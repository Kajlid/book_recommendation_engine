  "description": "You live in a western democracy. You believe in individual freedoms. You trust your government to have the best interests of citizens, individual citizens, at heart.Then you fall in love with a member of a social group considered a political football – an asylum seeker.What happens next is beyond comprehension. You are told you have no freedom to love this man, you are not really married after all and this is not your choice. Even though an international instrument says it is.No-one cares where your family live or die, whether you, the citizen, lives or dies: least of all the minions of Goliath.In the words of one reader:Robyn Oyeniyi’s harrowing account of how she fought against the might of the establishment and their bureaucratic blunders to save her husband and step-children changed my misconception about asylum seekers. Robyn shows how badly they are treated and how wrongly they are portrayed by the media. Her book made me angry and sad at how human beings can be treated in such a callous way. A gripping story that had me on the edge of my seat!",
