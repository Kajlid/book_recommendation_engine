  "description": "Three broken people. Two risky gambles. One twisted love.After the unspeakable night that changed my life, I moved across the country to attend college where no one knows me. I swore off romantic relationships, determined not to let anyone get close enough to learn the truth about my past.Then Harrison and Dez came into my life. Now I have not one, but two possessive men vying for my affection, and neither is willing to walk away without a fight.Harrison's part of the wealthy elite, but I suspect he's hiding more than anyone knows beneath that cocky swagger of his. Dez is from the other side of the tracks, covered in scars and tattoos, with a brooding, dominant personality to match.As different as they appear to be, they both have rough edges and pasts that haunt them, just like me. There's a brokenness in all of us that fits together in ways I didn't think possible.Despite their intense rivalry, the chemistry between the three of us is undeniable, and explosive.It's the last thing I expected, but maybe everything I need...Dangerous Game is a gritty, emotional new adult romance packed with tragic secrets, scorching heat, and an irresistible frenemies-to-lovers vibe.",
