  "description": "“Something horrible is happening in the Crimson Forest. I need you to promise me you’ll stay away from it.” Eighteen-year-old Angelina Adams had every intention of taking that advice. She had no desire to disappear into the trees as so many hunters had done. But when her mother is brutally murdered in their home, and the attacker comes for her, she has no choice but to flee into the blood-red woodland that claimed her father’s life years before. There she meets Nicolai, a handsome, mysterious stranger who vows to protect her from the dark forces bent on destroying her life. But can he be trusted? Is he who he says he is, or will he simply take what he wants from her and move on? Angelina soon realizes that nothing is as it seems in the Crimson Forest, a place where creatures known only to humans through myth and legend fight for love and survival. It’s a world where fairy tales thrive, nightmares become reality, and some secrets are better left undiscovered. Crimson Forest is the first book in The Crimson Chronicles, an exciting new adult fantasy series from Christine Gabriel. Book Two is Crimson Moon",
