  "title": "Trouble, Chaos, and Vengeance",
  "description": "Arden (known to everyone as “Trouble”) likes attention as much as the next girl, but this is getting ridiculous. When an insane stranger is murdered at the inn where she works, Trouble becomes the next Soulbearer for the disembodied god of chaos, Loku. Yes, it comes with the ability to channel the god’s limitless power, but at the cost of her sanity — literally. Now she has a sexy but cynical knight claiming to be her protector, a prince trying to seduce her to his cause (and his bed), and a snarky chaos god who offers a play-by-play commentary on it all, whether she wants to hear it or not. To make matters worse, there are plenty of people who would like to see her dead.  Follow Arden, Dev, and Kell as they battle necromancers, a jealous god, and foreign invaders, all while balancing the chaos thrown their way by Loku.  This edition contains all three books of The Soulbearer Trilogy: A Soul For Trouble A Soul For Chaos A Soul For Vengeance",
