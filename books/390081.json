  "title": "The Misleading Mind: How We Create Our Own Problems and How Buddhist Psychology Can Help Us Solve Them",
  "description": "Buddhism asserts that we each have the potential to free ourselves from the prison of our problems. As practiced for more than twenty-six hundred years, the process involves working with , rather than against, our depression, anxiety, and compulsions. We do this by recognizing the habitual ways our minds perceive and react â€” the way they mislead. The lively exercises and inspiring real-world examples Cayton provides can help you transform intractable problems and neutralize suffering by cultivating a radically liberating self-understanding.",
