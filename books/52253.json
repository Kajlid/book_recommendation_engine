  "title": "Dangerous Spring",
  "description": "An autobiographical novel that describes the experiences of a German doctor's family in eastern Germany during the final days of the war. The heroine is sixteen-year-old Karin Lorenz who has fallen in love with an anti-Nazi pastor twelve years her senior. When the American army occupies the town, Karin serves as a translator and assists in the release of the prisoners in the nearby Buchenwald concentration camp.\"The historical events in this book are based on my own and my husband's diaries of this period. This is exactly how we lived through the last days of the war. So, as an historical document, it has the positive truth of personal experience, along with the possible bias of personal feelings. The story, however, and the characters are entirely fictional.\" - Benary-Isbert",
