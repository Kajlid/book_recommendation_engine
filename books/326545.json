  "description": "Night after night, I meet Death He turns me inside out and makes me feel things I never knew possible. Day by day, his patience thins as I deprive the god of death the one thing he wants more than anything. My heart. But with my kind of childhood, one doesn’t just go dropping the L word unless it’s to a triple chocolate buttercream cupcake. I’m an acts of service kind of vampire, so I’m showing I care by tracking down the only blade forged that can kill him. Because if Grim dies, the whole world will go to hell. And facing an eternity without him would kill me.",
