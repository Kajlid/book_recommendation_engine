  "description": "A boy, his sister, and her psychopathic roommate. A New Year’s Eve party, a missing person, and a single set of footprints in the snow.Life is sweet for Katherine Langley, a first-year student at the University of Virginia. She is finally free from the drama of her parents’ dysfunctional marriage and ready to focus on studying to become a nurse. Her brother, Ben, belongs to the hottest fraternity on campus, and her roommate, Emma, is beautiful and charming, a party girl whose answer for a hangover is happy hour. She is also a psychopath. When obsessive-compulsive Ben succumbs to Emma’s charms and falls dangerously off-track, Katherine must save her brother from himself. From the University of Virginia campus to a cozy cottage on Carter’s Creek, Saving Ben is a haunting tale of love and loyalty, anger management, substance abuse, and betrayal. “This beautifully designed book might have come from any of the biggest publishing houses and sit shoulder to shoulder with some of the best LOOKING books to be released this year . . .The writing is exceptional and the story compelling with an emotional resonance that demonstrates a maturity to the writing that makes Ashley Farley an author to watch.”— Judge, Writer’s Digest 21st Annual Self-Published Book Awards",
