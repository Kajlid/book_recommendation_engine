With having to make sure the frosts come on time, Eira already has her hands full, then she goes and adds a neighbour she's in love with, a cocky vampire, and a pesky half-summer fae that just won't leave her alone... As a descendant of Jack Frost, Eira's only job is to make sure the frost arrives on time. Well not her only job, but her most important one. And when they don't, it's a race against time to get them back. Because if the seasons don't change...well it's best not to go there. Saving Eira is a reverse harem set in the Paranormal Council Universe and the first book in the Fated Seasons series.",
