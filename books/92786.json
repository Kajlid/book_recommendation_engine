  "description": "Curvy girl, Charlene Winters, had it all: the great career, wonderful friends and a dreamy fiancé. With her wedding day just three weeks away, Charlene is dealt a devastating blow. Suddenly finding her life, hopes and plans in tatters, the jilted bride sinks into despair and a tub of Ben and Jerry’s cookie dough. While the heartache of her fiancé’s infidelity is still fresh, Charlene is whisked away by her friends on a life-changing holiday. But how will this big fish cope now that she’s back in the dating pond and surrounded by slender trouts with Botox lips? As dashing Dr. Adam Fitz tries desperately to teach his best friend that she’s worth more than the number on her scales, her girls Vanessa, and Dana are eager to set her up with a boy-toy. Frustrated, Charlene decides the time for change is upon her. What she needs is a change of scenery, a change of dress size and maybe, a change of heart.",
