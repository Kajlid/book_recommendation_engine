  "description": "This ebook is optimized for Kindle with linked Table of Content making navigation quicker and easier.Of the questions often put to me by people of various classes and different degrees of informedness', the following, as I recall, recurred most What remarkable men have I met? What marvels have I seen in the East? Has man a soul and is it immortal? Is the will of man free? What is life, and why does suffering exist? Do I believe in the occult and spiritualistic sciences? What are hypnotism, magnetism, and telepathy? How did I become interested in these questions? What led me to my system, practised in the Institute bearing my name? So I shall now arrange this series in separate chapters, serving as answers to the first of the enumerated questions, namely, 'What remarkable men have I met?' I will distribute in the separate tales about these meetings, according to a principle of logical sequence, all the ideas and thoughts that I intend to make known in this series in order that they may serve as preparatory constructive material, and at the same time I will answer all the other questions often asked me. Furthermore, I shall arrange these separate tales in such an order that, among other things, there may stand out distinctly the outline of my, as it were, autobiography.
