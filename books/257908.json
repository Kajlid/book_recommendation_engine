We were known as the Fab Five and our futures were planned out—everyone together forever.In a flash, everything was taken from me. I don’t know how to live without them. I don’t want to.I’m broken.I head to college without them, so lost and alone.Then I see him.Cameron Stone. Mr. Football. Mr. Popular. He’s definitely hot, but on the inside he’s vile. He made my childhood a living nightmare. I don’t know why he hates me, or why he’s suddenly being so nice to me. All the sweet talk in the world won’t work. I know better.So, why am I listening?\nCAMERON\nShe used to be perky, fun, and full of life—everything I hated about girls and their bullshit exterior. People called her bubbly; I called her “fake-as-hell.”The edgy, dark, lonely girl in front of me is not the Olivia Brennan I know from high school—far from it, actually. I know the story—the whole town knows the story. It happened in the blink of an eye and the girl we knew was gone.But I refuse to watch it anymore -- I can’t stand it. I’m going to fix it -- fix her. It’s time I showed Olivia her way back… Back to the girl she used to be.",
