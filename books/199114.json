  "description": "The Enforcer’s Oath: Protect the club at all costs. Jackal made an enemy out of Penni when he kidnapped her years ago. He let her go, never imagining she would take a piece of his soul with her. Now protecting Penni against a former brother will force him to place the club against her once again. She may be the Hostage, but he’s the one held captive by the lust she refuses to admit binds them together. She thinks The Last Riders and another man will be all the protection she needs to end the tug of war between them. However, he’s never lost a battle, especially against a tiny blonde with an attitude, begging him to teach her that her place is under him. To end the battle, he’s going to have to reclaim the piece of soul she stole from him or claim a part of her soul as prisoner. When a predator takes you hostage, you’re his forever.",
