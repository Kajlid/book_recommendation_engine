  "description": "Think the NSA is in trouble now?If dealing with espionage and politics all over the world is dangerous, try dealing with intelligent life from outer space.This science fiction thriller is about medieval people who travel through a wormhole in 1200 A.D. and arrive in what they think is hell.In 2017 A.D., National Security Agency (NSA) scientist Daniel Preadon travels through the same wormhole and arrives in scientific heaven.What happens when Dan meets these people?The medieval people’s descendants are surprised to hear Dan’s assertions that they are not in hell, and he is surprised to hear of their insistence that they are in hell.So what is the truth?As the medieval people's descendants gradually accept Dan's point of view, Dan discovers things that neither science nor the NSA can explain -- at least not yet. Could this discovery lead Dan to discover other human life in the galaxy? Maybe this will change if he gets back to earth and informs the NSA -- or will it?",
