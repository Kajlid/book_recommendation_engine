  "description": "How did my life become such a battle just to breathe? When did I start to hate everything that is me? Along the way where did I lose my family, the Horde, and their support I have always relied on? Why did I push them away? What’s going on with me? Who am I anymore? Why do I even care when it seems no one else does?My life is a constant struggle. Getting up everyday is becoming harder and harder. I feed the demons of my loneliness by myself because I refuse to reach out for help. Why won’t I reach out? As the emptiness of my very existence threatens my sanity, I search for ways to make myself just feel. The problem is each time I find a new way to feel it’s not only causing me pain but also bodily harm.Will I be able to focus on the light amongst all the pain and darkness my mind sees? Will the people fighting to bring me back win or will the emptiness of my soul finally pull me down to nothingness? I don’t have a clue.",
