  "description": "Dear Author,I once was a cargo ship captain, straddling the line between the law and the bandits that roamed the galaxy. I had a good crew and a simple life. That was until my ship was captured by an unknown alien race. They enslaved me and my crew and made us into pleasure slaves.Here is where the story becomes yoursâ€” Was I sold and did I come to love my master? Did I find relief in my submission? Did I struggle and escape with the help of a secret lover that came looking for me? Was I rescued and come to fall in love with the military officer that liberated me? Or something altogether different?Photo Description: Filthy, naked from head to toe, nothing but a pair of cutoffs. His prominent erection tenting his pants. How did he wind up here? In this prison? Who did this to him? And who was he thinking of? His head is turned and our gazes met, his pupils blown inside green and gold irises. His hand extends, imploring, asking to be saved.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event.
