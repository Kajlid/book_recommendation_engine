  "description": "**The full-length second book in T. S. Joyce’s new Bears Fur Hire series.**  Lena Rhodes is a professional runner. Life is a lot easier when she is throwing everything she has into being a nature photographer for an elite outdoor magazine. And now, she is on her biggest assignment yet: Alaskan brown bears. She’s been training for years for this opportunity, but the growly, sexy outdoor guide charged with taking her to the bears is turning her world on its axis. She had everything figured out. Eat, sleep, take photographs, and never let anyone get too close. Too bad Jenner is making her forget all her rules. But his secrets are deep and dark, and as it turns out, the dangerous Alaskan grizzlies she is here to photograph are the least of her worries.  Jenner Silver is just trying to get from one day to the next without his inner bear shredding him. But when a feisty, beautiful wildlife photographer shows up at his lodge begging a tour to find brown bears, his protective instincts go into overdrive. The harder he tries to stay away from her, the more he wants to know about the woman, but both of their survival depends on him keeping his head out in the Alaskan bush. Torn between maintaining a professional relationship, and the bone-deep desire to claim her for his own, Jenner will have to decide if he’s ready to share his secrets. And only if Lena can stop running.  Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
