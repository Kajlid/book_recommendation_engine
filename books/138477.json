  "description": "“Generally, the stories are really excellent, being both educational and entertaining,” was the spontaneous response of this book's editor, Jack Turner, after completing his work. The book is now available to several reviewers. You can also read their assessment here.Mike & Alex is a series of children's books for children aged 6-12. Several schools in Holland have part of the book chosen for comprehensive reading. We've taken into account the age at which children start to read, using a clear and somewhat larger font and ample line spacing. The educational aspect of the three interconnected stories is largely in the description of the animals' life behavior but also in the explanations and maps of different places in the world. The 'entertainment' factor is a key component, with engaging topics like cleaning the seas and a captivating method of description. This approach has been well-received in my first book, 'Double Spy, an autobiography', published in 2014.In this book, the French bunny Jean-Pierre finds our main characters. Mike is a giant rabbit, and Alex is a large wild boar. They have helped animals many times when they were suffering from human behavior. In this book, for example, they help whale Wally get rid of a harpoon in his back. As a thank you, Wally offers them a world cruise with him. It is luxuriously furnished for this purpose. Once on their journey, they are called upon to do something against the whalers at the South Pole. They notice that they have made the whales angry. Then the tuna come to Puck and Evert to complain about all the people's dirt in the world's oceans. Our friends devise a solution for this, where the garbage is deposited back on people's doorsteps.",
