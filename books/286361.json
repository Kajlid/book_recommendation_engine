  "description": "Edward III is a major addition to the Shakespearean canon, being included for the first time in an authoritative edition of Shakespeare's works. Melchiori claims that Shakespeare is the author of a significant part of the play, the extent of which is discussed in detail. The introduction explores the play's historical background and its relationship to the early cycle of history plays. The commentary examines in depth the play's linguistic and poetical features, while an extensive appendix on the use of sources explains the stages of its composition.",
