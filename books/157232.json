At the center of the revival are four tattooed and pierced-clad beasts of sex personified, and owners of the Mel/Rose Barbershop.

Dino Pantopoulos is happy to have his life flattened by the beautiful and sassy, French therapist. Claudette’s atypical research techniques leave Dino wondering how to tame her, and Dino’s overbearing Greek mother has Claudette’s Freudian radar on high alert. Claudette isn’t about to alter her research or her sexual proclivities for anyone. But Dino’s mastery of sensual conquest has Claudette rethinking her relationship priorities.

As sparks settle from the couple’s emotional and explosive courtship, a tragedy threatens to destroy their newfound happiness. Will Claudette survive and keep her promise to love Dino Without End? Without End is a standalone novel, brimming with quick wit, charm, and unforgettable characters. It is the first of four books in the Melrose Shops series; one book for each of the sensual beasts waiting to claim your heart. This book will steam up your windows and intended for adults only.",
