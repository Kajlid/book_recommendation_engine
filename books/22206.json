  "title": "Year 50",
  "description": "It has been almost 50 years since the planet was nearly rid of humans. Wildlife grows without restraint, erasing the metal and concrete structures left behind. Even where industrialization was most prominent, trees and grassland are aggressively reclaiming their land; Earth is pulling away the scab of human civilization.  A young woman named Calypso leads a team of Scavengers beyond the walls of Brighton, the last major human colony. Her goal is to find medical supplies, necessary to preserve humanityâ€™s future. It is an adventure few have the training, ability, or psychological threshold to carry out.  Year 50 explores what humans are made of and what they can accomplish when pushed to the limit. Love, romance, and altruism thrive in this time of brutal survival.   \"On the fringe of extinction, it will take bravery to persevere. \"Year 50\" is a science fiction novel set in a future where humanity is nearly extinct, and the last human colony is struggling to survive against the combined cruelty of nature and an alien species. Calypso has been raised from her young life to fight them, and it's now on her to save her colony by finding the medicine they need. \"Year 50\" is a riveting novel that should prove hard to put down.\"  Michael Dunford Midwest Book Review",
