Be my guest, darling.I'll just pick a fighter as my bait, a consort with a hint of defiance.And when the culprit attempts to bite, I'll be the one who bites back.Because no one touches what's mine, including the fiery redhead at my side.Welcome to Kylan City.I dare you all to come out and play.****Oh, no.
