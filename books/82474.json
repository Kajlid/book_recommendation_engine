  "description": "What are a mother and father to do with SEVEN rambunctious boys under the age of eleven? For the Buckleys, the days are filled with running, yelling, food, wrestling, and burping. Every night culminates in an epic bedtime battle.When the school year ends, however, Mom and Dad decide to harness some of their boys' apparently inexhaustible energy and buy some goats and chickens for them to take care of. While they are initially thrilled with the \"responsibility,\" the boys soon learn that it's far tougher-and far funnier for the reader-than it appears.",
