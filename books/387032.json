  "title": "Devi: Samvara",
  "description": "The power of the goddess is unrivaled. Forged by the strength of the gods, the force the goddess Devi retains is meant to bring balance among gods and men. But the current Devi Incarnate is different. Her female host, Tara Mehta, is still alive and struggles to comprehend the awesome responsibility she now faces. Humanity is threatened by the fallen Lord Bala and salvation rests in the hands of a goddess-torn in two. Devi wields the power of the gods, but now the virtue that makes the female entity so distinct, yet so vulnerable: compassion. The Divine and Diabolical collide in an epic battle, culminating in a night of reckoning in Devi: Samvara, the exciting sequel to the first trade paperback",
