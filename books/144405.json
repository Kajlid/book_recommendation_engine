  "description": "Although Aine O’Hara still hasn’t decided for sure whether she is ready to accept the proposal of the gorgeous Locke Sterling— the one where he will be her Dom and she will be his Sub— she cannot deny that she is absolutely becoming swept up by his enigmatic charms. And there is a good chance that she is at risk of losing her willpower in the process. She is fully aware of this even as she impulsively agrees to go away with him on an out of town trip. Aine isn’t naïve, she knows exactly what will happen when she is alone in a posh hotel room with a man like Locke Sterling. And, if she feels like this already, what will it be like after he seduces her? One thing is for certain- she knows she will never be the same after going away with him. The question is, what will she be?When he makes love to her, the sex with him and the way he makes her feel is so amazing, she is sucked in. It feels so good to let go of her control, to just take the pleasure, not worry about anything else for a while. It looks like it’s beginning to be a question of not if she will accept his proposal, but when…But when an urgent call from the hospital regarding her mother’s condition intercedes, will it pull Aine away from Locke, or drive her further into his possessive arms? Then he does something which surprises her even more than their proposed arrangement, and melts her heart. How will she ever be able to refuse him now?THE SENSUALLY EROTIC 'MASTER OF INTRIGUE' SERIES:PERSUASION, Vol. I NOW AVAILABLE on AMAZON!SEDUCTION, Vol. II NOW AVAILABLE on AMAZON!SUBMISSION, Vol. III Coming February 2015POSSESSION, Vol. IV Coming April 2015INFATUATION, Volume V Coming June 2015ADORATION, Volume VI Coming August 2015PASSION, Volume VII Coming October 2015DEVOTION, Volume VIII Coming December 2015",
