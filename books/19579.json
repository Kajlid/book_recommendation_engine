  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Liora Greyson has never been a “normal” girl. Born of a demon father and a human mother, she’s what’s known in the underworlds as a “demion”.  Liora is just trying to survive her senior year of high school unscathed, her dark secret intact. But the walls she’s carefully constructed to keep people away crack wide open once she meets the sexy and mysterious Kieron Ambrose. The more she falls for him, the more worried she becomes. She can’t let him find out she transforms into demon named Lucky at dusk...a demon with an entirely separate personality who spends her nights drinking, tormenting humans, slaying unsuspecting demons,and lusting after her gorgeous and unattainable incubus/hellhound BFF. But it turns out Kieron has a few dark secrets of his own. Secrets that will either save Liora...or completely destroy her. Fighting your demons is one thing. Having one who fights back, messes with your guy, and leaves you with nasty hangovers is total hell. \"A Demon Made Me Do It\" is approx. 86,000 words.",
