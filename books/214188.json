  "description": "Librarian's note: See alternate cover editions of ASIN B01IB86KFG here and here.Deep in the nothingness of the Sahara desert, an innovative archaeologist finds a written picture text, the first ever known from the ancient world of Egypt. Linked to many other documents and scrolls found throughout Egypt and the world, this one is different and brings to light a primitive mystery; the arrival and ‘birth’ of the very first beings that would one day be called vampires. Prequel to Sands of Time In this prequel to the best selling, award winning novella, Sands of Time, a most unique and exciting find is discovered. Kesi of Giza, young and new, the hybrid blood drinker from Book One had documented her life as the child of the Pet Mer, gods from the sky, worshiped and protected by Pharaoh, offered their blood by humans. But all was not perfect, and Kesi documents her struggles, fears and trials for which future generations can learn. She may be a child of a unique race, but her struggles growing into womanhood are easily related even today as she learns of her place in a strange world, what it is to be different, coming to terms with her ever maturing body, her first love, and her need to have children—learned by catching another hybrid in the process. But success is not as effortless as she hopes and her life is thrown into a sand storm of despair as she is put to trial for deaths not of her own making and forced into a loveless marriage of convenience as punishment. More complex than Sands of Time, The Early Scrolls draws the reader deep into Kesi’s life, purpose and future motives. Get to know the Pet Mer and their role in history.",
