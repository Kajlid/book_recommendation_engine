  "description": "Horsepower and green thumbs meets justice and flip-flops.I’m a late bloomer.A geek, an introvert, an enigma, and a watchdog. My name is Paco.I’m determined enough to bide my time, yet too clever to pass up on opportunity. I’m a steadfast rebel.An outcast, a defender, a hothead, and an eccentric.My name is Mel.I’m resolute enough to carve my own way, but not too blind to see a better path.We are established loners—each limited by the boundaries we set—but when a young boy’s life hangs in the balance, we discover we have more in common than we thought.",
