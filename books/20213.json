  "description": "Translation of Stachtes, published by Kastaniotis Editions, Athens, in 2007.When Sonia Varika is pulled from the fire, her body is burned almost beyond recognition. For her ex-lovers, Police Colonel Chronis Halkidis and Simeon Piertzovanis, the landlord of the gutted property, her fate is a heavy reckoning. Fuelled by their twin addictions to cocaine and alcohol, they are gripped by a fanatical desire to uncover the truth behind the blaze and hold those responsible to account. A classic noir thriller, unflinching in its examination of violence and corruption, but tender in its treatment of human weakness.",
