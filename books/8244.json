  "description": "When Storm Wishfall is sent on an errand for his alpha, he doesn't expect to discover two young Asian men hiding on a boat in fear for their lives. He definitely isn't expecting one of them to be his mate. After encountering the young men's captors, the alpha devises a plan to rescue the three other men who were kidnapped along with his mate, Kyoshi, and Kyoshi's cousin, Keata, and the pack must band together to curtail a human trafficking ring before any more innocent lives are ruined. In the meantime, Kyoshi must come to terms with his new life. Storm searches for a way to convince the cynical human they're destined to love each other, but something lurking deep inside Kyoshi is forcing its way out. Are these two as different as they believe, or can they find a way to share their lives? ** Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
