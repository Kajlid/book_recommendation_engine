When she arrives in town, the police sergeant in charge of the investigation wants nothing to do with Akira or her special abilities. He pawns her off on Christian Price, a rookie detective she knew when she lived in town fifteen years earlier. Akira and Christian follow emerging clues to discover the elderly man has been kidnapped. Despite continued interference by the sergeant, Akira finds hidden documents and a mysterious object that challenges their perceptions of the victim and the reason he was kidnapped.",
