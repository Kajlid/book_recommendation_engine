  "description": "'Our love for India came to birth,I think, when we first heard him (Swami Vivekananda) say the word,\"India\", in that marvellous voice of his. It seems incredible that so much could have been put into one small word of five letters. There was love, passion, pride, longing, adoration,tragedy,chivalry,heimweh, and again love. Whole volumes could not have produced such a feeling in others. It had the magic power of creating love in those who heard it. Even after, India became the land of heart's desire. Everything concerning her became if interest-- became living--her people, her history,architecture,her manners and customs,her rivers, mountains, plains, her culture, her great spiritual concepts, her scriptures. And so culture, her great spiritual concepts, her scriptures. And so began a new life, a life of study,of meditation. The centre of interest was shifted.'-- Sister Christine",
