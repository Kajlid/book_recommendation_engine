  "description": "From the Giller Prize-winning author of 419 comes the season's much-anticipated travel memoir     Hope lives in Africa. Twenty years after the genocide that left Rwanda in ruins, Giller Prize-winning author Will Ferguson travels deep into the once-mysterious \"Land of a Thousand Hills\" with his friend and cohort Jean-Claude Munyezamu, a man who escaped Rwanda just months before the killings began.      From the legendary source of the Nile to Dian Fossey's famed \"gorillas in the mist,\" from innovative refugee camps along the Congolese border to the world's most escapable prison, from tragic genocide sites to open savannahs and a bridge to freedom, from schoolyard soccer pitches to a cunning plan to get rich on passion fruit, Ferguson and Munyezamu discover a country reborn.     Funny, engaging, poignant, and at times heartbreaking, Road Trip Rwanda is the lively tale of two friends, the open road, and the hidden heart of a continent.",
