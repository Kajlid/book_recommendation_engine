As the informant draws her deeper and deeper undercover, she witnesses the meeting of a shadowy group plotting a crime of unprecedented proportions and is shocked to see someone from her past among the participants-the father of her young son. Encountering closed doors and higher-ups who don't trust her at every turn, she must confront a particularly painful unsolved case-the fire that killed her father-in order to unlock the mystery of the most recent fire. As Georgia edges closer to the truth and her own personal vengeance, she finds a killer she would have never suspected.",
