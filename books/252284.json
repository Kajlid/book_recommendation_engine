  "title": "Barclay's Apology in Modern English",
  "description": "Robert Barclay's Apology has been the classic systematic statement of the Quaker faith. But the lucid prose of the original suffered the same hardening of the linguistic arteries that overtook the King James Version of the Bible. In this edition, antique & obscure words & sentence structure have been eliminated & references to people & matters of faith come alive thru the annotations. The nature of the church, its ministry & sacraments, & the relationship of church & state, with the consequent implications for religious liberty & Christian integrity, are key topics. If you're a Quaker seeking a better understanding of your own faith, or an ecumenist trying to understand beliefs that were significant to Methodism, challenging to Calvinism & frequently in rapport with Catholicism, you will find Barclay's Apology enlightening.",
