  "title": "Wretched",
  "description": "My body and soul are weak, and I am tired. I close my eyes and lie back on my bed. I dream of the past. My thoughts bringing back memories of trees, flowers and my fiance. He is waiting for me at the alter. It is the day I will marry the love of my life. I turn to walk outside the house. My breath is captured by a strange smell. I try to fight it but the drug is to strong. Darkness overcomes my consciousness. I leap from my bed, my heart pounding, as my sweet dream is stolen by reality. My feet embed into the rat dropping and mud that once was carpet. I glance around. The dungeon remains dark and dreary. I let out a loud sigh. I try to convince myself that today will be the day I escape. The sound of foot steps overtake the silence of the room. My heart skips a beat. I run to the middle of the room and take my position. Sitting on my knees, my hands tucked beneath me. This is the way I am to meet my captor and if this is not done I know the consequences will be dire.",
