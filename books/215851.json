  "description": "From NYT & USA Today bestselling author comes a new Bleeding Stars stand-alone novel…  She is his strength and he is her weakness. And this time he won’t let her go.  Edie Evans is gorgeous. Sexy. Kind. She’s also the definition of off-limits. But that didn't stop me from sneaking into her room to comfort her at night.  But guys like me? We destroy everything, so it should have been no surprise when I destroyed us, too. The night I sent her running, I thought I’d never see her again. Until I saw her standing like a vision in the crowd.  Austin Stone is dangerous. Alluring. Tempting. He broke my heart and I refused to give him the chance to do it again.  It’s been years since I’ve seen him, and now I can’t do anything but stare at the gorgeous, tattooed man playing onstage. I should run. I know I should. But like a fool, I run straight back to him.  Our desire is overpowering. Our need unrelenting.  She is my hope. He is my weakness. We should have known a passion this intense would burn us right into the ground.",
