  "description": "A Christmas gift she can't refuse… Billionaire Niccolo Da Conti has everything a man could want—the money, the cars, the business empire—but seeing the unbearably enticing Alannah Collins again has sparked his possessive streak. He'll hire her, seduce her and cross her off his wish list once and for all! Alannah knows the danger of working too closely with the sensual Sicilian, but she'd be a fool to refuse his help launching her business. Now, with Niccolo ruthlessly trying to seduce her under the mistletoe, her every defense is threatened. Can she stop him from unwrapping the truths she's fought to conceal?",
