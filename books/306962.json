  "title": "Short Stories From Mythnium: Anthology",
  "description": "Enter the world of Mythnium through these collected tales of heroism, discovery, and realization. Meet Elves, Dwarves, and Humans who play significant roles in the continual battle between good and evil. Each of these short stories introduces you to Mythnium's races, creatures, magic, and hints at something dark on the horizon. This anthology paves the way for C. Borden's upcoming novels about Mythnium and her heroes and villains as it takes you on eight journeys into the lives of characters who come from different backgrounds, cultures, and races. These snapshots into the world of Mythnium open the doors to a place of magic, danger, intrigue, romance, and adventure.\"The author has given us a sneak preview into her characters, and if she develops the rest of her world with as much skill, this series shows a lot of promise. ... These stories hint at an impressive level of depth and detail that can surely feed an epic fantasy series through several novels.\" -TheShortStoryTeller.com",
