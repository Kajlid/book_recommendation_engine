A supermodel trophy wife. A lavish wedding. People pawing at me from all angles. As an ex-military man, this kind of crap doesn’t fit me in the slightest. And yet, here I am, getting married to a woman I don’t love. The wedding planner shows up and happens to be my childhood sweetheart. You just can’t make this stuff up. She’s not a girl anymore though. Beautiful. Curvy. Strong. Everything I remember and more. My focus locks onto this woman and she stains my thoughts with her unruly ways. When the wedding doesn’t work out with my cut-out Barbie Doll, I’ve got one thing left to do. Run after the one I’ve always loved with a vengeance. Even though she's a heartbreaker, this woman is mine.Then. Now. Forever.",
