  "description": "These stories are fast food, ice creams, snacks. Right after eating them, you will feel hungry again. They have no nutritious value whatsoever, but I hope you'll find them tasty.Ever thought about how it would be if you were in love with three persons at once? And all three were in love with you? And with each other? And you lived together? And you all were guys? Wouldn't it just be like a family? That is what Alan thinks...Alan is a bit rude and he sees and has so much sex, that he talks constantly about it, almost without realizing it. If male on male sex, graphic scenes or coarse language offend you, this is probably not for you.Every chapter is a little story by itself, but in the same setting. Yet it is best to read them in sequence, as each story tells you something more about one or more of the characters.You can read a sample chapter online here.",
