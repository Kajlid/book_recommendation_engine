  "description": "Acclaimed writer Garth Ennis (Preacher, Hellblazer) enlists a band of celebrated artists to join him in wading through the horrors, the humour and the hardware of the Second World War. In four very different engagements, Ennis battles with the steel-clad terror of tank warfare, faces withering fire on the beaches of Normandy, parachutes into chaos and mayhem with the American Airborne elite, and tries to outrun the bad luck of a jinx! Illustrated by comics artist luminaries Dave Gibbons (Watchmen), Chris Weston (The Filth), David Lloyd (V for Vendetta) and John Higgins (Pride & Joy), this war-torn, battle-crazed graphic novel also features an afterword by Garth Ennis.",
