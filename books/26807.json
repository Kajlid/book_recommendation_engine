  "description": "Belladonna doesn’t know if a person can die from guilt, but she’s giving it her best shot. All her life, she’s done what she needed to in order to survive, but in recent years, the cost only seems to skyrocket…until someone innocent gets hurt. That’s why she made her deal with the demon. To right the wrong she committed.But when she’s auctioned off to Rusalka, a powerful and devious succubus, it’s nothing like she expected. She’s…taken care of. And if she’s put to work and expected to fulfill every part of her bargain, Belladonna is only too happy to let someone else shoulder the responsibility and make decisions for her.Too bad Rusalka isn’t in the market for a servant. She wants a full partner. If Belladonna can’t release her guilt and step into that role… Things may be over even before they begin.",
