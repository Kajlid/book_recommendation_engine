  "description": "When life leaves you scarred...  Dexter Price hadnâ€™t been the same since the day he lost his family and became scarred. Living with physical and emotional scars made him the angry loner that he was. Never thinking of a future with a family, he worked his life away...until one of his mornings...  Elena Collins had her own scars that left her distant and all alone. A run in the park changed everything. After being knocked down by a careless bicyclist, she received a helping hand up from a man who she only knew from afar, but who had an important part to play in her past.  Their scars kept them from others but brought them together. Can how they got them to tear them apart?",
