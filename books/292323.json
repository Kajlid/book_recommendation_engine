  "description": "Gravity is a collection of poems that explores the rise and fall of an intense relationship. The kind where the other person is the Gravity keeping you anchored to the planet and you worry that without them, you may float off into space.And then it is finding the strength to realize the relationship is not what you want, after all. It is several years, several breakups, several attempts to turn yourself inside out only to find maybe this isn’t the person you’ve been waiting for your entire life, and that you are the only person who can heal you.“Gravity is full of hearts, all of the hearts. Hearts of every kind: tender, open, injured– any form that you could imagine. Lynne Schmidt delivers a universe where planets are colliding.” — Cavin Bryce Gonzalez, founder of Back Patio PressCover art by Reid Maxim",
