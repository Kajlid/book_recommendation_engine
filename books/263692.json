She has one month to learn five things about the ranch and Tristan is given the task of “showing her the ropes”, so to speak. Heather recognizes her adversity and uses all the weapons in her arsenal to fight for the Hart Ranch, namely sex appeal and attitude aplenty.But Tristan can’t help but remember the young girl who had been more innocent and shy than this hellcat in high heels.
