  "description": "A man builds a tree house by a river, in anticipation of the coming flood. A sugar-beet crashes through a young woman's windscreen. A boy sets fire to a barn. A pair of itinerant labourers sit by a lake, talking about shovels and sex, while fighter-planes fly low overhead and prepare for war.These aren't the sort of things you imagine happening to someone like you. But sometimes they do.Set in the flat and threatened fenland landscape, where the sky is dominant and the sea lurks just beyond the horizon, these delicate, dangerous, and sometimes deeply funny stories tell of things buried and unearthed, of familiar places made strange, and of lives where much is hidden, much is at risk, and tender moments are hard-won.Watch Jon McGregor reading from This Isn't the Sort of Thing That Happens to Someone Like YouJon McGregor discusses This Isn't the Sort of Thing That Happens to Someone Like You",
