  "description": "Sandy travels by coach through a snowy night with his work mates two weeks before Christmas. They travel from Dumfriesshire up through the Scottish Uplands’ passes towards Ayrshire. To while away their time they joke amongst themselves in a nightly ritual as the snow slowly clears to reveal the hills and mountains in all their wintertime splendour, which all go unnoticed by the tried and sleepy workers as they travel onwards into cold night, homeward bound.Julie Elizabeth Powell, author of Gone said:“It's amazing how little a good writer needs to create an interesting story. With a cast of colourful characters, we are led on this snowy journey to a surprising end.”",
