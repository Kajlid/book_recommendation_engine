  "description": "Prince Nami Bordeux isn’t expecting much out of his lesson. He’s certainly not expecting to find another monster, locked up and serving as the Royal Scientist's personal lab experiment. So of course, he lets the monster out. And of course, he brings the monster back to the castle for help. Only this one act of kindness sets into motion a series of events that Nami could never have anticipated. What do you do, when even dandelion wishes aren’t enough?",
