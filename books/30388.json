  "description": "Vibrant with mystery, music and magic, this moving saga of two Native American families - the Kashpaws and the Lamartines - reaches out from the printed page with an authenticity and emotion rarely matched in contemporary fiction. From the powerful opening scene - high-spirited, hard-drinking June Kashpaw's death in the snow of a North Dakota reservation - Louise Erdrich's award-winning story springs to raging life: a multi-generational portrait of new truths and secrets whose time has come, of those who left the Indian land and those who stayed behind, of strong men and women caught in an unforgettable drama of anger, desire and the healing power called LOVE MEDICINE.",
