  "description": "A spurned young woman with an ax to grind strikes gold when she overhears some crucial information. But is it fools gold?  Simon, The Man in The Mask has hit gang boss Alex Galvan's operations four times in a row. If it wasn't enough to drive the young crime lord insane, it'll soon be enough to send him broke and at the worst possible time. His partnership with the mysterious foreign ganglord Mr Borsch is beginning to look distinctly dangerous. In order to survive the changes ahead, Galvan must seize control of his business before his enemies and rivals take control instead... And a golden opportunity presents itself in the form of a special exhibition at The Batewell Gallery. The trouble is, even the best-laid plans can go badly wrong, especially when spurned women and backstabbers are in the midst.  So when Simon hears about Galvan's latest scheme, he has a golden chance to take down his enemy. But when liars, listeners, blabbermouths and killers are around every corner, Simon's plans are all at sea...  To the victor, the spoils... to the loser, only death. All That Glitters is definitely not gold in Black & Gold 5",
