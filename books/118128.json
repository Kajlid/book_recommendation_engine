  "description": "Three goddesses, banished to earth by their dad, Zeus (yeah, that Zeus)...Era, on mortal boys:\"Look at him. Even the gods back home aren't that cute.\"Polly, on Nova High gossip:\"I'm simply not in the mood to chatter on about silly spiteful girls or cute Johnny Jims or sauerkraut breath.\"Thalia, on earth:\"I mean, we don't know what earth is like. Maybe it's all leprechauns and roses. Maybe it's an adventure every day. Maybe it's space-age.\"Polly, Era, and Thalia are stuck on earth, and to get back to Olympus, they've got to prove they've learned their lesson. And they've got to get through high school in the meantime. Which would be hard enough without the horribly evil Furies threatening to destroy their chances of ever seeing home again....\n\nAbout the Author\n\n Clea came to the project as a teen-junk-store-owner and writer, having written for magazines such as Details, Transworld's Warp, Option and countless other newspapers.",
