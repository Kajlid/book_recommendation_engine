  "description": "Is Raspberry Hill haunted by more than old regrets and lost chances? Natalie Wolcott, one third potential beneficiary, is about to find out. When Grandma Rose passes away, she leaves her magnificent, if slightly sinister, mansion on the edge of town to her three estranged relatives who, according to the terms of the will, must live on site for one year, three months and four days for before they can inherit. It is obvious that Raspberry Hill, although given, still comes at a high price. Whispers of murder and a town with a long memory have Natalie wondering one thing… Who was Grandma Rose?... because it’s all too apparent that someone doesn’t want them there. When things start to go bump in the night, Natalie is convinced that someone from town, or perhaps even one of her co-inheritors, is trying to force her out. That is, until she meets the ghost in the basement. Her only comfort is her new job at Crabapple Yarns. Unfortunately, the shadows of the past are knitted together with the present and before she has a chance to fit in disaster strikes the sweet little yarn shop. The plan to save Crabapple Yarns unwittingly sets into motion a chain of events that just might end with another murder at Raspberry Hill.",
