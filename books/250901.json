  "title": "Big Mistake",
  "description": "Planning a sexy surprise for her boyfriend one night, Jenny Carter doesn’t double check who she just grabbed in the dark, and in one big mistake ends up seducing her high school Math teacher, Mr. Smith. Trying to deny the out of bounds attraction she just sparked between them turns out to be futile. The consequences for being caught would destroy their lives. Teacher and student will have to decide what to do about their intense and forbidden romance, and the love growing wild in their hearts. Conventional wisdom says that if you love something, you should let it go, but nothing about their love is conventional.Author The author does not endorse or promote sexual relationships between teachers and students. This is strictly a work of fiction and in no way an endorsement of seducing an actual educator. The first chapter of this book contains a plot device that would never exist in real life, that any teachers reading will catch immediately—an unlocked door after hours at a high school.",
