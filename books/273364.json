  "title": "New York Stories: Landmark Writing from Four Decades of New York Magazine",
  "description": "The magazine that is the city that is the worldJust in time for its fortieth anniversary, New York magazine presents a stunning collection of some of its best and most influential articles, stories that captured the spectacle, the turbulence, and the cultural realignments of the past four decades.Covering subjects from “Radical Chic” to Gawker.com, written by some of the country’s most renowned authors, here are works that broke news, perfectly captured the moment, or set trends in motion. In New York Stories , Gloria Steinem (whose Ms. Magazine was introduced in New York ) broaches the subject of women’s liberation; Tom Wolfe coins “The Me Decade”; and Steve Fishman piercingly portrays the unwanted martyrdom of the 9/11 widows. Cutting edge features that invented terms like “brat pack” and “grup”; profiles of defining cultural figures including Joe Namath, Truman Capote, and long-shot presidential candidate Bill Clinton; and reports that inspired the acclaimed movies Saturday Night Fever, GoodFellas , and Grey Gardens –all are included in this one-of-a-kind compilation.The writers who chronicled the times that began with Nixon’s campaign and end with Obama’s are at their best in New York Stories . It’s an irresistible anthology from a magazine that, like the city itself, is still making stars, setting standards, and going strong.",
