  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for 9780615974088 A Man Is Just A Man is Leah's story of falling in love with Mr. Perfect. Leah falls fast and hard, losing all sense of reasoning. Love can do that to a gal, especially when the guy is as smooth as Nathan Moore. A Man Is Just A Man is about Leah's journey of falling in love, when she should have been standing in love. ⭐️⭐️Author’s Note⭐️⭐️ I’ve decided to provide two very different endings to this novella. Have you ever made a decision and wondered whether or not it was the right choice? Or perhaps you made the right choice because you knew that the alternative would’ve been disastrous? This is my gift to readers. Regardless of Leah’s final choice, I wanted readers to be able to reflect on the possibilities.",
