  "title": "The Liar of the Seven Isles: A rollicking tale of Irish wit over Viking brawn in a pursuit across the Emerald Isle",
  "description": "“Satan’s Mistress? Strumpet of the Devil?” the Viking asked. “You have been busy since the last time I saw you.” Cailleach was down a dry well. Stone all around. Filthy. With an insane Druid priest. Hungry. Tired. Trapped. “A girl’s got to earn a living.” Dregør laughed. “Well done, my wild Irish girl,” he said, and she heard the admiration in his voice. Against her better judgement, it warmed her heart. When Vikings loot and sink a trading ship off the coast of ancient Ireland, they get more than they bargain for with its hidden passenger in this historical romance. Cailleach claims to be a water witch who will raise the winds and kill the marauders if they harm her. As they threaten, she lifts her arms, and lightning flashes, seemingly at her bidding. Uncertain, they take her captive. The Viking captain, a swaggering and handsome leader of the longboat crew, takes her for his share of the booty, and from that point on, it’s a battle of wits against brawn in this love story that sweeps across the Emerald Isle in a medieval blend of Scheherazade and the Odyssey.",
