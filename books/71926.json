She has trained for years to be this protector and possible future ruler, but Athine has no desire to be ruler of a conquered land. She wants only to have her own adventures. She gets her wish when she is tested in the A'samrad and finds out that she has the power to kill other immortals. She also discovers there is a prophecy about her destroying the world with her powerful magic, but is that prophecy true or being manipulated by someone else?
