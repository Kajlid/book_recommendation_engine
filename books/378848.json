  "description": "Over the past two centuries archeologists and anthropologists have ignored, forgotten and suppressed vast quantities of evidence showing that human beings like ourselves have existed on this planet for tens of millions of years. Forbidden Archeology documents a systematic process of \"knowledge filtration\" and constitutes a serious challenge to the Darwinian theory of evolution.",
