I had just broken up with my fiance, John, after a huge fight. I decided I would rather walk home in the rain than drive with him another minute. Then Shane pulled up next to me on his Harley.

I find myself faced with yet another last-minute decision that will change my life all over again.

And now I've found my life, both day and night, becoming far more than I'd ever imagined it could be. Along the way, I've discovered a whole new side of Shane...",
