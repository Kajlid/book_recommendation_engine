  "title": "The Dragon's Muse",
  "description": "Gunari, a half-dragon, has trained hard to become Guardian to a Muse. He's stunned, thrilled and a little puzzled when he's assigned the Guardianship of Misu, a demi-Muse, well before expected. He's never heard of a demi-Muse and when told that Misu is male, he's even more confused as a Muse is always female. Meeting Misu is an eye-opening experience for Gunari. The attraction Gunari feels toward Misu is instant and whole-heartedly returned. Misu is also more than just the oddity of a male Muse. He is a male-identifying hermaphrodite and his area of ideas and influence is erotica. Misu develops and shares his gift with his chosen human through sexual acts and Gunari is more than happy to help Misu do his job, reveling in encounters that span heavy BDSM scenes to sweet, gentle loving. Misu knows Gunari is the man Fate selected for him before either of them were even born and hopes that with time, Gunari will come to realize that, too.",
