  "description": "I have survived the worst. I have come out of the darkness with my sanity intact.  Now, I get to meet the monster holding me here. For the first time since my captivity began, I get to meet Stonehart.  Whatever he wants, I'll be ready. The collar may be tight around my neck, but I will not be a prisoner.  A prisoner has no choice. A prisoner has no purpose.  But a concubine, on the other hand? She always has a choice.  And today, I choose to fight.  â€“  Uncovering You 2: Submission continues the story begun in Uncovering You: The Contract. It contains scenes of intense emotional and physical abuse. Readers with sensitivity to such subjects are advised to proceed with caution.",
