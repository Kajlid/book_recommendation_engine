  "description": "Tales of My Ancestors is like watching the History Channel broadcast via \"The Twilight Zone.\" It will take you on a journey through time with historical figures like Bat Masterson, Queen Elizabeth, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Cochise, Saint Margaret of Scotland, and players from the last Chicago Cubs team to win a World Series. You'll be there to witness the Salem Witch Trials, the Civil War, the signing of the Magna Carta, and the first steps onto colonial American soil. You'll run into William the Conqueror and a pale horse of death, learn how Shakespeare might have been inspired to create the character of Puck, and consider one theory on why, after decades of gunfights, Wyatt Earp was never so much as nicked by a bullet.You'll learn what might have been behind the mysterious disappearance of famous bandleader Glenn Miller during World War II, find out if there really is gold in the Superstition Mountains of Arizona or something else even more fantastic, and you'll even be introduced to a sexy but humorous take on the Robin Hood legend. Tales of My Ancestors features 18 stories rich with historical detail, but each with a speculative element that in no way contradicts recorded history. Or, to put it another way . . . what if it was never recorded that one of these historical figures met a banshee, or others had to deal with aliens, demons, selkies, hoodoo masters, witches, fortune tellers, fairies, or time travelers?Award-winning author Bruce Edward Golden's fast-paced narrative style and rich, authentic dialogue is on full display in this marvelous collection of fiction.",
