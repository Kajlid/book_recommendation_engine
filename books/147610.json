  "description": "‘I love the Night School series so much. It really is my favourite recent series… there's never a dull moment at Cimmeria Academy! FlutteringButterflies.com  In a few short terms since joining the exclusive Cimmeria Academy, Allie Sheridan has been kidnapped, fallen in love – twice, and become a pawn in an international power struggle.  After months on the run, Allie returns to find the school in turmoil. The atmosphere is thick with danger. Overshadowing it all is Nathaniel. He is close – very close – to getting everything he wants.  A secret civil war is tearing the British political elite apart. And Allie’s family is in the thick of it. Both sides want her. She knows Nathaniel will take her by any means necessary. But she is determined to fight him to the end.  With Carter and Sylvain both at her side, Allie must make up her mind - once and for all - who she really loves. And who she trusts most of all.  The fightback starts here. Everything is at stake now. Will everyone survive to tell the tale?  Resistance is the thrilling fourth book in the internationally bestselling Night School series.   What people are saying about Night School  ‘Just the other day I was sitting here, chatting with a friend and shamelessly making fun of boarding school books (with a few exceptions, of course), and now I am forced to eat my words. Or just add Night School to that very short list of exceptions. I adore Cimmeria Academy. I adore the idea behind it, I adore the teachers and I desperately want to be an advanced Night School student. (Only I’m not very athletic so that would never, ever work.) This series is a new favorite of mine.’ TheNocturnalLibrary.com",
