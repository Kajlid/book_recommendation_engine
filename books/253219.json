  "description": "IS THERE ANYTHING STRANGER, THEN A GRANDMOTHER WHO DECORATES THE WALLS IN DOORKNOBS? If those doorknobs are really a gateway of doors that lead to other realms...then maybe. For centuries the Wasley women have guarded the gateway, and for those years the Guardians have been incomplete. When Aggieâ€™s grandmother passed, the last things she expected was to be asked to join with eight hunky Guardians in order to help save a bunch of demon children who have been kidnapped. Through ever-changing storms and dangerous weather, they must figure out who is responsible and try and bring the children home in one piece. Too bad Aggie has to make a life-changing decision. Will she choose to accept her waiting powers by bonding with the Guardians or will she live the life of her ancestors and not fulfill her destiny?  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a reverse harem novel featuring many hot men, steamy sex and adult situations, magical creatures, demons, vampires, shifters, along with a woman who knows how to take charge of the situation, and so much more!",
