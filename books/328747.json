As a sexual dominant he's always been able to lead submissives to a higher plane, teaching them about themselves and helping them to grow.But now, Eric himself is wounded. He killed a man in the line of duty and is having trouble coming to terms with the fact. Maybe he didn't have to kill him, maybe it was a bad decision -- it doesn't matter that he was cleared of charges; it's making him doubt himself. His job has suffered, and he's even lacking the self-assurance to play at Tygers, a BDSM club that he absolutely loves.Angelica Vega owns and operates La Tienda Dulce, a bakery. Nicknamed Angel, she is anything but angelic. She's been a little wild in her life, searching for just the right thing, but never quite finding it. After Angel's store is broken into two nights in a row, and Eric's assigned to the case, she's pretty sure all that's changed.Right away, Eric knows he's destined to master Angel. But his investigation reveals that Angel's employees are helping to run an illegal gambling operation. They have stolen money from the owner, Dustin Jaymes, who wants it back. Now, convinced that Angel has the money, he's kidnapped an employee until Angel returns it.Eric will have to overcome his self-doubts to solve the crime, and lead the woman that he's come to love into the world of BDSM.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find Anal intercourse, bondage, domination/submission, exhibitionism, masturbation, multiple partners, voyeurism.",
