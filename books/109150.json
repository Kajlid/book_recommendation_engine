As the dazzling Diwali celebrations play out, their love defies the strict marital and cultural boundaries keeping them apart.However, pursuing this dangerous relationship is not their only challenge. Lakshmi's neighbor Gita is missing a treasured gold bracelet, and suspicions within the tight-knit community have turned against Lakshmi's family. With her world already fragile due to their lowly status, wrongful accusation could shatter what little they have.Amid the festival's vibrant lights and ancient rituals, Lakshmi and Deepak must hide their blossoming connection from those around them, even as they become engulfed in the mystery surrounding the stolen bracelet. It is a struggle that could see them cast into the outer darkness, separated forever...or burn a path toward an enduring love.A richly atmospheric tale of star-crossed love, Forbidden Light captures the magic and revelry of Diwali while going beyond the brilliant colors and lights to explore the harsh societal divides that can both illuminate and obscure the human heart's truest desires.",
