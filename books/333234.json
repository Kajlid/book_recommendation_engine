  "title": "Where's Billie?",
  "description": "Leathery journalist Skeeter Hughes searches for a missing girl named Billie and in the process uncovers a prostitution ring run out of the Mall of America. This tale taps the fear in the heart of anyone who suspects that the suburbs aren't as safe as they seem, while hitting on a phenomenon recently in the news. The men who victimize girls who have been sucked into human trafficking aren't greasy low-lifes. They're doctors and lawyers, judges and business owners, men who would otherwise be considered Minnesota Nice Guys. Wise-cracking Skeeter morphs from newspaper reporter to mom on a mission when her own daughter is almost caught in the seductive web.",
