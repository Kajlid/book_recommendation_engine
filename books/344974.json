  "description": "What comes after a complete ideological upheavel? When certainty becomes doubt and questions, when credulity sours to skepticism, self-reflection and soul-searching feel foreign. Never questioning your beliefs is dangerous - questioning your beliefs is dangerous too. Micah Allen Losh lived the first 37 years of his life as a Jehovah's Witness. Waking up wasn't intentional. He resisted it, even as he was inexorably pulled toward it. Mentally Diseased is the true story of how he left Jehovah Witnesses.",
