  "description": "Spring has sprung in Cleveland and home stager (and lousy spiritual medium) Bailey Burke is facing all kinds of major life changes. Both her grandmother and her boyfriend Jake Marner have moved in with her, she is contemplating a career change, and Marner’s mother needs her help planning a thirtieth birthday party for him.Party plans include dance lessons for Bailey and Jake. Which would be fun, except their instructor appears to have tangoed with the wrong partner. She’s found dead on the dance floor, a butchered ballroom teacher with multiple stab wounds.It’s a classic case of overkill, but there are no suspects and no ghosts hanging around to offer any insight. It’s time to call on Bailey’s old friend, Ryan, who happens to be a dead detective with a rude sense of humor.Can Bailey and her two favorite guys solve the case of the killer Cha Cha?",
