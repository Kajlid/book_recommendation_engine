It isn't until she finds herself aboard the haden ship, bound for New Ducran, however, that she realizes how tenuous her position is. The mission she has stumbled upon is to secure wives for the New Ducranian colonists-but Kelly wasn't chosen, and she has no way of knowing if she can convince Tau that she's worth keeping-although it doesn't seem to be difficult to convince him to impregnate her.
