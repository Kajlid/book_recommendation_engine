Dangers abound, the Uyumaak threatening to overtake and destroy the Chalaine and her companions as they desperately try to escape the Shroud Lake Shard. Split from Gen, the Chalaine must find a way to work with her husband before their mutual animosity tears the prophecy apart.  Meanwhile, Mirelle battles Padra Athan behind the scenes to free the man she loves more than anyone. Gen and his fugitive allies know that even if they escape the shard and the Uyumaak that hunt them, the Ha’Ulrich and Padra Athan will be waiting to destroy them on the other side.",
