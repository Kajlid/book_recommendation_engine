  "description": "Are you ready to rock?  Lily Crandell has always lived in the shadow of her older sister, Lauren, who has a successful career as a wedding planner and a perfect husband and baby boy. Known within her family for being an aimless, impulsive trouble-magnet, Lily finally decides she may as well live up to her reputation: she elopes with new beau and would-be rock star Ted Dayton. But just as quickly as his band skyrockets, Lily's marriage crashes and burns. When news of her ex's new love with sultry and silicone-enhanced actress Melanie Slate hits the tabloids, she flees the country.  Hello, London!  Across the pond, Lily shares a flat with an old flame -- a commitment-phobic doctor who convinces her that the best prescription for her broken heart is volunteering at the local hospital. Turns out, he's right, as one of the patients, famed soccer star Sean Gates, takes more than a passing interest in Lily's quirky style. But things get complicated when her ex's band starts flying up the British charts. Ted comes to town, the paparazzi camp on her doorstep, and her new fling and old flame both find rumors that Lily and her ex are planning a little reunion tour rather troublesome. Is there a happily ever after at the end of this rocky road?",
