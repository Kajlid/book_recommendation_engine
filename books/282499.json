  "description": "Savannah Brownâ€™s long-awaited second collection of poetry is at once philosophical and accessible, just as concerned with the biggest questions of being as the smallest personal desires, which might be one and the same. London (and occasionally the apocalypse) as a backdrop, Sweetdark explores the transience of existence, the pursuit of vulnerability, pleasure, chaos, and the dichotomy of a life wholly experienced, full of so much darkness and so much sweetness, sometimes in the same breath.",
