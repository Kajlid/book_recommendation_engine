  "description": "Abigail “Art “ Ruth Teller thought her sophomore year would include the usual teenage worries: getting good grades, breaking away from an overprotective mom, dealing with hormones, having fun with friends and starting to date. Unfortunately, the School Board decided to throw a wrench in her plans by proposing to water down the science program to teach the decidedly unscientific creationism. With such a subpar curriculum, how would Art get into a top university so she could discover a cure for her diabetes? Someone was going to have to stop them and it looked as if it was going to be her. As if high school wasn’t hard enough. Art didn’t know if one teenager could really defeat a group of religious zealots dead set on bringing their political beliefs into the classroom but she vowed she would stop at nothing to save her school.",
