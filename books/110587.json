Rowan and Xavier arrive in Aspen, ready to leave everything behind them and start fresh. But when the past follows them to Colorado, they have to overcome the odds to protect themselves from Lilith Silvan, who is not ready to let go of Rowan without a fight. They learn something about themselves that will change everything they thought they knew about life, love, and letting go.In Spring Hill, Cian, Chloe, Kaiden, and Brianna have to learn to adjust to life without Rowan and Xavier. When they get caught casting a protection spell, Chloe’s fast thinking saves them, or so they hope. They turn to two powerful witches who are willing to help them, but can they be trusted? Liam and Marcus Alexander have been protecting witches for so long that when they find something in the woods that threatens them all, they begin to think that they haven’t been as careful as they should’ve been. While someone searches for evidence of the Alexanders’ wrongdoings, Liam and Marcus search for whomever is trying to unravel the life they’ve built for themselves in Spring Hill. Will they figure it out before their secrets are exposed, or is it already too late?",
