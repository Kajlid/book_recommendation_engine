  "title": "Occupied Voices: Stories of Everyday Life from the Second Intifada",
  "description": "As the Middle East peace process disintegrates & the second Palestinian Intifada begins, Wendy Pearlman, a young Jewish woman from the American Midwest travels to the West Bank & Gaza Strip in a quest to talk to ordinary Palestinians. A remarkable narrative emerges from her conversations with doctors, artists, school kids & families who have lost loved ones or watched their homes destroyed. Their stories, ranging from the humorous to the tragic, paint a profile of the Palestinians that's as honest as it's uncommon in the Western media: that of ordinary people who simply want to live ordinary lives. As Pearlman writes, \"the personal stories & heartfelt reflections that I encountered did not expose a hatred of Jews or a yearning to push Israelis into the sea. Rather, they painted a portrait of a people who longed for precisely that which had inspired the first Israelis: the chance to be citizens in a country of their own.\"",
