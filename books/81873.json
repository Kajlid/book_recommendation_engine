  "description": "A book that asks the big questions facing today's generationDELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR is part dark and humorous memoir, part relentless cultural critique. How can a people who have so much still feel dissatisfied? How does an educated but jaded society reconcile what they know with what they see happening around them? These and other big questions are examined and updated for today. If you have ever felt that more should be happening – in your life, in this culture we give ourselves to – then this book is for you. Thousands protesting in the streets of New York. Revolutions across the Middle East. Millions of people plugged into social networks, searching for a connection, longing for a sense of community. This is not the trailer for a movie, not the hook of an epic novel; this is what’s happening today, all around us.Using a familiar backstory and well-known cultural examples, revisiting our history to better see where we came from, DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR is a passionate and personal examination of that “something” that is missing in our lives, why this something continues to eat at us, and why we need a different approach to how we deal with it.In a modern and fast-paced style, a compelling and common sense argument is presented for the next stage in our cultural evolution.A must-read for anyone who's ever felt sure that there must be more than this",
