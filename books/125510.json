  "description": "The brick walls of Farrington High School in Chicago feel like a prison to Sheila and a sanctuary to Neill when they end up in the same class, one taught by Sheila’s mother. Being black, teenaged, and gay leaves Neill a virtual outcast. His life is controlled by a man who acts more like a parent than a big brother. Neill has many enemies, but he is unprepared for the level of animosity Sheila exhibits when they meet. Sheila is a former poor little rich girl, now just poor, and facing an unknown future with a mother she barely knows. She gave up hope of a loving family after her father’s suicide. She recognizes Neill as the brother her mother’s former lover and is appalled to find her mother trying to throw her and Neill together.Invisible ties bind Neill and Sheila together, ropes that tighten when Neill's brother is arrested for the murder of Sheila's mother. These two outliers have to work together to uncover the truth and make futures of their own while they uncover the past they share.",
