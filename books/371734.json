  "description": "This unauthorized companion to George Orwell's Animal Farm is a controversial parable about September 11th by one of fiction's most inventive and provocative writers.Written in 14 days shortly after the September 11th attacks,  Snowball's Chance  is an outrageous and unauthorized companion to George Orwell's  Animal Farm,  in which exiled pig Snowball returns to the farm, takes charge, and implements a new world order of untrammeled capitalism. Orwell's \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\" has morphed into the new rallying \"All animals are born equal--what they become is their own affair.\"A brilliant political satire and literary parody, John Reed's  Snowball's Chance  caused an uproar on publication in 2002, denounced by Christopher Hitchens, and barely dodging a lawsuit from the Orwell estate. Now, a decade later, with America in wars on many fronts, readers can judge anew the visionary truth of Reed's satirical masterpiece.",
