  "title": "Heretic: A Memoir",
  "description": "A memoir of leaving the Evangelical church, reckoning with religious trauma while also interrogating just how much Evangelicalism has and continues to affect all Americans--via our power structures and pop culture--and how it drives our democracy towards fascism.Jeanna Kadlec was a devout Evangelical and the wife of a pastor's son before she came to the double realization that she was queer and that she had to leave the church in order to survive. This is a memoir of growing up Evangelical--of indoctrination, family, and working poor middle America--and a sharp critique of how the tenets of conservative Christianity have built our power structures and political systems, in addition to how they've shaped our culture and our daily interactions with each other.From writing about Lilith and celebrity purity rings, to coming out and discovering F/F fanfiction, finding community outside of Christianity in the face of millennial loneliness, to interrogating the liberal and academic stigma against faith, this memoir traces the damage Evangelicalism, with its demands for unquestioning obedience, has caused in individuals, communities, and our country, past to present--and also imagines how could we radically leave it behind: new methods of building community, finding meaning, and reintegrating concepts of fellowship and love into our everyday discourse.",
