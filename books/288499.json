  "description": "Bradley Johnson stands outside an antique book shop in Cambridge, England. Weighed down by lifeâ€™s expectation, he trudges through each day, detached from his father and siblings: drifting further from his wife and the person he once was.Gordon Andrews was the former head of English at Cambridge, and now the proud owner of an Antique bookshop. He shares his residence with his Canadian granddaughter Alex, a vibrant young woman and a student at Magdalene College.The elderly bookstore owner has done his best to move on from a life dotted with sadness, but by chance he meets Bradley, and their families intertwine across two countries to raise secrets from the past. Success as a Sydney-based lawyer has given Gabi Johnson everything she needs, except the courage to face her father as her true self. Outwardly confident, she is the person that holds the Johnsons together by the barest thread, her strength drawn from her mother Emily, the woman she always wanted to be.The death of their father brings the siblings together in Australia for the funeral, but the passing of Robert senior is only the vehicle that moves the middles-aged Johnsons towards reconciling their pasts and confronting what they have become.",
