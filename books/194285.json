  "description": "The other day, when I was having a rant about traffic, the Internet and the other frustrations in life my husband said: “Why don’t you write it down and send it into the newspaper or somewhere else.” Of course he really meant, ‘tell someone who cares’ but that’s okay. I decided to take his suggestion and I feel much better. Here it is.  In “Now that I am Sixty”, A. Mary Smith takes a humorous look at the complexities and challenges of 21st century life for ageing women baby boomers.  Between not being able to get the car out of a parking lot, to customer disservice call centres, to ridiculous electronic forms, passwords and security questions—life is not easy these days! Still, with friends, family, travel and a little bit of free time it is very good!  “Now that I am Sixty” will show you that you are not alone in your frustrations—and hopefully provide a few wry smiles, the odd guffaw and some belly laughs.",
