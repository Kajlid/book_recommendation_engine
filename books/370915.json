  "description": "Oprah Winfrey claimed this to be her number 1 spiritual story in over 20,000 guests and over 13 years of her show and quickly installed the story onto a select show called \"The Best of Oprah\". This powerful real life story of forgiveness has changed millions of lives in dramatic fashion and will continue to do so wherever boundaries of life have been horribly trespassed and God is allowed to enter the room. The Road to Forgiveness is the story of how Cindy and Bill Griffiths came to forgive-and eventually befriend-the woman who, while driving drunk, killed their daughter, Robyn, and Cindy's mother, Janice, in a horrible automobile accident in June 1996. It is a moving, first-person account of the transforming work God can do in the midst of tragedy. Readers will be inspired to examine their own lives, and to follow this powerful, true example of letting love and mercy triumph-even in the face of tragedy.",
