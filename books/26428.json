  "description": "\"When you work at a bookshop, hopeful customers sometimes come up to the counter and say, 'I don't know the author or the title, but it's red (green, blue, etc) and it has xxxxx in it.' (I've said it myself at least once or twice.) Anyway, for a couple of years, my husband Gavin and I have had a running joke about using this as the title of a collection. These three stories have appeared before, in other collections, but we were hoping that an all-zombie mini-book would make a good sampler for new readers. We designed the book and printed it in less than twenty-four hours. How amazing: to see your book made before your eyes! We're now thinking about other projects for Paige M. Gutenborg.\" â€”Kelly Link",
