  "description": "The kingdom of Candelaon is facing many foes, and the worst of them by far is the fire mages who are terrorizing the land—especially since no one seems to know anything about them. Where do they come from when they appear out of thin air? Where do they go after they burn villages to the ground? What is their goal? But perhaps the most pressing question is whether or not it’s safe to keep a man with their abilities so close at hand, as the king’s second.Sir Gabrel has been at King Haylan’s side since he first gained his powers, but there is much that they don’t know about the fire magic and how Gabrel came to wield it. And as he trains others to wield it as well, there are those who wonder if it can be trusted. There are those who wonder if Sir Gabrel himself is a danger to the land.With a rich cast of characters and mind-bending new worlds, Mereda Hart Farynyk’s Firedark is a thrilling mix of the old and the alluringly new that will keep you hooked and hungry for more.",
