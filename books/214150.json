Peer through the tinted windows at a family, that isn't mine.But I'm determined to make them mine.That was my obsession. Till it was too late~AdriannaBorn and bred in Redmond, Washington, she flits to Sequim, a town where secrets are so close knit, that she may fall into one of the mines with her traipsing. Barely containing her fragile past, lost in lies and deception, she starts a dangerous game. A game where dominoes start falling without slightest provocation. What started as road to redemption, quickly became a nightmare. Everybody has a secret; dirty, scandalous, chilling, a horrifying deed. Sometimes these secrets are people. They are buried in thoughts, hidden, restrained to wander in conscious memory, and some killed.My name is Adrianna Theroux, I am one of the secret people, standing in the town of a family who have buried my existence. But I am back, and they hardly remember me. Not that I'm announcing. I was never born in Washington. Come to think of it, the only Adrianna born in Redmond died in her teens, two years ago. Would I kill to protect this knowledge? Every killer has a start, although I already had mine.",
