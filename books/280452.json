  "description": "Pumpkin. The smell. The spice in my latte. The pie that’s synonymous with my favorite holiday. Thanksgiving holds memories of family and togetherness. So when a storm cancels my travel plans, my roommate takes pity on me and I find myself sharing the holiday across the table from my greatest crush—her older brother.  Finlay Ross. He was a senior in high school when I was still in pig tails. Popular, the star quarterback, he was the first boy I got a stomach flip over, and the only guy I’ve ever wanted. Pity a curvy girl like me would never be on his radar. He probably doesn’t even know I exist.  So why does he keep looking at me like he’s starving and I’m the feast?  This could turn out to be a thanksgiving I’ll never forget.   Warning: this quick read contains over-the-top declarations, insta-love and molten hot moments between a curvy girl and a dirty-talking alpha who wants nothing more than a sweet little piece of pumpkin pie.  Each Megan Wade story carries her 'Sugar Promise' of Over the Top Romance, Alpha Heroes, Curvy Heroines, Low Drama, High Heat and a Guaranteed Happily Ever After. What could be better than that?",
