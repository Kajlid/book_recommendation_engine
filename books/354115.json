  "description": "The Holocaust was perpetrated by fanatical Nazis. Or was it? Were they all insane and evil? The truth is many people involved in the Holocaust were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. We like to believe we would never do such things. Given the same circumstances, though, would we? Would you? Albert Stohl is an old man with a hidden past. He was at Auschwitz, but not as an inmate. Now he has to tell his story to his daughter and grandchildren. What will they think? How will he explain what he did and why? Will they ever see him the same way again? Well researched and technically detailed, Melting Point is a classic historical fiction tale of an ordinary person in extraordinary circumstances. About The Author Roger Collins is a software engineer living near Bodega Bay, California. An avid reader of history, Melting Point is his first published work.",
