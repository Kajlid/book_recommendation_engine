  "description": "A brilliant re-creation of the great myths of the Middle Agesâ€”from Beowulf to the Cid !Medieval myths are as significant to modern reads as they were to the unlettered serfs and lords of feudal times. Their influence on literature, philosophy, and folklore is apparent throughout the history of Europe, and they have deeply expressed the imagination and dreams of many peoples.Offering nine brilliant retellings of the great myths of the medieval world, this is the first collection to compare national heroes of a time when their cultures were emerging from barbarism into civilization. The stories of Beowulf, Roland, Tannhauser, Culchulain, and other mythic heroes are among the oldest of the western world, and their reverberations have deeply affected the ideals of the nations from which they came. These rousing sagas, so vividly presented here, are masterpieces of world literature that give modern readers new insights into the origins of European culture.",
