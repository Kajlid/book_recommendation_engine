  "description": "Brit Nelson spent the last four years of college in Seattle, a city that nurtured her artistic abilities and freethinking spirit. She had recently discovered a love for music and was enjoying some local success with her band. As her college career was coming to a close, an opportunity to teach art in Los Angeles presented itself. This forced Brit to make a choice between staying comfortable or starting over.Josh Rand was an ex-collegiate swimmer who had turned to MMA as a way to heal the scars left from a nasty divorce. His engineering career was really beginning to take off, and like Brit, he was contemplating a move to Los Angeles to pursue a new job opportunity.The two had become acquainted through their mutual friends, but they rubbed each other the wrong way from the very start. Josh's logical, responsible attitude was the polar opposite of Britâ€™s hippie lifestyle, and he would have never pictured himself with someone like her. But everything changed the moment he heard her sing.",
