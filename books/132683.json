  "description": "After the Zompoc a group of survivors joins ranks in Lower Manhattan. A motley crew of neighbors in a luxury high rise at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge now need to think about what comes next and whether to stay or go. Luckily there is plenty of weed, plenty of guns, and enough sharp metal objects to keep the Zombies at bay. If they can just stop arguing long enough to pass the bowl, they might just make it through alive. Along the way, the group expands as they encounter new people, new places, and new ideas. A reminder - anyone and anything is fair game for us to poke fun at. Absolutely nothing is sacred! So sit back, do whatever works for you to free your mind and don't take this too seriously. It's mental masturbation... not the end of the weed, uh, world,",
