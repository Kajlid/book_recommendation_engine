  "title": "The Gladiators' Woman",
  "description": "When Lana was taken prisoner and told to pleasure twelve gladiators, the last thing she expected was to do so willingly…  The gladiators have asked Lana to trust them. They have promised that they can bring her pleasure and keep her safe. It feels wrong on every level to simply go along with her enemy’s plan. To allow him and his men to watch her as she is humiliated.  But there’s another part of her, a part that wants to explore the fantasies she’s had since the first time she saw the gladiators.  Her men have given her one word. All she has to do is say it, and everything stops. Instead, they will attack her enemies, even if it costs them their lives. But can she really send the handsome gladiators to their deaths because of her fears? Or can she forget why she was kidnapped, and learn to enjoy the touch of her twelve devoted warriors?  ~ The love story of one woman and her gladiators begins as a dark and twisted tale and evolves to a romance like no other. This is not a story for the faint of heart. It is rough, hard, and dark, so if that doesn’t appeal to you, don’t buy it. ~",
