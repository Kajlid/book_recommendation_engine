  "description": "Has anyone ever asked you—What were the best days of your life? That one period of your life you always wanted to go back to? And live that life . . . one more time? When asked this, I closed my eyes and went back in my own past. And I thought . . . . . . of the days, when life's most complex choices had a simple solution of Akkad Bakkad Bambey Bo! . . . of the seasons when rains were celebrated by making paper boats. . . . of the times when waiting at the railway crossing meant counting the bogies of the train passing by. When I opened my eyes, it seems Like it Happened Yesterday! Like it was yesterday that I broke my first tooth and fell in love for the first time. Like it was yesterday, when I was about to lose my friend, and suddenly he became my best friend. I look back and it becomes a journey full of adventure. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry and I know I’m here because I was . . . Come, hold my hand, and take this trip with me. It will be yesterday for you, once again!Note: This book is in the Hindi language and has been made available for the Kindle, Kindle Fire HD, Kindle Paperwhite, iPhone and iPad, and for iOS, Windows Phone and Android devices.",
