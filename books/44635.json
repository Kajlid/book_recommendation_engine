  "description": "The Havoc Chronicles is a Completed Series  Madison is a smart and witty teen who wants what any teenager wants – to fit in and be accepted. Everything changes the summer before her junior year of high school when her first kiss triggers powers she can’t control, almost killing the unsuspecting boy. She discovers she is a Berserker, a powerful being chosen to guard the world from ancient creatures brought into our world by magic. These creatures cause destruction and death, but cannot be killed. Only a Berserker's life-blood can bind or release them. One of the ancient creatures is free and needs Madison’s blood to free another. Instead of being a normal teen, Madison must now work with the Berserkers to master her powers and bind the creature before it kills her. Oh, and if that weren’t bad enough, it turns out she is the first female Berserker since, well - ever.",
