Forced into a life of crime to feed the small group of orphans she's rescued over the past two years, she’s trapped in an impossible situation with no way out. But fate has other plans for Mary, and those plans involve a sexy six-foot-eleven Bracadyte with tattoos and piercing emerald eyes. With everything she cares about at stake, Mary must choose between the orphans she's come to love and her heart's greatest desire.  Rykaur is more than aware of the fiery-haired female in his midst. Night after night, he's watched her stroll into camp without so much as a glance in his direction.

With the world in chaos and the Incola virus still running rampant, Rykaur must face the demons of his past and learn to trust the one person who could hurt him most...",
