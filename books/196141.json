  "description": "Another helping of hilarity, please! Garfield, the lovable feline who never met a lunch he didn’t like, dishes up another book full of his heavy hijinx and weighty wit. Garfield’s put on a few pounds over the years, but he’s not just getting fatter, he’s getting better! So keep the comedy and calories coming! Whether he’s painting Odie or chowing down on Jon’s favorite fern, Garfield proves he’s still a ton of fun! The GARFIELD CLASSICS series collects the early years of the GARFIELD comic strip in a larger, full-color format. Garfield may have gone through a few changes, but one thing has stayed the his enormous appetite for food and fun. So laugh along with the classic cat, because classics are always in style.",
