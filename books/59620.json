  "title": "Time Fighters: The Shifter Prince",
  "description": "Twenty years after the Perfect War, in the last totalitarian regime in Europe, seventeen-year-old Yaroslav, the scion of an old dynasty, is on a mission to find the antidote to a drug the government is forcing on people like him.  They are the Talents, the elite group of shape-shifters, who, unlike ordinary shifters, plentiful in the country, can change without being recognized. Many have joined a group of anti-government rebels whose leader has been captured and given the drug to suppress her abilities to escape.  Together with Amber, an American exchange student and a time traveler, Yaroslav goes back in time to find an ancient antidote called True Shield. Major Gadinski, a Talent himself, backed by the country’s powerful Secret Service, stands in their way.  Yaroslav’s and Amber’s friendship is shaping into something bigger, but they discover that their budding romance is threatened: they can physically touch each other only when they travel in time.  Will they win the race against time before the resistance leader is executed? Will they be able to break the barrier which separates them?",
