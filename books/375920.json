  "description": "Have you ever worried about not being quite hip enough? Or maybe you are one of those who flaunts your unhipness with abandon. Either way, Little Guide to Unhip is for you. Although it charts my own personal unhip top 50 with the likes of Gilbert Oâ€™Sullivan, Morris Dancing, Vicar of Dibley, Shopping Trolleys and Brollies, I picked those characters, characteristics, attributes or material objects with a universally unhip feeling to them. Each is given an unhip rating up to five for you to keep a count of your own and includes personal anecdotes. There is also a 'bubbling under' list for a further those unhips things not quite making the top 50. This book carries a some readers may seriously dent their coolness if caught reading this material!",
