  "description": "Bubbaku is a collection of haiku poems for the more enlightened redneck. Many in the target audience would not be caught dead reading poetry, so it might be wise to keep this volume in the outhouse, or locked in the glove box of the pickup, to be read while waiting for the light to change. Haiku syllable rules don't apply to Bubbaku or to Bubbas--just like speed limit signs, calorie counters, born-on mason jar dates, and hunting and fishing restrictions.",
