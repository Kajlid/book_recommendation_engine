  "description": "Ten seconds. Thirteen words. That was all it took to reveal the skeleton in my closet. A dark truth that would doom me to a lifetime of misery: I was hopelessly in love with my stepsister.When my mother and stepfather sent me packing the moment I turned eighteen, I should have taken the hint and backed away. But Sadie was fighting a battle that couldnâ€™t be won alone. A battle against her father, the doctors trying to treat her epilepsy, and most of all, her own body. And I loved her too much to abandon her when she needed me the most. Could I be what Sadie needed without giving in to my feelings, or would the pull between us end up being too strong to resist?Trigger Warning: This book deals with the subjects of physical and psychological manipulation and abuse and suicidal ideation.Note: My Voice Is Sealed is the ninth book in the Sealed With a Kiss series, but it may be read as a complete standalone.",
