  "description": "An unexpected surprise has Elsie wrestling more than just gators in the souvenir shop of Bertie’s Snap and Wrap. Instant attraction causes sparks to fly when Elsie meets Dale, her new co-worker, at the local gator farm. Dale knows the second he meets her that she’s the one for him.  The phrase ‘Once bitten, twice shy’ describes Elsie perfectly and an encounter with something worse than a gator has her running for the hills. Except nothing will stop the new gator hunter who is an expert when it comes to hunting down and capturing anything he sets his mind to.  Will Dale’s instincts lead him in the right direction? Will Elsie be able to wrangle her feelings or be bitten again? There’s only one way to find out; step out of those pumps and prepare to get dirty.   Elsie is the second novella in The Swamp Head Series; a seven book novella series based on a family born and raised in the swamp. Each sibling will get their own INSTAlove story told and even though it is a series, each book is a standalone. Come meet Elsie and her six brothers and sister; Chester, Cyrus, Earle & Zeke (twins), Roscoe, Hallie Mae (Elsie’s twin).",
