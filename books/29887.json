  "description": "Janelle was a chubby and awkward teen in love with the most popular guy from her high school. Even now that she's in college and he's heading off to the army, he'd never give her the time of day...would he? When she finds herself drawn into a game of spin the bottle with him, she finds out how wrong she is.Ron admires Janelle as much for her spunk as he always has for her well-endowed figure. So when the sweetly shy girl shows her wild side, he can't think of anything other than possessing her; mind,body, and soul.",
