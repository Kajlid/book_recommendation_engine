  "description": "Basil Davidson ranks as one of the most remarkable Africanist historians of his generation. A leading authority on Portuguese Africa who witnessed many of these events first-hand, Davidson draws on his own extensive experience in the country as well as the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) archives to provide a detailed and rigorous analysis of the conflict. The result, No Fist is Big Enough to Hide the Sky, still stands as a key text in the history of the eleven-year struggle against Portuguese rule in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde.   Less well known than the struggles in Angola and Mozambique, the liberation war waged by the PAIGC, as Davidson shows, easily ranks alongside those conflicts as an example of an African independence movement triumphing against overwhelming odds. The book provides one of the earliest accounts of the assassination of the PAIGC’s founder, Amilcar Cabral, and documents the movement’s remarkable success in recovering from the death of its leader and in eventually attaining independence. An invaluable resource for the study both of the region and of African liberation struggles as a whole, this edition features a new preface by Cape Verde’s first president, Aristides Pereira, and a new foreword by Cabral himself.",
