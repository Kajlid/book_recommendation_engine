  "description": "A desperate widow in need of a helping hand… even a cybernetic one.  Hattie came to Mars with high hopes. Hopes that she and her husband would be able to claim a plot of land, to create a home, perhaps even to start a family - all of the things that were now impossible on a troubled Earth. Instead, she’s lost everything, everything except the land, and in order to keep her homestead she needs help.  When help arrives in the form of a tall, gruff cyborg ranger, she is torn between her loyalty to the past and the promise of a new future. But when danger threatens, is she going to lose even that?  M-231 can barely remember the time before - before he became a cyborg, before he shut off his emotions, before he became both more and less than human. Until a stubborn, beautiful female - one who is no longer off limits - makes him remember what it is to feel.  Can Hattie and her cyborg overcome harsh conditions, troubled pasts, and a mysterious enemy to create a new future together?  Each book in the Cyborgs on Mars series can be read as a standalone romance. This sweet and steamy romance is intended for mature readers.",
