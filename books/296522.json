  "description": "MikelI'm old enough to be her father, but it doesn't matter -- she'll be mine.Melody is the newest member of The Clans charity program. She's supposed to be my voice for certain issues I don't feel comfortable speaking about. After all, she's been doing this for years. Being a spokesperson is somewhat new to me, so I don't mind having a professional alongside me.She doesn't know anything about what we really do, and keeping it all a secret is becoming more difficult every day. She's constantly around me, always listening, always needing to bring an idea to me. Typically in a shirt that hugs her tits a little too tight and her ass just to my liking.Melody doesn't know I'm lying about who I am, or rather, what I am.She thinks I'm an angel. In all actuality, I'm the exact opposite. She doesn't know it yet, but she will. Whether it be by my real job, or by my presence in the bedroom.",
