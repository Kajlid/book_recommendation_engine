  "title": "Cyanide",
  "description": "Heartless. Conceited. Shallow. Three simple words to describe me.  I had everything a girl could ask for, yet nothing I truly needed. I'd made peace with who I was and the expectations set upon me long ago. Only to have that peace shattered when a nameless hero rode into my world.  I wasn't allowed to have him. Too bad I never cared much for the word no.  Because I'd soon learn the hard way that too much self-indulgence could result in incurable consequences.",
