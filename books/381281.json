  "description": "Diana Foxton has it all. Rich, British and beautiful she is married to the head of a publishing empire and fills her days with lunches, interior decorating and clothes shopping. Never out of the society pages, she hosts the most talked about parties in Manhattan and makes being the perfect wife an art form. Then she discovers her husband is having an affair, her glamorous bubble is burst and she finds herself without any money or any qualifications, shunned by the glittering society that once embraced her. Alone for the first time, she takes the only job she can get, and settles awkwardly into a very different life. But can she make it on her own? And why does her new boss, the handsome Michael Cicero, take so much pleasure in watching her struggle?",
