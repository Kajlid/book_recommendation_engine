  "description": "Madison gave her heart to a boy at the age of sixteen, but all she got in return was a broken heart and a swollen belly.Alone with a baby and desperate for the love she hadn’t found, she turned to a man who sealed his claim of devotion with a diamond ring.He promised her a family. A life. A future. But his lies had only been a cover for the personal hell he introduced her to daily.Now, at twenty-five, Madison has long since stopped believing in love. It’s simply not a square on her bingo card.Balancing single parenthood, three jobs, and online courses, she doesn’t have the time anyway.So when the broody neighbor living in the other side of her duplex leaves a rude note on her door, she’s not interested.Not in his dark hair, not in his physique, and definitely not in the dimples she’s only seen a hint of. She’s one hundred percent, absolutely, not interested.Not even a little.Author's Note: Head to the author's website for a full list of all content descriptions, tropes, etc.",
