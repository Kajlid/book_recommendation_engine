  "description": "In the mists of the dark forest of Muir, Rowan of Locks Glen stumbles into a trap. He is the last of his kind, a fierce and mighty Dragon Lord. As Rowan is fighting for his life, he is suddenly, desperately aware that he should have taken a wife, thereby ensuring the lineage of his blood. A throng of arrows whip through his body as everything turns black. Kira, a healer from an ancient clan of elves, finds Rowan's prone body. She recognizes him as the protector of her people, hides him and takes him to her cottage where, she hopes, he'll be safe. While there, Rowan asks her to be his life mate. She refuses at first, for she feels unworthy, but she was born to protect this mighty Dragon Lord. What better way to protect him than to be constantly by his side?",
