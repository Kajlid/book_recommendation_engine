Australia is at war and Perth is buzzing.US troops have permanently docked in the city in what local men refer to bitterly as the American occupation, and Perth women are having the time of their lives.

The war has brought her nothing but heartbreak, stealing her young love eighteen months ago. Until, in the middle of a Perth heat-wave, she meets her lost lover's brother, Tom â€“ standing over a dead body in her neighbour's backyard.Suddenly, Meg finds herself embroiled in the murder mystery, and increasingly involved with Tom Lagrange. But is he all that he seems? And what exactly was his relationship with the dead woman?Debut author Deborah Burrows has brought her skills as a historian to the fore with this meticulously researched and thoroughly entertaining novel of love and intrigue.",
