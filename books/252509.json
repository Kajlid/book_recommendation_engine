  "description": "Right now you just started to read the book. This book totally consists of nothing but a prologue so it's just a cover. With this book, we are aiming to show people how can something sell only because of the cover(package). Popular culture converted us into buying machines and it's hard to realize that. Let's show people how we spend money on unnecessary things.",
