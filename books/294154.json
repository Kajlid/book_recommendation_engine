  "description": "Poetry. Prose Poems. Fiction. \"Sarah Fran Wisby's fables and speculations have an unguarded quality--they are without prudery or self-protection. Her book, VIVA LOSS, is harsh, juicy, learned, and tender. But the loss in the title turns to wonder as Wisby surprises us with the truth--that is, what can be said--about ourselves\"--Robert Gluck.",
