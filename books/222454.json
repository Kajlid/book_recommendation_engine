  "title": "The Sheik",
  "description": "‘He was looking at her with fierce burning eyes that swept her until she felt that the boyish clothes that covered her slender limbs were stripped from her’ The Sheik – to become notorious as Rudolph Valentino’s greatest screen expression role – is an astonishing and touchingly artless expression of female sexual masochism. One of Virago’s trio of turn-of-the-century erotic best-sellers – with Elinor Glyn’s Three Weeks and Ethel M Dell’s The Way of an Eagle, its wilful heroine, is kidnapped and subjugated by the cruel but strangely compelling Sheik Ahmed who, it emerges, is not all that he seems.",
