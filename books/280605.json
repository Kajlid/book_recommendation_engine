Two felons armed with shotguns want to keep her as a hostage.Raw from the wounds of that experience Charlene begins healing by leaving home, again. This time she follows a contentious meditation teacher into Tibetan temples in the north of India, down to the slums of Sydney Australia, across narrow waters to a 3-month silent meditation retreat and around the globe for 2 and a half years.Will she ever release the internal demons demanding constant movement, threatening her sanity if, as she yearns to, she returns home?This psychologically thrilling memoir speaks eloquently to our heart’s desires— and the path of clearing and healing what blocks us.Written in luminous prose, insightful and wise, this book offers a masterful description of the pathway out of despair into triumph. Well-paced, mesmerizing, and bold, this book offers to all who yearn for it a description of the path home.If you enjoyed Educated by Tara Westover, Wild by Cheryl Strayed, Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert and On the Road by Jack Kerouac, you’ll love My Impossible Life.",
