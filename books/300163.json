  "description": "In a world where the rules are gray and the Don's word is a law unto itself, only one thing is sacred… family.Boris Novak watched four of his brothers find happiness with their fated mates, but never considered he might be that lucky. When a family member dragged in a fainting goat shifter suspected of working with their enemies, it took only one scent for Boris to recognize his mate and know that he’d fight anyone and anything to protect him.Even if it meant fighting his own family.One year ago, Gary never would have imagined being caught up in such a mess of crime bosses, turf wars, and smuggling. He’d never imagined anything beyond a quiet life. Until that life was stolen from him.Together, the two find a wholeness that neither looked for, but deeply craved. But before they can find peace, they have to defeat the woman who killed Gary’s family and tried to kill Boris’s father. All while keeping Chicago from erupting into a street war, saving kidnapped kids, and avoiding the eye of the Feds.This is the fourth book in this mpreg mafia series. Get ready for a world ruled by the Don’s iron fist, a fainting goat who is stronger than his instincts, and a family that stands together… no matter what. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and more violence than you’re used to from us. But at its heart, you’ll still find all the fluffy mpreg feels and crazy antics you’d look for from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown.",
