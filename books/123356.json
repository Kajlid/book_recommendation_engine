  "description": "Psychotherapist Rosa Sobel keeps a daily journal as she employs the use of a psychoscope to display her patients' brain activity as visual images for therapeutic analyses. When a straitjacketed patient shows an inexplicable ability to hide his thoughts from the machine, she suspects there may be a link to his irrational fear of electroshock therapy.
