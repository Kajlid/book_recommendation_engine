  "description": "What Bryce Beaumont, a young researcher from California was to discover on Mykonos—that Greek island of billionaire hideaways, nude beaches and world-renowned nightclubs, was more than a playground for the privileged. In his probing the undercurrents of the jet-set high season, he would learn the little island was also home and history to a very ancient clan of beings.  One of them, a darkly lithe and stunning woman, had been waiting a long time to keep a long-held promise. It would materialize that summer—as would a cabal of strangers from the nary world of the \"undead.\"  . . . Melina Vespucci was Greek-Italian. She was single, jaw-dropping wealthy, reportedly the descendant of a Venetian Duke . . . and as a resident of one of the classical white villas atop a Mykonos cove. . . still beautiful after five-hundred years . . .",
