  "description": "Resolving to locate her mother's heirloom quilts after so many years, Sylvia Compson embarks on a cross-country investigation of antique shops, quilt museums, and other, more unexpected places, where offers of assistance are not always what they seem. And as Sylvia recovers some of the missing quilts and accepts others as lost forever, she reflects on the woman her mother was and mourns the woman she never knew.   With heartfelt honesty, The Quilter's Legacy reveals the tenuous connections that bind generations and celebrates the love that sustains them.",
