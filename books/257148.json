Recently returned to London after a year spent rusticating in the country, she’s eager to resume her social life. One thing she doesn’t plan on doing? Crossing paths with Sebastian Northcliff, the arrogant cad who stole her first kiss and broke her heart. A duke with a dark past… There are whispers about the Duke of Warwick.

For his part, Sebastian doesn’t care what people say...as long as they leave him the hell alone. With no family, no friends, and no plans to remarry, he’s content to live in the shadows.

Sebastian has never forgotten Georgiana. After seven years of loathing, can two opposites finally find love? Or is this one relationship that’s doomed to repeat itself?
