Their mission: find out what's really going on behind the closed doors of America.The assassination of the U.S. Speaker of the House has shaken the nation. And the outrageous iconoclasts of the club have found a chilling connection with another death: the demise of the director of the Library of Congress's rare books room. The man who calls himself Oliver Stone is the group's unofficial leader. Staying one step ahead of his violent past and headquartered in a caretaker's cottage in Mt. Zion Cemetery, Stone draws on his vast experience and acute deductive powers to discover that someone is selling America to its enemies one classified secret at a time.
