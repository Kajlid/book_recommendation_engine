  "description": "A kidnapping, a dangerous new devil: Steve and Orson confront another mystery, involving their closest friends, while Satan tries to recruit Steve to the Demon Corps.   Steve, Hell’s Super, and Orson, his trusty assistant, are back in another comic romp through the Underworld!  The Lord of Hell has a staffing shortage; there aren’t enough devils and demons to torment the ever-swelling ranks of the eternally damned. Satan thinks Steve is an ideal candidate for the Demon Corps. He’s smart, tenacious and able to dish out punishment when the need arises. But as Old Nick tries to recruit Hell’s handyman in chief, Steve gets distracted by a more pressing issue: Florence Nightingale, his on-again, off-again girlfriend, is missing, possibly kidnapped.  With a little help from his friends, like BOOH, the storied Bat out of Hell, Steve must solve the mystery of her disappearance, manage Hell’s unending flow of maintenance requests, while fending off an aggressive devil chief of police …not to mention a succubus who is determined to steal Hell’s Mr. Fixit away from Flo.  Deal With The Devil Is the third volume in the fantasy comedy series, Circles in Hell. It has been compared to other works of “Hell Fiction” including The Screwtape Letters and Good Omens and to the paranormal humor of Tom Holt, Christopher Moore and Douglas Adams.  _______________________________________________ Comedy Fiction Book Categories >Satire and Humor >Fantasy Comedy >Hell Fiction >Devils and Demons >Fiction Humor >Paranormal Humor >Paranormal Comedy Romance",
