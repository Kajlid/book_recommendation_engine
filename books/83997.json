He thought he'd gotten past the loss until he began having dreams about his dead brother. In the dreams his brother asks him for something—impossible. Ryan's wife, Rose, knows something's wrong. For the last several months Ryan's grown more withdrawn and distant. She loves him and knows he loves her, but doubts begin to creep in. She's determined to find out why her husband is withdrawing from her and win him back—no matter the cost. An early Christmas gift, an unexpected trip and haunting dreams. Can the love shared between Ryan and Rose overcome grief and guilt and lend a little magic for a second chance at happiness?",
