  "description": "Bailey Foster's improbable discovery bolsters the geneticist's own uncertain spirituality and changes the world.Twenty-somethings Bailey Foster and Susan Griffin work as genetic researchers for Bayner Genetics, a medical research lab owned by a non-scientific woman who was given the company by her dying parents. When the woman's daughter announces she is gay, the woman tells Foster and her lab partner she wants to find a cure for lesbianism.Foster bristles -- homosexuality is not an illness -- but her lab partner, who is herself gay, cheerfully accepts the assignment, knowing all along that she'll use the opportunity not to cure lesbianism but to study her passion: Junk DNA.Foster's personal search for spirituality joins with Griffin's scientific findings to lead them to a discovery that will affect people around the world, no one more dramatically than Foster and Griffin themselves.",
