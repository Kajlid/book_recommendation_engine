  "description": "What Drives Good People to Do Something Bad? As terrible revelations come to light, four people join together to commit an unspeakable act…When a member of the privileged upper class frames a Polish immigrant for a socialite’s murder in 1920s Akron, the heart-pounding events that follow lead to a stunning and unexpected conclusion. This gripping tale of bigotry and class distinctions includes political corruption, greed, injustice, murder, and betrayal. While Albo Jablonski endures the atrocious conditions of the state penitentiary, his son Nickels, daughter Antonia, and their friends Kurt and Charlie are tormented by the knowledge that he is innocent. Zemsta is a powerful, character-driven story of three boyhood friends during the tumultuous days of Prohibition that explores the meaning of friendship, family, love, and loyalty.\"Brown's debut novel recounts how a young woman's murder affects the lives of childhood friends. But it is the portrayal of real-world history--the height of Prohibition, the early days of cinema--that makes the book such a gem. A nostalgic, authentic novel that charms with its vintage hue.\" --Kirkus ReviewsFrom the Author: Zemsta makes an excellent choice for book clubs.
