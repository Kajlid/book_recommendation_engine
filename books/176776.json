  "description": "Lost Gold— He’d Risk It All In Pursuit Of His Own Desires  Smart, alluring, pants-droppingly-handsome Arden Goodman, orphaned by his drug addict mother and never knew his father. Diagnosed as a high functioning sociopath in his teens, he worked as a male prostitute. Now at twenty five he’s the proud owner of a number of very successful spa and fitness resorts.  Bill Young, a strikingly good-looking young man, had been Arden's business partner and lover for the last six years. An ex-prostitute who has devoted himself to Arden for the last ten years, enduring an on-off romantic relationship.  However, Arden's and Bill's relationship gets put to the test when Arden receives a call from England. A grandmother, he didn’t know he had, has left him a sizable inheritance. The caller was Miles Snow, whose voice so captivated Arden he was on the next flight to England. He intends to sate his sexual desires with the man on the other end of the phone line. The only obstacle being that Snow is straight. A fact Arden is determined to disregard.  Warning: Contains explicit m/m action. A lot of it. Extremely detailed. Two men getting it on, talking dirty and doing the horizontal mambo. Guy parts will touch. You’ve been warned.",
