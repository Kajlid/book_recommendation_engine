  "description": "One woman fights to hold on to her friends, her family, and all that she holds dear as the battle over a Confederate statue divides her small-town Georgia communityin this powerful novel from the author of The Sweet Taste of Muscadines.On the morning after Harry Cline’s funeral, a rare ice storm hits the town of Wesleyan, Georgia. The community wakes up to find its controversial statue of Confederate general Henry Benning destroyed—and not by the weather. Half the town had wanted to remove the statue; the other half wanted to celebrate it. Now that the matter has been taken out of their hands, the town’s long-simmering tensions are laid bare.  This conflict is especially personal to Harry’s widow, Marietta, who’s never been a fan of the statue. Her brother, Macon, the top defense attorney in the Southeast, is representing Old Man Griffin, the owner of the park where the statue stood. Despite Marietta’s pleas to let the matter rest, Macon is determined to find those responsible for the damage and protect the Griffin legacy—and he’s far from the only person Marietta stands to lose over a statue. Without Harry beside her, Marietta longs to salvage those connections, but the world is changing, and the divide can no longer be ignored. With a cast of poignant, relatable characters, When the Moon Turns Blue is a compassionate and timely novel about family, friendship, and what can happen when we discover that we don’t particularly like the people we love.",
