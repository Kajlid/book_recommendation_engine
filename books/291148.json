  "description": "It started with a kiss. A single kiss that shook me to my core. A kiss to silence me, and a kiss to numb the pain. I took his hand and in turn, he took me away. I thought when we ran away, we’d never have to look back. I was wrong. I think Sebastian knew, and so did I, that he’d be pulled back into this life one day. There was no way we could have gotten our happily ever after. Scars don’t ever fully go away, and this sinful place is etched into our flesh. I don’t know how I’ll ever forgive him for bringing me back here. Even when he kisses me the way he does… no kiss can take away this pain. He’s still my everything, but I don’t know how we’ll survive this.   A Kiss to Keep is an extension of Chloe and Sebastian’s story, A Kiss to Tell.
