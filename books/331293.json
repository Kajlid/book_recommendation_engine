  "description": "Born from a family whose attractive genes didn't quite pass onto him, Alvyn often feels like the odd ugly duckling. It doesn't help that he's short and thin with pointed ears, a pointy face, and erect eyebrows, like the little elf his mean mother often calls him.At eighteen, Alvyn is on the verge of learning new things in life that his mother neglected to teach him. He doesn't even know about the personal pleasures of one's body, let alone what masturbation even means. His father is already out of the picture, never showing an interest in any sort of connection.Alvyn still has one huge supporter in his life: Hans, his big brother. They don't just love each other like real family, but they're there for one another through thick and thin. While Hans gives Alvyn all the love and attention he needs, Alvyn looks after him as his little caregiver because of an accident that left Hans confined to a wheelchair.Alvyn finally takes caregiving to a whole new level when he unintentionally wakes something up in Hans while giving him a bath. And that's just the beginning of the kind of brotherhood they never knew they could have.Bringing them even closer than ever.",
