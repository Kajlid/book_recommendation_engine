  "description": "When Sylvie and her older sister Claire survive a horrific encounter with a gunman, they’re sent to stay with their aunt in the south of France for a change of scene. Sylvie is charmed by Gabriel, a young child who tells her he can see an angel sitting on her shoulder. Not so charming is Gabriel’s older brother, Daniel, who is just plain rude. But it’s love at second sight when Sylvie gets to know Daniel better—until Gabriel is kidnapped, and Sylvie starts to wonder if Daniel is telling the truth about his family. And then there’s Mick, the geeky guy who has a major crush on Sylvie. Why does life have to be so complicated? And how can such a pretty village hide such dangerous secrets? Sylvie will need all the skills of the mysterious Houdini—and the blessing of the angels—to see her friends and family again.",
