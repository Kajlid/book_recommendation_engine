  "title": "Restoration, Book Two: \"Autrefois\"",
  "description": "Stunned by a tragic loss, young Chris and his friends at the Center for Restoration, a refuge created for victims of societyâ€™s hyper-religious and patriarchal abuses, struggle to make sense of a world suddenly filled with pain. As They each cope in their own ways, Chris receives a precious gift from the past, which leads him on a voyage of discovery, deepening his knowledge of both the Center and the life of the man he loves. Filled with unforgettable characters and exciting adventure, the complex narrative of RESTORATION, Book Two weaves together the present and the past to illuminate a possible path of hope and promise for the future. The RESTORATION series presents the explosive story of Americans caught up in the on-going culture war between the humanist principles of the Enlightenment on one side, and the dark intertwined forces of Christofascism and racism on the other.",
