  "description": "Synopsis \"For anyone interested even faintly in good horror writing, what we have here is pure Lovecraft's own selection of the best the genre has to offer, along with his comments on the individual stories. Talk about the horse's mouth! This book is long overdue.\" - Peter Straub \"Lovecraft opened the way for me, as he had done for others before me -- Robert Bloch, Fritz Leiber, and Ray Bradbury among them. The reader would do well to remember that it is his shadow, so long and gaunt, and his eyes, so dark and puritanical, which overlie almost all of the important horror fiction that has come since.\" - Stephen King \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.\" - H.P. Lovecraft",
