  "description": "Juan Cabrillo and the Oregon crew's search for missing NASA technology leads to a globe-trotting adventure in this novel in the #1 New York Times-bestselling series. On December 7, 1941, five brothers exploring a shaft on a small island off the coast of Washington state make an exciting discovery, only to be interrupted by news of Pearl Harbor. In the present, Cabrillo, chasing the remnants of a crashed satellite in the Argentine jungle, makes a shocking discovery of his own. His search to untangle the mystery leads him first to that small island and its secret, and then much further back, to an ancient Chinese expedition, and a curse that seems to have survived for over five hundred years. If Cabrillo’s team is successful in its quest, the reward could be incalculable. If not...the only reward is death.",
