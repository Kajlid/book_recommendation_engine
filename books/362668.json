  "description": "Robert Christgau on James Brown: \"When he modulates to the bridge it's like the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters. After that he could describe his cars for three [LP] sides and get away with it.\" Christgau on Carly Simon: \"If a horse could sing in a monotone, the horse would sound like Carly Simon, only a horse wouldn't rhyme 'yacht,' 'apricot,' and 'gavotte.'\" Christgau on Van Morrison: \"This is a man who gets stoned on a drink of water and urges us to turn our radios all the way into the mystic. Visionary hooks his specialty.\" Christgau on Lou Reed: \"Reed Sounds like he's imitating his worst enemy, himself.\" (Lou Reed on Robert Christgau: \"What a moron! Studying rock and roll. I can't believe it!\") An indispensable book, Christgau's Rock Albums the '70s is the definitive guide to nearly 3,000 albums of the decade that brought us progressive rock, country rock, glam rock, funk, disco, punk, heavy metal, and new wave.",
