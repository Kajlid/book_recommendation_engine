  "description": "All know Dracula, king of the vampires. But how did he come to be this? How did a man, a warlord of an obscure province, rise to rule the Night? DRACULA ARISEN answers that question, showing the origin of Dracula, beginning with the young Prince Vlad, detailing his rebellion against the Sultan, and his reanimation as a creature of the Night—only to find himself a slave to the wizard who drew him forth. After turning the tables on his would-be master, Vlad Dracula strikes out to build his Empire of the Night. These fifteen stories lead up to the climactic events of Bram Stoker’s novel, “Dracula”... And beyond!Forget wimpy, apologetic vampires, afraid to draw blood. DRACULA ARISEN makes vampires scary again!",
