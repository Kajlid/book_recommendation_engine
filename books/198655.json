  "description": "Last Spring, Claire was framed for the murder of Junior, the Devil's oldest hellspawn. Last Summer, she reawakened the fourth realm, saved the world (after almost destroying it), and wound up with the worst job ever. Now, Claire's been locked out of her realm, given an assistant that doesn't actually assist, and told to handle a small problem in Underworld that might just get her killed. And to top it all off, Mab's made one of the contenders her untouchable. So, yeah, you could say Claire's having one of those days. Follow more of Claire's adventures in Dark Forsaken, book 3 of the Devil's Assistant Series, to find out if Claire can defeat the latest contender, survive the quads, and replace the curator before Harry figures out she's stolen his blood.",
