  "description": "\"Poetry is the journal of the sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air.\" Carl Sandburg's quote captures the transcendence one feels when expressing a poem. Each of these poems was lovingly selected from a lifetime of attempts at flight. The observations and reflections are imaginative expressions of the myriad experiences encountered on life's journey. They resonate with the gamut of human emotions, from love and anger to hope and passing, from breaking and healing to the wonder of being alive. There's humor too.You're invited to strap yourself in and enjoy the flight!",
