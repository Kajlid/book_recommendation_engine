  "description": "Time traveler April Colson is stuck reliving the same minute over and over again.It's 2021, and April has volunteered for a time travel experiment in which she gets to relive one minute of her life from 10 years ago. She would have happily relived any moment from the past in which her now-deceased wife is still alive, but the minute she gets to revisit is even sweeter than usual: it's a short moment of peace before the day of their wedding in 2011. However, when something goes wrong and the minute keeps repeating itself, April must find a way to break the cycle before the scientists pull the plug on the experiment and end her life.",
