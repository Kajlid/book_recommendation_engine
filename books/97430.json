  "description": "Escape. Tess has stolen $100,000 and two bricks of heroin from the owner of the go-go club she dances for in Rome. She asks her ex-boyfriend Kevin to fulfill the promise he once made to help her at any time and anywhere. Together they try to avoid being pursued around Europe, and they bend, twist, and crack under the pressure of chasing the feeling of freedom. Tess and Kevin succumb to the heroin as their only escape from the reality of being on the run as the boss of the club tracks them. They are never certain if they are getting closer or further away from their dreams of being free and if they will be able to get away.",
