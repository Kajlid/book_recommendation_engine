One is fascinated by things of the past, and the other haunted by a voice from the future.For Erin, the \"now\" she lives in is not all she'd like it to be. There are problems around her and problems within her that she cannot always understand. She is a loner until a young Egyptian boy, Seti, transfers to her school and befriends her. And in her own time, Irun has much the same feelings of discontent, and another Seti tries to understand.But there are other things that bind the girls--the same appearance, their relationships to their parents, and a cat called Ta-she. Perhaps the two girls are in some way the same person after all.Mary Stolz's haunting novel delves into the feelings of two young women, joined and yet separated by time and place, and into their relationships with thouse around them.",
