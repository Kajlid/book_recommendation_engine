  "description": "Alison Emerson has been fascinated by Jacob Grant from the first moment she saw him. Over the next twenty-one years that fascination took many shapes; from crush, to friendship, to something else she knew he must never know about. Now, at the age of twenty-seven, Allie has almost given up on love and marriage. No man has ever measured up to the picture she has in her head of everything she wants. A picture with Jake’s face. When Jacob Grant returns to his hometown after being gone for six years, he doesn’t expect life to be like it was before he left. He left town as the golden boy, and returns as the divorced dad of a five year old little girl. Jake came back to give his daughter the sense of family and community he had growing up. He never expected that the biggest surprise he would face was the friendship he begins to form with his neighbor and childhood friend Allie Emerson. As Allie and Jake become closer friends than they ever were before, Allie can’t help but wonder if Jake’s homecoming is just a cruel twist of fate or a second chance with “Her Unattainable Guy”.",
