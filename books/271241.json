  "description": "Raelyn Love knows she should be excited when her long-time friend Andrew begins hinting about asking her to marry him, but instead she finds herself dreading the moment. Then along comes handsome and daring Dave Channing, who is everything Andrew is not. Rae is sure she has finally found the man she was destined to marry. But has she? Sometimes when she's alone, she feels something missing. Something more vital than life itself. But what? If only she could remember. Her confusion has something to do with a pair of dark eyes that come to her in her dreams. Find me, help me, they silently plead. As Rae struggles to make sense of her emotions-and how torn she is between the two men in her life-the words of an apostle illuminate parts of her path. Maybe she's been searching for her future in the wrong direction. Maybe, just maybe, she did make a promise to someone long ago. A promise to help them find the gospel . . . and perhaps love. She vows to fulfill that promise now, even if she has to risk it all-never suspecting that her own happiness hangs in the balance. Can true love triumph again? In this first, never-before-published novel by best-selling author Rachel Ann Nunes, you'll discover a truly romantic story about eternal love-and promises that reach far beyond time.",
