Both Krisia and her mother, however, were left out from Schindler’s list after an uncle of theirs refused to pay the price for their freedom.Her unwavering silence kept the young girl alive.This is the tender, moving story of unconditional love from a son, the author, to his mother, offering an intimate look into the lives of people who had to deal with an abominable past while finding the necessary strength to move forward.",
