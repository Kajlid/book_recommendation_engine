  "title": "Battle in the Dawn: The Complete Hok the Mighty",
  "description": "In the 1930s, a very unusual tale appeared in the influential Amazing Stories magazine. Unlike the usual yarns of robots and interstellar travel, 'Battle in the Dawn' featured the brutal exploits of Hok, humanity first hero. Written by Pulitzer Prize-nominee Manly Wade Wellman (Who Fears the Devil?), who would later achieve fame for his American folktales of Silver John and beat out William Faulkner for a prestigious writing award, this hit story spawned several additional adventures, in which Hok battles unrelenting cavemen, explores lost Atlantis, discovers new technology, and charts a new destiny for humanity.Now, for the first time ever, Planet Stories presents a complete authorized collection of all of Wellman's rare Hok the Mighty tales, including an unfinished story fragment and a brand-new introduction by Wellman's longtime friend, fantasy author David Drake.",
