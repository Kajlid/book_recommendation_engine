  "description": "“This story held my heart from the beginning.” Edward Stubbins has never known kindness. Orphaned in post-war England, he is sent to Australia at age ten, where cruelty and rejection define his youth.Against all odds, Edward carves out a life for himself—until love, the one thing he dares to believe in, is ripped away. From that moment on, he vows never to love again… and dies a bitter man.But death is not the end. Edward is offered a seemingly impossible chance—to live again. Another life, another fate.This time, he’s not in control—just a passenger in a life both eerily familiar and unexpectedly different. The man he becomes treads a path that echoes Edward’s own painful past, yet glimmers with traces of hope.Then fate takes a cruel turn.Is he doomed to relive the suffering he once endured, or is there something more at play—something that could change everything?\nOne More Life to Live\n is a gripping tale of fate, redemption, and the possibility that the universe is far more merciful than it seems.",
