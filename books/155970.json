  "description": "Despite having a loving fiance, Kate Edwards is haunted by a feeling that something is missing in her life. After losing her job as a reporter, a sense of inspiration is ignited by an invitation to spend the weekend with Emma Daines, a retired professor of social anthropology and the former US ambassador to Germany. Kate has long admired Emma's accomplishments and for years has attempted to obtain an interview.

A thoroughly mesmerizing novel, The Invitation takes us to a beach community in Northern California, where through a series of outdoor adventures Kate struggles with her internal conflicts over love, ambition, and her need to gain Emma's trust. Little does she know how her life will change when she stumbles upon Emma's hidden memoir which exposes the underbelly of her determination, her relationships, and brings to light the walls that keep us separated from one another. This riveting, insightful, and unpredictable story brings us into the heart of two women who ultimately learn from each other what's important in life and the real and powerful meaning behind receiving The Invitation.",
