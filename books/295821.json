  "description": "In late 2004, Vivian Chong’s life was changed forever when a rare skin disease, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), left her with scar tissue that would eventually blind her. As she was losing her sight, she put down as many drawings on paper as she could to document the experience. In Dancing After TEN, Chong teams up with cartoonist Georgia Webber—whose graphic autobiography, Dumb, chronicled her own disability—to trace her journey out of the darkness and into the spotlight.",
