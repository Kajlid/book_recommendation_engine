  "description": "ONE NIGHT, AT THE END OF AN ALLEY, ROSE MARGOLIN'S WORLD CHANGES FOREVER, AS IF EVERYTHING SHE'S EVER KNOWN AND TRUSTED WERE PULLED LIKE A RUG FROM BENEATH HER FEET.Everyone sees Isador for the dreamer he is, a talker, and ambitious to a fault—everyone that is except for Rose. She's head-over-heels in love and determined to follow Isador wherever he leads, never imagining she'll one day find herself face-to-face across a table from the boss of one of the 1920s era mobs and seeking help in the most unlikely places, from Jacob Moll a young neighbor and Samuel Bloom, better known as Earl the Ear—one of the mob's most feared leg-breakers.The Revere, Massachusetts setting for Rona Simmons' touching second novel is no accident. The beach at Revere, once known as \"America's Beach\", hosted Wonderland Park, an extravagant amusement park some consider a precursor to Disneyland. It was unlike any other seen before but proved to be unsustainable, its founders' dreams dashed and their finances depleted, the park vanished, leaving behind only memories and postcards.",
