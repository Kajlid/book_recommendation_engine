  "description": "If he can make room in his life and his heart, an isolated medieval history professor might find a real life knight in shining armor.  A terrible breakup in his early thirties left David shying away from relationships. For years he’s been content with his solitary life, finding fulfillment in his career, books, television show marathons, and his cat’s companionship. When David meets his neighbor Zach, he can’t tell if Zach is just being friendly or if the handsome fireman might actually be interested in him. The more time they spend together, though, the more David questions his resolution to remain single. If Zach can extinguish the flames left by David's past, David might finally break away from his structured life and take a chance on love.  A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2015 Daily Dose package \"Never Too Late.\"",
