  "description": "“I guess it was inevitable – the end of the world we know – the end of humanity. Finding out early was a gift, surviving impact night was a miracle, living to tell the tale, well, that was the price I will pay, forever. There’s no going back now.” Award winning author*, Matt Pike, takes you on a journey to the end of the world and beyond, as told through the eyes of an Australian teenager, who records his experiences day by day in a survival diary. From the social chaos in suburban Adelaide in the lead-up, a night of total global catastrophe and the aftershocks as community and humanity crumble around him – the world changes forever. What’s left is a place where the conditions can kill you just as easily as the other survivors. Everything our teenager relied upon for survival in the pre-disaster world falls apart – utilities, community, environment – the only things that can keep him alive are his resources and resourcefulness. *2013 Global Ebook Awards: Gold Medal – Teen Literature Fiction for Kings of the World",
