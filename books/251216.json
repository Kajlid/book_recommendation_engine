Aster Night always gets her man. Except when it comes to...literally getting a man. Thanks to a curse placed on the Chastity coven centuries ago, she can't get busy with anyone until she marries a man from the sanctimonious, boring, holier-than-thou Koda coven.  Yeah, no thanks. Instead, she finds a way out of the curse on her own, breaking it with such a bang that she ends up naked with one sexy as sin man and making some major emotional and physical connections with his two, oh-so-alpha clan brothers. Her love life is looking up, until she's hired to track down a serial killer preying on witches, and learns her three new boyfriends were once romantically involved with one of the victims. Now, she has to choose--her heart or her career. Yes, Rake makes her laugh, Finn makes her knees weak, and Damon makes her feel safe in a way she never has before, but these men are too close to her case. So close she's afraid one of them might become a killer's next victim...  *This WHITE HOT reverse harem paranormal romance series is intended for readers 18 and over. This is a true reverse harem featuring one woman and her three fated mates. M/M/F/M*",
