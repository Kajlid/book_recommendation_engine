  "title": "Egyptus: And Ham, Son of Noah",
  "description": "In a fantasy tale springing from the familiar world of Noah’s Ark, young sweethearts Egyptus and Ham encounter people and creatures who both help and hinder their journey. They must rely on their courage, and persistence to get them to the Ark in time. This is a genre-blend book combining adventure, romance, and fantasy. Its fast-paced journey appeals to a wide audience from children to adults of various backgrounds. It is on the same tone and reading level as “The Hobbit,” but with a more familiar environment. Watch out for the rabbits -- so far they’ve stolen everyone’s heart. You will enjoy meeting the characters in this positive tale, which shows that goodness and loyalty can exist in all races and ages, and even in animals. This genre-blended romantic, Noah's Ark fantasy will please readers looking for something fresh and uplifting. Book contains a map and chapter illustrations. This book is also available in a children's / read-aloud edition and e-book.",
