  "title": "Future Bright, Future Grimm: Transhumanist Tales for Mother Nature’s Offspring",
  "description": "Magic matters to people. Fairy tales matter. They’re all coming true.Transhumanism – the rising global movement to supercharge human evolution with radical tech – heralds body- and mind-bending personal transformation. Yet it feels curiously familiar, like the dizzying fears and fantasies we probed in Germanic folklore as children.Future Bright, Future Grimm draws upon the odd, abrupt, often violent tales of the Brothers Grimm to summon transhumanist tomorrows of astounding grace and danger. The adventurers, magicians and monsters who lurk here are we and our mind-children – amplified, augmented, immortalised in rebooted fables with the edgiest of twists.This is magical realism inspired by the transfiguring technological sorcery that our species seems driven to conjure. Where the improbability of traditional fantasy meets the wildest possibilities of modern science and the coming ‘Singularity’.Open doors – some dazzling, some dystopian – to enchanted mindscapes, unhinged. A storybook for changelings, whose humble once-upon-a-times now spell truly outlandish ever-afters.",
