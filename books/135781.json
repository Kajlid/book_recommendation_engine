  "title": "Alphonse Mucha",
  "description": "Generally agreed to be one of the most important contributors to Art Nouveau, the Czech artist Alphonse Mucha was trained, celebrated and lived most of his life in Paris. His unforgettably iconic images of Sarah Bernhardt and others embody the spirit of the fin de si√®cle. But underneath his successful career as an artist and poster designer lay a passionate Slav nationalist whose most important and long neglected works are still being painstakingly restored and exhibited in the Czech republic. This book is the first comprehensive overview of his life and work and is published in association with the Mucha Museum in Prague.",
