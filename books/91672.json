  "description": "“My father used to call you the Society of takers and killers. I'm just glad he's dead now, because the poor guy didn't have to know how right he was.” David Lass is a boy who has lived his whole life pretending that he's ordinary. And his whole life, nobody ever noticed him. After all, it's not like there's anything remarkable about David. He looked so ordinary, nobody ever spared him a second glance.Truth is, he's a Nomad. A time-traveller, not that he'd tell anyone about that. He can't tell anyone his secret. His father made a mistake by trusting a vampire, and that mistake had cost him his life. Søren Lass was killed by the Society, an organization of supernatural creatures that hunted his kind.But there's more about the Society than David's father told him, and David soon finds himself involved in an age-old war between supernaturals. Boundaries are crossed, loves and lives are lost, and the lines between good and evil blur in this ancient war for power.",
