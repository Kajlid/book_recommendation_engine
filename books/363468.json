  "description": "\"WHAT SF SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT.\" -- Kliatt Rob Merlin was the best engineer who had ever lived. That was why \"The King of Space\" had to have him for the most spectacular construction project ever -- even though Rob was a potentially fatal threat to his power... Thus begins a breakthrough novel by the former President of the American Astronautical Society, about an idea whose time has a shimmering bridge between Earth and space that mankind will climb to the stars! Sound like fantasy? The concept has been in the literature of physics for over three decades, but only a writer with the scientific background of a Sheffield or a Clarke could bring the idea to life.",
