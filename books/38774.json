  "title": "In the Days of Victorio; Recollections of a Warm Springs Apache",
  "description": "\"Chief Victorio of the Warm Springs Apache has recounted the turbulent life of his people between 1876 and 1886. This eyewitness account . . . recalls not only the hunger, pursuit, and strife of those years, but also the thoughts, feelings, and culture of the hunted tribe. Recommended as general reading.\"— Library Journal\"This volume contains a great deal of interesting information.\"— Journal of the West\"The Apache point of view [is] presented with great clarity.\"— Books of the Southwest\"A valuable addition to the southwestern frontier shelf and long will be drawn upon and used.\"— Journal of Arizona History\"A genuine contribution to the story of the Apache wars, and a very readable book as well.\"— Westerners Brand Book\"Shining through every page is the unquenchable spirit that was the Apache. Inured, indeed trained, to suffering, Apaches stood strong beside Victorio, Nana, and finally Geronimo in a vain attempt to maintain those things they held more dear than life itself—freedom, homeland, dignity as human beings. A warm and vital people, the Apaches had, and have, a great deal to offer.\"— Arizona and the West",
