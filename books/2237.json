  "description": "Charming, poignant and absurdly funny, (S)MYTHOLOGY is a contemporary fairy-tale that whisks you on a wild adventure from the streets of London to the far reaches of the globeâ€•from haunted islands to African villages, from the peaks of the Alps to the depths of the Underworld. Twenty-one year old Sophie has spent her entire life in virtual seclusion in a London flat fearful that should she venture out into the world the curse that was placed on her as an infant would turn friends and lovers into stone (marble, to be exact) just by merely looking at her. But when events beyond her control drive her onto the streets of London, she must combat her fears and battle the forces that have kept her hidden away since childhood. Told with tongue-in-cheek wit and wry whimsy by Jeremy Tarr in his debut novel, and with sixty-four illustrations by Katy Smail, (S)MYTHOLOGY is about the mythology of love and the fairy-tale of life and death.",
