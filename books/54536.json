  "description": "Los Angeles, a few years from now. Technology has changed the rules of the movie business with old, long-dead stars brought digitally back to life. Billboards cover every available surface of the city, beaming out a constant flood of commercials starring the likes of John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe, and--the great exception, the last \"real\" movie star--Colt Reston. But something is going wrong: A group of anti-tech rebels are attacking the billboards, inspired by a mysterious manifesto known as \"The Black Book.\" A burnt out screenwriter addicted to the latest hot drug finds his world wobbling. Colt takes ill with an unexplained disease--perhaps literally dying of overexposure. A guru who might know why has vanished. And then Montgomery Clift suddenly walks off his virtual set and goes AWOL.... A blistering mash-up of William Gibson, The Ring, and Chuck Palahniuk, EXPOSURE is a great step forward for Kurt Wenzel. Convulsive and thrilling, EXPOSURE is adevastating tour de force by one of the best novelists working today.",
