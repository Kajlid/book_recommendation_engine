  "description": "Candle in the Mirror tells of an adopted person making a long journey to seek her heritage. Erin was adopted through an agency but resided in a convent, described as a mother-and-baby home, run by Good Shepherd nuns. Erin loved, and had a good relationship, with her adoptive parents but not one which allowed her to share with them her need to know more about her past. The subject was taboo since her childhood. For an adoptee to search for their biological family is not showing disrespect to their adoptive family. Often it is major life events which prompts a search for roots and culture and in Erin's case it was the birth of her children. The results of her search are fascinating and become profoundly disturbing to her, resulting in her needing to travel to Ireland to learn more. It soon becomes clear there is to be no reunion with her biological mother. In the 1950's and 1960's influences deeply rooted in religion and society prevailed. She resorts to furtive means to uncover more information resulting in many fascinating encounters and friendships. Each of these contributes a strand of resolution for her as an adult. This book is a compelling read, exposing a little-explored aspect of our social history, piercing the aura of secrecy which still prevails today around adoption.",
