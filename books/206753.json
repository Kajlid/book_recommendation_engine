  "title": "Josiah's Love and Justice Volume I: Four Slaves",
  "description": "Josiah Bailey is a successful attorney married to Molly, a physician specializing in sports medicine. But that’s what they do to earn their livings, but not quite what they are in deeper places within. Josiah has found a rather unique niche for himself and his interests in BDSM. He works as a beadle, paid to punish and train slaves belonging to others, whose owners have difficulty doing so. He also owns an old horse farm, where he taps into the competitive spirit of other doms and masters with rickshaw races held on occasion. But an unrelated chain of events meet and intertwine, and in time he finds himself owner of several amazing women, a flurry of remarkable and devoted slaves, loving him and loving being under his power.   Contains scenes of intense S&M activities including rough sex, bondage, and corporal punishment. May be too intense for some readers. If you find such subject matter upsetting, read with discretion or not at all. BDSM isn’t for everyone and should only be practiced by those giving knowing consent with completely trusted and experienced partners. The author is not responsible for the conduct of those reading this book.",
