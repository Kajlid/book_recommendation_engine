  "description": "Juliette Brewer can’t face the truth, Ash Gordon can’t bear another lie, A passion for surfing brings them together, But will the sea and all its sorrows tear them apart?“There’s something about me you need to know—something I’m not sure I can tell you.”Juliette Brewer has always been different. From the age of four, she’s endured frequent premonitions of tragedy, but the one thing she never saw coming was the thing that would send her under. When she catches the ocean-coloured eyes of surf-lifesaving heartthrob Ash Gordon, Juliette’s life changes for the better … until a tragic accident destroys their dreams. Everyone else has given up, moved on, and put Ash's loss behind them, but Juliette can’t—and perhaps she shouldn’t. Not all who are missing are lost, but if she refuses to accept reality, will the sea claim her sanity as well as her lover’s life?",
