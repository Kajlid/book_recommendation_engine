While the others talked, she quietly retreated to the shadows to think… and to cry.READ WONDERLAND Today available as ebook and Miss Madson weaves an interesting story in an intricate and deep world. This is a page-turner and definitely worth adding to your collection. Of particular note is her powerful tale of The Lover's Curse which gives the story a heroic and tragic feel that I truly enjoyed. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy adventure or who is looking for an original approach to a classic mythological theme. Bravo!",
