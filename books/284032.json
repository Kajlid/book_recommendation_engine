  "description": "What if I took you along on a visit back to my childhood in Worthington, Minnesota? What if I made the places and people from my past come alive? You won’t want to miss this chance to be part of the stories and adventures that await in this book. Become part of the sights and sounds of a lively prairie town that have largely faded from view and yet I may succeed not only in transporting you there but in vividly recreating the many adventures of my childhood. If you grew up in Worthington, you’ll see many familiar places, recognize many familiar faces and relive many familiar events. If you’ve never been to Worthington, you’ll be captivated by a lively community where children enjoyed their freedom and much of our modern world was only just emerging. As an added bonus, there are five fictional short stories included, all set in Worthington and some involving the me and my childhood companions.",
