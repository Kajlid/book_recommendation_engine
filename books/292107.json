  "description": "Tully -  If he thinks he can just show up on my doorstep after four long years of radio silence, then he’s got another thing coming. Tully Cage does not bow down for anyone; especially ghosts from the past who insist on crashing back into my life and causing all sorts of havoc. My heart can’t take it. That boy put me through hell and back, and to be honest, I don’t think I ever fully recovered. But now…he’s no longer a boy and that hold he used to have over me? Damn it, it’s stronger than ever. Being with Rivers is like climbing aboard the Titanic; a sure-fire way of things ending in tragedy. I won’t put myself through it again even if my heart is screaming at me to give it one last shot. Samuel Rivers…he never should have come back.   Rivers -  I’m back and this time, I’m not letting her go. She better prepare herself because this man has been starved of her love for way too long and now that I’ve seen her, there’s no going back. Tully Cage is mine. Always has been and always will be. I’ve been at war and come face to face with my enemy, but convincing Tully that I’m not going to hurt her and somehow earn her forgiveness is going to be the hardest thing I’ll ever do. Failing is not an option. Not when it comes to her. No matter how long it takes or how many times she shoots me down; I’m going to marry that girl.",
