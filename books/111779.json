  "description": "Meet Ethan...he's a self proclaimed slut hitchhiking across country from New York on his way to San Francisco. He stops in a small town in New Mexico and gets a job at a tavern called Honky Tonk without really wanting it. The owner of the tavern is a hulking man named Hunter Westmore and Ethan does everything he can to get the man's attention and once he does his dirtiest dreams come true. Hunter is a cowboy and owns a ranch as well as the tavern. When he meets the city kid who came into the tavern he didn't know what hit him. He'd never felt the way Ethan made him feel and he tried to ignore the younger man but no one could ignore Ethan. Once he finally gives in they start a discovery of what makes them both tick, and what they both love is when Hunter takes a strong hand to Ethan and gives him his collar. Can their darkly seductive love last or will their kinks tear them apart?",
