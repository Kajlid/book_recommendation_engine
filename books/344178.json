  "description": "From his dark tower in the far north, the Silent King sends forth his foul armies. His minions are quickly spreading throughout the lands of Midralon, bringing fear and terror. His dark magic is powerful and his armies mighty, but the Silent King has one weakness. According to an ancient prophecy, one simple word can defeat the evil tyrant, but no one knows this word and the Silent King slays any who dare to speak in his presence! None of this matters to Emily; she doesn't know how she ended up in this strange land along with her sister and two brothers. Her only desire is to get her family safely back home to their own world. There is just one problem: it appears her only way back will lead to an encounter with the sinister Silent King himself! Join Emily as she adventures in the enchanting land of Midralon!",
