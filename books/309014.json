  "description": "TyresI’ve been through shit in my life, both literally and figuratively, but as the VP of the Inferno’s Clutch MC I signed up for it. The one person who didn’t sign up for it is my darling little girl, Wren.It’s just her, me, and the club. For a kid her age she’s been through it too, especially considering she was kidnapped not too long ago. Finding out about her made me change a lot. I’m no longer the reckless SOB who’d pull out his gun without even thinking. Now I’m calculating, knowing at the end of the day I have to get back home to her. But hell, being a single dad isn’t easy. I get as much help from the club as I can, but sometimes it’s just too much. Tiny recommends I get some help, ‘cause Wren can’t keep sleeping in my bed at the club so I tell her I’ll think about it. Never did I anticipate the woman would take it upon herself to hire a nanny for me, and she’s a vision.I know I’m asking for trouble . . . but I don’t give a flying fuck.",
