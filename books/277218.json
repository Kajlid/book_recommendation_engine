Thanks to their dad, he and his twin brother, Jordan, are kings on the court. But Josh has more than basketball in his blood â€“ he's got mad beats, too, which help him find his rhythm when it's all on the line.See the Bell family in a whole new light through Dawud Anyabwile's dynamic illustrations as the brothers' winning season unfolds, and the world as they know it begins to change.",
