  "description": "Fans of short fiction will love Christmas Stories. Each tale in author Kevin Moore’s debut collection celebrates the hope, magic, and memories so central to the true meaning of Christmas. Celebrate the season of miracles with this collection of short stories about the lives of ordinary people and the lessons they learn during an extraordinary time of year. You’ll meet a young boy who reevaluates his perceptions after he’s forced to spend Christmas with his stern grandfather, an attorney who seemingly has everything but really has very little; a burned-out homecoming queen who grows weary of her own excuses for failure; and many other memorable characters. As Moore’s protagonists face adversity and sadness, they learn important lessons, gain hope, and experience powerful transformations. The perfect length for reading before bed, on your daily commute, or during a quiet hour, these tales offer you the opportunity to step away from your own life and into a world where it’s always Christmas and where—despite the often painful realities of life—there is always a lesson to learn and a reason to celebrate.",
