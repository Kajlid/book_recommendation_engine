  "description": "Fifth grade English teacher, Kendra Wright, doesn't believe in instant love. In fact, at twenty-nine, she's all but given up hope of ever finding love, period. That is, until she meets the new principal, Valerian Riche.  He may be stunning, gentlemanly and honorable, but falling for the man is the last thing on Kendra's agenda. But when Val makes the first move, Kendra's life as the youngest spinster to ever grace the pages of history is turned upside-down.  She's longed to be treated like the lady she knows she is, but \"technically,\" is not. But if the truth comes out, it will destroy her career and end the wildest romantic ride she's ever known.  Kendra must end the relationship before she's in too deep. Before the truth is revealed. But, how does a lady say no to the charm-charged wiles of a man as determined, and eager, as Val Riche? While she anticipates the horror of breaking the news, he persists on making her decision as difficult as possible. Maybe Val should've checked Kendra's package before he unchecked his heart.
