The bully says the dragon is too big, tall and green to play knights. Suddenly, playtime is spoiled. The girl stands up for the dragon, but the other bystanders let the bully do as he pleases. It's time for a petition to the king! After a roundtable discussion, the bully comes to accept that everyone has a right to play -- no matter how big, tall or green they are! This winning combination of adventure and information provides the perfect starting point for discussions about bullying. The Tale of Sir Dealing with Bullies for Kids (and Dragons) offers a constructive approach to an important subject.",
