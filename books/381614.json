  "description": "What happens when the man you left suddenly becomes the man you need? Richard and Dave have a past together, but back then they couldn't give each other what they needed. They were too young, too unsure. When they meet again, it's both awkward and wonderful. Richard is far more confident now, and he knows he can be the sort of lover Dave requires. He's learned a lot over the years, letting his own insecurities go. Which means he can take on Dave's. Dave has some secrets that might blow up in their faces, though, including a man whose obsession leads to danger and heartache. He retreats into his music, trying to keep Richard safe from his demons, but Richard won't let him hide. Not anymore. Richard is determined to prove that Dave is a wonderful man, and one worthy of love. When violence and fear threaten to tear them apart, Dave has to learn to trust Richard to protect him, and Richard has to believe that Dave will trust him. They have to learn to work together to make their own life, one that leaves the past behind. Can these two blend music and metal into something beautiful?",
