Frankl held a series of public lectures in Vienna. The psychologist, who was to become world famous, explained his central thoughts on meaning, resilience and the importance of embracing life even in the face of great adversity.Published for the very first time, Frankl's words resonate as strongly today as they did in 1946. He offers an insightful exploration of the maxim 'Live as if you were living for the second time', and unfolds his basic conviction that every crisis also includes an opportunity. Despite the unspeakable horrors in the camp, Frankl learnt from his fellow inmates that it is always possible to say 'YES TO LIFE' - a profound and timeless lesson for us all.RUNNING TIME ⇒ 3hrs. and 4mins.©2020 Viktor E.
