  "description": "Dylan Perry is an odd type of hypochondriac.He would rather arrange his own suicide by a hired hit man than bravely battle a cancer diagnosis.Yet such is the nature of hapless Dylan’s obstacle-strewn life that a sudden change of heart over this sub-contract with death can’t stop the would-be paid assassin from trying to seal the deal.In a mad-cap chase, Dylan is forced to dodge his deadly pursuer by car, train, plane and even tandem-bike, embroiling him ever more deeply into a complex web of colourful characters, geo-political intrigue and the dark machinations of international intelligence agencies, not to mention local residents’ associations, neighbourhood watch officers and community choirs.Can he evade the clutches of all those who want to see the back of him - and escape with whatever sanity he actually possesses intact?",
