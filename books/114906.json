  "description": "In Canterbury, as the virus rages out of control, one troop of Royal Marine Commandos fights a 360-degree battle for survival, racing to rescue the Channel Tunnel survivors from a relentless siege – before Hellfire missile strikes and carpet bombing kill anyone left alive.Across the Atlantic, the crew of the John F. Kennedy risks a catastrophic reactor meltdown to get out of the path of a ten-mile-wide tide of the dead; while, onshore at the Naval Air Base, Wesley's tiny team maintains a lonely vigil – which turns horrifyingly dangerous as the edge of the storm hits, pushing desperate civilians ahead of it.In the air above, Gunnery Sergeant Fick leads a hand-picked fire-team of spec-ops Marines halfway across North America to take and defend an airfield on a remote island – but learns to his cost that it is a place with a terrible history, and very dangerous secrets.Finally, out on Lake Michigan, Alpha team races toward extraction… but first must fight their most harrowing battle yet – this time against the living, who are both more treacherous and a hell of a lot better armed than the dead.",
