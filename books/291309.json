  "description": "A vampire, a shifter, an incubus, and an asshole elemental walk into a bar. Sounds like the beginning of a joke, right? Unfortunately for me, it's not. These guys are looking for a missing magical amulet and think I can help them find it.  As a librarian by day and magical version of Indiana Jones by night, it's not unheard of for me to take private contract jobs. The thing is I like to work alone, it's easier to protect my secrets that way.  They're insisting I need to be part of their team for this job and make me an offer I can't refuse. It also doesn't hurt that they're each dangerously sexy.  But when everything in my life starts to go sideways, I have serious second thoughts about this whole thing. Can I survive secrets, betrayal, and uncovered prophecies that change everything I thought I ever knew? Will this team still have my back when life as I knew it shatters around me and the truth is finally revealed?  I'm about to find out.",
