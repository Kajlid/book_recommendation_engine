  "description": "Heir to Victoria’s leading gold rush museum, Jennifer Fraser is healthier than she’s been in years—and she’s ready to settle down. Since losing Tori, only one woman has been able to see through the formidable facade of nineteenth century drag Jen wears at Spring Creek each day. Forget the age gap—when what Jen has with her best friend Lacey is so comfortable, does it really matter that they’ll probably never have that ‘can’t-keep-my-hands-off-of-you’ kind of chemistry?Since the day Lacey Reed was cinched into her costume stays, working at Spring Creek living museum has made her happier than she ever thought she could be in small-town Beechworth. When Jen proposed the arrangement, it made sense—Jen adored Lacey’s seven-year-old daughter, and the life Jen offered was more than Lacey could ever have dreamed. And then there was that other minor detail: she’s carried a torch for Jen for eight agonising years. Lacey just presumed that, four months into their engagement, Jen wouldn’t be so completely oblivious to the fact that she set Lacey’s heart twitching in her chest each time she so much as stepped into the same room.Just when it seems as though all the chemistry exercises can’t change the way Jen feels about Lacey, a ghost from the past arrives in Beechworth, and suddenly, what once seemed like a simple arrangement becomes more complicated than they ever imagined.Genre: RomanceEditor: Cath WalkerCover Designer: Heather Honeywell",
