  "description": "It's the worst feeling in the world, seeing him with someone else. There's nothing I wouldn't do, no limits I won't go to get him back. But he won't give me a chance. He won't so much as look at me because he thinks I don't belong to him anymore.But that's the whole thing.I don't belong anywhere. Doesn't matter where I go or who I am with I am always alone. There is something wrong with me, there has to be because no one else seems quite as miserable at being without a master. But don't we all owe our freedom to something? People are slaves, aren't they? To their jobs, to their partners, to their children, even to their lifestyles? We all have those little kinks that we don't tell anyone about, because we think we're going to be judged for them, and because we're slaves to society's rules. In a world where slavery is the norm I'm a slave to my needs. To him. And I need to get him back.WARNINGS: HARDCORE BDSM, DUB-CON, NON-CON",
