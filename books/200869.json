  "description": "Ethan Chase isn't interested in dating. After losing the woman he loved more than life itself, he'd much rather ride solo, but his family is dead set on fixing him up. To get them off his back, he hooks up with ultra-adventurous, ultra-temporary adventure photographer, Rue Campbell. All he has to do is survive three weeks in her orbit and he'll be single again, only without the pitying looks and pressure to move on.Rue is literally counting the days until her plane leaves New York City. The last thing she wants is a relationship, but being Ethan's pretend girlfriend can't hurt, right? Wrong. With Ethan, there's no faking anythingâ€”in or out of the bedroom. With the sheets burning hot and the clock ticking on their arrangement, Rue realizes she's falling for a man guaranteed to derail her goals...and break her heart.",
