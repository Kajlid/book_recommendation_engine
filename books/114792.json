  "title": "Empty Cradle: Shiloh in the Circle",
  "description": "Shiloh is a star, a headlining performer with Gallamore's Traveling Extravaganza. She's afforded luxuries that aren't often seen in the communities and walled cities that pepper what was once North America, and as such she's largely isolated from the dangers of life \"out in the dirt.\" Embroiled in circus politics and in denial of her shapeshifter heritage, Shiloh's about to discover that the enigmatic queen of the felids wants an audience with her--and it's not a request. Soon she finds that a scavenger named Ivy and a persistent shifter named Kissel may be all that stands between her and a diva's worst fear--disappearing without a trace.",
