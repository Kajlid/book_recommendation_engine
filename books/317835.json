A life of pain and abuse I never thought I’d escape.I’m still not convinced I have.When friendly Santa-figure turned trucker, Al, finds me at a rest stop and offers me a job at his idyllic farm in small-town Nebraska, the picturesque family life is more than I could hope for.And his youngest son, Kyle, is a dream romance that I don’t deserve.But no dream lasts.
