And that, my friends, is how it is with love.\" --Edward MonktonMr. Darcy and Miss Bennett. Ozzie and Harriet. Jay-Z and Beyonce. Great couples often find togetherness by embracing their individual differences. In this modern-day fable, Edward Monkton pens an irresistible love story about a fiercely funny but distant Dinosaur who falls in love with a forgetful but free-spirited (and shopping-savvy) Lovely Other Dinosaur.* Monkton, perhaps better known as the U.K.'s top-selling living poet Giles Andreae* This ode to love pairs Monkton's signature illustrations with simple yet profound prose.",
