  "description": "A healing touch. A hideous face. A looming curse.  As the ugly twin to a perfect sister, Princess Laidra lives her life in the shadows—until her parents offer her as bait for a giant serpent.  Her escape attempt leaves her shipwrecked on a secluded island with only one inhabitant: Prince Calen, who lives under a curse. If anyone looks upon him, he turns into a giant serpent. Speaking to him in the darkness, Laidra sees past the monster to Calen’s lonely soul, and she determines to free him from the magic’s hold.  But if Laidra can’t break the curse in time, Calen will become a mindless creature of scales and fangs forever.  A YA mythology/romance that retells the myth of Eros and Psyche with adventure, magic, and true love.",
