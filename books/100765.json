When by misadventure she meets the sexiest Cypriot alive, she succumbs to her deepest fantasy. Not even her fantasy does justice to the reality of the hard bodied Andreas Katsakis who makes her explode and then some.In true Cinderellaesque fashion she flees leaving a signature design piece behind. Virtually an unknown designer, Andreas’ attempts to locate the missing half of his soul end in frustration. With a bit of ‘Fairy Godmother’ style manipulation, his three sisters bring the lovers back together. However getting the happily ever after he desires is doomed to failure until Andreas convinces Cass he will love her far longer than only one night.",
