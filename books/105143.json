  "description": "Untouched By Human Hands... ...are the stacks of boxes confronting two starving explorers on an alien world. Some of their contents are digestible--and some of them are hungry!...are the \"surplus female\" pens of a distant planet--where wife killing is required by law, and mendacity is an act worse than death....is the Altar of Baz-Matain--until it appears in New Jersey, just north of Hoboken....is filled with fear, surprise, ruthless humor and an almost fanatical devotion to delight, as Robert Sheckley, the greatest science-fantasy writer of recent years, reaches out his hands to you.",
