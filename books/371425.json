  "title": "Derivation Incognita: A Comprehensive Study into the Peopling of America",
  "description": "Once you read Derivation Incognita, you will never look at another world map or history book quite the same! The work is a serious in-depth history, which analyzes, cross-references and when possible correlates each and every migration, exploration, and visitation that occurred on the American continents prior to the Spanish arrival. This book represents the culmination of more than 20 years of research, laid out in a succinct and cohesive volume, complete with analytically precise facts and confirmed physical evidence; arranged chronologically, beginning with the earliest records available.The author has left no stone unturned in this exhaustive monograph. The annotations you will read in Derivation Incognita are all the result of the author's investigation and scrutinization of a myriad of ancient and contemporary works and evidences, when possible, in their original context or circumstance.",
