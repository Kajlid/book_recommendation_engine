  "description": "Aspen Montgomery was nine years old when she befriended Camden Priest—a boy with dead eyes and dark urges. Since that day, they’d been inseparable. She hadn’t expected to later develop a major crush on him. Or expected that the crush would fail to pass. Or ever thought that she’d grow to wish that she could one day claim him as her mate. It’s never going to happen. She knows that. To him, she’s a friend, nothing more. So it’s time to make some changes to establish some better boundaries. Which would be a hell of a lot easier if he didn’t fight her on it.There is only one person in the world who Camden Priest gives a damn about—Aspen. She’s his best friend, his anchor, his conscience, the very reason he’s sane. There’s only one secret he ever kept from her…he wants more than friendship. Knowing she doesn’t feel the same, he put a chokehold on his need for her. But when some asshole claims to be Aspen’s true mate and danger starts closing in on her, Camden’s control becomes precarious and platonic lines are crossed. He knows what he should do—leave it at a one-night stand to protect their friendship. He’s just not so sure he can.",
