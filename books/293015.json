Homes as one of the most provacative and daring writers of her generation.Here you'll find the cult classic.\"A Real Doll,\" the tale of a teenage boy's erotic obsession with his sister's Barbie doll; \"Adults Alone,\" which first introduced Paul and Elaine, the crack-smoking yuppie couple whose marriage careens out of control in Home's novel Music for Torching; and \"Looking for Johnny,\" in which a kidnapped boy, having failed his abductors expectations, is returned home. Brilliantly concieved, sharply etched, and exceptionally satisfying, these stories explore the American dream in ways you're not likely soon to forget.Working in Kodacolor hues, Homes offers an uncanny picture of a surreal suburbia -- outrageous and utterly believable.",
