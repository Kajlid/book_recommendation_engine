  "description": "DINAH  When my husband died, I never thought I would find love again.   I definitely didn’t think I would find it in the arms of my younger best friend. Why would the hunky hockey player want anything to do with me? I’m a stressed out writer with a lot of baggage. Any other man would say, “HARD PASS!”  But Noah was the best man I’ve ever known, and if it wasn’t for him, I might not be alive.  But am I ready to put my heart on the line again?  NOAH  I’ve pined for my best friend for so long, that my teammates issued an ultimatum.   “Make your move now or one of us will ask her out.”  They are just trying to push me, besides none of those jerks would ever be good enough for her. Makes me wonder if I even stand a chance.  Besides, what would a smart woman like her want with a dumb jock like me?  Get ready to meet the Philadelphia Bulldogs hockey team, in this all new-standalone novel. If you love sexy sports romances and friends-to-lovers with a HEA, this book is for you!
