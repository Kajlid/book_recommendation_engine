  "description": "Slow Blind Drive is a conversation with the dead. A letter to an unlikely muse and a testament to the resilience of unconditional love. All at once haunting and horrific, erotic and endearing, this is the story of what it means to grow up a girl, to find solace in addiction, to have everything and give it away. It's a raw and sentimental account that follows a childhood friendship as it thrives and suffers through an intimate love, drug addiction, mental illness and betrayal. This is a story whose characters stay with you long after you've turned the last pages.",
