  "description": "Mike Auburn dangles above the city of Chicago from the beams of a half-built skyscraper. He is seconds from plummeting towards the circuit board of buildings and streetlights below, but oblivion is not what he seeks it s the dead.  Obsessed with discovering evidence of the afterlife, Mike s death-defying stunts have brought him closer than ever to lifting the veil of reality, always just out of reach. However, his ventures to the edge have not gone unnoticed, and a tenebrous organization led by O'Neil seeks to recruit him to their own cause: preparing the city for impending Ragnarok, the end of the world as they know it.  Before long, a world ruled by scientific method and rational thinking is challenged by the supernatural luring the dead, the damned, and the demons that have long awaited the return of magic, and they will stop at nothing to bring it back for good. Suddenly, Mike is at the center of a battle between the forces of reason, of good, of evil and everything in between.\"",
