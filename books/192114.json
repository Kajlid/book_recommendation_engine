  "description": "I work at my family’s café/bookstore. Every day is the same, but it has never bored me; I’m content with my life. Or I was, until the day he walked in at approximately nine that morning. He was poised, enigmatic, and carried himself like a man who knew who he was and what he wanted. Unfortunately, what he wanted wasn’t me, or so I thought from the way he always remained remote and aloof towards our encounters. What I didn’t know was that he did want me, even before he stepped foot into Brennan’s Novel Tea Café. I quickly became consumed by him. The problem was, he was hiding a secret; one that would turn my existence upside down and take me into a world I wasn’t ready for. I should be clear that he told me he would never lie to me, and he didn’t, I just never asked the right questions. This is my journey of falling hard and fast for a man I knew very little about, and the downfall that went with it. I won’t tell you how it ends; some things are worth not knowing. After all, half the fun is the fall; it’s the landing that’s unpredictable.  This book is intended for mature audiences due to language, violence, and sexual content.",
