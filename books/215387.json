  "description": "This book is about the life of Ayrton Senna, the three times Formula One world champion. It is the first proper story of a man the world revered and whose like will never be seen again. In this first full account of the life of Senna, the author and his collaborators examine each detail of the driving maestro's life - from his earliest days to his first race, his pole positions and his world championships - as well as his death and its aftermath. It is a story that has never been fully or properly told, and it is a story that needed to be told.",
