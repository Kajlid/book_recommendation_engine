  "description": "The mandalas have always been among us, unseen and uncalled. Those few occult masters who have encountered them have known to leave them alone, for to these unholy forces we are mere playthings, insignificant tools to be used, fed upon - and eventually discarded. â€” When New-Age charlatan Derek Crowe learns the secrets of the mandalas he sees only the opportunity for easy money. He ignores the warnings, alters the mystical texts to make the dreaded mandalas seem benevolent to a gullible public, then publishes his book and waits for the profits to roll in. but Crowe is all too successful. For he has inadvertently released upon the earth a horror that is beyond all understanding or control - a horror both infinite and hungry.",
