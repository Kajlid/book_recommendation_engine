  "description": "A selection of works by noteworthy figures in contemporary Indian design New India Designscape offers an original selection of noteworthy works by the most talented designers at work today in India. These works are characterized by a singular mix of practical inventiveness and the imaginative repurposing of traditional forms, materials and motifs. Mythical subject matter recurs, often emphasizing the indivisibility of the sacred and the everyday. The objects profiled range from a pedal-driven washing machine (an example of what has been called \"barefoot design\") and a bamboo bicycle to ornate furniture, toys and household accoutrements. Among the designers included are Kavita Singh Kale, Garima Aggarwal Roy, Geetika Alok, Aneeth Arora, Shilpa Chavan, Hampi, Rajiv Jassal, Shirin Johari, Remya Jose, Lokesh Karekar, Padmaja Krishnan, Hanif Kureshi, Mira Malhotra, Ranjit Makkuni, Andrea Noronha, Sandip Paul, Satya Rajpurohit, M.P. Ranjan, Mann Singh, Gajanan Upadhyay and Priyanka Tolia.",
