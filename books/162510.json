  "description": "My name is Greer Walker. Mom of two. Friend. Daughter. Dance instructor. And, let’s not forget—a woman scorned. For the twenty years my husband and I were together, I gave him my soul, my life, my everything. What did I get in return? Heart break, crows feet, stretch marks, and a slew of insecurities.You see, my douchebag ex-husband of fourteen years dumped me for a twenty-five year-old, real-life Barbie Doll with a large repertoire of medical enhancements. He crushed my heart. His affair destroyed me. There were signs—lots of them—but I didn't see what was right in front of me. Or maybe, I didn’t want to.Somewhere along the line, things changed. With my eyes wide open, I vowed to never go through that kind of heartache again. I don’t need someone to make me feel special or beautiful, or sexually charged. Hell, I can take care of that part on my own if you know what I mean. It’s been twenty years since I last dated. I have resigned myself to the fact that I’ll be alone.But…There’s always a but. And with age comes wisdom. Like I said, I had come to grips with the fact that I’d always be alone…until gorgeous, dominant, and sexy Nick Costa walked into my life—or rather drove right into it—and made me feel all sorts of things that this woman right here has no business feeling.He has me asking myself questions that I never thought I’d hear myself ask. Can I allow someone into my life again? Can I risk being hurt? Can Nick deal with all the insecurities the fallout of my marriage produced? I am thirty-nine, for crying out loud. Can I start all over again? Can I let go of the past and possibly move on with my future? Could Nick Costa be my future? You might want to stick around to discover the answers.For now, I'll be 39 & holding.",
