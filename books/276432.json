  "description": "Willow Mackenzie did not want to go away for the Summer to stay with a cranky, old Grandfather she didn’t remember, to a place she had never seen. A croft in the remote Scottish Highlands, full of sheep and mystery. All she really wanted was a friend. To fit in. To feel normal. Not to be ‘Weird Willow’. She never expected that when she did at last meet a friend, she would be magically transported into a hidden world of Fairies and magic. And her new friend would be a tiny, purple Fairy called Violet. What sort of adventures would they share? And just what dangers lay in store?",
