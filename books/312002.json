When Xavier Malcolm, Lucas's abusive ex-alpha leader, asks me to spike into his own brain to save his sanity, I sense a trap. Problem is, no one refuses Alpha Xavier Malcolm without paying for it in one way or another.So, I spike.And bring down the wrath of a thousand-strong wolf pack on all of our heads.If you enjoy urban fantasy with a side order of romance, fast-paced action, a dash of humor, and some slow-burn love, you'll like SUMMONED.",
