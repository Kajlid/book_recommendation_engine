Her books are sexy and full of heart!”—New York Times bestselling author Teresa MedeirosOne of the most exciting voices in contemporary romance fiction, Toni Blake returns to Destiny, Ohio with Holly Lane—a sizzling hot and deeply emotional holiday story of a longtime friendship that turns into something oh so much more. As warm and touching as the small-town romances of Debbie Macomber but with a deliciously sexy twist, Holly Lane is a Christmas love story that not even a confirmed Scrooge could resist—as a solitary weekend at a remote lake cabin becomes a miraculous, life-changing event for a struggling young woman when a double-booking error lands a handsome childhood friend on her doorstep…and a blizzard does the rest.",
