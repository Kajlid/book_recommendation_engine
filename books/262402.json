  "description": "Lucky Gordon lives, breathes and sleeps baseball. Lucky started his career in the major league fresh out of college. His first at bat was a home run and that’s how it’s been ever since. Ava Royce is a sassy sportscaster who loves her job and the game but detests the ball players. She has no time for cocky, self-centered men who think being faithful means sex with only one woman a night. Lucky is intrigued by Ava. She’s a challenge...like a championship game. Ava is enraged when she finds out that Lucky had her reassigned to accompany him home to Tennessee to cover a story on him as his hometown’s hero. She vows to teach him a lesson or two for playing games with her career. Will Lucky be able to beat Ava at her own game and score a home run or will he strike out for the first time in his life?",
