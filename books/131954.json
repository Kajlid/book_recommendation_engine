  "description": "“The queen of the summer skies seeks where the barren mother’s child lies. Father unknowingly must be sought. For if frost’s child is by Summer caught, her power under summer skies shall bloom. Then humanity shall know its doom.”  Doctor Emarn Yarencil is a man whose past is a shadowed as the creatures he studies. In a world of myths and monsters he’s learnt the hard way how to survive. Yet even he isn't prepared for detective Jessica Frost and the forces that pursue her.  Hunted by the fae, the police and his own ghosts, it’s going take everything he has to come out of this alive. Yet even that may not be enough. For the fate of the world seems to be somehow tied to Frost’s own fate. Then there are the spectres of his own past, forgotten but not gone.  All in all a tall order for a man with nothing more than an old journal, natty hat and a wise cracking serpent to rely on.",
