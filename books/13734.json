  "title": "The Thought Exchange: Overcoming Our Resistance To Living A Sensational Life",
  "description": "With the proliferation of books like \"The Secret,\" we now know that what we think appears in the world as what we see there. So how come we're having such a hard time holding the thoughts we want to hold? How come we take on a positive thought only to find, moments or days later, that we're back to the same old thought and seeing the same old results we've always seen. In this groundbreaking book, David Friedman gives us the missing piece, the real secret to identifying the underlying thoughts we're actually thinking, exchanging them, and being able to stay with them and see the results we've always wanted to see but never knew how to achieve.",
