There's a kind, quiet calm here that warms the winter air.\"--\nThe New York Times\n\"Charming, hushed illustrations and quiet text together evoke the soft, snowy silence and winter beauty of a Swedish night. The troll Tomten mercifully saves the farm animals from the depredations of Reynard the fox, and manages to assuage the fox's hunger to boot!\"--School Library Journal (starred review)",
