  "description": "Xander Doumas, wealthy, intelligent and gorgeous entrepreneur was not amused when pictures from within his private playroom started to appear in the gossip rags and on social media. The embarrassment caused to his family made him decide to take a break from the media spotlight and isolate himself on his remote Scottish island.  Chloe Davies had survived an abusive relationship but needed to relocate so she was no longer around when her ex was released, after serving the prison sentence he had been given for assaulting her. When she saw Xanderâ€™s ad for a Girl Friday she thought the job would be the answer to her prayers.  At her interview, Xander offered her an entirely different position. Short on funds and desperate to escape the clutches of her ex, she reluctantly agreed to become his mistress. Only after she had signed his confidentiality agreement did she realize that she had delivered herself into the hands of a Dominant.  Isolated on his island with Chloe, Xander still smarting from having his trust betrayed, struggled to trust Chloe as much as she struggled to submit to him.",
