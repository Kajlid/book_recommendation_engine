  "description": "The Completed Series is finally here! Books 1-5 in the Southern Charm Series is now all in one place.  Southern Charm When Nicole “Nikki” Wilson was sent to Texas on assignment, she got much more than she was looking for. One bad storm, and a hot tow truck driver later, her day ends with one hell of a happy ending. It was fun. It was daring. It was one night and that’s all. Or so she thought.  Refusing to live off his family’s name, Brian left the McNair legacy behind in exchange for an honest living. Being a tow truck driver is the most humble one can get and servicing others keeps him content. But one bad day. One call for service. And one sexy damsel in distress, leads to a night of unimaginable passion.  But, something shifted that night. In the midst of all the ecstasy, memories were formed. Now they can't stop thinking about each other. One text. One phone call. One flight, changes everything.",
