How much more would she despise him when she learned it was he who had killed her husband?From the night their riverboat went down in flames, and he carried her to safety at his once-magnificent New Orleans plantation, he knew he must have her love. Must make her forgive and forget the past. The future was Texas, where he'd build a glorious new life for them if she would but listen to her heart, which told her Brant lived only to make her happy again, now and for always.",
