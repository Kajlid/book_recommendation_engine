  "title": "The Typewriter Keeps Me Awake At Night",
  "description": "Marcel Feldmar's poetry deals with various views through different shaped windows. Dealing with themes of light and dark, death and life, love and loss, as well as the occasional lighthearted observations, Marcel references music, alcohol, travel, and literature with a Gothic romanticism and a surreal wink.From traveling through the Whiskey trees to finding a home in an exit sign, Marcel picks up unusual images and finds perfect places to fit them inSome of his poetry can be held within the palm of your hand, like the four line snapshot \"Quick Fix\", while others, like the five page drift of \"This Dream Is Still Waiting\" moves like a quiet ocean.Shelley Venemann has added a visual poetry to these pages with singular snapshots that can sometimes be worth even more than a thousand words.",
