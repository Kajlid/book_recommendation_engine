  "description": "Jack Prelutsky, one of the premier children's poets of our time, manages to be deadpan and goofy simultaneously and in perfect rhythm right up to the pleasantly unpredictable punch lines of his poems. Take \"Jellyfish Stew.\" \"You're soggy, you're smelly, / you taste like shampoo, / you bog down my belly / with oodles of goo, / yet I would glue noodles / and prunes to my shoe, / for one oozy spoonful / of jellyfish stew.\" Poems about greedy grannies, exploding Bloders, and hypothetical situations such as having your nose unfortunately situated between your toes are guaranteed to delight you and your favorite kids.This new format includes five poem/songs from the book not found on the cassette version: \"The Carpenter Rages,\" \"Drumpp the Grump,\" \"Oh, Teddy Bear,\" \"I've Got an Incredible Headache,\" and \"Happy Birthday, Dear Dragon.\" These new pieces feature guitar, banjo, and fiddle playing behind Prelutsky's fun vocal antics.",
