  "description": "Penelope:I love baseball. And I get paid to talk about it. Sure, I'm behind the scenes of the best baseball talk show on television, but that's where I'm comfortable. Where I'm safe. And then Jake Hutchinson showed up and I started dreaming again. Dreaming of so much more than being behind the scenes. He reminded me of why I got into this business in the first place. I was determined to put my head down and do my work, and not get involved...but the closer I work with him, the harder I fall...Jake:I was determined to come in and make a good first impression. Though, soliciting a free meal from my producer probably wasn't the way to do that. And then she started talking about the game I love, the game I played, and I was hooked. I could listen to her talk about baseball for the rest of my life. I can't get involved with my producer, can I? With her talent she won't be a producer for much longer, and what's life without a little risk, right?The Curveball is a closed-door, friends to lovers, workplace romance featuring a baseball loving heroine and former baseball player hero. The Curveball is very much a love letter to baseball and the bonds created when it is shared. The Curveball also features #OwnVoices Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and chronic pain representation, written by an author who lives with PCOS and the associated chronic pain.",
