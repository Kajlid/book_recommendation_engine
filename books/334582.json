  "description": "Meg was fifteen years old when she wound up in Gunya, the infamous psychiatric institution for the rich and famous. Quite an achievement, especially for one who's convinced she's only half nutty. It was never Meg's idea of 'fun' to share her life with an underage pornstar, a prodigal junior-Olympian or a drug-addicted criminal; but when you're electively mute and can't remember why, you're not given many choices. The disappearance of a local girl Meg's age brings the quirky group together in a race against time to solve the crime before the authorities. Suddenly, the torture of being committed against their will is shadowed by the nightmare that reveals itself each day in the crime section of The Daily Telegraph. Most amazingly, the foursome form a friendship, stronger than the walls that encage them in their crazy world. And somehow this becomes the key Meg needs to find herself, and solve the mystery of her own incarceration.",
