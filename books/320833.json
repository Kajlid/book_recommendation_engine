  "description": "The prophecy foretold of the true queen... In the new world, where the old world is long forgotten, an evil queen sits on the throne, and anyone who challenges her reign is a mortal enemy—I am that enemy just by breathing. The queen always gets what she wants, and she wants me dead. Then one day, my life is turned upside down by a prophecy naming me the one true queen. I was oblivious to the true roles of the two men in my life—the Angel of Light and the Angel of Death—as my existence hung in the balance. One man there to save me, the other to claim me should the queen succeed in her quest for my blood. But every time she nearly succeeds in my demise, my dark angel swoops in, pulling me back to safety. Making the world stop. Pulling everything back in balance. Tired of being hunted by the vampires, slaves to the queen, I decide to fight back. It’s the only way to survive. I’m going to tear down the wards one by one and free my allies—the witches and the wolves—and then I’m going to force the queen from the safety of her castle and claim what’s rightfully mine. Her kingdom. Her throne. Her crown.",
