  "description": "Boodlers, and pikers, and slyboots… oh my! It’s December 1901, when the paths of three of the era’s notable characters cross in the nation’s capital: the Wizard of Oz, the Countess von Schnurrenberger und Kesselheim, and Harry Reese, insurance investigator. Harry has come to Washington in order to solve a string of jewelry thefts. But first he must match wits with a throng of thirsty newspapermen, a pack of rapacious lobbyists, and a young devotee of the Wizard’s. And as is usual, his dear wife Emmie has her own agenda.",
