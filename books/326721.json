  "description": "Two nerds - One LabWho will come out on top!MicahFor the last several years I haven’t felt very confident, my ex made sure of that. Working in a medical lab can make it easy to hide. When my flirty new coworker bursts onto the scene, he's the distraction I don't need. I'm content to come in and do my job, but he's determined to insert himself into my life. He’s exhausting, yet funny, and makes me feel wanted. Am I ready to feel attractive again?LucasI moved here for my sister and my family. When Thalia got sick, she became my world. I knew I’d do anything to take care of her, even taking a job outside of my comfort zone. When I meet Micah and we almost share a night of passion, I’m convinced meaningless hookups are no longer what I want. The problem is convincing him to want the same. There’s something about him that I want to protect. My dirty lab puns and nerdy talk might drive him a little crazy, but I’m determined to win him over.Nerdy Talk is an Opposites Attract, Nerd/Playboy romance with lots of laboratory references and a nosy well-meaning best friend. It’s Nerdy, it’s deep, it’s sexy and extra sweet.",
