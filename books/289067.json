  "description": "Most people see me as the smart, nerdy girl scared of her own shadow. But what I am, is a woman sick of watching the powerful prey on the powerless and I have zero guilt tipping those scales in the other direction.  I point my finger on a map, make my self at home, and set my sights on my next target. Only, what I don’t anticipate when I roll into my next town, is Chain Jackson. He doesn’t take kindly to my scam and before I know it, I’m locked in a room with the crew of the Heartlands Motorcycle Club outside my door deciding my fate.  You’d think being kidnapped and having your life threatened would be a low point. Instead, when the door closes and it’s just me and Chain? It’s all high points, and I have to decide whether to come clean or plan my escape. Problem is, if I stay, I may lose my life. If I leave, I will lose my heart.  Author’s Note: This curvy grifter may have met her match. The treasurer of the Heartlands MC may look rough around the edges but between the ears he’s no slouch. And between the legs? He’s packing more horsepower than is legal. These two may want to kill each other at first, but that doesn’t last. It’s over the top, safe with love at zero to sixty in the blink of an eye.  The alpha males of Heartlands Motorcycle Club are the most possessive, devoted, and territorial men in the country when it comes to the ones they love.  Heartlands is a rough and rugged new series of standalone stories. Written by four of the most trusted names in short and steamy romance, each book will get your motors revved and your hearts racing. Guaranteed.",
