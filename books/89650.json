  "description": "It's the summer of 2013 and the children are enjoying their vacation. Things go from bad to worse, when a group of kids start picking on Michael, the lonely kid. Not knowing what he's capable of, they push him to his limits and he attacks them, leaving them for dead. With the police after him, Michael stays on the run, hoping to lead them into a trap. His plan to lead them into a trap backfires in his face, which gets him taken into custody. With his captors dropping their guard, he slips right through their fingertips. What would happen if Michael is captured a second time around? Would the consequences be more severe? Would anybody come to his rescue if he is, in fact, captured?",
