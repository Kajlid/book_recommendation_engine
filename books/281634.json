  "description": "Cecilia Lorimer has hidden her loneliness by devoting herself to a charity mission for London's poorest women. But when a dashing Lord Delacourt takes control, she feels an uncharacteristic urge to flee. Just six years earlier, Delacourt had proved himself to be an immoral rake, nearly ruining her reputation in the bargain.It's whispered that the womanizing Delacourt is vain, vindictive, and merciless.But he's a man who honors his wagers --- and one lands him in his brother-in-law's godforsaken mission, face-to-face with the woman who has long haunted his dreams. When treachery closes in, only he knows how to guard Cecilia, but can a profligate knave persuade a virtuous woman that is worthy of her trust --- and their love?",
