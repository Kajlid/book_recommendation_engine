  "description": "Alison Gregorio thinks her new job with a prestigious law firm is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but explosive secrets lurk beneath its golden façade. When a plane crash takes out the firm’s biggest client, she finds herself in a situation that will test her conscience and her courage to the limits. Surviving a crash-landing is only the first challenge Justin Wyatt faces after his fall from power. He loved the toys he built more than the fortune they brought in, but neglecting his corporate empire left his deadliest creations in the wrong hands. Forty-two years have passed since the Restored United States emerged from decades of oppression and the chaos of revolution. It’s a brave new world, but some things never change. Money still talks, power still corrupts, and trust is a rare and precious commodity. Two people. One conspiracy. Everything to lose.",
