  "description": "Fairy tales always have a Prince Charming and a bad guy. In real life, Prince Charming is the bad guy and his favorite happy ending is the big O.I'm Prince Dare but you can call me Prince Charming. Cinderella never wanted the prince--she wanted a night out, a banging dress, and some midnight fun. I deliver that. I make being bad look way more fun than being good, and no one leaves my royal bed without a happy ending. When my uncle, the reigning king of Vale, orders me to marry and offers to make me the heir to the throne, I'm thrown for a loop. I'm the spare, the extra, the free gift with purchase. I can't be the hero and I won't be the villain who knocks his brother off the throne, so I've come up with an evil plan of my own... I'll marry someone completely unsuitable to take myself out of the running. The only problem? My suitably unroyal bride is far too tempting to resist--Edee is funny, sweet, and sexy. And best of all, she's American. It's a great plan. Everything's working out just fine until reality starts to intrude on my fantasy and for the first time ever, I wish fairy tales did come true.",
