  "description": "Kyara is one of a kind. Literally. She knows of no other half-breed Skinwitch-Werewolf. And she's learned the hard way to keep it a secret too, after all the violence the Skinwitches forced upon her as a result of that heritage. Now both Shifters and Skinwitches are hunting her and she doesn't have a clue why. A long time ago she made the mistake to trust a dangerously handsome Werewolf, but she won't make that mistake again - and she'd rather die than ever go back to the Skinwitches.",
