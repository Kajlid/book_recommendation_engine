I realized that the original passion that I had for Sid had not dimmed with the passage of time. And my management position? Well, I had absolutely no passion for it! However, I was almost ready to grit my teeth, accept reality and move on when my whole world collapsed.  And while I was still struggling in the throes of depression, my dad passed away.  And it was during that lowest point in my life that I made a shocking discovery. I stumbled upon my dad’s past love affair. A past strong enough to haunt me. A past strong enough to make me undertake a journey to uncover my dad’s secret.  Did I uncover my dad’s secret? Will I have the courage to throw caution to the winds and follow my heart? With the memories of my golden days still lingering in my mind, will I get a second chance?  A clean, wholesome romance that will make you fall in love all over again.
