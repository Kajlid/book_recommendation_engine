  "description": "He is a living legend, a master swordsman, and a hero of the Elven Empire. He had led his Warriors home in victory from a war that had lasted centuries. He is the High Lord General Gabriel Eagle Claw, Supreme Commander of the Combined Elven Forces, and his word is law. She is a force of nature, an Elven maiden trained in the art of survival by a Fae Warrior and she is just coming into the knowledge of her powerful talent. All of her life she has been able to converse with the forests about her. The leaves rustled their news into her ears, and the life force of the trees transmit their needs to her, for she is an Elf with a gift lost in legend. She is Eden, Guardian of the light of the Elven forests. TRATCHAR. The trees shout her title. Her people whisper it in awe.  “Catch,” the warning comes just in time to alert General Gabriel to attention and warrior that he is he is quick to react just as an arrow knocks a young Elven maiden from a tree branch that he has chosen to stand under, and he catches her as she falls. When blue eyes meet silver each know they have met their life mate, but such things as not as quickly accepted as they are recognized. He would have order in his ranks, she must be free to mark her own trail, he would bind her, tie her, control her. She would test his patience and will to the limit, and challenge his rights to own what she would not give freely.",
