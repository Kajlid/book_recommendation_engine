But if her involvement on the project is discovered, Emmerich will be marked for treason, and a far more dire fate would await Petra.Working together in secret, they build the clockwork giant, but as the deadline for its completion nears, Petra discovers a sinister conspiracy from within the Guild council … and their automaton is just the beginning.",
