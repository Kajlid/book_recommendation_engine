The scene of commerce and battle, romance and ceremony, it remained a vibrant focal point for 20 generations of Londoners. This remarkable structure—with its drawbridge, nineteen arches, and nineteen piers—stood majestic through the centuries and was an inspiration to many who saw it. This is the story of the bridge, its inhabitants, and its extraordinary evolution—and of how it came to live on in affectionate folk memory, occupying a unique place in London’s heritage.",
