  "description": "Words from the Heart, a collection of poetry and prose, is a title that just flowed out of me as I looked over the candidates that were on the short list for this book.The majority of these works were written during two specific periods in my recent life, which unexpectedly became woven into one. To lighten the mood a bit I have also interjected a couple of whimsical pieces as well as two bout my fou legged furry companions. They are the glue and tape that often put me back together again, when I begin to come apart at the seams.",
