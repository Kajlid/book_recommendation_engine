  "description": "In a landscape of Canadian myth and magic, the fairy tale continues...The gateways between Faerie and the Earthworld have been destroyed by the Enemy. The only hope of ever bridging the two worlds again lies with Dana, a troubled teenager now living in Toronto. In a dream, Dana is told by her fairy mother, Edane, that the key to restoring the gateways is in The Book of Dreams. \"Okay, so I'm to find a book.\" she said. \"How? Where do I look? Should I return to Ireland? Or is it somewhere in Faerie?\"\"The Book of Dreams is in Canada. It is as the High King foresaw long ago. That was the reason you were sent to that land. Your destiny lies there.\"Dana was appalled.\"Canada? But how? Why? That doesn't make sense. There's no magic there. I can't quest in that country. I don't know it at all!\" A map of Canada flashed through her mind. \"And it's huge!\"But quest she does, the length and breadth of the land, pursued by evil forces and aided by many new friends including Gwen and Laurel of the Companions of Faerie, and Jean, a classmate from Quebec with his own dark secret. Soon, Dana discovers that Canada is home to magic as frightening and wondrous as anything she left behind in Ireland.",
