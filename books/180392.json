She finally knows what she is and what she wants. Evie desperately wants to be Chris’s equal, his partner. To her, that means mastering her gift. In order to do that, Evie strikes an unlikely deal with a werewolf in exchange for much needed help. But the deal will put her in danger in ways than she doesn’t realize.  Chris has gone astray for Evie, just as the prediction said he would. He’s no longer Darcy’s faithful son. His loyalty is Evie’s. When Darcy demands Chris bring Evie to him, Chris knows what Darcy plans for her. He wants Evie to become his in every way possible. Chris knows Darcy will destroy everything he loves most in Evie: her smart mouth, her independence and her heartbeat. And Chris won’t let him do that.  Soon, Evie is making waves in the myth community clustered in Thunder Bay. She’s hanging out with werewolves. She’s not afraid to speak her mind or display her gift. She’s also completely unaware that Darcy thirsts for her. Evie’s sudden fame sets all of them in a dangerous path. And things will never be the same.
