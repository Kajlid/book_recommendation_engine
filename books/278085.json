  "description": "\"A darkly comic contemporary a brave, very funny, very knowing trip through the neo-psychedelic substrate of the wired world.\" -- William Gibson , bestselling author of Neuromancer and Idoru Douglas Rushkoff--the foremost authority on cyberculture and author of Cyberia, Media Virus and Playing the Future --has penned the ultimate novel for our fast and furious times. A wired-in thrill ride into the here and now of tripping, raving, net-surfing...and beyond. \"An eerie tale of 20-somethings caught up in an increasingly trippy world of homegrown religion. Set in an abandoned piano factory in Oakland, CA., Rushkoff's novel drops several characters--hackster, hipster, hustler, hippie--into a pop-culture Cuisinart along with a nice Jewish boy, and then spins them off into an intricate plot that leads to a showdown with the leader of a rival cultlike group.\" -- New York Times",
