  "description": "Tom Tyler, young ward to the mostly beloved superhero Morning Light, takes to the streets each night as the crime-fighting Score. Together they help keep the streets of Sail City safe, despite a lingering, more than justified mistrust of vigilantes and superheroes. After the events of On My Shoulders, Tom Tyler finds his life turned upside down. As a master plan begins to take shape around him, Tom is isolated from those around him and left with few options. Meanwhile, close ally Chrissy Cole - the Inimitable Squire - realises she's suddenly the front line keeping the city safe from an unseen menace.",
