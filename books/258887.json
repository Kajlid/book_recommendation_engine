  "description": "Heal your pain and break free from toxic relationships with this unique recovery program designed by one of the world’s leading authorities on narcissistic abuse.Narcissistic abuse was originally defined as a specific form of emotional abuse of children by narcissistic parents. More recently, the term has been applied more broadly, referring to any abuse by a narcissist (someone that who admires their own attributes)—especially adult-to-adult relationships, where the abuse may be mental, physical, financial, spiritual, or sexual. If you have been through an abusive relationship with someone who has Narcissistic Personality Disorder, you will know that no one understands what you are going through unless they have personally experienced it. Author Melanie Tonia Evans was abused by her former husband for over five years, and it almost took her to the point of no return. At her lowest point, she had an epiphany that signified the birth of the Quanta Freedom Healing Technique, which she presents here. In this book, you will learn how • recognize if you are in an abusive relationship• detach or remove yourself from the narcissist's ability to affect or abuse you• identify your subconscious programming, release it, and replace it• focus on healing yourself to become empowered to thrive and not just survive With thousands of patients successfully treated worldwide, this revolutionary program is designed to heal you from the inside out.",
