I felt him though, just as soon as I crashed into his rock hard body. Gabriel Maddox.The heir to the Maddox Empire and target of countless gossip columns. He was the man that all of the single women of New York had their eye on. The playboy with a reputation that preceded him, and a trail of broken hearts left in his wake. The only problem? He seemed to have his eye on me. Victoria Colletti. The woman with a closet full of skeletons and a past that I couldn’t escape from. My too fragile heart couldn’t handle someone like him. I knew it the moment he first made his proposition. But the thing about Gabriel Maddox is, when he wants something, there is nothing he won’t do to get it.
