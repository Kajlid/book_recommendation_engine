  "description": "Dragons do not cry. They control their emotions. This is what all dragons were taught, but I am now the only one alive to remember this lesson . . .Meet Vincent, a most unusual dragon.For thousands of years he’s been trapped—forced to spend what’s left of his existence among us in the form of a human for a crime in which he was unjustly convicted. When a new love arrives unexpectedly, Vincent discovers that the only way to find happiness is to revisit his violent past and to confront his uncertain future. From a world that’s been hidden from view to a history that if acknowledged would end in torture and death, Vincent’s tale is a timeless one, both epic and intimate—as fierce as a dragon’s breath and as delicate as its tears.Haunting, heartfelt, and sometimes funny, Vincent discovers that even through tragedy, the things we most often try to avoid are those that make us human.",
