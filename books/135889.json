  "description": "Matt Connover is like a new person. Caring, romantic and thoughtful. No worries though… he’s still sexy as hell.  He has changed in every way that I have ever dreamed of, and he did it because he wants me. It’s like a fairy tale of sorts.  Except… like with every fairy tale, there is a villain. One who threatens to disrupt the harmony we have created together.  Is what we have strong enough to survive? I truly believe that perhaps I can find love within these Legal Affairs. I’m just not sure Matt believes it.",
