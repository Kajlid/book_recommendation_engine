Over the course of their search, Augie’s Bookshelf read thousands of poems from poets around the world, and out of the thousands of pieces of work read, 54 of the best poets were chosen to be highlighted in ‘And We All Breathe the Same Air: A Poetry Anthology’.“We believe that there are so many amazing writers out there that should have the chance to be published,” said Molly Wolchansky, the founder at Augie’s Bookshelf. “That’s why we are publishing this book.”This book is sectioned off into three parts, and it has poems in all types of topics, such as love, feminism, heartbreak, death, nature, and more.",
