  "description": "Ambrosia wakes to find he has survived the night... Or has he? Honestly, he doesn't know and can't remember how he got in his bed, or any other happenings having transpired since taking the elixir the night before. The world he now finds himself in is one of chaos, being ripped apart by natural disaster, while at home a terror erupts in the Hartland with people gone missing and a new set of grisly murders. To make matters worse, there's something the matter in his mind; constant flashes plague thoughts run amok, making fractured images appear that he can't quite grasp hold of. Lucid dreams won't let him be and follow him around in a house that at times seems itself alive. Unsure of what to think, Ambrosia seeks out those closest to him: companions who would help, and the solace of a loverâ€™s open arms. She means everything to him, so why does he feel that he just can't hold on? There are still many things he does not yet know, but with every moment he's getting closer to discovering the truth. What answers will he find there appearing on the other side?Though not prevalent throughout this series, it does contain some content of an adult nature. Recommended for mature audiences.",
