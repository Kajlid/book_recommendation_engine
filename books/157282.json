  "description": "We're in Occupied Paris, June 1940. German tanks have rolled in. The stylish cafes and nightclubs cater to Nazis now. Daily supplies are rationed, fear is plentiful. France is crushed but the SHADOW WAR has just begun. A British S.O.E. spymaster teams with a partisan leader in Burgundy to organize The Resistance Fighters' Literary Club. Composed of blacklisted writers and artists, their clandestine headquarters in Paris is the Balzac Bookshop. A young American Embassy attache and a beautiful French-Russian countess are two female agents sent by London HQ to kidnap a top Nazi art official, the head of Dienststelle Westen, and smuggle an iconic French masterpiece to safety from the thieving Nazis. These characters are based on actual people and true events. The Resistance fighters carry a shadow self within, as we all do, while saving France in a dangerous SHADOW WAR.",
