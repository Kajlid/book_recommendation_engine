  "description": "Bronze Sword: Lore of DayONE continues the story arc of Ivory Sword: Lore of DayONE. The tale describes the expanding scope of the struggle for the Thrones of the Liosdoackalfar Empire and King Lionard's nascent Human Kingdom. The Elfin Prince Morais discovers that his personal trials have been part of a larger story. He learns of the Bronze Sword, the embodiment of Ramdierh, once Queen of Dragons. Her trapped anima struggles to find her path back to physicality and power. The political conflicts beneath the surface of history force internal, deadly struggles that reveal the nature of alliance, power, trust and history. Other characters introduced in the first book, Ivory Sword, also face their individual challenges. For example, conflicts, intrigues, and her thirst for revenge teach Victoria, daughter of the Human Grand Duchess Margaret, more than she wants to know about the obstacles to peace that fester within the Empire.",
