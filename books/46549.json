  "description": "Ford's masterly story of destruction and regeneration follows the progress of Christopher Tietjens as his world is shattered by the Great War.In four volumes (Some Do Not…, No More Parades, A Man Could Stand Up— and The Last Post), Parade's End traces the psychological damage inflicted by battle, the collapse of England's secure Edwardian values and the new age, embodied by Tietjens's beautiful, selfish wife, Sylvia. It is an elegy for the war dead and the passing of a way of life, and a work of amazing subtlety and profundity.",
