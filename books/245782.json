BLURB:The first mistake Saint made was forgetting about his naughty sinsâ€¦  Dr. Saint Aknaten is living a good life, enjoying his family and friends to the fullest. But this doting father, loving husband, loyal friend, dedicated businessman, and warrior for justice has just been presented with a living nightmare that will stop him in his tracks: a demonic undertaking that sucks him into the depths of a kind of Evil he never believed existed.  The gates of Heaven have opened, and the road to Hell is paved with the blood of bought-and-paid-for souls. The virtuous and the wicked are pitted against each other, but only one can survive this war. Clinging firm to love in the face of unrelenting hatred, Saint goes head to head with a force so merciless, it is sure to scar him for life or end his very existence. Spells are conjured and sprinkled upon New York City, seasoning it just right in this tale of magic, humor, heartbreak, and sex. But the monsters of the underworld have come out to play with the good doctor, hoping he will soon draw his last breath.  But what happens when a man looks Evil in the eye to see nothing but a reflection of himself staring back at him?",
