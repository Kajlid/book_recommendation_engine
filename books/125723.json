  "description": "LEARN:: How to Become a Successful Networker, Even if You Are an Introvert (August 2015 edited version!!) Do you hate networking and do you dislike the typical networker? Do you feel overwhelmed when you enter a room full of people and are you too shy to start a conversation with a stranger? If you’d like to obtain a steady stream of customers, boost your self-confidence, and enjoy meeting new people, then this might be the most important book you’ll ever read. This book will teach you how to: • Learn specific techniques to conquer shyness. • Never be afraid to enter a room full of people. • Make a good impression to the people you meet. • Use networking as a means to become successful in business and really enjoying it while doing. Most business owners are very busy. Sometimes too busy to do all the necessary things, like meeting potential customers. However, only few businesses get their customers without making any efforts. Especially in times of financial crisis and aggressive competition. Networking can be an effective and lucrative way to do business. However, for some of us it’s extremely difficult to go to a network meeting or even approach someone on the street and to start a conversation. From my own experience I admit that being shy, or thinking that you’re shy, can be a huge obstacle in meeting new people. This book is designed to help you overcome your shyness and to become a successful networker. In this book I’ll teach you to become an effective and ‘fearless’ networker. Although this book is especially intended for the novice networker, the experienced networker will also find useful tips in this book. This book and the examples mentioned in it are especially for entrepreneurs. Yet most tips are also useful during other occasions and for other target groups like for example job seekers and fundraisers.",
