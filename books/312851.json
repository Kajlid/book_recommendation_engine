  "description": "Long Ago the world of Malati became a refuge for all magical life on Earth.In ages past, kings, queens, and emperors faded away in favor of new styles of governance. No matter the era, at every turn, the noble wizard lines remain power hungry. They maintain control with countless dark plots and hidden grand schemes designed to hold themselves over the merchants and peasants of all races.This is the world Tobin Ammagan is born into. Only after a brutal early life does he find a reprieve at the Steelblade Academy of Magic. When he comes of age inside its walls, he must deal with the demons of his past and the scars of his youth. The world outside Steelblade is also fast becoming one of massive oppression, and a revolutionary war is at hand. A war which threatens to destroy all Tobin loves. This includes Colin, to whom he is bound by magics few understand and who is slowly becoming more than a mere friend. This young wizard farmer and his love mean everything to Tobin and he will protect Colin at any cost. No easy task when Colin is determined to help in the fight against the corrupt in power.In this age, enemies and allies alike must all decide quickly where they stand and who and what they will fight both for and against. No matter the race, class, or magical status of a being, there can be no middle ground this time. With such overwhelming odds, Tobinâ€™s only hope to do what he believes is right and to protect Colin is to wield the most powerful of ancient magics. If he succeeds, he may avert a world war. Should he fail, he could lose all he holds dear forever. Only one thing is for certain. No matter if he wins or loses in his desperate gamble, the world will never be the same once Tobin Ammagan is done.",
