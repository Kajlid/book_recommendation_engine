  "description": "A story of the Scottish border in 1679. Sir Patrick Hume's dear friend, Robert Baillie, was a political prisoner; thirteen-year-old Grisel Hume went to the Edinburgh prison to see him, disguised as an apple vendor. Mr. Baillie was liberated, but a new danger threatened when Sir Patrick himself was implicated in the Rye House Plot. Again Grisel and her brother came to the rescue; their father escaped and the family joined him later in Holland.",
