  "title": "The Salterton Trilogy: Tempest-Tost / Leaven of Malice / A Mixture of Frailties",
  "description": "In the small university town of Salterton, Ontario, dreams are quietly taking shape, or falling apart. There's the Salterton Little Theatre Company, in which professional director Valentine Rich is tormented by the amateurish efforts of his actors. The families Vambrace and Bridgetower almost go to war over a fake notice of engagement in the local paper. And a family fortune is lavished on an aspiring singer because there is no male heir to claim it. Tracing the lives and incidents of a small community in the middle of the last century, \"The Salterton Trilogy\" peels off the public veneer of geniality and respectability to reveal the private passions churning beneath.",
