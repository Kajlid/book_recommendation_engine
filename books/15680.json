  "description": "White brings with it dreams of respect, of wealth, of simply being treated as a human being. It's the one thing Walter will never be. But what if he could play white, the way so many others seem to do? Would it bring him privilege or simply deny the pain? The title story in this collection asks those questions, and then moves on to challenge notions of race, privilege, personal choice, and even life and death with equal vigor. From the spectrum spanning despair and hope in \"What She Saw When They Flew Away\" to the stark weave of personal struggles in \"Chocolate Park,\" Let's Play White speaks with the voices of the overlooked and unheard. \"I Make People Do Bad Things\" shines a metaphysical light on Harlem's most notorious historical madame, and then, with a deft twist into melancholic humor, \"Cue: Change\" brings a zombie-esque apocalypse, possibly for the betterment of all mankind.",
