  "title": "Ascension!: An Analysis of the Art of Ascension As Taught by the Ishayas",
  "description": "This book clearly explains the teachings of the Ishayas, an ancient order of monks who were entrusted by the Apostle John to preserve the original teachings of Christ until the third millennium. The Ishayas hold that the original teachings of Jesus were not a belief system at all, but rather a mechanical series of techniques to transform human life into a constant perception of the perfection within the human heart. Real expansion of consciousness occurs only through direct, personal experience. Ascension! is an invitation to awaken to the innermost Reality of your true Self. This text also includes a description of the Ishayas' 27 Ascension Attitudes.",
