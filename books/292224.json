  "description": "Blaze Holden was going to complicate my life... I never intended to flirt to get a job. It’s not something I’m proud of, but there’s something about a sexy single father that just made me want to bat my eyelids. And it wasn’t like it wasn’t fun. Boy was it fun. Blaze was handsome with a devious smile and a sparkle in his blue eyes. Something about him sent chills up my spine in the most sexually arousing way. Maybe it had been a mistake to flirt with my new boss, but what’s the worst that could happen?  Max Holden was going to cause me nothing but trouble... I never intended to lie to get a job. It’s not something I normally do, but when mom was made redundant, we had no other options. I didn’t lie when I said I loved kids. I only lied about the fact that I had nanny experience. And that I had a masters degree in child psychology. Becoming a live-in nanny was the solution to my all my problems. The way I would pay for my second years tuition at college. But I didn’t realize that my new boss also lived with his younger brother, Max. The same Max that I’d made out with at a bar the weekend before I interviewed. The same Max that caught me flirting on the couch with his older brother. The same Max that was in my English class on the first day of class. Now Max knows the truth about me and he wants to make me pay.  We’ve all got a secret to hide... However, it turns out that I’m not the only one that has secrets. Both Blaze and Max have things they don’t want anyone to know and for some reason they’re both pursuing me. Now, I just have to decide which of the Holden men I want (if any) and how far I’m willing to go in order to keep everyone from finding out the biggest secret of all.",
