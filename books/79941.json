  "description": "Research scientist Dr. Anjali Mehta lost her beloved family in an earthquake. Only her work cuts through the paralyzing grief, but when she finds her new research subject, reputed mass murderer Jake Finn, maddeningly uncooperative and inexplicably sexy she's tempted to run away. How can she burn to touch a man behind bars—a killer?What she doesn't know is that Jake is a chimera, a shapeshifter who can change into a lion or a dragon with all the strengths of both even in human form, who believes his ability to shape shift is nothing but a terrifying hallucination and his overpowering attraction to his new doctor proof positive he’s finally gone over the edge.And the employer she trusts has an agenda all his own. If she can't believe the impossible, neither she nor Jake may make it out alive.",
