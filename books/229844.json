Vlad has devoted his life to guarding his king and never thought about taking a wife. But all bets are off when a sassy, dark-haired princess appears.  These two are hot and fast, but when Tabby’s parents step in, things get messy. Can they forgo tradition and make their own way, or will the divide break them?  Warning: Okay, okay…stop asking. They get their story. Happy now?  Each book in The Princess series is standalone & about a different couple.",
