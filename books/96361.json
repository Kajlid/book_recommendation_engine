  "description": "Would you survive a day where killing was legal?Do you know someone that for whatever reason you wouldn't be particularly bothered if they were no longer with us? Welcome to Curve Day.In the near future, desperate times call for desperate measures.The Earth's population is now so out of control that the Government has enforced one day of the year where murder acts as a form of population control. Sure, it wasn't always that easy to get people to accept this idea, and in truth there is still an element of resistance to it. As time ticks on though, with each passing Curve Day the American people gradually accept and adapt to the notion of citizen on citizen killing. Our story takes us to the eve of the eleventh Curve Day following an eclectic bunch of individuals as they each prepare and execute the fight of their lives. Characters include a German ex paratrooper, a French foreign exchange student, a homeless academic who suffered a midlife crisis, a woman who is a victim of spousal abuse, a female police officer and a marine who has lost faith in his Government. Who will survive the annual slaughter?Approx 63000 words in length",
