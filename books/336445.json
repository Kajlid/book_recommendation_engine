  "description": "Jackson:I know most people say this, but I really did have it all: I was the hottest jock in college, a star on the field, and had a rich girlfriend who turned heads.That was until I got caught with my pants around my ankles with another girl. Needless to say, it all suddenly came crashing down around me.Too proud to grovel, I thought the streets would have been a better alternative. But, boy, was I wrong.Then my luck changed one evening when a stranger pulled up and gave me an offer that seemed too good to be true. Maybe, just maybe, I could turn things around. And if I had to bend a little to do so, then who cares? I’ve always been secretly curious anyway.Giles Remington:I always know a good asset when I see one. Tonight was no different.Something about this toned, clueless jock standing before me, begging for money, made me suddenly feel protective. Being out here was no place for such a handsome creature. But, under my control, he could have a roof over his head, a brand new identity, and a life of purpose.With several transformations under my belt, I could see something special in this one, just as I had done with all the others.I have big plans for him…he just doesn’t know it yet.",
