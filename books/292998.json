His new life is medical treatments that feel straight out of a video game, vision loss in one eye, disappearing friends who don't know what to say to \"the cancer kid,\" cruel bullying, and ultimately, friendships new and old that rise above everything.Just when Ross starts to feel like he's losing his footing, he discovers how music, art, and true friends can change everything.
