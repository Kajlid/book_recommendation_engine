  "title": "A Secret Cavalry",
  "description": "In the eyes of an Angelic Overwatch, mankind has not lived up to its full potential. Our most valued commodity is often taken for granted and consistently in jeopardy. The miracle of Life. With crime and moral corruption running amuck, man is seen as his own worst enemy. Convinced they can bridge the gap and with no other options in sight, a league of angels chooses to act. However, in order to exist in the human realm, they must merge with willing human hosts. The recruitment of common ordinary people is necessary to champion this worthy cause of safeguarding life on Earth. As a result, a partnership is forged to awaken comatose patients in strategically located coma wards. Among them are a soccer coach, car thief and a 911 operator. Merging empowers each host with a vast number of supernatural abilities to provide hope and serve the greater good. With two caveats. This team-up can only continue as long as it is done in secret and no action committed results in the loss of life. Violating either of the previous directives permanently voids their agreement returning the host to a previous comatose condition. All-powerful angels submitting themselves to a variety of imperfect people results in a unique and precarious partnership. One that if not careful, can potentially place both realms at risk. All for the sake of establishing A Secret Cavalry.",
