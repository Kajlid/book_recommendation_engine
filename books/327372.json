Now who's going to save me from them?Every beat of my heart is the tick of a time bomb, reminding me to squeeze as many thrills out of life as I can.

But the more we dig into the mysteries surrounding my existence, the more I catch glimpses of tenderness beneath their vicious exteriors.And the touch of their fangs and tentacles makes me feel so shockingly alive, it's hard to remember why I ever feared them...Until I discover the real reason they're protecting me.",
