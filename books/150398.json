  "description": "When Shade Stevenson gets fired from her job pushing pencils - literally - at an office supply store, she uses her hideous last day to score a spot on the latest reality show: Are You the Bitchiest Person in America?   Unfortunately, maintaining her spot on this:show is as much of a pain as her fellow contestants: Amy hates \"pretty people\" (as if it's Shade's fault that she moisturizes regularly) and makes it her mission to get Shade kicked off the show – even accusing her of assault with a deadly treadmill! Kent scores big points with an audition video that features him complaining during sex. And then there's Maggie,  who's still griping about things that ticked her off in 1985 (and she doesn't even mention the hairstyles!). As if that wasn't bad enough, the show's first challenge forces Lucy to call up her ex-boyfriend Richard, even though she recently swore never to speak to him again - for the very last time.    Shade digs up dirt on her fellow contestants - and a few other people she thinks would benefit from her complaining talent. When her efforts turn up a secret that could wreck Richard's financial future - and a few about her fellow contestants - Shade has to decide how far she's willing to go to win.",
