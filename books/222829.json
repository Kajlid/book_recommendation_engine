  "title": "Heartspoken: Poems & Musings",
  "description": "Loneliness, heartbreak or loss can leave us feeling hopeless at times. Yet, such intense emotions often drive us to look beyond our immediate worldly existence, to question the meaning of life itself. In doing so, we grow spiritually stronger. The earlier poems in this book are cathartic, but then the tone shifts to higher thoughts on life and societal issues as well as musings on the divine nature of our existence. Just when you think life has left you broken, and you're falling apart, deep wisdom surfaces in trying times, truths spoken from the heart.",
