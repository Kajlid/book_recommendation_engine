When the local economy is thrown into a tailspin by a plant shutdown, Murphy is thrown out of work, with no way to pay for medical care for his son. In an attempt to prove they can operate on their own, the workers move in and occupy the factory. The government intervenes, escalating the labor dispute into a deadly conflict. As the conflict intensifies, politicians on both sides refuse to back down or compromise, tipping the nation into a bloody civil war.",
