  "description": "My boss is an asshole. I’d take off my heels and throw them at his face, if they weren’t so expensive.  Why? Because my boss, the sexy, billionaire bad boy Leo King, wants me to be his wife.  That’s right. His wife. Except, it isn’t real. It’s all pretend so his family believes it, and I’m supposed to go along with it.  Asshole doesn’t even begin to describe him, and it’s only going to get worse. Especially because his cocky attitude and sudden interest in my private life make it difficult to concentrate on something other than his sexual innuendos. I always do what he wants, and we both know it. It’s not like I have a choice. Agree or get fired.  I’m going to need a drink … Or twenty.   The first part of Possessed, a three-part series from Coco Cadence. Note: This ends in a cliffhanger.",
