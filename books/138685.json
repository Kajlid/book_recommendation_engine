  "title": "Dear Diary",
  "description": "A collection of a girl's funniest diary entries from 12 to 25 years old. She updates each entry by tracking down the people involved and asking awkward questions like, \"Do you remember when I tried to beat you up?\" Sometimes old friends apologize. Sometimes they become new enemies. No matter who she talks to about the days we all discovered sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll, one thing becomes abundantly clear: Boys are totally immature.\"Here's your chance to have all the benefits of a tortured adolescence without the shitty childhood. Congradulations!\"â€”Sarah Silverman",
