  "description": "The World is bigger than you think….Johnathan’s Great Grandfather was famous for something. Was he a dragon slayer?That’s hard to believe now, because the world no longer believes in Dragons.Jonathan’s arrival in his home land starts in motion a wave of activity that sweeps the continent. Caught in the backwash of events larger than himself, he must navigate across the vast strange world he never imagined was as deep or old as it is. Against a backdrop of a world teeming with Dragon Symbols, Dragon Lore, and armies that carry the Dragon Flag, Jonathan unwittingly retraces his Great Grandfather’s steps. At each turn, he finds new allies, new enemies, and new decisions. Can he trust his team? Can he trust himself to do the next right thing when the carefully laid plans go wrong?Is there a Dragon to fight? Or is it all just an illusion?This is an epic journey story, traversing cultures in a world full of ancient wonders and present dangers.The book follows imperfect characters in a world that has had better days. It touches on the topics of leadership, purpose, and the need to attack problems at their root. It is intentionally written in a way that defines characters by characteristics other than racial identifiers, with the hope that anyone reading could relate to the hero.Spiritual themes addressed include the concepts of providence, miracles, and the significance of worldview on the beliefs and actions of the characters.",
