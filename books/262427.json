Two animals who, according to the natural course of things, are not supposed to be friends—but does it have to be that way?In his simple but brilliant art style, Coll Muir playfully conveys the idea that if you are different from somebody, it doesn’t mean that you can’t be friends and that even the most unlikely duo can manage to get along.Akin to I Want My Hat Back and Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus, Coll Muir’s debut picture book feels like an instant classic friendship story!",
