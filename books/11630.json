Scientists theorize that one day the volcano will explode. Nine hours after eruption a mega-tsunami with waves of more than 150 feet in height will crash onto American shores. Now, what if something sent a nuclear missle into the volcano and blew it up?

United States Admiral Arnold Morgan battles his greatest enemy yet, and races against time to stop Rashood before the unimaginable happens. With his trademark authentic research, military hardware, grasp of geopolitics and now cutting edge science, Patrick Robinson is at the top of his game with this new tale that you pray will never happen.",
