  "description": "The epic fantasy trilogy begins. In a world fearfully waiting for the return of the dormant dragon god, a triumvirate of evil villains rises up to take advantage of the chaos. Reluctantly pitted against them is Kal Moonheart, an adventurer and gambler, marked for a life of danger at a young age. But Kal has friends to stand with her—honest thief Will Straightarrow, smuggler and pirate Lula Pearl, knight-errant Rafe Firehand, and wiley policitian Benedict Godsword. There will be blood. There will be a reckoning …In DRAGON KILLER, a mysterious threat puts Kal on a collision course with terrors she thought she had left buried in her past. Teaming up with a young guard captain, aspiring knight Rafe Firehand, she travels to a dragon-haunted island to hunt down a murderous beast. Once there, Kal soon discovers there are worse things in the world than dragons, and when an unexpected sequence of events leaves her in an impossible situation, she must summon every ounce of skill, cunning and strength in order to survive.",
