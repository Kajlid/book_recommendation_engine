  "description": "He thinks he can buy anything he wants. Even me. The package in my mail had no name, no address. Just some sexy lingerie, and a letter telling me that I was claimed. That I already belonged to him. I thought it was a mistake. No one would send something like that to a girl like me. The most exciting part of my day was getting to marathon a new show on Netflix. But the gifts kept coming. And the messages got more personal. He'd write things like, “Thinking about you drives me wild.” Or, “How will our lips feel when we finally kiss?” I won't lie, I was starting to fall for a stranger. Then he wanted to meet. He's gorgeous, charming, an actual damn billionaire. He's everything a girl could want. But he has a secret. What if he isn't a stranger at all? Standalone novel with a HEA, no cliffhangers here! Contains a bad boy billionaire with hot tattoos and one hell of a dirty mouth.",
