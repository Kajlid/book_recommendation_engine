  "description": "*** A sweet romance *** Falling in love with your little sister’s best friend is never smart. They know all your secrets and if things don’t work out your sister will kill you. When Ashley Parker sends young Marine Nathan Johnson a care package it open’s his eyes to a possibility. The last time he’d seen her she’d been deep into that 16 year old coltish stage. Now, 2 years later, she was definitely in that beautiful woman stage. It seems that annoying brats grow up. Being in love with your best friend’s older brother is never easy. To them you’ll always be the annoying pest following them around like a lost puppy. Always in the friend zone, never more, never enough. Ashley has known Nathan Johnson her whole life and secretly been in love with him since she was twelve. Maybe now, maybe if dreams come true, Nathan might see her for her true self, might come to love her as much as she loves him.",
