She’s only seen Logan once since; when they were still young children. Over the years, she’s written him several times, asking that he petition the king to end their troth, but Logan never responds. However, after a chance encounter with an irresistible rogue she can’t stop thinking about, nor stop secretly meeting, Mayra is resolute she’ll marry for love. Though it’s risky, she initiates a bold scheme that’s certain to force Logan to call off their union. Until Laird Logan Rutherford returned to Scotland and inherited a near bankrupt estate, he had no intention of wedding the lass he was betrothed to as a wee lad. He’d planned to honor Mayra’s ever more demanding requests to dissolve their marriage contract, but now he must have her dowry to save his beloved Lockelieth Keep. One day, he prevents Mayra from taking a nasty tumble, and he’s immediately intrigued with the intelligent lass. Mayra doesn’t recognize Logan, and after she reveals her utter contempt for her betrothed, he impulsively assumes his cousin’s identity. A decision that soon has Logan snared in a tangled web of deceit, because he’s fallen in love with Mayra. Buy this first book in the Heart of a Scot Series for a gripping, emotional, Highland adventure you won't want to put down.
