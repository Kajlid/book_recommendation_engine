  "description": "Phyllis Schlafly is a constitutional attorney and president of Eagle Forum, a leading fighter for pro-family politics and agendas. This book is her reflections on the sexual liberations and other feminist's ideas in comparison to how she has lived. She demonstrates through her life that it was by living a Christian life of devotion and motherhood that she was to be \"liberated.\" The book provides criticism and arguments against radical feminism. Betty Freidan once said over the radio, \"I would like to burn her [Phyllis Schlafly] at the stake.\" It takes much courage for any individual to stand up against a political force such as feminism and say, \"You're wrong.\" Much like Dr. Alice Von Hildebrand in THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A WOMAN, Schlafly shows how the system that best promotes women isn't the government; it's God.A must read for anyone wanting to show other women's accounts of the feminist movement and the Equal Rights Admendment.",
