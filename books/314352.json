  "description": "Hayley is an Omega wolf. Submissive, low-ranking, and considered less than nothing by her previous pack. Which is why she ran away, fleeing their abusive Alpha. Now, all she wants is to make a life that she can be proud to live.Cole and Ryland are two Alphas without a pack. With Cole's unpredictable wolf and Ryland's suspicious combination of witch and tiger shifter blood, and the fact that you can't have one without the other, it's too much for most packs to handle permanently. Instead, they roam from place to place as enforcers, a final solution when a wild wolf needs to be taken down.When they find Hayley, at first they're not sure if she's a spy from the pack they're trying to hunt down or a victim, but either way they need her. Inconveniently, in more ways than one.If Hayley can be strong enough to help them, maybe she can overcome her past. And if she can be strong enough to trust again, maybe she can find a way to the life she wants to live.SILVER MOON RISING is the first book of new erotic fantasy reverse harem romance series OMEGA WOLF!Content warnings include graphic sex scenes, multiple partners, some light dominance, discussions of past abuse without detail, some violence.",
