  "description": "Across Hayden's neck sat an ugly scar, a vivid reminder of what she'd become. She looked horribly wild, untamed, her eyes too bright and focused, like an animal. In order to keep her family safe from both herself and the enemies she attracts, Hayden must trade a life of normalcy for one of constant uncertainty and threat. Expecting to find her place among others like her, she soon realizes that even among werewolves, she's an exception. Burdened with constant discrimination and falling into a dangerous attraction, Hayden must struggle to find her footing after being made a pawn in a game between two powerful Alphas.",
