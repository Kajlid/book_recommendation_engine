  "description": "I may have sworn off groupies, but a man has needs. My surly next door neighbor is the first woman to get me going in years. Too bad she’s playing hard to get.  JENNY  I’ve been hurt before. The safest thing to do is to hole up with my dog Basil in my grandmother's little cottage by the sea and bake my heart out.  When the obnoxious, mega-rich rock star starts building his house next door, I hate him on sight. For some perverse reason, Slade Kinney keeps trying to charm his way into my pants.  Sorry honey, that’s never going to happen.  SLADE  I’m worshipped by millions. They scream my name and offer me anything I want. But I turn them all down. Until I meet her.  Jenny has her cute little sugar coated fingers wrapped around my heart. If I have to lower my guard completely to get her, I will.  I'll do anything to make her mine.   This short story was previously released under a different title. It has been extensively rewritten and expanded. It has a guaranteed HFN!  If you ask nicely, I might even turn it into a full length novel!  Enjoy! Xoxox, Joanna",
