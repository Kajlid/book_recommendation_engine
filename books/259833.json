  "description": "Things had been ticking along quite nicely. My teachers suddenly started talking to me about going to college, my mum had ditched her rubbish boyfriend, and I had a gorgeous new girlfriend. You know that bit in a film when they show couples laughing and holding hands and kissing in lots of different places while a song plays? Alicia and I were like that, except we didn't go to lots of different places. We went to about three, including Alicia's bedroom. Anyway, it took years for everything to come together like that, and it took two seconds to screw it all up. One mistake and my life would never be the same.When the wheels come off the trucks and your life slams into a wall... who do you turn to then? I turn to Tony Hawk. You maybe would not expect the world's best skater to know everything you need to know about hour life, but he does. And if you don't understand what he's saying, then he'll just whizz you into the future.",
