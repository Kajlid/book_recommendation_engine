  "description": "Mikayla’s men are keen to start their family, but when things go wrong, can Mikayla really keep eight husbands happy? Feeling sad and rundown, and trying desperately to hide it from her men, Mikayla is glad to have some time on Earth with her best friend, Tracey. Her husbands Brock and John travel with her, but their concerns ratchet higher when they overhear her conversation.With the news of the mouse tears aphrodisiac properties somehow leaked to the public, the jungle planet is now being raided on a daily basis. Lachlan and Bryce are spending more time rescuing raiders from their own stupidity than getting geological surveys done and are starting to wonder if this contract is even worth the effort.To make matters worse, Peter's ex-fiancée is stirring up trouble again, and it seems someone on the jungle planet has an unusual plan for a couple of Mikayla's men.",
