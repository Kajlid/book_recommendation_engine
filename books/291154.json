Turns out he's been poisoned, and it seems like everybody on the tour is hiding something. Now Poppy has to put her gluten-free baking on the back burner and bottle up her feelings for the two men in her life while she charges after a bitter killer with a lethal case of sour grapes . . .Includes Seven Recipes from Poppy's Kitchen!\"Fans of Chopped will have fun juggling the complicated set of suspects and following a romantic triangle that has yet to be resolved.\"--\nKirkus Reviews\n on \nRestaurant Weeks Are Murder",
