  "description": "Also see: Alternate Cover Editions for this ISBN [ACE]  \nACE #1\nFrom girlhood, Lady Caroline Foster knew what her future held: marriage to an esteemed viscount, followed by a dignified high-society life. A sedate existence perhaps, but certainly preferable to her current state--jilted, humiliated, and then hastily bartered off to a man old enough to be her grandfather. Dreading the marriage, Caroline seeks advice from her ex-fiancé's illegitimate brother, whose potent sexuality has always intrigued her…  Ian Clayton can scarcely believe that the woman he's coveted from afar is boldly seeking sexual instruction. A true gentleman would turn her away, but the yearning he feels for Caroline surpasses anything he's ever known. Soon their encounters become more heated, more daring…and more dangerous. For someone will stop at nothing to end their illicit affair--and destroy a fantasy that is coming blissfully, brazenly to life…",
