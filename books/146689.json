  "title": "Alien Invasion: Inside Area 51",
  "description": "This book is a set of interviews I made across the United States and the United Kingdom and I’m probably the very first journalist to have accessed Area 51.I didn’t know, when I started this investigation, where it would lead me, but what I’ve seen in the underground levels is really scary. If you ever wondered if we are alone in this universe, the answer is No. Aliens are closer than you could imagine.I have dedicated my entire life to reporting stories and events through newspapers and that’s what I do for a living; I’m not going to stop now. However, in order to protect my life, I decided to have this book written under a pseudonym. Throughout the course of this book I will make specific reference to facts that are clearly recognisable and that you can cross-reference. My only hope is that you will take action NOW and start protecting yourselves and the people around you.Patrick M. Mariano",
