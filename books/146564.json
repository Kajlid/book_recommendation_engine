The witch had other plans…  Clearly is corrupted, and if that wasn’t enough, the witch has possessed her, working restlessly to live again in Clearly’s body. Victor and his friends must find a way to stop her before the rise of the Blood Moon, which is less than a month away. If They fail, everything Victor has worked so hard to achieve will have been for not and much more than Clearly’s life will be lost.",
