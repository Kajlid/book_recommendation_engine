  "title": "The Dragons' Beads: A Treasury",
  "description": "What do you get when dragons combine their hoards? What do you get when you take a little slice of dragon lore?  “The Dragons' Beads\" features the work of Elizabeth Buckley, Niels Van Eekelen, Athena Garcia, Ollie Lambert, Douglas J. Moore, Meghan Proctor, Jo Anne Spiese, Kristina Stumpf & Michael Camp, and Rachel Wookey.  This is the first volume of what is hoped to be a multi volume project highlighting essays, art, poetry, and short stories featuring and/or about dragons. Originally it was supposed to be a contest to highlight the best dragon stories and poems from young authors. The project had to be adjusted due to an initial lack of submissions. Perhaps future volumes will be able to have more competition, and it is hoped that in the future THG StarDragon Publishing will be able to afford having cash prizes to fuel writer's interest in exchange for featuring the “beads\" of their stories.",
