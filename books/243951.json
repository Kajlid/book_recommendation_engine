  "title": "Madness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis",
  "description": "A highly critical account of the misguided attempts on the part of some members of the psychiatric profession of the 1950s and 60s to attribute mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, autism, and obsessive-compulsive disorder to cold, contradictory, or otherwise unwholesome parenting. The author incorporates the personal stories of parents who endured criticism for making their children sick, only to find themselves vindicated when the biological origins of these conditions were identified.
