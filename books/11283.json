When she takes on the protection of a science geek for a vampire clan, she doesn’t expect her temporary girlfriend status to come with lots of pleasure. But a geeky human who pushes all her right buttons—and plays her body oh so right—isn’t reason enough for her to break the rules and fall in love.Everything changes after an incident in the lab, but before she can decide if it’s safe to give him her heart, she has to help him survive.",
