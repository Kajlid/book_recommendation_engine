Six weeks ago I was broke, alone, and about to be homeless. Six weeks ago I had zero intention of moving back to Winchester, Colorado—aka Mayberry on crack. Six weeks ago a one-night stand had never crossed my mind. Now? I threw that all out the window for him. He’s tall, dark, and handsome—with a body made for sin. Hard, fast, and dirty bar bathroom sex has to be experienced at least once, right? It’s only my luck he’s also my boss and best friend’s older brother. Barrett Brooks doesn't believe a woman belongs on a construction site, especially with his company on the line. I'll prove him wrong—let's just hope I don't fall back into bed with him in the process.",
