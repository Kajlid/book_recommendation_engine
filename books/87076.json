  "description": "In turn of the century London, a handful of men, members of the exclusive Lords of Aether club, discover that the English Imperial Empire is under assault by a nebulous enemy. Murders of key figures in the criminal underworld abound and innocent men are framed for the crimes. Government officials change their stance on political issues overnight following the near death experiences of those close to them. Experiments related to aether are covered up. Inventors and others with military knowledge have mysteriously disappeared. Strange banking and finance issues cripple the Empire. As the government’s funds dry up, crime rises, signaling approaching anarchy. Something dire is afoot and disparate clues lead to one dead end after another for the Lords of Aether. The search for a missing lover becomes the painstaking uncovering of a plot against the world’s governments that begins with the crippling of the English Imperial Empire. The Lords of Aether battle their own demons and personal issues as they work together to discover just who is behind the ingenious and nefarious plot. When their investigations lead them to an ancient arcane society they find more chaos and evil than they ever imagined existed. A master criminal with ties to the Imperial family, unlimited wealth and resources, and no conscience leads them down a twisted path of destruction and deception. The Lords of Aether must pool their own resources, call upon their trusted friends and family members, and work together to save the Empire and the world.",
