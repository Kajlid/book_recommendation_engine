Now I owe six months of debt to a dangerously sexy Fae hitman.Iâ€™d had everything a dryad could want- a job, an apartment, and a scandalous human boyfriend-Until I stole the wrong fruit from the wrong Fae.Dragged into the Seelie underworld of deception and lies, I do anything he commands: steal, spy, even fight as we hunt down a notorious Fae fugitive.Not exactly the fun I was looking for, despite the intense attraction between us.But when the mission ends, I may not want to leave.Dark and Wicked Fae is a Hades and Persephone-inspired Fae reverse harem romance, with high steam and a harem that builds over time. For mature readers only.",
