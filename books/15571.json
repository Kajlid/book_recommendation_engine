  "description": "Every family has its secrets. For the Callaghans, this burden is more intimate than most; for they have kept their secret from the world, from each other and even from themselves. The once proud and strong family is not what Maggie remembers. The distance between she and her brothers has grown until they barely know each other. As adults they continue to suffer the consequences of their childhood in very different ways. Only Maggie is blissfully unaware of the painful memories the rest share. Maggie Callaghan Stewart has a good life, a successful husband and two beautiful little boys. Then recurring nightmares invade the calm and her strange behaviors concern her loved ones. With no other choice, Maggie begins to seek meaning behind these nightmares. Patrick, Mickey and Aiden Callaghan have long struggled with the secret of their past. They each live different lives, quite separate from each other, yet one thing connects them completely. As their sister struggles to find herself, their own tentative reality is threatened. Now they must confront their past and reconcile it with their present lives. For Maggie, what starts off as a bad dream will threaten the very facade her family has carefully constructed. Fighting to remember her past may prove more than Maggie can bear. The lies that have become truths unravel and they face a reality they thought they escaped many years ago when Echo Island calls them back once more.\"",
