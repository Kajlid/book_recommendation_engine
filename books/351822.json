  "title": "The Brand New Monty Python Papperbok",
  "description": "One of the most original and groundbreaking humor classics of all time, the Papperbok was compiled for Methuen in the early 1970s by the young Monty Python team at the height of their surreal powers and was published on the heels of the improbable success of the Monty Python's Flying Circus television series. A surreal delight, the Papperbok was a testing ground for ideas equally as fresh and funny as the Flying Circus material. It is full of colorful and rude illustrations by Terry Gilliam, oddball instruction sheets, cod schoolboy stories about adventure and mischief, misleading horoscopes, informative and thrilling features-such as \"Hamster: A Warning,\" \"The Python Book of Etiquette,\" and \"The London Casebook of Detective Ren Descartes\"-zany competitions, fake editorials, spurious film reviews, and some of the oddest miscellany ever pressed between the pages of a book. The extraordinary comic genius of Monty Python is on full display in this humor classic, too-long unavailable and now back by popular demand.",
