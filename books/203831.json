  "description": "While \"Whale\" begins with Chunhee, a mysterious young brickmaker of imposing physicality who cannot speak, introduced a the Queen of Red Bricks, it quickly situates her story within a longer multi-generational saga composed of three parts. While we learn of Chunhee s tragic path to her becoming someone who makes bricks of the highest quality, the novel retraces the familial circumstances that shaped her. While poignant yet brutal, \"Whale\" is also a satire of how we the general public, mass media, even artists and writers tend to romanticize voiceless figures of history.\"",
