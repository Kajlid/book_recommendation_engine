  "description": "As a semi-pro fighter and free spirit, Fray doesn't have a care in the world, until a secret group begins abducting supernatural teens in the Blue Hills of North Carolina for excruciating experiments. Will Fray, a leopard shapeshifter, and her unlikely allies rescue the children before they are dissected alive? Fray will do whatever it takes to stop her world from changing -including confronting personal prejudices and a brooding ex- but the ultimate sacrifice forces her to realize just how overdue change is. Her most shocking discovery: Everyone's human. At least a little... Fans of Laurell K. Hamilton are sure to love the 'no surrender' attitude of FRAYED.",
