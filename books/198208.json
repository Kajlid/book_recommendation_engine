  "title": "Atheism Is Stupid",
  "description": "Atheism is a social phenomenon that has existed for quite some time. It presents itself as the antithesis of theism. The version we see today stems from affluent Europeans during the so-called 'Enlightenment' period. This atheistic propaganda comes across as chic and convincing despite being based on misconceptions and fallacious conclusions. In this book, atheism is dissected, scrutinized and exposed as being irrational, without substance and 'stupid' by the author who has personal experience with atheism. Readers who believe in God will benefit from the dismantling of atheistic fallacies and misconceptions while objective atheists will question their own atheism.",
