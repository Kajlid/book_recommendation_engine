  "title": "Going with Gabriel",
  "description": "Going with Gabriel is about a man's flight from his own, frighteningly important scientific discovery into what is for him a new world; a world of music and the power of music. It is also about that man's conscience and about freedom and the lack of it and about love and the lack of love. Having left behind his past life Gabriel can keep moving with his new friend Sonny Ojitsu but can he preserve his anonymity along the open road? Not if a celebrity obsessed media has anything to do with it. Definitely not if they should get to hear the faintest echo of Doctor Gabriel Nicolson's abandoned science.",
