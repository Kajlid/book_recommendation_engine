  "description": "Jason Quick lives in a quiet little fishing on the English coast. Nothing ever happens there, if you don’t count the children who go missing. From the moment they can walk, children are told, “Don’t go over the tracks and into the fog.” Some don’t listen, go into the fog and are never seen again.A Year ago, Jason's little brother chased a ball across the tracks and never came back. Jason is tired of waiting for someone to do something and wants to find his brother. He's willing to do whatever it takes, even if that means going into the fog to do it, but is he prepared for what he finds?",
