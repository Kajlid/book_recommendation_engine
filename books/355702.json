  "description": "A phenomenally popular vampire romance sequence - now showing on ITV2 - from the best selling author of Night World, L. J. Smith. Surviving through countless centuries, Alisa is beautiful, strong and ...deadly. Kalika has transformed into a bloodthirsty killer with powers far greater than her mother's. So, Alisa faces a heartbreaking decision -- to save her daughter or the rest of the world. But perhaps things are not quite as they appear to be and the lines between good and evil seem blurred -- can Alisa decide the right path in time? Her decision will lead her back to the very start -- the day 5,000 years previously when she met the first vampire. Alisa must confront her darkest fears and ensure the first vampire never comes into being. But without a first vampire, there will also be no her. Is this really a choice she can make?",
