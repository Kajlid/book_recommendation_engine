  "description": "When my magic suddenly awakens and uninvited guests crash my birthday party, the Fae royal guard saves me... And kidnaps me.These irresistible, protective Fae want to whisk me away to their enchanted realm. A world that’s fading without its queen — me. To save the Tree of Life and Fae magic, I’ll need to bond with five consorts, one of each Fae kind: A tall, ancient Elf. A powerful, charming Kitsune. A playful, flirtatious Nixie. A bookish, reclusive Duwende. And a moody but magnetic Veela.Until my birthday, I thought I was human, and I had no idea magic is real. To make matters worse, not everyone wants me to take the throne — and the enemy is hunting me.Instead of graduating college, it’s time to find out if an inexperienced young Fae like me can really save a world I never knew existed.No pressure, right?Our Fae Queen is a deliciously slow-burn, steamy reverse harem fantasy romance with a reluctant queen and slow-build relationships spanning the series. Spice level, M/M content, and poly themes increase as this new adult series progresses. Now a complete series! Our leading lady will bond with five Fae consorts by the end.
