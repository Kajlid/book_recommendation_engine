  "title": "Blazing Academy: Semester One",
  "description": "When the element of fire burns within your veins, the academy for all things scorching is the best place to learn how to make that flame burn even hotter.    Alice Blaze is my name, and I'm not exactly your typical sixteen-year-old. My mom disappeared after my birth and my dad was an alcoholic maniac, so I was raised by my protective grandparents in the single house up the hill. The one people only come to visit on Halloween.   Because, yeah, apparently, our house is haunted. Naturally.   As an orphan living in a spooky house, it’s no surprise that my life has been…eventful. I’ve been inadvertently causing trouble since I was little and it always ends up with something combusting into flames. You know, lighting up the curtains, exploding vials in lab class. And don't get me started with the accidental school fire. Need I say more?  The flames really hit the fan when I'm accused of shattering all the windows in the entire school. Of course, that doesn't make sense because it has nothing to do with my burning nemesis. But it doesn’t matter. Expulsion is imminent and my grandparents are fed up with my constant transfers.  But then something amazing happens: a letter of invitation lands right onto our doorstep.   Or should I say window?    I'm invited to Blazing Academy, the school for all things — and people — that are scorching hot. Shifters, demons, and blazing hot witches...oh, right. I almost left that part out. According to the school, that’s what I am. A blazing hot witch.    Let's hope that's all I am, and that this first semester goes a whole lot smoother than I'm imagining. Otherwise, my whole life might just go up in smoke.",
