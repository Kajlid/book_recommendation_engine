  "description": "My name is Ace Bissett, and I used to think magic was a hoax. Now I’ve got four dark, sexy gargoyles at my beck and call, magic bursting from my fingertips, and a curse that’s proving ridiculously hard to break. Juggling all of that would be a challenge on its own, but when you add in my day job as a detective? It’s almost impossible.But all of that stuff is the least of my worries. A new threat has risen in my city, and it looks like the murderer is going after anyone with an interest in the occult. That makes me the perfect person to stop him…but also the perfect target. And the deeper I dig, the more I realize that this isn’t an accident. The murderer is trying to get my attention, and if I don’t unmask him soon, this could be the end for not just me, but the four gargoyles who have become more important to me than life itself…",
