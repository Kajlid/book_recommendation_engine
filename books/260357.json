  "description": "Matthew Bexley is the unquestioned darling of the London theatre scene, and is now primed to take the small screen with a new television series. Engrossed in his preparations, another offer comes through his agent, to work with a man Matt has known intimately in the past. Colin Walls -- erstwhile recluse, brilliant playwright and director, and secret sadist -- has a part for Matt in his latest play. The only catch is that Matt must join him for a week at his countryside cottage to prepare.Matt enjoys wearing expensive women's underthings almost as much as he enjoys rough sex and stern discipline, and Colin is only too happy to oblige his proclivities.This work is distinguished by its exquisite prose and lavish depictions of secret kinks. Domestic drudgery, strict discipline, fabulous lingerie, and a creative use of yard clippings can all be found here. Mature and adventurous readers only.",
