  "title": "The Sound I Saw",
  "description": "Let legendary photographer Roy DeCarava lead you through the dark, moody, and exciting world of New York jazz in the 1960s. Photographed 30 years ago and not published until now, The Sound I Saw is a saunter through a poignant period of New York musical history and life experience. Vacant lots and sweaty musicians dot a cultural landscape that looks as if it's going to burst at the seams. The beautiful black-and-white images simultaneously capture hard and luscious life in the city. Lonely figures abound, on park benches, street corners, stages, and subways. The music appears and strives to make intense connections with the surrounding world. A delirious trumpet player works so hard you can almost feel him move the camera. This beautiful coffee-table size book has one striking picture after another, each capturing heartfelt experiences of life in the great city. From jam sessions to candy stores, the streets of New York appear choreographed to reveal the depths of the human spirit. --J.P. Cohen",
