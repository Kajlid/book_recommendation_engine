The time has come to put their powers to use for good, but, what is good? *Who* is good?With those unanswered questions heavy on their minds, the Cavies fly to Saint Petersburg, Russia to do their part.What they find there is a complication they never expected, in the form of people they never guessed existed…even though one of them is a trusted friend.Gypsy and the Cavies will have to make the right alliances in the thick of a lethal showdown, and making wrong choice could do more than expose them. It could kill them.",
