  "title": "Scenting Scandal",
  "description": "The second in my scandal series with heroines whose scientific knowledge and intellect are an affront to early Victorian's increasingly staid society. The family's second sister, Lady Laura Jamison, uses her extraordinary olfactory senses to sniff out her perfect match, a husband who fits all her scientific criteria. The earl, with whom she's forced to co-operate in order to stop a mad-woman bent on destroying legitimate share investors in Britain's railways, evades marriage with someone as beautiful and intelligent as her, fearing she'll uncover his shameful childhood secret. But by accepting each other's strengths and weakness, Laura and Richard discover a passion neither counted on.",
