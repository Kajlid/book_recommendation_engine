  "description": "Things are never quite what they seem. On the corner, just down the street is a coffee house. You’ve seen it before. Maybe you haven’t paid very much attention to it, after all there are coffee houses on every corner. But this one is different, a little eclectic, the perfect place for all the artsy types. Writers, thinkers, musicians and artists congregate there each day. From early morning to late in the evening, something is going on. Did you know that each of them has a story to be told? Each day is a little window into the life of someone you don’t even know. So join me as we enter The Coffee House and take a peek into the life of a few of the regulars. Who knows, you might make a friend or two.",
