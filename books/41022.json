My two besties, Cassie and Lila, are now officially parentally banned.No summer of freedom . Instead, I'll be working at a convenience store, earning money just so I can cover bail.No future . Just a series of humiliating \"rehabilitation techniques\" designed to teach me a lesson.The only silver lining is Aaron--a mystery wrapped in a leather jacket andwielding car keys--who just happens to show up right when I need him. Now I only feel alive when we're driving together, the wind in my hair.Maybe finally getting a life only happens once you think your life is over.",
