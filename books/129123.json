This charming inn is nestled out in the Sonoran Desert on the Apace Trail close to the foreboding Superstition Mountains which are said to be the home of the legendary Lost Dutchman Mine. Some say the inn sits at the top of an energy vortex that has ties to the mine. And this just may be the reason for all of the paranormal activity .You may find some of the guests who come to the inn are as strange as the inn itself.The inn was a gift left to a family of three – a divorced mother, daughter and son - one of those being Dean Banks, a young fifteen year old boy who comes to find out he has inherited a supernatural gift of power from a long ago Apache ancestor and is destined to be the Guardian of the mine. He feels this is more of a curse than a gift. With these powers come some pretty unnatural occurrences for Dean as he acquires the ability to gain superhuman strength along with mystical powers which enable him to thwart any attempts from anyone who tries to discover the whereabouts of the mine. Dean fears his new responsibility and also is terrified of the possibility of harming someone. He tries to remain a normal teenage boy as he enjoys his life riding in the desert and hanging out with his newfound friends, which leads him to befriend a mysterious old miner who holds the key to some of Dean’s past . One guest in particular is onto Dean’s secrets and is out to destroy the Red Coyote Inn and possibly Dean himself.",
