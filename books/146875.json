  "title": "Misdirection",
  "description": "Misdirection is the first novel in a series of international crime thrillers. High-tech and action packed, this may seem like the stuff of science fiction; however, the series features amazing new technology that actually exist in the world today.When we first encounter the series’ narrator, Lucas Norton, he’s riding his bicycle through a sleeting rain, heading to his office in the British Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) complex in Cheltenham, England.Meet the new James Bond. He has all the high-tech toys Britain’s MI5 security service has developed at his disposal, but he’s just a regular guy dealing with a promotion and marital problems, in addition to one hell of a caper.Lucas’s first assignment at MI5 is to chase down a lead that consists of an e-mail containing four high-level keywords, a barely-intelligible phone call made from the same smartphone from which the e-mail was sent, and a cryptic numerical text.From this limited amount of information, the team quickly surmises that, rather than an act of terror, as was first feared, this is a high-target heist, organized by a very sophisticated operation, and it is already in motion. The question is, where?With each clever twist and turn of the story line, you will be trying to solve the case before Lucas and some of the world’s best security experts do, as they chase down a daring plot to make off with $48 million—right under their noses. Despite all their technology and brainpower, MI5 is one step behind the perpetrators.",
