  "description": "Joanna Archer is back.  From New York Times bestselling author Vicki Pettersson comes THE REORDERING, an all-new, action-packed novella, and sequel to the NYT Bestselling Signs of the Zodiac series.  Joanna Archer is a superhero…or would be if she hadn’t blown up the underpinnings of the entire supernatural underworld and walked away. With the promise of new life stirring in her body, and her lover, Hunter Lorenzo, firmly at her side, Joanna believes she’s earned her hard-won peace. Yet when her mother, Zoe, is reported missing, Joanna must take up arms once again and return to Las Vegas. Because there is a Reordering of the Zodiac world underway…and a powerful new evil rising from the rubble she left behind.  Never before published, THE REORDERING is a 25,000 word original novella.",
