  "description": "Chloe needs a man to pose as her fiancé for a few weeks, so she asks her roommate, Brent, to take on the role. He might be shy, but he's a good guy, and he'll do anything to help her out.  Because she's grateful, she wants to do something for Brent in return, and there's only one thing he needs from her. He has no experience with women. None. At all. So Chloe decides to give him lessons.  It's supposed to be a friendly, casual thing, but Brent makes her feel better about herself than any man ever has. So Chloe wonders if their fake relationship can be real.",
