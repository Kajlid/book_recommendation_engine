Living only by the code of steel, blood and coin, and aided by fightbrews that gave them the edge in battle, whoever met their price won.Now, broken up and seemingly forgotten, they are being hunted down, one by one.Drawn from multiple accounts compiled by a scholar investigating the legendary group's demise, who is also the son of one of the Twenty, Snakewood is fantasy at its most inventive and rewarding.",
