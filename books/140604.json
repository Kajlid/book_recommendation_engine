  "description": "When you’re young, single, and naïve enough to believe that pleather is perfectly-acceptable business attire, New York City is one big playground. Natalie Pepper is savvy enough to know landing a job as marketing director at an up-and-coming Internet company was sheer luck. But when she falls for her handsome and charming co-worker, she’s not sure her luck will hold out, and losing the job will mean packing her bags and moving back in with Daddy. Not an attractive option. Thanks to her company’s “no fraternization” policy, the brainchild of her insane supervisor, Natalie must choose between the job and the man of her dreams. Natalie’s impetuous and spirited friend Lulu Rossi has no such choice to make. She knows exactly what she wants and isn’t afraid to go after it at three-hundred miles an hour. It’s just that sometimes the world doesn’t seem to be on the same page. Lulu falls in love hard and fast, and her newest boyfriend is just as smitten. It’s his mother, the less-than-friendly old-money definition of Upper East Side royalty, who needs convincing. In Highballs in the Hamptons, Natalie is forced to decide what is important to her for once and for all. Will it be love or her career? And Lulu must prove her worth to Andrew’s family—or make him see that the only person whose opinion really matters is his. Highballs in the Hamptons is the hilarious second book in Stewart’s Girlfriends of Gotham Series.",
