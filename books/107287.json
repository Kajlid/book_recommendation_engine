Their pasts have been dragged to the surface and they seem to have worked through it all. They want to live for the here and now. That is, until Claire Dubois, Donovan’s psycho ex, is released from prison after having her trial overturned for killing her husband. Claire and her equally nasty crew of Frank, her stepson, and Donna, Donovan’s stepmother, stay hot on the lovers’ trails, following their scent everywhere they go and causing a path of destruction along the way. When the well being of Allie’s son, Jackson, is threatened, the two will stop at nothing to protect him. Even if it means putting their lives on the line. But with Claire around, you know things won’t go down without a fight. All hell is about to break loose as Donovan and Allie fight to save each other from the grips of this evil woman’s clutches. Who will win this battle for love?",
