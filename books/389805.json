  "description": "Halisstra Melarn has lived her life in the service of Lolth, every second knowing she would spend her endless afterlife at her godess's side. Serving the capricious whims of a chaotic demon goddess was never easy, but it promised great reward. Now the Spider Queen is gone, and she may never come back. What then? For one priestess, turning her back on the goddess who abandoned her might be her only way out, her only way to escape oblivion. While Pharaun, Quenthel, Jeggred, Danifae, and Valas search for a way into the burning infinity of the Abyss itself, all the while selling each other cheap, Halisstra and Ryld discover a world where life has value and the shadows are free of assassins. But in an effort to survive, will they lose everything it means to be a dark elf? The simple act of asking that question could bring the entire drow race to the brink of extinction. The War of the Spider Queen gets personal.",
