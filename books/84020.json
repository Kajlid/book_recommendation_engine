  "description": "He was her best friend...until he became her fantasy.A More Than story. Lucy Lawson's got it bad. Bad as in stunned speechless by the situation she's in, by the feelings sitting on her chest, ready to explode. She's in love...with her best friend. Problem is, telling Sebastian Blackford could destroy the best thing in her life, but the longer she keeps her feelings under wraps, the stronger the need to spill her secret. The last thing Seb suspects is that his best mate is madly, wildly in love with him, or that he's the star of her seriously dirty fantasies. Worse, he's just started seeing someone he'd like to see again--and Lucy knows it. So why does her confession hit him like a runaway train? And why can't he get her explicit description of her fantasies out of his mind? They've never been more than friends, but now that he knows how Lucy feels, everything is out of whack. Seb figures it's up to him to get their relationship back on track. He'll do it too, just as soon as he establishes which track is the right one.  After reading this, you may just be tempted to jump your best friend. It's recommended you keep your partner on speed dial or a toy with fresh batteries on standby.",
