  "description": "GAD'S HALL When a house comes up for sale at a ridiculously low price there has to be a catch. Doesn't there? Some sort of legal problem. More prosaically, rising damp or subsidence. But Gad's Hall had none of these problems; it was modernised and in good condition. Mr. Thorley, the vendor, had his reasons for the sale and the price so Jill and Bob Spender were happy to make the purchase. What Mr. Thorley did not--could not--know was that there was an unseen occupant in Gad's Hall which had already caused darkness and death and was poised to do so again... THE HAUNTING OF GAD'S HALL An attic room which shouldn't be opened. An eight-year-old girl whose talent for painting turns... darker. An age-old presence which is about to be let loose, once more to wreak its horrors on the unsuspecting occupants of Gad's Hall.",
