Donna's eating her lunch and minding her own business when a case of mistaken identity puts her squarely in the sights of Rev. Silo's hired guns. Now she's on the run and in hiding with the Drunk Monkeys. Victor and Uni aren't sure about the clueless bank teller at first...until she proves to them how invaluably smart she really is.

But an ice storm bearing down on Atlanta grinds everything to a halt. Terrifying events force Donna to re-evaluate her life and her priorities, and drive her into a tragic situation from which there's no turning back. Unfortunately, nothing good comes without great cost. With the stakes turning deadly, will she lose one of her men before she even gets to know him? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
