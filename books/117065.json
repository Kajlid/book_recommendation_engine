  "title": "Once Upon A Christmas: a heartwarming story of a woman's desire and determination that brings everyone home for Christmas.",
  "description": "Upon arriving on the rough Texas Frontier, with her two sons and a trunk full of dreams for a new life, Olivia Pritchett discovers the man she was to marry has died. The prospect of the long trip back from where she came, to make her boys spend Christmas traveling, is too painful to face. With all her strength, she prevails upon her fiancé's partner to allow her and her boys to see the place where they had pinned all their hopes, and to be able to spend at least Christmas at the ranch that was to be her home.  Monroe Locket wants no part of a widow-woman mail-order bride, nor her snot-nosed boys. He can’t manage to deny her, however, and nothing he does seems to daunt her. Olivia is one determined woman, who makes biscuits better than any two angels trying hard in heaven, and who manages to bring Christmas right along with her.  Once Upon A Christmas is a revised edition of a novella long out of print. With it, Curtiss Ann Matlock once again gives us a space to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the holidays, to lift our hearts, and to experience the joy beyond reason.***originally appeared in the anthology 1993 Keepsake Christmas Stories",
