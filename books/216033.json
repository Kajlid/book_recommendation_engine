Facing a mountain of unpaid bills, a car on its last legs, and imminent eviction, he doesn't stand a chance with Pam, a sexy waitress/actress on the hunt for a man with means. Enter Scamz, a slick brother from Dante's past cruising L.A. in custom-tailored suits and a Benz CL600. He's got a job that'll put Dante back on top—especially with Pam. Seduced by easy money, she's finding Dante suddenly irresistible. But then the perfect sting goes horribly wrong, and a dangerous game is just beginning.",
