  "description": "Shifting shadows. Macabre murders. And a glorious garden. The Date is 1207.One of Sir Aumary Belvoirâ€™s unpopular villeins lies murdered in his own home. Has the daughter with whom he recently quarrelled finally broken and killed him? Has her lover dispatched him so that they can be free to marry? What does his death have to do with a missing will and a disputed patch of ground in Savernake, the forest of which Sir Aumary Belvoir is warden?To make matters worse, King John desires a garden to be built close to the castle in Marlborough and the townsmen are bitterly opposed. Aumary must be able to keep the peace and placate his King.As the deaths pile up, Aumary realises, contrary to his belief, that which he sees with his very own eyes, cannot possibly be the truth.Have you ever wondered what might be the story behind some of our most beloved ancient folk songs? This, the eleventh in the series, offers a novel interpretation of this sweet song.",
