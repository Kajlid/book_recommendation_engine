Once the most famous musician of his generation, celebrated as a man beloved of the gods, his voice is now silent, his hands ruined, his music that offered beauty and hope to war-torn Elyria destroyed.

To discover the truth, he must risk his hard-bought freedom to unlock the mind of his god and the heart of his enemy.",
