  "description": "When the past forms the future, how does a woman with few memories survive?  No longer nameless or alone, Tate has put down roots in the city of Aurelia. She’s found a home, friends and a misfit family. When an assassination attempt leads to a dangerous loss of control over her dragon, Tate is sent to the farthest reaches of the empire on a mission she can’t refuse.  It isn’t long before Tate stumbles into her usual brand of trouble. Kidnapped and separated from her closest allies, Tate will have to find a way to survive old enemies and new acquaintances.  Piecing together the tattered remnants of her past might be the only thing separating her from death. Enemies long thought dead are returning and they won’t be satisfied until they have Tate’s head.",
