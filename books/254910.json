  "description": "Samantha Ward hops a westbound train, risking everything to rescue her swindler father. When her train is robbed and she is taken hostage, she escapes. Alone in the wilderness, she comes across a lone cowboy and steals his horse and the shirt right off his perfectly sculpted back. But just as she falls for Jesse Colburn, she learns of a devastating connection behind her father’s disappearance and the rugged rancher who stirs up all kinds of sinful thoughts. Jesse Colburn’s sole desire is to redeem his late father’s good name and save the family legacy, Enchantment Ranch. He must find out who is sabotaging his land and killing his livestock before he loses everything. Revenge is all he cares about until the mysterious spitfire Samantha Ward rides into town—on his horse. Her courage and curves threaten to distract him—until he discovers she may be part of the plot to steal his ranch.",
