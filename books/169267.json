In the garage of a Birmingham, Alabama, monastery, the Eternal Word Television Network grew at a staggering pace under her guidance. Mother Angelica (1923–2016) remains on the air, offering faith-filled advice, hope, and laughter to her audience through rebroadcasts of her original homilies. Raymond Arroyo, through more than five years of exclusive interviews with Mother Angelica, traces her tortuous rise to success and exposes for the first time the fierce opposition she faced, both outside and inside her church.",
