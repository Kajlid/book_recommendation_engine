But in order to defeat an age-old god and his growing army of vicious fiends, Vince will have to take Kinsale’s selection of subdued paranormals and somehow turn them into a first-rate fighting force.To complicate matters, the vampires have made themselves at home in Kinsale, and the city’s recovery is threatened by their escalating violence.

A cunning trap that could destroy the city. An ancient summoning that could destroy the world. A pair of powerful people determined to achieve their dark ambitions. And the only thing standing in the way of all this chaos is a half-fae with a cop badge, a cool sword, and a massive chip on his shoulder.It’s Vincent Whelan versus the forces of absolute destruction, and the odds are far worse than fifty-fifty.What Dawn Demands is the fourth novel of The Frost Arcana, an action-packed urban fantasy series set in a post-apocalyptic world.",
