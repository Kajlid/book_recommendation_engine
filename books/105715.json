She has the near-perfect life, with an amazing husband, and she has it all in the palm of her hand. When her marriage falls into a romantic rut, Stephanie is skillfully swooned by a charming, mysterious and intriguing stranger who looks to be the answer to all of her fantasies. A whirlwind and erotic affair quickly spirals out of control, and before long, she learns that things arenâ€™t always as they appear and people are rarely who they seem.

The Suicide Princess is a sexually charged roller coaster ride where nothing is as it seems and everything is at stake!",
