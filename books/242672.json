  "title": "Deadly Pretty Strangers: One dead body, one bereaved mother, one small favour ...",
  "description": "An ordinary cityworker tries to help out a bereaved old lady. If he’d known it would lead to a confrontation with Russian murderers using an outlawed nerve agent on the streets of London, a pretty sharpshooter with unreliable motives and a deadly spider scuttling around his living room, he’d have kept his front door firmly closed. A long-forgotten genetic research experiment just makes things even stranger. And more deadly.",
