  "description": "Kevin Lewis, author of the bestselling Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo, pairs up with award-winning illustrator S. D. Schindler to create the perfect picture book about a pumpkin on the run.When Buck, Billy, and their little sister Lil spy the biggest pumpkin they've ever seen, they can't resist. Buck and Billy try to roll the pumpkin down the hill to show everyone, but it's too big! Before they know it, it's bumping and thumping and rolling out of control down the hillside. It busts through Momma Baxter's sty and makes her think of pumpkin pie. It knocks over Grandpa Baxter and makes him think of pumpkin soup. And when Poppa Baxter finally stops it in a pumpkin bed, all he can think of is pumpkin bread.",
