  "description": "The Alpha Wolves Motorcycle Club owns my sleepy coastal hometown.  Their inked-up a**hole president owns my heart.  But I’m the mayor’s daughter, his righthand in the office. My whole life, all I’ve ever wanted is to succeed in politics. How can I do that when an outlaw has his tattooed hands wrapped around my heart and body? How can I fight political corruption when I’m in his bed?  There’s a powerful cartel moving in on our town, and I’m afraid that Royal McBride is going to get himself killed. I’m also afraid that he’ll win, that he’ll destroy them, and he’ll destroy me, too, in the best possible way.  This is the story of me, Lyric Rentz, and my daring downfall.  It’s also the story of Serenity Westbrook, and her love for a man with a heart of ice, the emotionless monster that Royal calls his best friend and officer, Glacier “Saint” Nordin.  Two women, two dark men, two dangerous romances.  ***ALPHA WOLVES MOTORCYCLE CLUB is a 4 book set, including almost 400,000 words of story in a complete trilogy and stand-alone spinoff.
