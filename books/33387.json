  "description": "In every perfect life, there comes a time for A Dose of Reality. Pharmaceutical Heiress Chloe Avalon has always had the best of everything. But then again, a perfect wardrobe, the swankiest address, glamorous parties and limitless trust funds are the norm when you live in the realm of the über-rich. The only problem is that all of it has become a tad bit…tedious. But life starts to get a little too interesting when her brother, Luke, sends her an ancient relic—and promptly vanishes. A mysterious voicemail from Luke’s oldest friend (and Chloe’s girlhood crush) adds a new layer of intrigue. Then, on the eve of her 30th birthday, things really begin to fall apart. From Southampton to New York to a private island in the Caribbean, Chloe plunges into a dangerous race against an enemy she never expected and discovers there really are some things that money just can’t buy.",
