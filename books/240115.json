  "description": "She’s a nobody. A street rat. Human. At least, that’s what she tells herself at night.Rhea Greystone is the daughter of a god king. Ruler of the dark and twisted Otherworld where the gods are so powerful they share their souls with Guardians—demigods born to protect their God at all cost. Her mother was one of those Guardians.Being the only heir to the Otherworld throne, Rhea saw first-hand the entitled and immoral lives the gods lived at the expense of the mortals. When her mother died, she escaped the Otherworld to live among humans. A silent nobody disguised as a street kid who roamed the city, far away from the cursed life of the gods.A plan that worked perfectly. Or so she thought.When five commanding demigods claiming to be her Guardians showed up on her eighteenth birthday telling her that her father had been killed and insisted she return to the Otherworld to claim her position as ruler, Rhea has a feeling her time of freedom had run out.",
