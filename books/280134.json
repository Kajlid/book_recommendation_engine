  "description": "A hockey/fake date/not-quite-a-virgin very wrong romantic comedyYou know those stories where an adorably misunderstood clumsy girl needs a fake date to a wedding so she asks her brother’s best friend and they accidentally fall in love?I wish that was the kind of life I lead, but it’s not.I don’t need a date to a wedding. I need a date to a funeral.Clumsy sometimes fits, but then, that’s true for all of us, right? But adorable? No. Misunderstood? Nope again. I’m just your average girl, standing in front of a funeral invitation, asking it to be a winning lottery ticket instead.And I don’t have a brother, or a best friend with a brother available, which means I’m stuck with Tyler Jaeger.Sure, he’s a professional hockey player who also knows advanced calculus, but let’s say we’re not compatible and leave it at that. I should know. I am a matchmaker.Not a very good one, but that’s beside the point.I know a mismatch when I see one.Still, Tyler’s what I’ve got, and I am not going to this funeral solo, so he’s what I’ll take.After all—what could go wrong at a funeral?I Pucking Love You is a hilariously wrong romantic comedy about the world’s worst matchmaker, a hockey player with a problem he doesn’t want to talk about, and an awkward date-of-convenience that everyone would prefer to forget. It comes complete with a cat working his way through his nine lives, all the sexy times, fish and chips, and a swoony happily-ever-after.",
