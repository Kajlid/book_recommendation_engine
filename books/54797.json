  "description": "Francesca Lia Block has charmed and amazed readers with her tales of the mystical and ethereal. This outstanding story is no different. Following the life of Echo, an L.A. baby born to an artistic dad and an angel for a mom, this dreamlike work of magical realism offers more than fairy dust and the supernatural. It tells the tale of a girl who feels doomed to be less than angelic, at least in comparison with her mother, whose startling beauty and aura enchant all who meet her. Desperate to be loved as much, and maybe find her own identity, Echo escapes to the boys in her life. Ultimately, she must rely on herself for the strength to survive.Simple text ands story lines do not appeal to Block, who weaves a tale with amazing grace and the flowing energy of a true genius. Images of vampires, ghosts, and fairies fill these pages, daring the reader to believe.",
