  "title": "The Elusive Mot Juste",
  "description": "In the bucolic hills of rural Massachusetts, Eli Rutherford, the middle-aged, impeccably mannered, pedantic headmaster of an all-boys school engages in a game of scholarly wordplay with the free spirited, bohemian, albeit intelligent young teacher, Dianna Hart. For him, the world is clearly defined by meticulous rules, an exemplary code of conduct, and strict academic decorum. For her, the world is a wonderland, a place to question answers, push boundaries, and explore emotions. Eli has the luxury of an abundant commerce of words - succinct, precise, honest, and exact words that have never failed him, but Dianna proves a formidable opponent during their carefree banter with double entendres, metaphors, haikus, and alliterations. As their verbal tryst evolves beyond the conventions of language, each searches for a more intimate method of expression.",
