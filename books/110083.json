She should be working hard to make sense of her precalculus math class.She shouldn't be waking up her college roommate with screaming nightmares.

And she definitely shouldn't be spending time with sexy player Marcus Reid.But engineering student Marcus is the only one keeping Amber from failing her math course, so she grudgingly lets him into her life. She never expects the king of hookups will share his painful past. Or that she'll tell him her secrets in return, opening up and trusting him in a way she thought she'd never be able to again.When their fragile future together is threatened by a stalker Amber thought was locked away for good, Marcus is determined to protect her--and Amber is determined to protect Marcus...even if that means pushing him away.",
