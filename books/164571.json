  "description": "Discover lavish Netherworld grandeur meets British vampire society in this highly anticipated sequel to the international bestselling novel, Netherworld: The Chronicles of Koa Book One. Not all vampires are created equal... Koa is a half-blood vampire with not only the ability to fly, but survive in the sun's light. She will do anything to protect her mother, and break her curse. The demon, Bund, wants more than her mother's life. He wants something from Koa, a power that she doesn't even know she has, and will rip through as many humans as he can to get her to surrender. Agent Koa Ryeo-won, and her boss, Halston, formed a crew of supernatural agents to stop Bund. But is a prophet, a temptress, a War-Breeder, a half-blood with an enchanted sword, and a few angels enough to stop what Bund has planned? In the midst of a war between the humans of the mortal world, and the creatures of the Netherworld, Koa discovers the truth of her past. She finds herself torn between two men, and in the center of everything. Faced with all of her returned memories, Koa also finds herself more powerful than ever. Being a half-blood is hard enough, but what exactly is Koa's other half? The truth can save...or destroy everything. Will the Netherworld Division stand behind Koa once they learn her secret? **Bonus Material** Chapter 1 of K.N. Lee's young adult fantasy, Academia of the Beast, and chapter one of Lyrinian Blade: The Chronicles of Koa Book Three!",
