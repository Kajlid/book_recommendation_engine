On a fateful summer night in the lavish palace of Versailles, she meets an exotic courtier whose glittering dark eyes promise more than mere temporary relief from a loveless marriage. Angelique is offered the gift of immortality by the ancient vampire prince, and she accepts it with open arms. From Louis XVI's France and Victoria's England to modern London, THE DUCHESS DE NUIT is brimming with lush eroticism, action, and vivid historical details.",
