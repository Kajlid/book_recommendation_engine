  "description": "War has come to the North. The kingdoms of Rogscroft and Delranan are engaged in a bitter struggle that can only result in the total annihilation of an entire kingdom. Yet while the opposing armies battle, a new threat approaches that may tip the balance of power and give King Badron total control. Seeking new evidence of the Dae'shan, the last surviving wizard, Anienam Keiss, believes Bahr and the others are all that stand in the way of the dark gods' return to Malweir. Seeking the only weapon that has the power to stop the dark gods, Bahr, and his beleaguered band of allies, search for an ancient book said to contain the whereabouts of the mythical Blud Hamr. The mystical Dae'shan continue to manipulate the politics of the northern kingdoms from within the shadows, eager to drive the balance between light and good irrevocably evil. Once that balance is undone the way will be open for the dark gods to return and claim Malweir as their own once again. Darkness approaches as the flames of war burn brighter. One king shall stand. One shall fall. Malweir's fate hangs in the balance as a weary band of adventurers struggles to find the Blud Hamr and end this war.",
