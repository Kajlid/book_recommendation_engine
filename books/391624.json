  "description": "Sometimes love's journey begins with a glance, sometimes with a kiss, but some journeys begin with a bite. Sydney Chance has found her eternal destiny in the arms of her lover, vampire Demetri Bastian. Their rocky beginning gives way to an adventure fitting the lifestyle of the undead. They've conquered an enemy who threatened their love and discovered powers and gifts contingent on their immortal bond. Everything is finally just as it should be until they set out for a romantic adventure in the Australian Outback. Upon their arrival, they're met with an unexpected problem, when Connor Ryan, the determined son of a human friend, sets his sights on Sydney and tempts her with more than the taste of his blood. And, after an unexpected attack by rogue vampires on a murderous rampage, their coven must unite to help Connor's family and a local Aboriginal tribe, eradicate the lethal enemy. Can Sydney fight the temptation of forbidden fruit or will bloodlust force her to betray the oath she's made to Demetri? Will an unstable lover from Demetri's past destroy more than cattle, or will her twisted agenda rip Demetri from Sydney's arms forever? The journey may have started with a bite, but it just may end with a bang.",
