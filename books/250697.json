  "description": "Japan is a fascinating country. 125 million people in a country only slightly larger than New Zealand, and just as mountainous. We’ve all seen the TV footage – cramped housing, industrial haze and crowded trains – but what about the “real Japan”? Spectacular mountains, twisting rivers; hidden harbours and rugged coastlines. This is the story of my 99 day walk from one end to the other in search of the “real Japan”. 1993 – what a year to do it! The year of the endless rainy season. The year without a summer. The year of earthquakes, tidal waves and typhoons – and sore feet!",
