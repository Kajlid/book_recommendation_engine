  "description": "Felicity is invited to a dancing lesson at the elegant Governor's Palace, the most wonderful honor she can imagine. Mother promises to make a beautiful new gown for her, just like the one shown on the fashion doll at the milliner's shop. As the splendid event draws near, Mother becomes dreadfully ill. Felicity spends all her days caring for her, sadly accepting that there will be no new gown and no chance to go to the Palace. No chance, that is, until a glorious surprise reminds her that Christmastide is a time when hopes and dreams do come true.",
