  "description": "Harrington Brande lavished all his pompous love on his young invalid son. But months in the Mediterranean sunshine, in the care of the tender gardener, made little Nicholas blossom into an exuberant vitality. Then his father's possessiveness asserted itself...his love became repulsive. He grew cold with the desire to control those around him....From one of the greatest storytellers of this century comes an unforgettable saga of Americans abroad...of the decay of love between husband and wife, the struggle between father and son, the terrible poser of a diplomat bent on destroying those he loved.",
