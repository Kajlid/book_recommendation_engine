  "description": "Cortez Hunter, the modern-day whipping boy. The orphan always walked alongside the man he was destined to shadow, enjoying the wealth, the indulgences, the influence, and the opportunities of the elite. Ezra Holden Zeitler was coddled, protected, because he was the last of his family’s line. The heir would act out, and fearing Ezra’s tantrums and his mental illness, Cortez took the blame, the consequences, and the punishments. From the outside looking in, Cortez is selfish, lazy, and untrustworthy. Cortez tries to scream the truth, but no one ever takes him seriously. Never listens. “Ezra did it!” In actuality, Cort is brutally honest while his lips twist into a charming smirk and his eyes glisten with amusement. This life. This game. Ezra– it has all taken a toll on Cortez. The whipping boy only ever had one thing to call his own. It was inborn, a passion for words. The latest punishment rendered Cortez blocked, left to walk an endless abyss of an empty imagination. Without Cort’s ability to delve into his imaginary worlds, he was forced to live in reality. Lost. Confused. Cortez Hunter struggles to survive. One simple acknowledgement frees Cortez’s frozen words. “Daddy.” The muse awakens from her long slumber, demanding Cortez go back to the beginning…Under the pseudonym Cortez Abernathy, he begins writing a memoir. The Hunter. As Cortez pours his soul onto the pages, he begins to heal. No longer lost or confused, Cortez realizes he doesn’t have to walk in Ezra’s shadow. Whether beside Ezra or without Ezra, Cortez will survive.",
