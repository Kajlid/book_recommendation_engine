  "title": "Marie Pontonnier ~ Montreal Pioneer",
  "description": "For Marie Pontonnier, the choice was clear — stay in her native France and become a nun, or attempt a treacherous journey to the remote outpost of Montréal, Québec, to search for a husband and a new life. In 1656, a 13-year-old orphan, Marie Pontonnier, with a meager dowry and guided only by her deep faith and unwavering optimism, chose the latter. There, menwere plentiful and women were few. She was one of a hearty group of souls referred to as the “Filles a Marier,” the “marriageable girls” recruited to populate the colony. They had no support from King Louis XIV of France, himself just a teenager at the time.Based on a true story, this thoroughly researched novel follows young Marie’s triumphant and tragic tale, transporting the reader to a time where wars raged with the Iroquois Indians and children commonly died shortly after being brought into the world.The King would later realize these women required support and subsequent young ladies recruited to populate the colony would be sent with a dowry. They are well chronicled as the “King’s Daughters.” But the marriageable girls’ stories are all but lost to history. This passionately written novel helps amend this oversight, bringing what we do know of Marie’s turbulent and sweet life to vivid detail, filling in the gaps through rich, imaginative storytelling.",
