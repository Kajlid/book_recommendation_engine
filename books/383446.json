  "description": "When James breaks up with his girlfriend on Valentine's night, he's forced to confront a part of himself that he's done his best to suppress since college, the part that wants sex with another man. Heâ€™s sure he could never share the truth with his conservative family or his best friend Ethan, so in an attempt to figure out if his fantasies are the real thing or just a phaze, he heads out to a local gay club. On the jam-packed dance floor, it's easy just to move to the techno beat and let things happen. But when James turns around to look at the guy giving him a grope, he gets the shock of his life. Now he doesn't know whether he wants to grab happiness with both hands -- or run for his safe, closeted life.",
