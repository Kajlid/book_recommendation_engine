  "description": "SHE LOST EVERYTHING SHE LOVED. HE HAD EVERYTHING SHE NEEDED. BUT COULD SHE FIND THE COURAGE TO TRUST HIM?Stepping from a battered coach on a rainy April eve, newly widowed Elisabeth Kerr must begin again, without husband or title, property or fortune. She is unafraid of work and gifted with a needle, but how will she stitch together the tattered remnants of her life? And who will mend her heart, torn asunder by betrayal and deception? Elisabeth has not come to Selkirk alone. Her mother-in-law, Marjory Kerr, is a woman undone, having buried her husband, her sons, and any promise of grandchildren. Dependent upon a distant cousin with meager resources, Marjory dreads the future almost as much as she regrets the past. Yet joy still comes knocking, and hope is often found in unexpected places. When more than one worthy hero steps forward to woo Elisabeth, she makes a bold choice, then must confess her heart's desire. Will he refuse her out of pride, or surrender to her love?",
