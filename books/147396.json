  "description": "Resistance is no longer an option. My house has a secret. A secret kept behind a closed door. A secret that led my mom to commit murder. Lately, the same secret has begun plaguing me. Voices ring out in the night. Visions appear of people dressed in sweeping ball gowns and elegant top hats, of quiet servants trapped in their love for each other, unable to be together because of their master's obsessive, cruel control--and it all leads back to my mom. Something terrifying happened, something my mom discovered. And the worst part is, I don't think it's over yet. My brother warns me not to open the door--even my best friend, Todd, tells me to ignore this impulse. But I'm tired of ghosts and secrets and lies. All along the answers have been at my fingertips, at the mere turn of a knob. All I have to do is open it. I mean, seriously, would you be able to resist?Hauntingly beautiful and daringly mysterious, if you like intrigue, the newness of first love, and the paranormal twist of the unexpected--all mixed in with a dash of spooky--then open the door to Cortney Pearson's Phobic today.",
