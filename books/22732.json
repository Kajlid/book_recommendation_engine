  "title": "The Vintage Bradbury: The Greatest Stories by America's Most Distinguished Practioner of Speculative Fiction",
  "description": "The author of Fahrenehit 451 and The Martian Chronicles , offers a personal selection of his best stories, featuring “Dandelion Wine,” “The Illustrated Man,” \"The Veldt,\" “The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,” and twenty other classics.American cousin to Borges and Garcia Marquez, Ray Bradbury is a writer whose vision of the world is so intense that the objects in it sometimes levitate or glow with otherworldly auras. Who but Bradbury could imagine the playroom in which children's fantasies become real enough to kill? The beautiful white suit that turns six down-and-out Chicanos into their ideal selves? Only Bradbury could make us identify with a man who lives in terror of his own skeleton. And if a generic science fiction writer might describe a spaceship landing on Mars, only Bradbury can tell us how the Martians see it--and the dreamlike visitors from Planet Earth.",
