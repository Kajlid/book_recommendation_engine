  "description": "Princess Kimri is used to betrayal. Her brother sold her to a king in exchange for swords to defend his lands. King Tathan's reputation is as fierce as that of his mountain kingdom-where dragons are said to guard the castle walls-but the realms are unstable enough without angering the mountain-king, so Kimri reluctantly agrees to the union.When she arrives in Helsmont, the king promises her a year of courtship before marrying-or parting ways. Before long, Kimri thinks she may find comfort, and perhaps eventually love, with the stoic king.But the realms are more unsettled than Kimri realizes, and she soon finds herself caught in the middle of a war between the kingdoms. Can she count on her betrothed to take her side? Or will his loyalty to his kingdom come before his loyalty to her?50,000 words",
