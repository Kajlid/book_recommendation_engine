And at the workplace, she is abused in every imaginable way. At home, she is treated as an unpaid servant. She is someone you know. And who failed her - the society or the system?When a vigilante witnesses six victims of abuse, she chances upon an opportunity to bring about a lasting change. Did she succeed?#MeToo Brutus is a work of fiction about common women who face abuse in different ways.",
