  "title": "Sweet Reunion",
  "description": "She's determined to stay single, but everyone else is determined to see her married.  Maggie Kendrick is trying to start over in the enchanting beach town where she spent her summers growing up. Life has thrown her one too many wrenches, and now she's resolved to move on—without a man.  Aunt Lucille has made it her life's mission to see Maggie walk down the aisle. Everyone knows it too, as Lucille has tried to set Maggie up with every available bachelor in Indigo Bay.  Canyon Leblanc was Maggie's first love, and he just returned to town. Sparks start flying again—stronger than ever. Distance has definitely made their hearts grow fonder, but Canyon has spent the last seven years living a wild and destructive lifestyle, and that reputation labels him a less-than-desirable catch.  Maggie and Canyon see past each other's situations, but nobody in town wants them to get together, least of all Aunt Lucille. Friends, family, and even an enemy work hard to keep them apart.  Will Maggie open her heart to love again despite the many obstacles, or will the single life prove to be her best option?",
