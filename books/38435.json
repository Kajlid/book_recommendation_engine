Not just her life…but her very “You don’t know me, but I work for your Social Network. This morning we had visitors from Homeland Security and they demanded that we turn over to them all information pertaining to your account. They also have access to all your phone contacts as well. This message will be deleted in 20 minutes and all traces of it will disappear. I can only hope you get this message in time. Overhearing the conversations of these men I realize that you are in grave danger. You must leave your home immediately. Go somewhere where they can’t trace you…They are coming to pick you up!
