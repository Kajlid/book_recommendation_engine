  "description": "A retired captain. An experimental starship. A war like no other.When the research starship Galileo vanishes without a trace, the powers-that-be are quick to bury the incident, eager to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to war. As a former POW, Soren refuses to give the ship up for lost.His daughter is one of the missing.Taking matters into his own hands, Soren starts pulling strings and calling in favors, determined to launch a clandestine mission to bring Galileo home. When an old friend offers him a ship for the operation, he expects a rusty relic headed for the scrapyard.Instead, he's given the Wraith—an unfinished, experimental starship with plenty of potential and just as many problems. A marvel of engineering…if his crew can keep her running.They’d better.Because Galileo’s disappearance is just the beginning. War is coming to the Federation from the most unlikely of places.And Soren may be the only one who can stop it.",
