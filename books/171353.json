I have never met a woman more beautiful, more tantalizing, and so I made her my bride. She promised me her heart and soul…in return, I plundered her flesh, and bound her to me for all eternity. Then, terrified of what I’d made her, she fled.Now she has returned, desperate for my help in saving her beloved nephew. But my assistance comes at a price: She must share my bed once more, for the feel of her soft skin, the heat of her kiss, excite me still. And I know she desires me, even as she resists her own heart.Yet, as we rediscover the passion that brought us together, an enemy waits to destroy us both…",
