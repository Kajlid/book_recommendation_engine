When at last she thinks her quest for the sword is at an end, she discovers a it takes two people to claim the blade, not one, so she needs a Questing Partner for help. Too bad Renee never bothered to make any friends on her journey, and she has to put her trust in a stranger. She thinks she has found the perfect Questing Partner in Guy Smokes, a hapless Assistant Barkeep always willing to help anyone with heaving bosoms. However, Guy might just change his mind after they are attacked by lustful nun assassins and lethal men in green cloaks. Will Renee be able to claim the Sword of Power, or will she and her Questing Partner be slain instead? Journey to a land where men are women, women are men and unicorns are jerks in \"Kingdom of the The Quest for the Sword.\" This is the first book in the \"Kingdom of the Snark\" series.
