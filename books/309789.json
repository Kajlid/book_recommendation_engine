  "description": "I used to be someone: an up-and-coming writer, a doting father, a husband who believed he was the center of his wife’s universe.Then everything crumbled.Thanks to Benjamin Grant, I became a joke. A divorced man. A shell. Thirsty for revenge, I needed him to feel the weight of loss like I did.Enter Josie—Benjamin's wife and the key to my vendetta. My aim was to infiltrate her life, seduce her, and use that to hit my enemy where it hurt most. It was supposed to be straightforward. But as any writer knows, stories rarely stick to the script. Now I’m caught in a plot twist I never intended to write.Vengeance was the goal, and Josie Grant was my way in.I never meant to fall in love with her.Now?There’s no way out.",
