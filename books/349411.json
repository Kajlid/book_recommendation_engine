  "description": "The Sweet Spot has nothing to do with football. . . . Just ask Kahari Brown, one of the NFL's sexiest stars. He knows how to handle a football, and always thought he had a way with the ladies. But his smooth moves off the field are only getting him into hot water these days. And no one is hotter than Zoë Andrews. When she thrusts a mic in his face and asks him if he's the father of a crazy fan's baby, he's ready to tackle her and toss her out of the locker room on her shapely butt. But there's something about Zoë . . . Zoë's Rule Number Never Date an Athlete! Zoë will do anything to make it as a top sports reporter, even ask the controversial question that puts her toe to toe with Kahari. Still, she can't help noticing that the brother is mighty fine. Now the heat is on and Zoë is wondering if she should have fanned the flames, because she's falling for Kahari's charm -- something she swore she'd never do. Yet it's hard to resist his smooth moves, making Zoë wonder, is he sweet-talking his way into her heart for love -- or for something else?",
