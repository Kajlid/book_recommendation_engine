  "description": "\"...the poetry and photography...STUNNING.\" Beth Teliho - Writer B is Me \"Sometimes poets write what we wish we could say, and they tell us what we need to know. The poems in Wild Woman Waking lead us to a place where we can proudly refuse to be “bent and broken”; instead, they document a journey to self-acceptance, peace, and understanding – where in a community of women, we celebrate and dance as Mud Women. We become women of spirit and keepers of our own keys.\" ~Beth Camp \"From the first poem, to the last, Morgan Dragonwillow's well crafted prose speak to the very heart of what it is to be a woman on an emotional journey.\" Linda Roy \"elleroy\" Tui Snider has an artistic eye for photography that is unique, beautiful, and creative. The combination of her photography and Morgan's poetry creates a poetic journey like no other.",
