  "description": "You know those early days of a weight loss program? When you're sick to death of following the program and you just want to quit? Taste for Truth will help you keep going when you'd like nothing better than to quit. This 30-day Bible study offers 30 days of renewing-of-the-mind help. Through Bible study, evaluation, practical tips, and daily assignments, youâ€™ll learn to throw off the lies that make you eat and put on the truth that will set you free from the control of food. Taste for Truth is a companion Bible study to I Deserve a Donut (And Other Lies That Make You Eat).",
