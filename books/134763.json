But when he catches the sexy scent of Lisa Delaney, he's hers, body and soul and ready to risk both on an erotic desire that will shatter all boundaries. Kelon intends to return to his pack after helping Donovan, but he never counted on the voluptuous distraction of Robin Delaney. She's the one woman who can make him contemplate a choice no werewolf should have to make. Wyatt can't afford to be attracted to the practical, completely human Heather Delaney. But she isn't a woman a man ignores no matter what the cost.",
