England. Shrouded in the heartache of a fifty-year-old secret, Elaine Arthur suddenly slips into a deep depression and gives up on life. Lainey, her granddaughter, is desperate to save her---and certain that uncovering the secret will bring healing and hope. America. Nicholas, the grandson of a powerful publishing mogul, discovers a box from his grandfather's English past---including unopened letters that reveal a love once lost. Nicholas believes those letters may explain his grandfather's hardheartedness, and the writer may hold the key that could open the door to redemption. As Lainey and Nicholas search for answers, their paths cross and, together, they move into a deep mystery and discover that love---and forgiveness---can show up in the most unlikely places. From the pain of the past emerges a tender story of lost love, betrayal, reconciliation, and renewed hope that spans a half-century and thousands of miles.",
