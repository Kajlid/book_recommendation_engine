For years, the Waste has waged a bloody battle against the royal court to win its independence—and they need Octavia’s powers to succeed.Joined by unlikely allies, including a menagerie of gremlin companions, she must evade killers and Clockwork Daggers on a dangerous journey through a world on the brink of deadly civil war.",
