  "description": "There’s a killer on the loose… A monster who hides in plain sight, waiting to make his move when you least expect it. When you’re tired. When you’re alone. When you’re not paying attention. At Dusk. Special Agent Harlan Tate of the FBI knows this particular killer’s work well– too well. The killer took somebody important from him when he was a teenager, then disappeared. Two decades later, he’s resurfaced with an appetite that’s even more voracious than before. Victims are popping up left and right on a path that seems to lead right to Harlan. Torrah Magan is no stranger to the fear this killer invokes. Not after he reached for one of her family members and missed. Now the fear is he’ll try again. Can Harlan keep her safe while racing against the clock to find the killer?",
