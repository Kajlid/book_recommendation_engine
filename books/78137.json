  "description": "Wild Indians & Other Creatures is a stunning book that will startle readers who harbor romantic notions of contemporary Native American life. In these interrelated stories, most animals speak and most humans drink. A number of these irrelevant stories of Indian life are reworkings of traditional Trickster talescomplete with horny humanesque coyotes, randy ravens, and mystical bears - which transcend that form and become something new and arresting.Set on and around the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, these unsettling, often politically incorrect stories almost function as a novel. Many are laugh-out-loud funny, while others are stark and sad, yet grimly human and powerful.Many more stories and lives are interwoven in these sometimes bawdy but always moving and memorable tales. In Wild Indians & Other Creatures, Adrian C. Louis, one of the leading American Indian poets, presents an unblinking look at the social ills of reservation life while at the same time speaking of hope and survival for native peoples.",
