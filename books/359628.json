  "description": "As much as we all know that 'E = mc2' was Einstein's most important and groundbreaking equation, do we really know what it means or why Einstein is regarded as one of history's foremost thinkers? In this absorbing biography Michael White and John Gribbin reveal the man behind the physics and introduce us to his theories in an accessible and fascinating way. With an updated preface for this new edition on the fiftieth anniversary of his death and the hundredth anniversary of the theory of relativity, EINSTEIN explains how the scientific icon changed our view of the world and why no one can ever hope to understand that world without first understanding his work.",
