  "description": "Never trust a cold condom.   Wait, let me back up. I'm Kellan McGuire, and I'm a rockstar in hiding, at least for the weekend. Enter Maggie Kelly, the famed Kelly virgin - AKA my small hometown's favorite good girl.  Did I mention she's really good? And I'm so...not.  Except Maggie isn't a virgin any longer. She actually just went through a rough breakup due to her ex's penchant for strippers.Â   And I don't want to be a rockstar this weekend. Not with her.  I just want to be Kellan, the wolf to her Little Red Riding Hood. The guy who shows her all the dark, dirty things she never dared to dream.  In return, she gave me something I never dared to dream about either - a baby.  A family.  Our family, if I can convince her I'm worth the risk.  Author's note: this book may be called Rockstar Daddy, but the emphasis is on lots of babymaking practice, laughter, a few tears, and a serious case of insta-love.",
