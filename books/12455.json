  "title": "Babies on the Go",
  "description": "The Barnes & Noble ReviewLinda Ashman (Can You Make a Piggy Giggle?) and Jane Dyer (I Love You like Crazy Cakes) team up for a sweet exploration of how babies get around. Ashman's clever rhymes explain how tykes of many species travel (\"Rolling by in baby strollers / Holding tight to Mother's shoulders / Grabbing on to clumps of hair / Riding bareback through the air\"), and Dyer's warm watercolors portray a real sense of comfort and safety. Whether it's a little koala clinging to its mama, a young elephant being \"towed along a bumpy trail,\" or a baby beaver \"surfing on a paddle-tail,\" happy-faced passengers of every sort bask in the sure knowledge that they \"always ride with love.\"This book is beautifully designed, with illustrations that slowly move each mother-baby duo along in an easterly direction -- until they reach their final destination; and a delightful \"Meet the Babies\" montage displays all Dyer's beautiful artwork on the final page. Sweet and tender but never sappy, Babies on the Go is a surefire charmer, perfect for reinforcing the bonds between parents and children. Matt Warner",
