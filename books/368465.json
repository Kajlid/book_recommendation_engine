  "description": "Eva has met her match, but though he is older than she is, he will not be physically mature for sixteen years. Their solution is to put her in stasis. She would have gone mad, but her connection to her match keeps her sane, even if he is way too short for her. When she wakes, her best friend is holding her and with his help, she will soon be back to her normal activities. If only she didn’t have the almost constant urge to peel his clothing off, she would be fine. Giving into her lust is fun, but preparing for his ascension isn’t. As much as she is enjoying romps in the sheets, shower, sofa, chairs, she has no urge to engage in a public consummation of their affection.",
