  "description": "My name is Amethyst DeMille and I’m in love with a vampire.Sounds complicated, doesn’t it?Yet the fact that he’s a sexy, centuries-old blood-drinking vampire isn’t what makes our relationship complicated.It’s because we live in the same house together, work at the same exclusive club together, and he happens to be my best friend with absolutely no idea how I feel about him.I mean, sure he’s probably seen me give him heart eyes more than once. Wolf is not only a deadly, charismatic vampire with great persuasion skills, he also happens to be built like a Nordic God, all solid muscle and chiseled bone structure and haunting eyes that I sometimes think tell me more than he wants me to know. He’s the type of guy most women find themselves falling for (and not just because they might end up his next meal).But despite the simmering sexual tension and yearning between us, I know there’s no way I’ll ever be able to tell him how I feel. After all, I’m a human and he’s a vampire and he’s told me more than once that those love stories never end well.Too bad my heart doesn’t know the difference. ***Nightwolf is a contemporary vampire romance with a friends-to-lovers twist.This book is a spinoff of The Dark Eyes Duet, featuring Wolf & Amethyst, but can be read as a total standalone. However, if you are reading it as a series, The Dark Eyes Duet (Black Sunshine and The Blood is Love) should be read first.It will release wide on November 8th and go into Amazon KU on November 10th.",
