He was one of a small brotherhood of men who made a living out of lassoing dead satellites and towing them out of Earth's orbit. Then came the accident, the one which cost James everything. Now landlocked and grounded with no chance of returning to space, James lives a life of quiet desperation. By day, he struggles with having become an amputee. By night, he is haunted by nightmares of the moment that took his leg, his friends, and his entire career.After a failed suicide attempt, a company psychologist assigns James a companion animal named Maxx--a very smart rat with an interesting past. Now, once again, James will find his life radically changed as old wounds are opened and fresh scars are forced to heal.",
