  "description": "With their music topping the charts worldwide, the band mates of Japanese rock band ChildsPrey have everything they've ever wanted--international success, millions of fans, money, fame. But for guitarists Jun Doi and Koji Takasoto, the nights this winter are long and empty. Since the band's early wild days full of passionate sex and hard music, Koji has seen Jun as more than a mere friend. Worried that admitting his feelings would jeopardize this relationship and their success, Koji keeps his long-standing love a secret. Meanwhile, Jun's hopes for happiness in the New Year crumble. Following the break up of his marriage and an injury to his hand that could put his career on hold, he needs Koji's friendship more than ever before. Whisking his friend away for the holiday, Koji puts everything on the line. Both men have had their share of hurt and loneliness, but if Koji can find the courage to say what's in his heart, can they find the love they've been longing for? Publisher's Note: Winter Song is a homoerotic love story. As such it contains sexual content that may be offensive to some readers: menage, male/male sexual practices.",
