  "description": "There’s only one rule in the world I come from.Keep our existence a secret. Period.The day my sister broke that rule one too many times, I knew there would be consequences. I expected us to be sent to one of those schools for “troubled” kids—and maybe Daizlei Academy was, in a way. But really, it was far more complicated than that.You see, I thought that world had forgotten me. Forgotten us. For years we were left alone, and one day . . . we weren’t.It was only when I got there that I remembered the second rule:Trust no one.Because in our world? They would kill me if they knew the truth of what I am.Daizlei Academy is a school for Supernaturals.And me? I’m so much more.*This is a YA+ Academy series with slow-burn romance and a strong but flawed heroine. It is labeled YA(+) for stronger language and some mature situations. As the heroine ages and grows so does the content of the stories.*",
