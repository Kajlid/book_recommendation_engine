  "description": "You’re restless.  Trouble has you gasping beside the narrow road.  This is your invitation back to the adventure. Some Christians leave their relationship with God in a sealed box like a collectible that will be worth something \"someday.\" Not you. You wholeheartedly answered the call to follow Him into the great adventure.  Then, something unexpected happened that left you gasping beside the narrow road. You thought you were following Jesus but now it feels as if all you re doing is running from a crazy man. Even knocked down, though, you seek the strength to continue the journey.  This isn’t a book for the happily comfortable. This is a book for the restless Jesus lover, the longsuffering disciple, the openhearted believer. Be forewarned. The challenges inside are designed to unsettle you as well as provide practical suggestions for thriving on the narrow road even if trouble is your travel companion.  Running from a Crazy Man (and Other Adventures Traveling with Jesus) is a siren call to the modern believer that the God-adventure can happen even when, like King David, you re running from a crazy man.",
