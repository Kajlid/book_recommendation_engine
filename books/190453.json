  "title": "Eternal Life Inc.",
  "description": "An alien army is crossing the astral planes of the quantum field, snapping up the souls of the recently dead and taking possession of the living. The only one who can stop them is Harry Neuman, a womanizing, alcoholic movie star with his career on the skids and a contract to die again and again. This is Eternal Life Inc., a different kind of science-fiction novel combining physics and metaphysics in a fast-paced adventure about an alien invasion that starts not in outer space but in the inner space of the human mind.",
