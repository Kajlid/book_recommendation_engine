  "description": "The short mountain night was drawing to a close as Maryann finally left the greenhouse.Already a glowing false dawn could be seen climbing up behind the peak. She was no longer stoned. All those orgasms back there had drained away her intoxication and left her feeling tired. It was, though, a contented sort of tiredness. She walked arm-in-arm with her original captor, her head resting lightly against the shoulder of his jacket. Laura trooped along a step or two behind. The other men had left long before. None of them had much of anything to say. Instead, Maryann simply felt the calm of her final sexual completion still within herself. It hadn't been exactly what she expected for this evening, but it had been precisely what she wanted nevertheless.And there did remain the possibility that she had been wrong all along about what went on down in the basement.They turned into the house. All was quiet; the music had finished for the evening. On the first-floor landing, the man gave Maryann a light and affectionate kiss. Laura also greeted her with a hug and a kiss, and then she was left to climb by herself to her own safe place. Through the familiar landings and corridors she climbed. Grinning a little, she opened her door.",
