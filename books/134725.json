  "title": "More than Footprints?: How backpacking lost its way",
  "description": "An 'Emperor's New Clothes' for backpackers, 'More than footprints? How backpacking lost its way', heads onto the beaten track to examine the rise (and fall) of ‘independent’ travel.In this hilarious exposé of how backpacking has exploded into an industry worth billions, travel writer Martin Stevenson journeys through India, Southeast Asia, Australia and the USA, retracing the steps of his own gap year(s) to ask the questions the backpacking industry would really rather he didn’t.Featuring a cast of wide-eyed travellers, neo-hippies, suicidal bus drivers, expats, NGOs, prostitutes, frustrated volunteers and two very unlikely sex tourists, 'More than footprints? How backpacking lost its way' unpeels the ‘banana pancake’ trail and reveals how it has changed, how backpackers have changed it and how, far from being separate from the mass tourism industry, backpackers have become pioneers for it.",
