  "description": "Gilberic Parzival Moth is a strange and lonely boy who has grown up without a father, raised by a single mother who moves from town to town in fear of something she will not name. His only friends are animals, with whom he has always been able to speak. And although he has begun to learn about his true heritage, he also discovers that the modern world is not always friendly towards monster-killing knights errant, particularly when the police find them covered in blood.  But the long arm of the Twilight world reaches even into the jail cells of Asheville, North Carolina. Gilberic soon finds himself bound to the service of an ancient writ and a higher law, and traveling to eldritch places filled with enchanted creatures, immortal lords and ladies, and dangerous temptations. FEAST OF THE ELFS is the second book of THE GREEN KNIGHT'S SQUIRE, the first volume of MOTH & COBWEB, an astonishing new series about magical worlds of Day, Night, and Twilight by John C. Wright.  John C. Wright is one of the living grandmasters of science fiction and the author of THE GOLDEN AGE, AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND, and IRON CHAMBER OF MEMORY, to name just three of his exceptional books. He has been nominated for the Nebula Award, for the Hugo Award, and his novel SOMEWHITHER won the 2016 Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel at Dragoncon.",
