Most romance books that I have read always start out with the woman. It was a nice breathe of fresh air. Very well written and good story. I would recommend.\"Coffee Time Romance\"Ms. Adams has written such an inspirational story about taking charge of one’s life and changing it to fit them. It was great... There are no steamy sex scenes; however, the characters came alive, and I found myself fascinated with both Lauren and Jason and who they finally became.\"The Romance Studio\"The romance was subtly woven throughout the book... This unusual look at the lives of two people affected by a childhood friendship was a compelling story. I recommend it to anyone.\"",
