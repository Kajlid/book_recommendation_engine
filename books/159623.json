  "description": "Three words, to shake a man’s existence. Three words, to call on all a man’s strength, all his courage, all his love, and all his ability to hope and dream…and trust. Three words, to wake up every fear a man has ever had. “I’m pregnant, Luc.” Now how could a man be perfect enough for that? Author’s This book occurs in the early days of the marriage of Luc and Summer, the couple in THE CHOCOLATE HEART.
