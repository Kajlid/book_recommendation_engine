  "title": "God's Buried Children",
  "description": "In an effort to increase Romania’s population, the communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, authorized Decree 770 in 1967 that criminalized contraception and abortion. Abandoned and unwanted by their parents, thousands of children ended up in state orphanages where they were neglected and abused, and later became homeless on the streets of Bucharest. This book is drawn from the journal entries of one of them. This book is the journal of a Romanian orphan who survived and escaped the street and the communist regime. This book is a healing book. Life itself wrote this book. All I can offer you is my reality, my simple truth. The book burst out of my journal with its own identity after twenty years of weekly confessions. What happened under the streets of Bucharest will sink into your mind and take you back into those dark communist times. This book is dedicated to the 3000 American Families that adopted Romanian orphans after the December 1989 Revolution.",
