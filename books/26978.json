More people have set foot on the moon than have journeyed to the very bottom of the sea – but that’s where the Nekton family dare to go. While most explorers look to space, our heroes know that an infinite number of mysteries lie deep in the darkness below. A brilliant team with advanced technology and an unquenchable thirst for discovery, the Nektons boldly explore this spectacular final frontier here at home in their immense state-of-the-art submarine, the Aronnax. Using their fantastic deep sea vehicles, specialized mech suits and other cutting-edge technology, the Nektons will discover places, artifacts and creatures that long ago vanished into myth. Secrets are rising from the depths. But why? And why now?",
