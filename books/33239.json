  "description": "Truck-obsessed toddlers will want to make the diggers, tractors, fire engines, and more featured in this fun-filled construction tale part of their nightly bedtime routines! Discover what bedtime looks like for the snowplows, dump trucks, giant cranes, and more that dot the pages of this irresistible construction story. Just like you and me, the vehicles in this story get tuckered out after a long day of hard work and need to quiet down and settle in for sweet dreams. Young readers will surely identify as these trucks ask for  one more story  while their parents sing them a goodnight song and send them off to bed. With a sweet rhyme scheme and an illustration style that’s perfect for nighttime rituals, Where Do Diggers Sleep at Night? and its things-that-go companions— Where Do Steam Trains Sleep At Night? , Where Do Jet Planes Sleep At Night? , Where Do Speedboats Sleep at Night? , and Where Do Diggers Celebrate Christmas? —will leave vehicle-loving kids snuggled up and satisfied.",
