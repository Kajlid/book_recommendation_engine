  "description": "When an agent dies in the field, it's their fellow spies that are always hit the hardest. When the agent that doesn't make it home is an ex-lover, \"hard\" doesn't begin to describe it. As Tara Chace and the rest of the department reel over the demise of one of their own, a ghost from Director Paul Crocker's past has him sending his minders into danger yet again. But will this operation free Crocker from his ghosts or merely create new ones? Queen & Country: Operation: Stormfront is the latest volume in the award-winning series of espionage and politics and sees creator Greg Rucka united with the Eisner-nominated artist Carla Speed McNeil (Finder).",
