  "description": "How to create the change you want to see in the world using the paradigm-busting ideas in this \"utterly fascinating\" (Adam Grant) big-idea book.​Most of what we know about how ideas spread comes from bestselling authors who give us a compelling picture of a world, in which \"influencers\" are king, \"sticky\" ideas \"go viral,\" and good behavior is \"nudged\" forward. The problem is that the world they describe is a world where information spreads, but beliefs and behaviors stay the same. When it comes to lasting change in what we think or the way we live, the dynamics are beliefs and behaviors are not transmitted from person to person in the simple way that a virus is. The real story of social change is more complex. When we are exposed to a new idea, our social networks guide our responses in striking and surprising ways. Drawing on deep-yet-accessible research and fascinating examples from the spread of coronavirus to the success of the Black Lives Matter movement, the failure of Google+, and the rise of political polarization, Change presents groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting new science for understanding what drives change, and how we can change the world around us.",
