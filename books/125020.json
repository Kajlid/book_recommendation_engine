  "description": "Meet Jackson \"Jax\" Harding, lead singer of the rock band Dirty Louisiana. A wickedly good-looking playboy with a mischievous smile, a body that screams I’m-going-to-take-you-hard-against-the-closest-wall and stunning blue eyes that make you think that he can see right into your soul and impregnate it. He’s the kind of bad boy your mother has warned you about. Obviously, the type that you fall for anyway.  Women throw themselves at his feet and what kind of man would he be if he didn’t treat them to a good time or two? Relationships are perfectly okay as long as they are short-termed and there’s no label put on them. All he needs is someone to share his popcorn with, keep his feet warm at night and change body fluids with in every wicked way he can think of.  Meet the first trio of the Rockstar Stud’s Amy, Hayley and Alex. What can you expect when Jax meets women who aren’t the easy groupie type but whose panties fall off all by themselves anyway by the sight of the sex-on-a-very-honorable-sized-stick rock god? A little bit of wit, kink and smartassery. A hell of a lot lust, desire and passion. Welcome to the sinful world of Rock ’n’ Roll. Enjoy the ride, it’s going to be a bumpy one.",
