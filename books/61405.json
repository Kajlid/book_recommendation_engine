  "description": "“Three billion people were no longer seeing a glimpse of a cool Britannia façade, of Union Jack clad cheerleaders leaping from open top red buses, of athletes using traditional pork sausages as skipping ropes, and a William Shakespeare impersonator doing the long jump. Three billion people were concentrating on infection. Britain was INFECTED!”It’s the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, and things haven’t quite gone to plan. Risk of Infection, an apocalyptic and humorous tale, or anti-love story, explores the complexities of love, obsession and masculinity, and all with a sense of fun, wit and infected drama. This short novella is ideal for fans of the apocalypse, and yet has plenty to offer those who ravenously crave an unconventional love story with a dark and powerful... BITE!What others have to say...?(D. Peers, top 1000 Amazon reviewer)\"Risk of Infection is a tongue in cheek \"Shaun of the Dead\" mashed-up with \"Spaced\", with a mildly hapless twenties no-hoper-of-a-man finding himself in the midst of what just could be the end of the world. All in all, it stands on its own as a surprisingly enjoyable take on the apocalypse and all things pertaining to zombie. Risk of Infection is a satisfying balance of zombie action versus humans realising a few things about themselves. It's cheap to purchase, and is a satisfying little fix if you're craving a zombie hit.\"(Greavsie, verified Amazon purchase)“I was gripped from the very first page. I bought this book after enjoying Tom Conrad's début novel Rich Pickings for Ravens. The story is fast paced and has some great characters. Conrad's witty and charming style is once again evident in this zombie/romance romp. If you have a spare pound, and fancy a laugh, buy it now!”",
