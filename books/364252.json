  "description": "In her new Living in Eden novel, Michelle Rowen proves that being a little wicked isn't all bad...Every woman has a sexy demon inside her just waiting to get out, but for Eden Riley it's a little different. Her inner demon is named Darrak, and he's been inhabiting bodies for the past three hundred years. In the daytime, thanks to her special psychic energy, he's able to take physical shapeâ€”a shape she wouldn't mind getting her hands on, it it wasn't a threat to her immortal soul...Because of her possession, Eden now has uncontrollable black magic at her fingertips, and she and Darrak are trying to end the curse that binds them before the situation gets any worse. To do it, they'll have to get tangled up with some unsavory characters from the underworld. When sparks and spells fly, they could get the distance they need...or each will have their own private hell to pay.",
