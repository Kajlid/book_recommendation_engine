  "description": "She’s my favorite secret.Sandra Dane is mine, and I intend to keep her that way—even if the world says otherwise. Or it would, if it knew. After all, you’re not supposed to poach your nephew’s girlfriend, even if he doesn’t deserve to kiss her shoes. I like kissing her everywhere, so I do. And I do so many other, filthier things. But I’m getting tired of keeping her a secret. I’m not the kind of man who hides from anything. I take on all comers and I accept no defeat. The only one in the world who can defeat me…is Sandra. And if I lose her, I lose everything. I can’t let that happen. Sandra is mine, and I am hers. No one will keep us apart. Not my family, not society, not anything. Not even her.I will keep her at any cost. And God help anyone who tries to stop me.",
