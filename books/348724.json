  "description": "Future earth has forgotten God. Science and technology reign supreme. A benevolent government banishes hunger, poverty, and disease and provides a luxurious lifestyle for an ever-increasing population. However, even science has its limits, and the world faces a crisis of diminishing resources. Dr. Deborah Tennyson, a brilliant mathematician, devises the only answer for Discover new resources through the Interdimensional Transport Protocol (ITP). A brash, self-centered, but remarkably talented astropilot, Major David Sanders, takes the responsibility of making the first ITP flight and determining the fate of the earth. Will he find the fame he so desperately craves or much more? Sanders' journey through interdimensional space takes him to a world he could never imagine and a spiritual destiny he could never expect.",
