  "title": "The Secret Life of Nanna Ġenoveffa",
  "description": "From the manuscript found by Renzo Camilleri Manduca, Ġenoveffa's grandson, it is clear that his Nan was no meek and gullible woman... as some imagine women in those times usually were. Her writing shows her to have been a rather naughty character, full of passion and vigour, having a zest for life and with a strangely creative streak.Not even her father, a well-known businessman in the drapery trade, could control her; nor her aunt Fawstina with all her saintly goodness, nor her aunt Ġemma with all the practical advice she gave her. Only Zanzu had the power to make her malleable and melt her defences. But no... not only Zanzu!Nanna Ġenoveffa's scribbles are meant exclusively for adults... sometimes they are explicit and at other times obscure... just like Nanna herself!",
