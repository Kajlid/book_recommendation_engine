Northwest Smith saved her life... but had he know what she was--or how she would try to thank him --he might have left her to die.For the girl was Shambleau, and across the galaxy that name meant death--or worse.Now available after too long an absence is C.L. Moore's fantastic vision of the worlds of the future and the weird creatures that inhabit them.",
