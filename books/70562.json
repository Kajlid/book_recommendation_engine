  "description": "Sequel to Witch Hunt  Mike Srevic blinked and the world turned upside down. For fifty years he lived alone, mystically bound and incapable of comfortably using his magic. Now he’s back on the throne as High Mage and soul-bound to Rick Behr, a man he hardly knows. Luckily, Rick has a big heart and huge reserves of patience, because Mike is still raw from watching his former lover die and doesn’t know how to talk about a future with Rick.  Defining their relationship isn’t Mike’s only an army of demons is amassing, and Mike discovers he has a nephew named Wyatt. It’s enough to rouse painful memories, leading Mike to believe his loved ones will only end up hurt. Scared and unsure what to do, he pushes Rick away and flies off to Chicago to train Wyatt.  But then Wyatt is kidnapped and Mike finds himself needing Rick’s support more than ever. Can he trust himself to make the right decisions and save the ones he loves?",
