  "description": "A revolutionary new tool for spiritual growth and evolution from one of today’s most dynamic spiritual leaders. Shaman Durek is a 6th generation shaman who has devoted his life to bringing a message of transformation and healing to the world. Working with clients from Gwyneth Paltrow to tech giants like Dave Asprey, he’s one of the most inspirational thinkers of our time, offering ancient wisdom for modern seekers. Following the success of his first book, Spirit Hacking, Shaman Durek has created a revolutionary new spiritual toolkit in this 88-card deck designed to up-level human performance. Each card of the Alchemy Elementals Deck carries an energetic code, known as a spirit enhancer in shamanic tradition, designed to deepen your energetic wisdom and grow your spiritual power. These spirit enhancers will help you heighten your psychic and healing gifts and strengthen your spiritual journey. The cards correspond to the Celestial bodies—Moon, Sun, Star, and Earth—in combination with the Elemental powers—Storm, Rainbow, Wind, Snow, and Lightning—forging a connection between the natural world and your own inborn power. Beautifully designed with luxurious finishes, each card is not only a spiritual catalyst but also a work of art.",
