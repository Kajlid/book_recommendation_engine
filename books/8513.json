From Ljubljana, a place he can’t even spell. ‘Come stay with me forever,’ it tells him.Weird, but okay, thinks Billy. Why not?With Jay along for the ride, and others picked up along the way, Billy arrives in Ljubljana and quickly finds that things are a lot stranger than he could’ve possibly imagined. An art commune run by a man in a bear costume. A castle surrounded by continual snow, with ancient gods and 80s board games, famous writers and forbidden rooms.And Daisy…his beautiful, unpredictable host.Who is this woman? Why won’t she let him go outside? What’s inside the room at the top of the spiral stairs? And what happens when he can no longer write for her?",
