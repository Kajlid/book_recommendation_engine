  "description": "Book nerds rule! And what better gift than a book that celebrates bookishness? You know you’re a Book Nerd when…—You have a minimum of 5 books on your night table.—You never once thought the movie was better.—Your favorite mug says “I’d rather be reading.”—You use words like librocubicularist in casual conversation (though no conversation about books is ever \"casual”). —You wear a T-shirt that says—what else?—\"Too many books, too little time.\"Charming, affectionate, and unabashed in its celebration of book nerdiness, this little love letter is for every avid reader. Every page is packed with bright, playful, intricately detailed illustrations by Holly Maguire, and wonderful mottoes, definitions, relatable moments, and more.",
