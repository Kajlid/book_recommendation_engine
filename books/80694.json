  "description": "Imagine for a moment that legend and fact are two living and breathing entities. In legends, Atlantis was destroyed by a great flood due to greed. For a civilization to be gluttonous, they have to be imperialistic. A great war would have taken place to destroy such a powerful civilization. In fact, mankind has learned of civilizations older than the Egyptians and Sumerians. Within the last five decades, archeologists have learned about the Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, and the City of Lord Krishna submerged under the Gulf of Cambay. Both cities can date back twelve thousand years ago. Right after the Ice Age, the world looked different. The oceans and seas started to rise four hundred feet due to climate change. After the glaciers started to melt, Mankind was ready to strive to the next level of its existence. Societies and cultures started to expand. If a person fuses fact and legend together, the result would be the civilization of the Atlantian Empire.",
