  "description": "You know that awkward moment when your agent tells you to fake date your best friend’s sister so you can get the endorsement deal of your dreams? No? Call me crazy for considering it, but why not?

She loves it when I flirt with her, so we could carry it off, couldn’t we?An endorsement deal with Lock Performance has been my goal ever since I was little, and it would be one of the biggest accomplishments in my professional swimming career. Something I want desperately.But what I didn’t expect from this fake start was to want something else—someone—just as desperately.
