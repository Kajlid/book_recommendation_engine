I’m a spontaneous guy, so I offer to help—spend the rest of the weekend with her so she’s not alone on her birthday.I don’t expect her to end up in my bed, but when she does, it’s mind-blowing. And after a smoking hot weekend together, I realize I could use a little more Juliet in my life.See her again? Sure. But it’s still just a fling. I have my reasons. My heart can’t take more.Sexy bartender Finn O’Conner thinks he has the solution to my troubles. Birthday weekend gone bad? Nothing a nice drink and some hot eye candy can’t solve. And Finn is all kinds of hot.Spending the weekend with him is impulsive—so unlike me. But throwing off my planner tendencies feels amazing—as does Finn.I’m not supposed to fall for him. He doesn’t believe in forever. But as our weekend fling turns into a whirlwind romance, my heart will never be the same.Weekend Fling was previously titled Could Be Forever",
