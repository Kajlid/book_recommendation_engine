  "description": "The weather is rolling in and for Kyle Tanner and his would be friends it hasn’t even begun to come down. When a mysterious noise rolls in from a neighboring town along with the dense smog from a Chemical Plant explosion people begin to die. But that is the least of their worries. Trapped inside a small local grocery store they watch in horror as those left out in the weather blister from head to toe with unimaginable sores. And when it couldn’t seem to get any worse, this small band of survivors are forced outside to face the mutilated madness!",
