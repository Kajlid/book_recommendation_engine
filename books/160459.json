  "title": "Out Came the Sun: A Day in Nursery Rhymes",
  "description": "Out Came the Sun is a collection of nursery rhymes, thoughtfully selected and beautifully illustrated by Heather Collins. The rhymes tell the comforting and familiar story of a child's waking up, washing and dressing, eating, playing indoors and outdoors, and going to sleep. Following a day from sun up to sun down, the rhymes were also chosen for their rhythms, patterns and sounds -- to delight babies and toddlers, to make reading aloud fun and interactive for parents, and to encourage young children's engagement and response. Familiar rhymes such as \"Hickory, dickory, dock\" and \"I'm a little teapot\" gain a new meaning in illustrator Heather Collins's story. From cock robin's lively waking up to the man in the moon's fond goodnight, more than 40 nursery rhymes follow a cuddly animal family through their day. A feast for young eyes and ears, Out Came the Sun also encourages babies and toddlers to connect words, pictures and story -- an essential first step in learning to read.",
