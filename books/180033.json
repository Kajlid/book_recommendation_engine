  "description": "Lucy Prestipino has only minutes to deliver a lawsuit to the Baltimore City courthouse. She’s a twenty-one-year-old bicycle messenger on a mission—saving a crying lawyer from missing the statute of limitations. She's promised to file the lawsuit before the court closes, no matter what.  No matter what propels Lucy into a horrific crash with handsome and charismatic Romero Sanchez. She becomes romantically entangled with Sanchez until Rick McCormick, the chief of the new gang unit of the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office, warns her of the depth of Sanchez's criminality. Her relationship with Sanchez violently disintegrates.  A brutal murder draws her into a ruthless vendetta between Sanchez and McCormick. She's convinced the police are on the wrong track and launches her own murder investigation. The long-kept secrets Lucy unearths during her hunt for a killer force her to confront choices that may destroy her.",
