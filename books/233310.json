  "description": "When Fenrir's Warriors bring James a wolf found running half-naked through the forest in the middle of winter, it doesn't take long to work out they're dealing with an Omega. Days away from leading an attack on the heart of Eagle Creek, James' first instinct is to get Luke somewhere safe and deal with the rest later. Until he works out Luke is a gift for Jeremy, son of Eagle Creek's Alpha. And suddenly Luke becomes a potential solution to his problem.  Luke has waited all his life to be given to an Alpha and finally fulfill his purpose. But Jeremy is cruel, with harsh hands and a touch that makes his skin crawl. Running away in the hopes of finding his brother, Adam, he's captured by Fenrir's Warriors and brought to their Alpha leader, James. This Alpha is different. He actually looks at Luke, talks to him, treats him like a person. But just when Luke is beginning to change his mind about Alphas, James hands him back to Jeremy and Luke pays the price for running away.
