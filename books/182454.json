  "description": "Tim is 17, Catholic and conflicted. Though he escapes regularly into his daydreams of the English civil war, the war within himself is a bigger concern. When his golden haired obsession Aaron, and mates John and Ray lose their fourth for a week's tromp through the Lake District & the Cumbrian mountains, Tim volunteers to fill out their party. But then storms set in, the boys become lost and decide to wait out the rains in a cozy four man tent. Unsure of exactly where they are or if their food will last, it turns out that nothing is certain.",
