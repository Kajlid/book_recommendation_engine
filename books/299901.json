  "description": "FROM THE AUTHOR:Yes, this is an M/M story but it is not erotica. Ringo has been a character in my books since day one and Bananas is the name of the drag queen restaurant in my books that Ringo owns.This book is about an awesome man who looks fabulous in drag meeting a man who knows he is gay but has never admitted it to anyone because he lives in a world that he believes will crucify him.It is about opposites, give and take, and finding \"home\" in the people who choose to be in your life.--BLURB--A gorgeous man, a hot fireman, and a crazed gunman walked into a Drag Queen restaurant on a busy Sunday morning.It sounded like a joke until...The shooter fled, I was left bleeding on the floor, and the steamy hot fireman peered into my eyes. Why couldn't I have choked and got mouth to mouth resuscitation?This was our story.Two men.One raging inferno of emotions.He was rugged boots and a red fireman helmet, who kept more than fire gear in his closet.Most days, I was glitter stilettos and red lipstick, and the only thing in my closet was a couple hundred pairs of fabulous shoes.I was ready for love, to shout it from the rooftop, he still needed a safety net.But, together we created a home.",
