  "title": "The Many Wonders of Costa Contente",
  "description": "There's a small town on the South America coast where the sweet sea air mixes with fragrant tropical blossoms. It's a place where the neighbors are kind, the parrots are helpful, and wonders abound in everyday life. It's in this town of Costa Contente that you'll find Dona Gloria and her husband Berto, proprietors of the Casa de Everything & Anything. It's in their home that you'll meet Solange, the young traveler they've welcomed into their lives. Just across the way is the Taverna Amore and its owner Gilberto. And Dona Immaculada is not far away, ready with a potion or bit of insight to soothe a broken heart or ease a sore back. When the drought lasts longer than anyone expected, the citizens of Costa Contente rally together to save their parched town. When the ghost of Don Mateo becomes restless after outsiders attempt to decimate his family's land, a meeting is called at the tavern. Working together, the townspeople always come up with a plan to overcome any obstacle, large or small. Careful thought, hard work, and just that little bit of the magical assure that Costa Contente will continue to thrive for its people and the land on which it rests",
