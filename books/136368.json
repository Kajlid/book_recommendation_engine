  "description": "Luthias is a sexy shape shifter, and close friend of the MacClaire family. Lately, he's troubled by dreams of his father, who lived in ancient Egypt during the time of Cleopatra. It seems his reputation as a statesman had been tarnished by no other than the queen herself. Now, he seeks his son' help in restoring it, so he may have peace in the afterlife. Upon arrival in ancient Alexandria, Luthias becomes involved in a heated love affair with the queen. She is obsessed with him, and demands his undivided attention. Enter Julius Caesar, who despite his best, gets no where with the beautiful queen. The stage is now set for lies, corruption, dark magic, sorcery and murder. Add a lovely slave girl who Luthias marries, and you have a fast paced intriguing story you won't want to put down. Will Luthias live long enough to return to his home in the seventeenth century? This is the third in the Ancient Echoes Series, and one not to be missed.",
