  "title": "A Kiss of Revenge",
  "description": "To Reese Templeton, marriage is completely over-rated, especially after her quadratic failure. She wants to settle down to a solitary life of owning a bakery. Too bad her super-human talents and the search for her husband’s killer have made her something of a human tazer. She’s full of enough electricity to short out a city block or send a man into cardiac arrest with just one kiss.But the alluring P.I. Griffin Chase, a man she has a history with, is stirring up feelings of need she hasn’t felt in years. Only this time, her desire to be in his arms has nothing to do with her fear of loneliness and everything to do with the current charging through her body every time he looks at her…touches her. Griffin hasn't remained at Reese's side just because of the spark that has nothing to do with her super-human talents. He's willing to compromise his rock-solid principles so she can find closure. But before they can move on, he must help her catch her late husband’s killer, staying on track before she has a chance to exact her revenge. Because leading Reese to jail in handcuffs may just break his heart for the final time.",
