  "description": "A mystical forest...A forgotten history...A love that spans lifetimes... \nThe Golding is a story-within-a-story, a whimsical tale about money and its unknown otherworldly origins.Rosetta Melki (part-time tarot reader, struggling sole parent and full-time idealist) begins a reading group to examine a fantasy novel and discovers the book to be anything but fiction.The book, written in the 1770s by Edward Lillibridge, is a hidden history revealing the true beginnings of the global monetary system. Lillibridge’s story surrounds ancients from a gold-obsessed empire and the sprites they oppress: elfin clan dwellers whose currency of choice is kindness.Whether discontent in rich and poor will ever make way for a world free of war and poverty, whether anyone can believe enough in humanity’s true ancient history to activate the dawn of a benevolent new era, remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain. Someone in modern times must fulfil a prophecy.",
