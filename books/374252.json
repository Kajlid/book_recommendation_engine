  "description": "Galt Niederhoffer's The Romantics nimbly follows the shifting allegiances among an unforgettable set of characters, with a powerful, bittersweet romance at its heart, now a major motion picture starring Katie Holmes, Josh Duhamel, and Anna Paquin.Laura and Lila were college roommates--one brooding and Jewish, the other the epitome of golden WASP-dom. Now it's ten years later, a day before Lila's wedding to Laura's former boyfriend, and as the guests arrive, Laura finds herself the only one not coupled up. Struggling with the traditionally thankless role of maid of honor, Laura realizes for the first time why she can't stop thinking about her long, tangled relationship with the groom. And it appears that he is not entirely ready for the altar himself.",
