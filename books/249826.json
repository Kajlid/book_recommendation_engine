In a dark and desolate New America of work camps, government subsidized starvation, and media blackouts, where the rich live in elite Fence Cities and the rest of the people agitate for revolution while trying to survive the aftermath of the earthquakes and the New Regime, the rebels learn the shape of things to come and change tactics in order to survive. In the aftermath of a personal tragedy, Hikari gets desperate in her search for missing Yerik, who is trying to find his way out of a trap, and a slow burn between Lissa and a newly returned and deeply changed Gideon, causes Connor to spend more time getting to know his destructive tendencies.",
