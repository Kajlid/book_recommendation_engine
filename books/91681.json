  "title": "Between Gardens",
  "description": "When good friends and avid gardeners Dorothy Field and Carol Graham Chudley began a year's correspondence about their gardens, they intended to write a simple how-to manual. At the end of the year they discovered that they had created something richer - they'd written a joyous meditation on living with integrity.While the letters were being written, Carol suffered from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Despite pain and sleep deprivation, she joined Dorothy in recording the cycles of their beloved gardens. She also kept a private journal of her struggle with illness. Excerpts from her journal are an integral part of Between Gardens, providing a poignant counterpoint to the vibrant letters. Dorothy's photographs and handmade paper accompany the words, expressing her acute perception of the natural world.",
