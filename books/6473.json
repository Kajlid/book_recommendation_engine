  "description": "In the acclaimed Night Tracker series by New York Times bestselling author Cheyenne McCray, the vampires are back to make a brand new start of it—in old New York…With zero tolerance for bloodsuckers, Nyx and the Trackers have made the streets safer for warm-blooded New Yorkers. Unfortunately, they didn't drive a stake through the problem nationwide. Vampire attacks are on the rise. Proctors are dropping like flies. And Volod—New York's ousted Master Vampire—is trying to make a comeback…Nyx is worried—about her city, her job, and her neck. But mostly she's concerned about her former lover, Rodán, a Proctor who's gone missing. Scarier still, Volod is capturing and \"turning\" paranorms to help him paint the town red. Which sucks. Because some of these new vampires are Nyx's old friends. But hey—if she can stake them here, she'll stake them anywhere…",
