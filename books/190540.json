  "title": "How to Make the Most of Your Earth Experience: 14 Principles for Living Unconditional Love",
  "description": "It’s your life. Live it your way.  Let’s face it. The voice of your Inner Critic can:  • Weigh you down  • Hold you back.  • Mess up relationships.  • Stress you out.  • Block creativity.  • Keep you imprisoned in the past where you don’t need to be.  But not any more because here’s a spiritual go-to guide that can lighten up the way you live.  When you let the vibrations of Unconditional Love transform that past conditioning of your Inner Critic into full-out emotional and mental freedom, nothing can stop you from living the life you came here to live.  Go from confused to confident… from knee jerk reactions to knee slappin’ happy… from hiding your truth, your power, and your joy to singing it on the rooftops or just humming it at the grocery store.  Written as a metaphorical guidebook for Divine Souls having a human experience (that would be you) makes it fun. At the same time…  • It’s practical and concrete.  • The approach is simple.  • The actions steps make it a no-brainer.  • The results are personal and powerful.  It’s time to remember how to consciously create whatever it is your heart truly desires.  • Healthy relationships.  • A healthy body.  • Fulfilling business endeavors.  • A lifestyle that truly suits you with a flow of prosperity to sustain it with abundance.  • A deep sense of well-being and emotional freedom in all you do.  • A deep calm that comes from knowing you’re living your own personal mission in life.  Nothing ever needs to hold you back again. Not with this handy guidebook on your side.",
