  "description": "\"An extraordinary new series\" - Book Reader's Heaven Trapped in a world where wizards rule, the Blackwood brothers from New Orleans have become entangled in events that threaten to upend the Realm. Oldest brother Val, sentenced to die in wizard prison, is forced to undertake a quest for the Congregation to try to win his freedom—but which might cost him his soul. Reunited with an old companion, Caleb must overcome his personal demons as he braves the dangers of the Barrier Coast to warn his ancestors of the coming invasion. And in a distant unexplored jungle, Will must find his warrior spirit as he and Mala lead a party of adventurers in search of the Coffer of Devla, a fabled artifact thought to reside in the lost pyramid of Yiknoom Ukab K’ahk, the most powerful sorcerer king who has ever lived. Used to annihilate the enemies of its possessor, the coffer might be the only hope for the struggling revolution. Yet even if Will’s expedition is a success, prophecy holds that the coffer can only be used by a cleric of Devla. And no true cleric has walked the Realm for centuries . . . \"Top 7 books of 2017\" - O.D. Book Reviews \"So far in this year of books this is my absolute favorite.
