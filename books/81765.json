  "description": "Elise is a professional photographer with an apparently perfect family life. Things are never quite what they seem. \"Some people have all the luck. One influential lover, another stunningly handsome one and an open travel account\" is a quote from one of her less steadfast friends. She has a creative way of achieving some of her more successful photographs that lands her into trouble, scandal and eventually personal trauma. She discovers that close family are not necessarily as dependable as loyal friends nor even newly formed acquaintance.",
