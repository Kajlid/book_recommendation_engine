  "description": "Book one in the Riding the Raines series.Trina Mattews lost her husband of sixteen years to a tragic accident. Starting her life over in the small town of Hailey, Texas, at the age of thirty-eight sounded like a good idea but she never counted on the loneliness she’d experience.Navarro Raine is the hottest man she’s ever seen. He’s tall, with piercing blue eyes and Native American beauty. He fills her nighttime fantasies and makes her wonder about all the things she’s yet to experience in bed. And Navarro has a reputation for being very good in that department…Discovering he’s about to lose his family ranch, Trina has the perfect solution for both of them. She’s willing to offer Navarro the money to save his ranch if he’ll give her the kind of sex she’s only read about. It might be the craziest thing she’s ever done but after years of vanilla sex, she’s made up her mind—it’s time to taste a few more flavors.Reader This story has graphic sexual language and scenes - no closed bedroom doors (or other rooms) here!",
