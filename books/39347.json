  "description": "Right Ho, Jeeves is the second full-length novel to feature Wodehouse's most beloved characters, Bertie Wooster and his \"gentleman's gentleman,\" Jeeves. This witty frolic through early 20th century English society features some of Wodehouse's very best writing and one particular scene that is considered a masterpiece of comic literature. Jeeves the mastermind has devised a clever plan by which one Gussie Fink-Nottle, a friend of idler Bertie Wooster, can win the heart of his fair lady. But when Bertie begins to meddle, disaster ensues! Throw in a formidable aunt, an ancient grammar school prize day, and a bit too much liquid cheer, and you have the formula for some of the most delightful reading you will ever encounter. It's just laugh-out-loud funny!",
