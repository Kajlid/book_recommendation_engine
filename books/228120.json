He settles into his new life in a new city with a sexy new neighbor who goes out drinking every night and seems to have a lot of kinky, fantastic sex every day.Fiona has more than a few scars from her past, nightmares so bad she cant be in her own apartment at night. She spends her days moaning like a porn star to her phone sex callers and putting up walls so thick no one can break them down.That is until she keeps getting woken up from the hot new guy next door and goes over to confront him, sending them both into uncharted territory. When their pasts come charging into their present, will they be able to heal the old wounds enough to let each other in? Or is there some damage that is simply too difficult to overcome?",
