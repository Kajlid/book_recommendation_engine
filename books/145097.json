  "description": "A SUPERMODEL After candidly admitting her virginal state, Jordana Almueda, the world's top supermodel, finds herself in the crosshairs of the tabloid media. Worse, she becomes a challenge for men - receiving a record number of proposals (most of them indecent) since her faux pas. Needing a break, she goes off to Italy to play maid of honor to her best friend. Finally, some downtime at last. Or so she thinks. A BILLIONAIRE Lonzo Vitale's name exudes power. A billionaire by his early thirties, his undeniable good looks and dynamism inspire awe and grabs headlines. The European business sector follows his boardroom moves, usually a step or two behind, while his bedroom conquests provide fodder for gossip pages. He is a man who vows never to settle - a true serial monogamist. When his best friend suddenly decides to tie the knot, Lonzo agrees to be his best man, in hopes of changing the groom's mind about the pitfalls of matrimony. A STORY MADE IN TABLOID HEAVEN. On the eve of the wedding, they find themselves entwined on a bed, naked and with no recollection of how they ended there in the first place. Or that their naked pictures will be selling tabloids weeks later.",
