Once the smoke clears, the man who claims he s her husband is more than eager to reward her for her timely assistance.James Morrow knows very little about the woman he was forced to marry five years ago, but the woman who saved him doesn t fit the portrait he s painted of her in his mind. She s strong, brave, and submits to his every dark desire. She seems the perfect woman for a pirate, but he makes his living among the dishonest and disreputable trust isn t a commodity he trades in.\"",
