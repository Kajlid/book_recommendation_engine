  "description": "Charlie, forester for Macallister Outdoors' corporate wilderness retreat, takes Ian Macallister, the owner and her boss, to inspect a newly purchased tract of forest with a tiny lake that fascinates Ian because of the legends of a spirit that lives in it. While there, they see lights and hear music but, before they can investigate further, a severe storm strands them in the forest and severely damages the beaver dam that created the lake, forcing them to remain without proper equipment to repair the dam and save the lake in order to save the spirit in it... if the spirit exists. And Charlie must fight her growing attraction to her boss or become involved in a tawdry workplace affair.",
