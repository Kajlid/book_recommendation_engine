  "description": "Seventh grade at Archibald Hunter Elementary School was nothing like Kati imagined it would be. She had always thought living in Tiny was boring. Life would never be boring again. Since school started her world had been turned upside down with ghosts, legends, first crushes, new best friends and great old friends. It all started with her new look and the almost silent click of a cell phone camera and now things would never be the same again.",
