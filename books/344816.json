  "description": "The national bestselling author of Fragile returns with a luscious new blend of sex and suspense.   Quinn Rafferty is working as a bounty hunter for a private detective agency in St. Louis when a new neighbor catches his eye. He's drawn to her—but he has his own soul to mend before he can worry about anyone else.  Sarah McElyea is on the run, but not for the usual reasons a woman goes on the lam. She has a plan for her future. And as much as she finds herself attracted to her gruff, tough neighbor, she can't risk telling him the secrets she's hiding.  But Quinn must get closer to Sarah when she turns out to be the target of his new missing persons case, and both Quinn and Sarah will have to expose their true feelings—as well as their fragile hearts—if their love is to survive.",
