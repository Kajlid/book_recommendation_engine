  "title": "The Masters of Bow Street",
  "description": "This epic novel embraces the story of the Bow Street Runners, forerunners of the modern police force, who were founded by novelist Henry Fielding in 1748. They were the earliest detective force operating from the courts to enforce the decisions of magistrates. John Creasey's account also gives a fascinating insight into family life of the time and the struggle between crime and justice, and ends with the establishment of the Metropolitan Police after the passing of Peel's Act in 1829. Splendidly authoritative! J-4",
