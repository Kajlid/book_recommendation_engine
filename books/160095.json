  "description": "“You’re asking me to…love you?” asked Mia. He slowly scratched his thick black stubble. “I suppose I am.”  What if you were asked to love a dangerous man who betrayed you at every turn, who terrified you even in your sleep? Could you do it to save the people you hold dear?  Mia Turner is ready to give it all—her body, her heart, her soul—to the mysterious, ruthless billionaire who holds the cards to saving her family. But when this sinfully sexy man, simply known as King, demands something more, something horrifying, Mia will be forced to face the impossible truth about their lives.  Sometimes the truth brings salvation. And sometimes the truth breaks you.",
