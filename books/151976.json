When the perfect lad falls into Corby’s lap, having crashed into the roof of his apartment building, a special bond is created between the two of them that neither one could break. And as the ex-marine is thrown into the thick of things, having set himself against both the police and the government, as well as his old pals from the military and the dog-faced mercenaries from the deep space, a loony billionaire and a priest, he takes on a mission to protect the perfect guy from them all. And by doing so, he might just earn himself and the humanity a second chance, a chance to redeem mistakes of the past and save the peoples of the world from the ultimate evil.But is the power of four elements going to be enough for the job or will it take the fifth element?The book contains the scenes of alien/human violence and gory bloodshed. There is no graphic intercourse in this book.",
