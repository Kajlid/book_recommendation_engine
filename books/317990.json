Living with no one for company but her reclusive uncle in a remote cabin lacks excitement.Until she realizes someone is watching every move she makes. The question is are they friends or foe and how in the world will she draw them out of hiding?If only she knew the danger was lurking much closer than she could ever imagine.Roman is a man on a mission. To keep himself as far away from society as he can. He's seen the worst humanity has to offer and he doesn't want any of it.Until the day he wanders farther from his sanctuary in the woods than he ever has and stumbles upon the most beautiful gift, and has no choice but to make her his - no matter what it takes.Watching Her is a novella with stalker vibes, a steamy couple who can't take their eyes - or hands - off each other and the smallest amount of daddy kink.
