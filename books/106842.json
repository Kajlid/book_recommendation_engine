  "description": "After sixteen years on the lam, infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger was finally captured and brought to trial—and what a trial it was: nineteen gruesome murders, government secrets, FBI corruption, a dead witness, and an unbelievable love triangle. Whitey's machine guns and gangland-style extortions gripped the city of Boston for decades.Investigative journalist Jon Leiberman travelled the world with the FBI’s Whitey Bulger task force. Former Boston area prosecutor and legal analyst Margaret McLean witnessed every day of testimony, heard every word uttered in court. Both authors have developed close relationships with the investigators, the lawyers, and Whitey’s friends, his fellow mobsters, his victims and their families.　 In Whitey on Trial, the truth is revealed through trial testimony, interviews with cops, FBI agents, prosecutors and defense attorneys, and members of the jury that ultimately found Bulger guilty on thirty-one counts, including eleven murders. Authors McLean and Leiberman trace Whitey’s rise from a small-time criminal in South Boston to mob boss and murderer that spurred a worldwide manhunt. An exclusive letter from Whitey to McLean offers insight into his state of mind immediately following the verdict. Whitey on Trial is the definitive firsthand account of the Whitey Bulger trial.",
