  "description": "The story begins in the peaceful Havah Valley, where stands the beautiful new city of Ethrae. Known as the Garden City, it is home to Wyssoning trees that sing at sunset. In Ethrae lives Ahfai, an orphan girl, who in setting out to find her missing father finds herself at the epicenter of an ancient battle between the kingdom of Darkness and the throne of Light. When a deadly Eil descends on her city, and Rumers invade the streets, Ahfai begins to dream strange dreams. Trained in the art of Humyl, an ancient art of self-defense, she sets out to make sense of the dreams that haunt her nights, and the Rumers that lurk in the shadows by day. If they sniff out her familyâ€™s secret, that they still hold to the outlawed legends of the valley, her family could lose all they have. She must find the key hidden in her father's old stories in time to save them all.",
