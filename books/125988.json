  "description": "Ten articles in eight days is a tall order for any journalist, even for Polk Award winner Connor Reedly. But with a dying wife and an empty bank account, the promised payment of $250,000 is hard to turn down. More so, his enigmatic employer, Mason Becker, has insinuated Connor's acceptance of the job will result in a supernatural healing of his beloved wife.The people of Hailey, California--the subjects of Connor's charged articles--are a secretive group, not willing to open up to strangers. When shots are fired and Connor is running for his life, he demands Mason answer his questions: Why are the articles so important? Is anyone going to publish them? Where is the money coming from? How can he be so confident that the completion of the articles will heal his wife?Nothing in Connor s vast journalistic adventures--not Katrina, not September 11th, not even his first-hand experience in the genocide in Darfur--could prepare him for the answers Mason gives. Now, it seems, the life of everyone in Hailey including his wife's is in his hands.",
