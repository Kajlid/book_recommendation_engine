  "description": "SEALS–America’s best just got better.On the heels of a bloody first contact comes Earth’s most important diplomatic mission in a summit meeting with the three alien empires vying for control of the galaxy. Assurance that Earth’s first extraterrestrial ambassadors aboard the spaceship Pangaea will be safe means little to Lieutenant Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. After all, a job’s a job. As escorts on the voyage, Jackson and his sixteen-man team of new-breed Navy SEALS (Sea, Air, Land, and Space) must be neither seen nor heard. Unless, of course, the op hits the fan.While Jackson and his team respond to a distress call from an allied fleet, the Pangaea, with all its diplomatic passengers, goes missing, forcing the SEALS to follow the trail to an ice moon at the edge of the galaxy, a harsh environment crawling with crack commandos and hostile enemies. But for these warriors with their outrageous firepower, what seems an impossible quest is just another day in deep space.",
