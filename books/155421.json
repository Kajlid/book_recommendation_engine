  "description": "Sometimes, we love the wrong person for the right reasons.Set Adrift tells the story of love and loss, of deeply abiding friendship, and of sacrifice. The Immortal Isle series will rip your heart out and have you falling in love with the inhabitants of this small coastal town.This is book one in the Immortal Isle Series, and it's M/F throughout most of it, but there are M/M overtones and there is a brief M/M scene (not explicit). Terric and Jordyn are two people who are damaged and learning who they are, where they belong and what they should be doing. They love each other, and have for years. But there is more out there than being content, and they are realizing that, sometimes, you need to be uncomfortable for awhile, in order to find happiness.",
