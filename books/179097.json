  "description": "Forgiveness in the MC doesn’t come easy…They say you can never go home again, but I was out to prove them wrong. After a three year absence from the only home I have ever known, the Inferno Glory MC was not welcoming me back with open arms. Until Colt Sawyer sweeps me off my bike, makes me feel like a woman again, and shows me pleasures I have never dreamed of. Colt thinks he can save me, but I am not the MC darling everyone remembers me as, and no amount of scorching hot sex or whispering sweet nothings in my ear will change my hardened exterior.Or at least that is what I thought.He’s offering me passion, forgiveness and protection. And once secrets start being revealed, the protection he provides me may be the only reason I survive the Inferno Glory MC.Warning: This story involves steamy sex with multiple partners and tattooed alpha bikers. If you’re looking for a hot and dirty ride, this is your book.*Previously offered as a 5-part series under the pen name J.A. Fredericks. Now combined into one full-length novel.*",
