  "description": "The three volumes that comprise this compelling saga begin with In the Hall of the Dragon King, and follow the fortunes of Quentin, who as a young temple acolyte, seeks to overthrow the evil loosed by Necromancer Nimrood and to save Mensandor, the realm of the Dragon King. In the second volume, The Warlords of Nin, Quentin once again holds the king’s destiny in his hands as the Wolf Star grows greater and the power of the Nin increases, spreading its black terror. In The Sword and the Flame, the final volume, Quentin reigns as Dragon King and faces an insidious attack of evil—from within himself—when Nimrood holds his son hostage.",
