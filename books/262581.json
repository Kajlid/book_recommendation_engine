  "description": "**Moonbeam and Readers' Favorite award winner!**One week on an Alaskan cruise, three teens, and an endless trail of lies...Enter a series of thefts on board and they all fall under scrutiny. Though Navy acts a proper preacher’s daughter, she did end up with someone else’s purse in her hands, and Jesse knows way more than he should about what’s gone missing. Isaiah, however, is the one with motive—enough money and he could get back to his ranch. Each holds a piece of the truth, but exposing the thief could damn them all. They must navigate through the lies they’ve told, choose between standing together or saving themselves, and decide if innocence is worth facing their ugliest secrets.\"Triplicity should not be limited to young adult audiences. The depth of characterization, flavors of romance, adult confidences, and alternating viewpoints keep this story lively and involving for all ages.\" -- D. Donovan, Senior Reviewer, Midwest Book Review\"The authentic characters, snappy writing style, and compelling plots make it an ideal selection for any high schooler.\" -- Manhattan Book Review, 5 stars\"This story was extremely well-developed as far as the characters and plot... The book read very smoothly and was easy to understand. A great balance of mystery and intrigue with a truly fabulous cast of characters.\" -- San Francisco Book Review, 5 stars",
