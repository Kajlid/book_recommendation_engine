  "title": "St. Mawr / The Man Who Died",
  "description": "These two brilliant novels are deservedly among Lawrence's most popular works. Both are at the same time exciting narratives and striking expressions of Lawrence's philosophy. St. Mawr is the story of a splendid stallion in whose vitality the heroine finds the quality that is lacking in the men she knows. It is also the first of Lawrence's writing to be partially set in America, on a ranch in Arizona. The Man Who Died, originally published in Paris as \"The Escaped Cock\" and later retitled and revised, has as its main character Christ, who does not die on the cross but escapes to wander through the country seeking the meaning of human existence, which he finally discovers in a temple of Isis by the waters of Lebanon.",
