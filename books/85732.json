  "description": "Sarah Cummings has one goal in life--to break into Chicago's high society. Desperate to stop serving dinner to members of the wealthy Banning family and to start eating at society tables, Sarah spends her meager free time altering cast-off gowns to create the perfect wardrobe for her future life. When opportunity knocks at a chance meeting, she presents herself as Serena Cuthbert, weaving a fictitious past to go with her fictitious name. But as she gets closer to her goal--and closer to Simon Tewell, the director of St. Andrew's Orphanage--Sarah finds that she must choose between the life she has and the life she dreams of. Can she piece together the perfect life from scraps? Or will it all come unraveled in the face of true love?",
