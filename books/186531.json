  "description": "Something always brings him back to her….  Ryker Cage is a rough guy, with very particular tastes when it comes to sex. Rough, hard, and dirty is the extent of his repertoire. Never soft. He doesn’t have a clue about connecting with his sensitive side in the bedroom, or that find-your-inner-femininity bullshit. He fears nothing—except his feelings for the sweet and innocent Molly Monroe.  The bad boy who lived next door claimed Molly’s heart long ago. Crazy or not, she loves him. Always has. No matter what he does to push her away, or how far he runs, Ryker is the one man she’ll never stop loving.  When Ryker finally finds his way back home, will he find the courage to claim what’s always been his? Or will he be destined for heartache when someone threatens to take everything away?",
