  "description": "Neil Gaiman once said: \"I like stories where women save themselves.\"  Asked to work with this as guideline, sixteen authors from Canada, the UK, the USA, Ireland, and The Netherlands contributed sixteen stories about strong women, dangerous women, witty women, resourceful women, and most of all realistic women. The stories range from general fantasy to high fantasy to sci-fi to steampunk to horror.  No swooning, no male saviors, and only one token chain mail bikini (and that one is a riot!). Dreamtime Fantasy Tales authors are proud of our final result and sincerely hope you'll enjoy each and every page.  All proceeds of this anthology have been pledged to an animal rescue shelter which we chose knowing that each and every penny raised will benefit the animals, and not a highly-paid CEO.
