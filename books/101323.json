  "description": "Elizabeth Lancaster’s life appears normal. In Lizzie’s world of horses, friends, boundaries, and sweet tea, there is no room for paranormal beliefs, though secrets loom around her in the shadows nonetheless. But before Lizzie can begin to understand the power of these secrets, or the plan fate has in store for her, Lizzie must try and discover what lies within the mysteries of her own heart.When a mysterious stranger comes to Fox Meadows, fate steps out of the shadows. Unexplainable events begin to occur in Lizzie’s life, as well as in her dreams, creating fear, yet eliciting in her a strange notion of wonder at the possibilities. But Lizzie’s eyes are unable to believe what she sees. Her lack of experience with affairs of the heart cause her to mistrust her emotions. She convinces herself that there is an explanation, and these bizarre, and even frightening occurrences must somehow be tied to her unexpected crush on her best friend Rob Jacobs, and her intense draw to the intoxicating stranger, Cain Atchley.Lizzie’s path to self-discovery becomes twisted, dark, and at times, wicked. Caught between the passions of two men, Lizzie must follow the path laid before her, and wake the mysteries sleeping in her soul. Her journey begins with the story of The Three Crowns.",
