  "title": "Tough Girls: Down and Dirty Dyke Erotica",
  "description": "TOUGH GIRLS are not your typical girls next door -- they're bad girls, brats, sluts and bitches, dykes from the wrong part of town, the other side of the tracks. The girls you weren't supposed to hang out with in school. Girls in prison, girls with knives, daddies and girls, strippers, punks, and truckers -- Tough Girls like it rough. This collection of erotic tales, featuring authors such as Laura Antoniou, Marilyn Jaye Lewis, and FetishDiva Midori, edited by Lori Selke, takes a walk on the wild side of lesbian sex.",
