  "description": "This is the definitive chick guide - the ultimate visual resource for American chickspotting.It's outlandishly hilarious, spot-on accurate, provocatively illustrated, and organized like a field guide to birds, with a series of 2-page chick \"species\" profiles instead of chapters.And it's not just for bachelors. It's a must-read for the active and armchair chickspotter in all of us.",
