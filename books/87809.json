  "description": "Erica's charmed life changed in an instant with a devastating act of betrayal. And so with her secret, she ran. From everything and everyone, including the person she loved most in the world. Now she's back to take control of the life she left behind, even if she's doing so with a lot of uncertainty. And even as that event from the past still hangs over her, unresolved. But Erica knows a thing or two about survival. She just wished she knew what to do about Bryson Ellis, the guy who has her heart but doesn't know her secret, and Matt Corso, the one who knows her secret and may want her heart. Yet just when her life slowly comes together in other ways, she suddenly finds her strength tested again. But this time... She's ready. And she won't run. This follow-up to \"Documentary\" picks up with a new point of view in a story about what it means to love, forgive and never back down. But it's also one woman's chance to remake herself. This is NA fiction. Due to the sexual content, language and violence, this work is not recommended for readers under 17.",
