  "description": "How far can you fall? Caspar had once shone brighter than any star in the sky. He led an exciting life, had a good job and the love of his family. Now he barely survives in a village where he’s shunned by everyone, even his parents. Unemployed, unemployable, he consoles himself with stringless sex—lots of it.How hard can you land? Ally escapes death by a whisker when she falls in front of a train. Not an accident, someone pushed her, and she doesn’t hang around to give them another shot. But she finds herself falling in a different way when she meets Caspar, and she plummets hard and fast. He’s dark, he’s brooding, he’s hotter than any man she’s ever met, and she wants him—bad.How high can they soar? With Ally’s adversary closing in, plus Caspar’s tendency to screw things up, if they don’t open their arms and catch each other, they’ll burn up in an atmosphere determined to keep them apart.",
