  "title": "Nick & Kyle",
  "description": "Nick knew what he wanted, he just thought it was crazy and a little messed up—Okay, a lot messed up. Everyone knew bullying was wrong. Some deep part of Nick just hadn’t gotten the message. Each time Kyle approached him in school and called him a name or made him feel short and weak it should have made Nick feel terrible. It didn’t. It made his knees shake and sent shameful butterflies racing around in his stomach. Kyle knew what he wanted—Nick. No second-guessing. No hesitating. Everyone knew bullying was wrong, but Nick was the only person in school Kyle ever wanted to torment. Something about the way the sexy guy reacted made Kyle desperate. Desperate to touch him…to torment him…to take him… Story Contains: M/m sexual content, spanking, consensual humiliation play, and BDSM elements. Authors Note: This is a sweeter version of humiliation play. It is completely consensual and both main characters are enthusiastic about their desires. The heat level is higher than some of my other books, but it is very much a romance at heart. Each book in the series will be a standalone story.",
