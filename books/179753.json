  "description": "Regarded as both one of classical Greece’s premiere philosophers and writers, Plato is of course still well-known today, although two of his best works, The Symposium and The Phaedrus, are perhaps not taught as often as some of his other, lesser works. The reason? Both books are treatises on homosexuality, with the subject covered not only from Plato’s restrained point of view but also from the point of view of those who consider the love of adolescent males the highest form of love and at least one person, Pausanias, who feels the greatest love is between males who are more mature and more equal in age.",
