  "description": "A human who opened the wrong magical book, her stern boss, and his “friend” who says he can help…I’ve been cursed. Not metaphorically. Not, “Oh no! I spilled my coffee!” or “I broke a heel!”No.I’ve been cursed by a book and now I’m a danger to everyone I care about.After finding out that the things that go bump in the night are real a few weeks ago, this is doing nothing for my peace of mind.Pair it all with the fact that the boss I can hardly speak to seems to be the only one with any answers and the tension between him and the seductive expert he’s brought in…The outlook for this group project is alarming… but my body is acting like it knows things my mind won’t yet accept.Entranced by the Basilisks is a standalone monster romance in the same world as Stalked by the Kraken, but best read after Deceived by the Gargoyles. This book has two love interests who are also in a relationship with each other. There will be no choosing between the love interests.Content Warning: This book includes descriptions of anxiety, snakes, deceptions and manipulations perpetrated by the love interest, and highly inaccurate snake anatomy.",
