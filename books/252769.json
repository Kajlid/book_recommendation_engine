After a painful divorce two-years ago, her ex refuses to believe they’re done and fights for a reconciliation he’s convinced she wants no matter what she says.

Entrepreneur Theodore Barnes recently learned that his mother was murdered 19 years ago and is searching for the truth. Imani’s name comes up during the investigation and he chooses to meet the beautiful woman personally to ask questions.

Their search reveals things Theo wishes he never knew. When another person ends up dead, the pair learns quickly, knowledge without wisdom is deadly, and there are nuances and degrees to truth.
