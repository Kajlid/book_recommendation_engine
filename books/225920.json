  "title": "Rabbit Warrior",
  "description": "Rabbit Warrior is a captivating memoir of a transformative journey of renewal and discovery. Disoriented by intense mourning over the loss of both her mother and sister within a short time span, the author found consolation and reconciliation on a pilgrimage of solace to her beloved Cape Cod home. Emotionally overwhelmed, Janet turned inward for personal healing and wholeness. As she quietly contemplated the meaning of life and death, the Cape's wildlife became a voice for inspiration and revelation. Horseshoe crabs, lobsters, a great blue heron, and rabbits \"spoke\" to her of life: change and evolution, pain and suffering, death and dying. Supported on her journey by daily journal writing that exposed persons, places and memories stored deep within, she unmasked falsehoods, gave up protective \"magical thinking,\" and examined relationships in an effort to live a more authentic life. Writers and fellow soul-searching travelers helped Janet dispel guilt, expunge destructive messages and peel away emotional layers accumulated over decades. As she traversed her soul, Janet resolved to move ever deeper towards her core, her spiritual center. A summer that began with overwhelming sorrow mixed with angry confusion, ended with transformative feelings of enlightenment, forgiveness, love and rebirth. Janet hopes that both her memoir, as well as her summer reading list, will provide a template for other Rabbit Warriors who might wish to undertake their own liberating journey as well.",
