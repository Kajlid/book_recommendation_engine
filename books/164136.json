  "title": "Antonio's Will",
  "description": "A child emigrates from Spain to Puerto Rico in 1870, adapts to a new culture, and strives through hurricanes, disease and war to become a prominent tobacco planter. With high hopes, he sends his son Antonio to Albany Law School in New York, but the young man loses his will, commits an atrocious crime, and is executed on the electric chair at the Sing Sing penitentiary. Antonio's spirit returns one hundred years later to persuade a family member, who is also a lawyer and amateur genealogist, to uncover his wrongful execution. Amid a historical, cultural and legal backdrop spanning three countries and over a century, Antonio’s Will exposes the tragic events: the murder, the trial errors, the desolation at the Sing Sing prison, the pleas of an entire island to save him, and his unjust execution. This is Antonio’s story, but it is also a call for equal justice for all people.",
