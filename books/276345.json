There, she’s forced to face her fears and answer the question: Are the shadows real, or is this all in her head?At Brookwood, the shadow creatures are more present than ever and are getting stronger every day. Only with the help of a mysterious boy who lives inside the mirror world might she be able to prove that she’s not hallucinating and stop the shadows from destroying the human world.",
