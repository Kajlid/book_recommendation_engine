  "description": "Though she was born in the East, Kaylee Matthews took to the west like a duck to water. She loves the freedom of the wide open spaces, the beauty of the land. While riding with her neighbor, Randy, Kaylee discovers a wounded Indian. Against Randy's wishes, Kaylee insists on taking the Indian to an empty line shack and nursing him back to health, the way she did with the all the wounded creatures she found. Wounded and left for dead, Blue Hawk is prepared to die even though it means abandoning all hope of avenging himself on the white men who betrayed him. While waiting for death, he receives a startling vision before losing consciousness. On awaking, he finds himself being tended by the white woman in his vision. When he's strong enough to return home, Blue Hawk steals a horse and takes Kaylee with him, intending to trade her back to her family for weapons for his tribe. But somewhere along the way, distrust turns to love and attraction turns to desire, leaving them to wonder if they can heal old hurts and find a way to bridge the differences between them.",
