  "title": "Break for Freedom: The Story of a Mink",
  "description": "Syla was a mink, about eighteen inches long, weighing about twenty-four ounces, and so dark brown she looked almost black.At first glance she was identical with the forty-nine other females of her tribe, and the cage where she lived was identical with theirs, except for one thing - there was a loose staple in the floor of her sleeping box. And that wasv the way that Syla escaped from the fur farm to find new life, free in a remote valley on the edge of Dartmoor, free to hunt and fish and play, and also to face dangers of traps or sudden chills or fierce animals, or the perils of the wild life which has no mercy on weakness or carelessness.Ewan Clarkson is an expert naturalist and makes a fascinating story of Syla's year on the moor, her brief courtship with another escaped mink and her life with her cubs. At the same time he tells us about all the other inhabitants of Dartmoor, the birds and insects, snakes and rodents, till the moor seems as busy and complicated as the greatest human city. For readers of eleven upwards.",
