  "description": "A past that defined a future...\nShade has a secret.One he’s hidden most of his life.Secrets created in his past.Of a broken family. A little boy lost.Of broken dreams. With only nightmares left in their wake.As a prospect, his MC nicknamed him Shady because he’s quiet and keeps to himself.As a patched member of the Blood Fury, he changed it to Shade, because that’s what he prefers... to stick to the shadows.To remain unseen.Then he sees her. A flicker of light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.The only problem is, he may never escape that darkness until he sheds the chains of his past that weigh him down.Note: Blood & Bones: Shade is the sixth book in the Blood Fury MC series and is an age-gap romance (younger man/older woman). As always, this book has no cheating, no cliffhanger and has an HEA. It’s recommended to read this series in order.",
