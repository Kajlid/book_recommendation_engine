  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here and here.Our kids are no longer our future… They’re our demise.  Humanity’s advancements in medicine, meant to eliminate disease and extend life, have led to a macabre reality of childhood vaccinations gone terribly wrong.  Kids have transformed, changed into ravenous beasts that are nightmarishly quick, disproportionally strong, and void of empathy.  No amount of planning or preparation could have saved the human race against this unexpected attack, centralized in the heart of every human home, and the U.S. is quickly thrown into a chaos of Z Children. By the end of the first day, the entire world is jolted into a veritable hell on earth.  Yet, there are survivors- individuals who, by luck, skill, or circumstance, lived through the initial wave of destruction. These ‘lucky’ ones will join together, bonded in their quest for survival. They will try to maintain their humanity in a world where children have graduated from bubble baths to blood baths.  And they will try to find an answer to the only question that matters: What will tomorrow bring?",
