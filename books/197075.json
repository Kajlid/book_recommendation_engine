  "description": "The only thing standing between her and disaster is a man she can't trust...\nAs far as Dinah Pittman is concerned, men can't be trusted. Especially cops. Her own father was a former cop and a convicted felon who stole a small fortune before dying in prison. The best part? No one knows where the money is...and someone is willing to kill off everyone who knows anything about it. And Dinah is next. Rafe Morales left the Dallas police force to settle down to a simpler life in the small Texas town of El Royo. Instead, he finds himself protecting an infuriating, tough-as-nails, oh-so-sexy victimâ€”and driving himself crazy with a thoroughly unprofessional desire. But as the body count rises, Rafe and Dinah must find a way to trust each other...before they both end up dead.",
