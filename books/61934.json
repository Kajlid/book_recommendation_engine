  "description": "Where do lost books go? The Babylonian texts thrown in the Tigris by the Mongol invaders of Baghdad. The sequel to Gogol’s Dead Souls burned to ashes by its own creator. The original edition of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom misplaced by T.E. Lawrence in a train station. Are these books destroyed forever in those moments? Or does a piece of them live on? By day, Darius is a struggling ad writer. One night, he slips into a hitherto undiscovered world where a small group of determined guardians preserve lost books. As he explores this new world, he learns the techniques used for gathering and preserving the lost manuscripts. But all is not well. Darius’ arrival has set in motion a series of events that threatens to bring down the entire world. If Darius hopes to preserve the Library and all it contains, he must reach within himself to find the strength to face the greatest threat this world has ever known. Where do lost books go? They go to the Library of Lost Books.",
