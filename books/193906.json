  "description": "A jaded homicide detective working a serial murder case is teamed up with a new partner—a law enforcer from an alien race Big-city life in the near future is full of violence and tension for Saigo City homicide detective David Silver. His latest assignment is to track down a serial killer dubbed “Machete Man” because he hacks his victims to pieces. But Silver and his partner Mel Burnett just caught a break: One of Machete Man’s intended victims—an elderly woman who would’ve been number six—escapes. And the killer left some DNA behind. Too bad the bureaucrats in charge have brought in a third wheel to assist the Homicide Task Force. Hailing from a superior race gifted with advanced technology, the Elaki have come to Earth to advise in everything from politics to medicine to big business—and now, it seems, police fieldwork. Standing seven feet tall with scales that ripple in the breeze, String resembles a stingray and smells like fresh lime. But he’s turning out to be an unexpected asset in a case that’s quickly morphing into something even more sinister: a far-reaching conspiracy that could leave a lot more people dead, including Detective Silver.   A twisting, complex crime tale with intriguing characters, including Silver’s DEA- turned-enforcer wife, Rose, and an Elaki named the Puzzle Solver, Alien Blues realistically depicts a world in which aliens and humans can coexist.",
