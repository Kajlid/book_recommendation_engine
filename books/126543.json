  "description": "Sharing a mate with his brother would be difficult. But keeping it a secret? Maybe, impossible. With Amon finally in custody and set to live out his days in the palace dungeon, Ever and Talon are ready for what should be the honeymoon phase. They're safe now, and all that's left to do is wrap up a quick visit with the King before heading home. But when a plot to overthrow the King is revealed and someone close to them is suspected as a conspirator, everything changes. Not one mate. Not two mates. But, three? Things are getting very crowded. King Drake couldn't pass up the chance to see her. Just once. The girl who dances through his dreams. SUCK U is book 2 in a long-running series with more than one storyline. The first storyline is told from a multi-POV, and is set to be a trilogy. This first story is a progressive reverse-harem. Meaning, the FMC will add mates as the series progresses.  Adult language, steamy adult scenes, and themes of abuse, rape, and stalking, but while those may be disturbing to some, this book is meant to be a fun read.",
