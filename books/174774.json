  "title": "Young Nixon",
  "description": "Sometimes hilarious Black Comedy satire,based on the Frost-Nixon tapes and even more bizarre revelations unveiled from the Casper Enigma and the Apocalypse series by the same author.  Explosive revelations surround the earliest exploits of the young Richard Nixon,how he lived up to his famous nickname, and a set of unlikely conspirators from his time as a secret agent in World War Two,leading through the famous deaths of White House incumbents on the path towards ultimate power.  A refreshing departure from the kind of war heroic saga which takes itself too seriously,while still delving into the nefarious depths to which the often comical and sometimes horrifying plotting and double-cross between sides can take a really ambitious and thrusting personality.  A knockout set of revelations from a dark era in the annals of infamy,still casting its baleful shadow on us all today.",
