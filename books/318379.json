  "title": "Conversational Therapy: Stories and Plays",
  "description": "Conversational Therapy is a debut collection of challenging and unusual short stories and one-act plays.In A KEEPSAKE MEMORY, a wrongfully imprisoned girl tries to escape the confines of an abandoned mental asylum and the treacherous hands of a psychotic doctor placed in charge of keeping her there. In ALLIGATOR RESORT, a SoHo prototype living a Bohemian lifestyle gets more than he bargains for on a family retreat to the great outdoors when a cloaked madman unleashes an army of lab engineered alligators on the slacker’s family cottage. In PSYCHIATRIST’S PSYCHIATRIST, a distressed woman interviews with a new psychiatrist after her old one commits suicide. In THE LAST LAUGH, an excessively overweight comedian looks back on his arduous journey through life while presently navigating his claustrophobic condominium, the building’s smallish elevators, and the lobby’s makeshift comic stage.These and many more exhilarating pieces full of suspense, biting social commentary and black humor from the darkest depths of human psyche await the reader. Unrelenting, surreal, and even occasionally twisted tales which, more often than not, have a ring of truth and relatability outside the falsity and the make believe.",
