  "description": "Graduation is fast approaching and with it the threat of Selena looms closer and closer. But the question is leave? Or fight? Jonathon will do anything to keep Kylie safe even if that means entrusting their lives in their greatest enemy next to Selena, The Coven. Graduation has hardly ended when the Pulmers and The Coven are on the road with precious cargo in tow. Kylie is not at all pleased with this arrangement. Hiding in the woods in a tent from Selena doesn’t make much sense to her. Kylie knows that Selena is after a fight and if Selena wants a fight that’s what she’s going to get. Loyalties are tested, temptation is around every corner, and not everyone will make it out alive.",
