  "title": "Squeezed: The True Story of Fruit and Global Greed",
  "description": "What if your morning orange juice had the blood of empires on its hands?For centuries, fruit has been at the center of power, corruption, and global exploitation—all while sitting quietly in your grocery store aisle, looking innocent. But behind every banana, pineapple, and apple is a long history of stolen land, overthrown governments, corporate greed, and backroom deals that shaped the world. Why did the U.S. government help overthrow Latin American leaders just to protect bananas? How did American businessmen steal Hawaii for sugar and pineapples? Why did a single tariff nearly collapse the economy of an entire kingdom? And why is fruit still at the heart of racial stereotypes, global trade wars, and economic exploitation today? In Squeezed, historian James Hendrix peels back the layers of history with sharp wit, biting satire, and a healthy dose of outrage, revealing how fruit was never just food—it was a weapon, a business empire, and a tool of control. If you love fast-paced, engaging history with a side of dark humor and hard-hitting truths, this book will make you rethink every bite. Every peel, pulp, and pit has a story. And most of them aren’t pretty.",
