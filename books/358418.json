  "description": "The women are strong, the men are hot … and passions simmer just below the surface.  Welcome to Jamesville, Maine, a small town with a big heart. Where folks come looking for a fresh start - and sometimes find much more than they bargained for. A Legal AffairIt’s not easy for Alicia Flint to even date, much less take a lover. As a lawyer, her livelihood depends on her spotless reputation. A chance encounter with a stranger at a friend’s wedding tempts her to do something she’s never done before - have a red-hot, one-night stand. The guy will be gone tomorrow; no one need ever know her delicious little secret. The only problem is that Gill Baron is in Jamesville to stay. Past PromisesLinda Fletcher’s newly opened antiques business is her declaration of independence from her powerful and manipulative family. She’s never considered herself the no-strings-affair type, but the chemistry between her and her newly hired handyman, Levi Mann, is too intense to ignore. Moving to Jamesville was a bold step, so what’s the harm in taking one more - into his arms? Warning: This title contains very explicit language, dysfunctional families, a very large inheritance and lots of wild, hot sex.",
