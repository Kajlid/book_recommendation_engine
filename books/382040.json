  "description": "Trash, Allison's landmark collection, laid the groundwork for her critically acclaimed Bastard Out of Carolina, the National Book Award finalist that was hailed by The New York Times Book Review as \"simply stunning...a wonderful work of fiction by a major talent.\" In addition to Allison's classic stories, this new edition of Trash features \"Stubborn Girls and Mean Stories,\" an introduction in which Allison discusses the writing of Trash and \"Compassion,\" a never-before-published short story.First published in 1988, the award-winning Trash showcases Allison at her most fearlessly honest and startlingly vivid. The limitless scope of human emotion and experience are depicted in stories that give aching and eloquent voice to the terrible wounds we inflict on those closest to us. These are tales of loss and redemption; of shame and forgiveness; of love and abuse and the healing power of storytelling. A book that resonates with uncompromising candor and incandescence, Trash is sure to captivate Allison's legion of readers and win her a devoted new following.",
