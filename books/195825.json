But a man unexpectedly enters her life and her family takes an interest in him. Soad's friends - Hasna and Noora are two sisters raised by their liberal grandmother. Unlike Soad, Hasna yearns for love but she falls in love with the wrong men for her. After she is dishonoured, her family repudiates her and she finds herself facing an uncertain future in a hostile society towards women like her. Even her sister, Noora, has to suffer the consequences of having covered up Hasna's mistakes. Baghdad is plunged into chaos after the war. Unrest, revenge killings and religious violence start to take hold of the city. The three friends come face to face with their shattered dreams and their new realities. But as they go through war, loss of loved ones and upheavals, the women of Baghdad learn that defying tradition brings with it only solitude. Some of them will choose to stand by their community while others will have to create for themselves a new destiny.",
