  "description": "When a trivial incident sparks conflict in a Buddhist monastery, a young monk named Sati is embroiled in a plot that reaches all the way to the palace and inflames the city of Kosambi. Amid corrosive tensions, Sati struggles to make sense of his monastic calling and the teachings of mindfulness and lovingkindness. He faces challenges that test even the wisdom of the Buddha, exposing the worst and inspiring the best in all those caught in the plot. The Kosambi Intrigue, rooted in actual events in ancient India, follows in the footsteps of Hermann Hesse's beloved masterwork, Siddhartha. Stephen Batchelor, author of best-selling Buddhism Without Beliefs, comments, \"I loved The Kosambi Intrigue....The characters are distinctive and alive, the dramatic narrative unfolds at a steady, engaging pace and the world of the Buddha's time is sketched with great vividness, attention to detail and conviction. Although the situation occurred more than two thousand years ago, it is just as true of idiosyncratic humanity now as it was then....brilliantly done.\"",
