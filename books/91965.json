  "description": "Reap is the first book in the series Walking Among Them, a paranormal/supernatural series for young adults. A quaint little river town in Kentucky seemed a little boring to Sophie. When her father got transferred, she was less than excited to be pulled from a school and home she loved, to start all over... again. It turns out, however, that this small town is anything but boring. Sophie finds herself in the midst of a supernatural stomping ground that would rival her wildest dreams. Will she uncover life's mysteries and search for the path she was meant to take?",
