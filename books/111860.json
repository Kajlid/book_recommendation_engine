  "description": "Savannah Morrison is the new athletic trainer for the Moncton Ice Cats, a professional hockey team in the wilds of New Brunswick. It’s a good thing she’s got plenty of knowledge and grit, because as the only female trainer in the league, she has to work twice as hard to win the players’ respect. The last thing on earth she would do is date one of them.Twelve year hockey veteran Garrick LeBlanc isn’t ready to hang up his skates, particularly since he hasn’t figured out what the hell he’s planning to do next. He needs the new trainer to keep him fit to play, and she’s got the skills to do it. Too bad he lost his mind and hit on her the day they met. Now she hates his guts and he’s made an art of ignoring her.When the team is put up for sale, Garrick and Savannah have to work together to save their jobs and their team. Somewhere along the way, they discover Garrick isn’t just a hockey player, Savannah isn’t only passionate about her work, and maybe they’ve got more in common than they thought.Fair Play, the 1st book in the Hat Trick series, is a enemies-to-lovers romance featuring a hometown hero, a kick-ass woman who can weaponize duct tape, and the Moncton Ice Cats—a hockey team that looks out for their own. All of Sam’s romances take place in the same world, but Fair Play can be read as a standalone. It is an 80,000 word f/m romance with no cheating, no cliffhangers, and a guaranteed HEA. Fair Play contains brief m/m content, but don't worry, there's plenty more in Book 2.",
