This cozy fantasy series has mystery, magic, and a splash of romance!Up until a week ago, my only knowledge of magic came from the movies. Unfortunately, it didn’t stay that way.A bout of insomnia leads to witnessing a scene that belongs in a vampire flick—only, the fangs looked way more realistic. One second, I was running for my life, and the next, I found myself choking on a hairball in the back of an SUV.That’s right … a hairball. See, my body's been hiding a pretty big secret, and I’m some kind of witch. One that turns into a cat when under duress.Apparently, my choices are fight, flight, or … fur.Overnight, I find myself thrust into a world of magic and mayhem beyond my most wild sleep-deprived delirium. Until the murderous vampire is captured, I’m placed into some kind of witch-ness protection program, and sent to live in a house full of actual monsters.What’s the worst that could happen?Hey, at least running for my life will help me squeeze in my cardio.***Witches in the Kitchen is the first novel in a new series of paranormal mysteries from Danielle Garrett. Come stay at the Magic Inn where anything is possible—including the stuff from nightmares.",
