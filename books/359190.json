  "description": "In the third installment in Anonymous's popular series which began with The Book with No Name and continued with The Eye of the Moon , the Bourbon Kid returns for more vengeance, this time on the contestants of a television talent contest   The Devil’s Graveyard is an area of desert. Its only habitations are a small roadside gas station, and a giant hotel, where the final of the Back from the Dead singing competition is held, in which contestants compete by impersonating dead stars. Except that someone is killing them off . . . and there are other killers out there, too—not to mention zombies. Featuring characters from The Book with No Name and The Eye of the Moon , this is a show where anything goes and anyone can enter. Even the judges aren't quite what they seem. Sanchez, Elvis, the Mystic Lady, a whole bunch of dead rock stars and, of course, the Bourbon Kid are headed to the Hotel Pasadena for what is quite literally the most cutthroat reality show there's ever been. Dreams will be crushed, deals will be made, and blood will be spilled. The latest book is a rip-roaring addition to the series by the author with no name, which is guaranteed to be every bit as gory, fast-paced, and adrenaline pumping as the previous novels. It's Tarantino meets Pop Idol in a sensationally blood-streaked adventure that takes the tale of the Bourbon Kid to new and even creepier heights.",
