  "description": "By the twenty-first century, Germany has all but taken over the world. Only one nation remains untouched . . . America. Only spies slip in and out of enemy territory. Within this shadowy and dangerous world of cloak and dagger, Isabel Riley is an American spy deep in enemy territory. Isabel is detained at a German checkpoint by a black-uniformed SS officer. She's arrested, taken into custody and interrogated. But she soon learns her enigmatic captor wants more than just her secrets. He enjoys tying her up or teasing her with the tails of his leather flogger. But floggers and video cameras are the least of her concerns. In the eyes of the Third Reich, ownership is real. And a lovely American spy is far too tempting of a war prize to pass up.",
