  "description": "Considering that two years earlier, poisoned green mist had taken over the City of London spawning zombies that ate his parents and turned him into a half-zombie, Tremayne was doing alright.True, moaning zombies and nightmares made sleeping difficult but as long as he kept away from the game hunters who paid to kill and scalp zombies, he could handle the apocalypse.However, when a dangerous half-turned zombie called Red turns up, he loses what’s left of his heart. Unfortunately, she’s driven by a mission to save their fellow zombies that he just can’t ignore.Instead of keeping out the way, Tremayne finds himself agreeing to take on game hunters in a vicious reality show televised live to millions.Surviving the few days before the cameras begin to roll becomes increasingly difficult as powerful enemies with a lot to lose want them dead before the show begins.",
