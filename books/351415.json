  "title": "Dangerlok",
  "description": "'Dangerlok' is the word coined by Rina Ferreira, middle-aged, single, lecturer of English, to cover all occasions, dangerous people, tiresome people, people she doesn't like. Rina lives in a squalid corner of Bombay and daily comes across some dangerlok. Yet she will live nowhere else in the world. Rina observes all around her and dashes off letters brimming with the details of her life to David, an old flame now in America. Funny, irreverent and sad, Dangerlok is the story of an urban life, with all its absurdities, loneliness and, of course, danger.",
