  "description": "Evie Snow, a lone Private Investigator who happens to be a psychic (and has never lost trail of a missing child since she put up her own business) suddenly found herself on paths with Hunter Vale, the man who's marked her past with bitterness after he'd betrayed her with another woman before their romance took off.Hunter's little niece was missing and he badly needed Evie's help. Evie, on the other hand, knew she would try to find the child even before she learned who she was. She confronted the familiar painful feelings of his past betrayal when she was forced to work with him to save little Christa and bring her home to her devastated parents for Christmas, or before it was too late. But to her utter dismay, the sexual tension and incredible awareness she felt towards him from the moment he appeared in her doorway and back to her life again could only mean one thing--he's still the only man who could get through her tough facade and could very well still be the only man who owned her heart.",
