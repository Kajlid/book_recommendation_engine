  "description": "From New York Times best selling author, Kelly Elliott, comes a new series her WANTED fans will adore. Filled with love, hope, and second chances, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, is book one in the Southern Brides series. Each book in this series will be stand alone books. Love at first sight. That’s what it was when Rip Myers came up to me in kindergarten. From that point on, we were inseparable best friends. When I work up the courage to tell Rip I love him, I am met with rejection. He tells me he treasures our friendship too much. That statement might as well be a knife to my heart. I want to hold out hope that he’ll change his mind. Instead, he moves on. The only choice I have is to pretend that doesn’t slay me. So, I say yes…to the man I love. But he isn’t the man I’ve been in love with nearly my entire life.",
