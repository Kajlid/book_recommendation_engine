Then Ted meets Anderson Taylor, and it’s like being struck by lightning. Anderson is a cardiac surgeon whose passion for his work has consumed him. He fears he’ll never find a partner—until he sets eyes on Ted. It’s happening fast, but both men know what they feel is right. Confronted with an angry preacher, a scandal, and an act of God that threatens to destroy everything, their relationship will face its first true test.",
