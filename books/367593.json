  "description": "My clan of wolf shifters wanted me dead for being born a girl... but I didn’t just survive but also met someone that felt like family.That someone was a boy in the orphanage I grew up in.I never could have imagined that I’d meet Derek again...His innocent eyes had a lot of pain in them after all those years.Perhaps that was the reason I didn’t recognize him at first.It didn’t matter what my heart felt for him.I had to keep myself from Derek... at all costs.There was no way he could find out my real identity.Derek was human, and I was not.That was the only fact I needed to remember, especially now that I had hired him as my employee.But the heart never listens to reason.One single night changed everything.The bad boy that I’d been in love with was hiding a secret of his own.And he was the only one that could make my body shiver with pleasure.The dream that I’d started living in wasn’t real.Danger was chasing us... and Derek became the only one that could save my entire world.Each book in this sexy-as-sin series can each be read as standalones, and has no cliffhangers, but are best read in order.Warning: Adults Only",
