  "description": "The Bychkov Bratva need an heir. Now.   They wanted a woman quickly, so they chose a home where no one would ask questions. Instead, they got twenty-one-year-old American, Starla Anderson. When the Russian Mafia invades the orphanage where she lives, in the middle of the night, throwing the nuns who raised her into a petrified frenzy, it’s Starla who is chosen as the only one who could possibly survive the Bratva and their demands.  In spite of her own fear of the three massive, glowering and scary men, Starla has to think and act fast. With her heart thundering in her chest, her body on fire at their mere presence, she sees an opportunity, something that might help the other girls at the impoverished home get a chance of a better life. She lays out her only condition: her body for a fee… Except… No one says no to the Bratva.  Publisher’s Note: This dark mafia romance contains elements of mystery, suspense, power exchange and a guaranteed HEA.",
