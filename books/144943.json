But even though Jo doesn't always meet the expectations of the people around her, she still longs to fit in. When she and her family leave their northern home for the small southern town of Jericho, Alabama, Jo might finally stop picking fights and settle in right.But when Jo befriends a young black boy, she discovers that \"fitting in\" is about a lot more than proper manners or a new outfit. Suddenly she's faced with a new set of questions that call up her own values. Maybe some fights are worth picking after all. Set in 1957, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, this riveting novel tells the inspiring story of a young girl growing up amidst racism.",
