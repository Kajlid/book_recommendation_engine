  "title": "The Egyptian Book of Life: A True Translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Featuring Original Texts and Hieroglyphs",
  "description": "According to ancient Egyptians, humans require a specialized body of knowledge to prepare for and survive in the afterlife. The Egyptian Book of Life (often mistakenly translated as \"The Book of the Dead\") is the only living record of the twofold mystery of life and death. In this accurate and complete translation, Ramses Seleem emphasizes The Egyptian Book of Life's vitality and relevance. Accompanied by fascinating commentary that places the work in historical and religious context and featuring superb computer-generated renditions of hieroglyphics from a unique program of the author's own design, this guide offers prayers, breathing meditations, and other interactive techniques that draw the reader fully into the spiritual experience. The Book of Life promises to be the definitive translation of one of the most important documents ever written.",
