  "title": "Babysitter's Black Boss",
  "description": "Mrs. Carver is worried about finances, and tells overworked husband Tyrell (played by Mr Marcus in the Sweet Sinner production of this work) that it's time to hire a babysitter so she can go back to her career. The couple's friends suggest their former au pair, Tatum, and they hire the young buxom blonde beauty right away. But Tatum wants more from her job than just pocket money, and soon the teen vixen is obsessing over the sexy African American Dad and tries to \"model\" for him. Will a guilt-plagued Sissy warn her friend Tatum, the nympho teen, not to go down this road before its too late? Or will she too get caught up in the mix. This is the taboo fantasy about the sweet young woman that comes to your home to watch the kids! The perfect blend of nurturing girl next door sex appeal and forbidden interracial encounters, drive most modern men crazy, and this is no different. The lovely Maitresse P gives us another masterpiece!",
