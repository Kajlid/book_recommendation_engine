  "description": "Dear Author,He's been in my life for two decades. Don't Ask Don't Tell ended too late for us as we were months from retirement. We spent so much of our lives in the closet, hiding our love that I worry if we can hold it together when we're out. I'm scared of losing him. For me, he's the hottest thing I've ever seen still and I know he could get guys half my age without trying hard. Why would he stick with me now? But he always knows...he knows when I need him to center meâ€”to remind me of what we have. We're in it together to the end.If an author selects this...I LOVE BDSM. Please, please...Edited to clarify: I see the man facing forward as a sub and the other man as his dom. They've had stolen moments over the years but never the time and privacy to truly explore their D/s needs at the level they have desired. Now they do since they have retired. I enjoy a little angst (no cheating) but definitely want a HEA. Moderate BDSM would work great. Author, up to you if you take this mind. Ultimately, author, if you pick this one I'll be pleased no matter what you do to give my guys a story!Photo Description: Sexy Marine sitting on the floor, shirtless with just fatigue pants, another sexy Marine leaning down with his hand resting on the other Marine's lower stomach. Matching tattoos on their shoulders and upper arms.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Read the story online or find it in Love Is Always Write: Volume 1.",
