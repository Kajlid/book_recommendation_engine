The minstrels give him a bigger swagger than he knows he deserves. The crown prince is furiously jealous of his fame and respect. The king secretly plots to bring him down while welcoming him at court.

Before he can be anyone's deliverer, he must first take up the mantle of Eiathan's Heir, and ascend the throne of Astarkand.Just one little problem: Olaf is king. Has he ever got it in for one Bjorn Horsa...",
