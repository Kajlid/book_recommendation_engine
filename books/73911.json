  "description": "\"My name is Luca Valentino. I came to Uitspan two years ago.\"It's the eighteenth century of the Imperial Calender and the Empire of Warassa is at its peak. Spanning a full continent, and experiencing a new mastery of the magic known as the principles of Sfeer Theory, one might go so far as to call Warassa the center of the world. However, prosperity comes at a cost. Day by day, tensions rise at the borders of the Empire, which may soon be bound for war. Not that Luca Valentino knows that last part. A lab technician at the Empire's premier school, Uitspan Academy, Luca desires only to live quietly to further educate himself in the nature of Sfeer Theory. This may not be so simple, for as he learns more about the magic around him, he finds himself entangled in a great mystery, one which may involve the whole of the world as he knows itâ€¦",
