  "description": "Their wishes were simple and modest. Fate had other things in store though, and she can be a real bitch sometimes.- All he wanted was to get the job done and somehow to endure those long months playing nanny to a spoiled little rich girl. Without strangling her with his bare hands in the process. Well, it is going to be much easier said than done.- All she wanted was to escape the past and live like any other nineteen-year-old girl. Her plan definitely didnâ€™t include the arrogant, tattooed savage, with his awful mohawk hair and lack of social graces, whose only mission was to stick real close and mess up her life.But, people aren't always what they seem to be, are they?",
