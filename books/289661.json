  "description": "Magic is illegal in Ravenswood.  Those of us with power are collected and stuffed into prisons. They found me when I was still just a child. I've spent my whole life caged, beaten and experimented on. I'm nothing but a nightingale shifter, little power to combat the torture.  The last thing I ever expected was to find my mates in this hell, but they're brought in, snarling and furious and huge.  Too bad if our mate bond is discovered, we'll be killed. And too bad they want nothing to do with a weak bird who can only run from danger. They don't have time for a mate when they need to work on their plan to escape and get back to the people who need them.  They act like I do when I have plans of my own that don't include a broody incubus, a blood-thirsty unicorn, or a bratty vampire.  Unfortunately, we may end up needing each other if we want to survive the Arcane Prison, much less find our way to freedom.  This is a reverse harem prison series which means the FMC doesn't have to choose a love interest. If that or MM offends you, this probably isn't your cup of tea.",
