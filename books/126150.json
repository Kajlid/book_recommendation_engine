  "description": "I am seizing the patriarchy by the balls, and I’m going to give it a vasectomy.\nI may have been crowned Queen, but it rapidly becomes clear that the title doesn’t come with an iota of respect: in fact, it’s a death sentence. My enemies have handed me a crown and now they’re sitting back to see how long I can keep it. Challenges will be coming thick and fast, and I need to be prepared. Luckily, Esme was born ready and I’m a fast learner.Of course, that’s when the dead bodies start piling up. Someone’s cleaning house, removing all evidence of their involvement with the deadly black tourneys. I’m determined to find out who is responsible – even if the witnesses keep winding up dead.As if crowns and corpses aren’t enough, a shadowy organisation called the Domini extends an invitation for me to join their illustrious ranks. It is all too clear that their invitation comes with hidden dangers and refusing will have far-reaching consequences. And not just for me…I may be sitting pretty, but I can’t help feeling that soon I’ll be sitting dead…\nDon't miss this werewolf shifter series if you like humour, heart and a strong heroine with a slow burn, loyal-beta fade-to-black romance.\nWritten in British English.Devour all the books in the Other Wolf series:Defender of the Pack, a prequel storyProtection of the Pack, book oneGuardians of the Pack, book twoSaviour of the Pack, book threeAwakening of the Pack, book fourResurgence of the Pack, book fiveAscension of the Pack, book six",
