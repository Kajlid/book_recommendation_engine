Will her company survive the attack? And who would want to be in Regan Stein's sights if she returns at all?This is classic science fiction, the first part of a series that includes technology, androids, interstellar travel, action, politics and mystery. The series tracks sixteen years in the life of the remarkable Regan Stein and her friends. It will entertain you, challenge you and provoke your thinking on everything from the nature of the human heart to the nature of evil.Review By Heinz Zwack on June 10, 2014 Kindle Edition Verified PurchaseWith the Renaissance of space opera that indie publishing and e-books brought about this is refreshingly different. It is space fiction with lots of action and lots of exotic technology - but not the usual rehash of space battles and Galactic empires.In almost 60 years of reading science fiction - probably 2000 or 3000 books and at least as many stories in the Golden age of SF magazines - I haven't found a character like Ham very often. He certainly beats \"Hal\" of 2001 hands-down.5.0 out of 5 A sorely needed new heroineReview by M Travison August 19, 2014 Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI think this was a terrific beginning to a new series but more importantly a new heroine for the scifi genre. It's also refreshing to read an intelligent scifi novel without galactic space battles or alien earth invasions. Regan is by no means a genius but she's ambitious, focused, assertive and especially knows how to assemble a good team to make her dreams reality.",
