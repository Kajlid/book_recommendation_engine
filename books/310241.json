  "title": "Cannibalism in the Cars",
  "description": "Mark Twain's brilliant tale of a train stuck on the prairie in a snowdrift, where the starving passengers resort to a daily ballot to select which fellow traveller will be sacrificed to provide the next meal. Will it be the succulent Mr. Harris of St. Louis, the juicy Mr. Messick of Colorado or the scraggy, tough Mr. Davis of Oregon? Twain's gentle gallows humour shines through the story and we find ourselves laughing out loud at the most grisly of details. Masterly!",
