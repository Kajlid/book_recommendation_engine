  "description": "The King, the Sorceress, the Trickster . . . they are members of the Circle of Twelve, primal human archetypes whose powers are manifest in us all. Most people never meet the Twelve, except in books and movies-but they exist. Those who have the Sight, like young Bobbi Yandro, can speak with them at will. Bobbi does not will-but her own budding powers are beyond her control. And when she becomes the mistress of Shane, a black mustang with eyes like blue fire, a horse who is more than a horse, events sweep her into the very hands of the Twelve. . .",
