  "description": "In the future, humanity is still much itself. The modern world has expanded into outer space, and thousands of businesses and corporations possess planets instead of factories. Slavery is common. Frontier planets, barely livable, are worked only by the bravest. Titan Station, once mankind's greatest achievement, orbits Jupiter, abandoned to gangsters. New York City is a commonly known archaeological dig. The conquered universe is a political powder-keg, ready to explode on dozens of stations and planets. Meanwhile, Badger chases freedom. Magdalena Aznar chases ideals. Sabrina Trent chases the past. Digger is simply an anomaly.This collection of stories reaches into the future one thousand years. It tells the tales of several persons, with dark and secret pasts, with only a hint of a promise of revelation. It tells of humanity in the future, how small choices matter and how small paths cross- for good or evil. Read onward for rapid space battles, deathly cost, rebellion, and mystery, but only if you care to discover danger in 3024 A.D.",
