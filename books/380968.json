  "description": "Who is he? What is he? An inbred homicidal pervert? A supernatural psychopath? Who or whatever he is, he's on a roll now, raging out of the Virginia backwoods and leaving in his wake a trail of blood, guts, and disgust far beyond the limits of your reckoning. Never before has a work of fiction dared to delve so deeply into the realms of perversion, sexual dementia, and bad taste.",
