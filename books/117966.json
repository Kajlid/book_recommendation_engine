  "description": "From the very beginning it was all Toad’s fault. A blundering, quick-talking thief, he was the one who cut a deal with the dangerous Edward P. track down the ingredients to the Seeking Solution, or else. Twenty-five thousand gorents, he’d said to her. That was all it took for Melena, a lonely orphan with a knack for potions, to pack her bags and join in on the quest. From the majestic forest of Holly-Harp Wood to the labyrinth caves of Dunthur to the frigid waters of the Blackens, they search for Owl’s ingredients. Toad and Melena must face sea dragons, cave monsters, birds as large as wagons, kidnappers, and thieves – so many thieves. Toad’s in it to save his head – cross Owl and start digging your own grave. Melena’s in it to get paid so she can start a new life, one that includes her missing brother. But you really can’t trust thieves.",
