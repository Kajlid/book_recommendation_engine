  "description": "Amira Heartley thought she had it all; a loving boyfriend and a bright future. But when she is publicly humiliated by the one she once thought loved her, everything changes. She becomes bitter, unapproachable and completely shuts herself off from those around her. Her once-positive attitude is replaced with stubbornness, laziness and rudeness, and a permanent frown. That is, until she runs into her high school crush, Jabari Brooks. As Amira tries to navigate her new reality, Jabari makes it his mission to help her find her way back to happiness.",
