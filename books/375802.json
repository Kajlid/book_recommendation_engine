But when a hunky Camaro-driving P.I. shows up at her B & B looking for a room for the week, she sees something more than a hard-bodied guest. For the first time since her husband's death, Summer's sexual interest is awakening, and she's not about to hit the snooze button!Â  Gage Knight is a P.I. in desperate need of a vacation. His impromptu trip to Cape May, New Jersey, seems just what he needs to relax and unwind. But when he knocks on the door of Chase's Bed & Breakfast and comes face to face with sexy owner, Summer Chase, relaxing drops to the bottom of his to-do list. Now all he wants is a tasty Summer treat, and he plans to take his time, savoring the curvaceous beauty one inch at a time. Question can she watch Gage drive off into the sunset when the week comes to an end? This story contains a hard-as-nails, ornery, demanding, tattooed PI eager to please, a widow ready to get back to the business of living and loving, and the kind of hot summer sex that you just might want to bookmark for later.",
