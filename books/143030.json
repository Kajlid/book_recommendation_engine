  "description": "SAND explores the sexual and religious roots of jihadist terrorism. It is a snapshot album of Saudi Arabia in the late 1980s, when contemporary jihadism sprouted in the sands of the Kingdom. It is a novel that is more than the sum of its parts, more than its plot: a mystery centered on a delusional, religious-police detective investigating trouble at a five-star hotel in Riyadh. Graphic descriptions expose the sexual mania that motivates self-justified intolerance and violence resulting from a repressive society. Written by an American journalist who covered the Middle East at the time, SAND is a realistic story of characters, events, and an ideology so extreme that its telling is at times surreal. Neither Saudis nor their highly-paid foreign workers -- Americans, British, Canadian, Filipino, Pakistani, and others -- are spared. SAND describes a place where misogyny, predatory sexual opportunism, heterosexual and homosexual, religious terrorism, rape, stoning, and greed are the norm.A possible threat to the wife of an American oil magnate brings an incognito investigator from the Institute for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice to the InterHo hotel. At the Institute, he is secretly involved with a jihadist brotherhood that includes Osama bin Laden.",
