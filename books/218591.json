  "description": "Five centuries ago, terrorists tore open the fabric of reality, revealing a world of nightmares on the other side. After decades of war, a union of wizards and witches built a barrier to keep the monsters in their rightful home. They called it THE VEIL. Vampire Detective Devon Harrigan and pampered human priestess Helene Du Solaire can't deny the instant attraction between them, or that indulging it could have devastating consequences. A serial killer threatens to tear down the Veil and release Hell on Earth once more, and Helene is the key to his deadly plan.",
