  "description": "The government thought that teenagers were the main cause of crime in America. So from the day that a teenager turns thirteen, they are locked away in buildings and treated like prisoners and left that way until they are eighteen. Wendy Austin couldn’t take it any longer. She knew that there had to be some way to escape all of it. As she starts to plan the escape, she must rely on her friends and a guard with a secret that she can’t help but trust. But running from the government isn’t as easy as it looks. She must race to find her family, who has moved to Canada to keep her brother safe, before the guards can catch her.",
