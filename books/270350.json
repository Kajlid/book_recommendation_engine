  "description": "A speech on the radio. A high school literature class. A promise made to a mother.Activism begins in small ways and in unexpected places. In this inspiring book, over forty activists from Billie Jean King to Bernie Sanders and Angela Davis to Edward Snowden recount the experiences that sparked their journeys and share the beliefs that keep them going. These are citizens who met challenge with action. Their visions for peace, equality, and justice have reshaped American societyâ€”from voting to reproductive rights, and from the environment to the economy.",
