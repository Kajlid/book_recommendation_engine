When Callie is humiliated by her crush in front of an auditorium of thespians, she and Farrah turn to the Internet to find their soul mates.Unfortunately, what they find there isn't what they hoped for.Amidst family secrets and tragedies, Callie finds and nurtures an online love, the mysterious Kevin. This chat room relationship blossoms and pushes her to the unthinkable: to run away from her mother, grandmother, and newly-introduced father so she can be with her unknown Prince Charming.But she soon learns nothing is what it seems in the virtual world, and blind trust can be dangerous.",
