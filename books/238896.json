  "description": "I never thought I’d have a sexual awakening at 34, but, well…here I am: River Burke, novice deviant and master class neurotic mess. With my laundry list of control issues, submission doesn’t exactly come naturally, but I figure if I can find the right person—someone big, buff, and crazy intimidating—maybe I can learn to let go.\n\nAnd then in walks Ellison Fitch.\n\nHe’s not at all what I thought I was looking for, but with his piercing eyes, his too-personal questions, and his brilliant mind, he’s under my skin from the moment we meet. He makes me squirm in all the best ways with nothing but a look and a word, and I can see he loves that as much as I do. I thought I wanted someone to push me around, but it turns out I want someone to take me apart.While Ellison systematically dismantles every one of my barriers, I can’t help but wonder if he’ll ever drop his for me. Does he even want to let me in, or am I too lost, too broken to fill his needs the way he fills mine? I have to know, because now that I’ve had a taste of submission at his hand, I can’t stop thinking about how good it felt to be on my knees for him.Let’s be honest here: I’m going to let this man break me into pieces. I only hope he’ll be there to put me back together again.\nTruth By His Hand is a 120,000 word contemporary gay romance with strong BDSM themes and many explicit scenes. It’s a standalone novel with a guaranteed happy ending.",
