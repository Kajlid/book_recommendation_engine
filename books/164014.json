  "description": "They say time heals all wounds.  What a load of bull. It’s been four years, and Kate’s voice still echoes in my mind.  Every. Damn. Day.  I numb her memory when it taunts me. In college, I drown her out with booze and easy lays.  I can’t do what she asked.   I can’t let her go.  Not even when Lia shows up, freaking ripping what’s left of me to shreds. Caring about someone isn’t worth the deadness that follows after they’re gone. I didn’t ask for this. Didn’t ask for her.  And I sure as hell didn’t plan to miss her when she walked out of my front door. Now, if I want to keep her, I have to straighten myself out and earn her. I can’t screw this up.
