  "description": "**An Interracial Fantasy Romance**  The highly anticipated conclusion to Volume I:  \"Her slender, graceful hands grip the balcony railing at the High Elders’ castle in frustration as she contemplates how it’s even possible that she’s managed to fail in life after death. Her son has followed in his father’s footsteps, precisely how everyone had assumed it would happen. They were right. He is an Alaris after all. But though a small part of her refuses to let this be the end, she still feels repentant now that things have gotten to the point where they are. She’d done everything she thought she could do to give him a way out, to protect him from the relentless Darkness that lives inside him. Even given her life.  Still, everything she’d fought so hard for was a complete failure...\"  *****  Eleven years of Parker Stevens' life have sped by, the time moving so slowly, he’d assumed he would be in the mental institution forever for the murders he’d committed when he was fifteen. His days are monotonous and uneventful...until he is released and meets her. She elicits a feeling in him so strong that a power awakens within his very being. He doesn’t recognize himself or understand why the power ignites whenever he’s around her. Either way, Parker knows he’s in love.",
