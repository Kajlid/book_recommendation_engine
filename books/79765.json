The bishop, John Beachy, Jr., and his brother, Amos, expend great effort to maintain order and peace amongst the community. However, inner feelings and ambition which are driving the mystery, eventually burst through the surface exposing the murderer.Through the complicated and dangerous situation, love grows between Titus and Jonathan. When life is almost out of control, the strength and courage of the bishop's son prevails, and the love between Jonathan and him conquers the evil that has been running unbridled in the community.
