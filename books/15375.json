From the first moment they came together, “erotic” was too pale a word to describe their relationship. Together they explored each other’s deepest, darkest desires.But now Mark, survivor of an ambush to his Delta Force team, is a prisoner of a terrorist group in the Peruvian jungle, and his telepathic communication with Faith is his only contact with the world. While she searches for help to save him, they survive on dreams that take them beyond all sexual boundaries.",
