  "description": "Dear Author,I would love to read a story set in pre-Christian Northern Europe (Germanic, Celtic, Slavic, etc) with a red-headed warrior MC. I enjoy reading about characters in difficult situations, so a plot that involves some kind of danger (be it because of a power struggle or war) would be very much appreciated. Will it be about two warriors from opposing clans falling in love? A warrior on a mission falling in love in someone from a completely different walk of life? Something else altogether?Photo Description: A Celtic warrior stands in a room of what looks like the sacked remains of a country estate. His well-muscled arms are crossed over his chest and he is holding a double-headed axe. He is wearing Celtic dress (kilt, tunic) and he has shoulder-length red hair and a red beard. His determined gaze is focused on something in the distance.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story. This story may contain sexually explicit content and is intended for adult readers. It may contain content that is disagreeable or distressing to some readers. The M/M Romance Group strongly recommends that each reader review the General Information section before each story for story tags as well as for content warnings.",
