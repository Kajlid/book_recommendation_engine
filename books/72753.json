  "title": "The Moneyless Manifesto Live Well. Live Rich. Live Free.",
  "description": "That we need money to live – like it or not – is a self-evident truism. Right? Not anymore.Drawing on almost three years of experience as The Moneyless Man, Mark Boyle not only demystifies money and the system that binds us to it, he also explains how liberating, easy and enjoyable it is to live with less of it.In this book, Mark takes us on an exploration that goes deeper into the thinking that pushed him to make the decision to go moneyless, and the philosophy he developed along the way. Bursting with radical new perspectives on some of the vital, yet often unquestioned, pillars of economic theory and what it really means to be ‘sustainable’ – as well as creative and practical solutions for how we can live more with less – Boyle offers us one of the world’s most thought-provoking voices on economic and ecological ideas.Mark’s original, witty style will help simplify and diversify your personal economy, freeing you from the invisible ties that limit you and making you more resilient to financial shocks. The Moneyless Manifesto explores why making the transition beyond monetary economics is becoming the zeitgeist of the Occupy generation, and how you can participate in the world’s only booming economy – the gift economy.-------------------------The book can be read online for free:http://www.moneylessmanifesto.org/why...",
