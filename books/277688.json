  "description": "Rabbits are popular domesticated pets, but many develop problems because of living conditions that do not allow them to follow their behavioral instincts. This guide to troubleshooting rabbit behavior clues owners in to the history of the domesticated rabbit and describes how rabbits live and breed. Common problems among rabbit owners are discussed, as are probable causes for irregular behavior, including instincts that make rabbits behave in certain ways. Both hutch and house rabbits, as well as troubles specific to each, are covered.",
