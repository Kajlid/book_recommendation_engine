  "title": "The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia",
  "description": "While the early history of the steppe nomad is shrouded in obscurity, The Empire of the Steppes brings to the general reader and the specialist the majestic sweep, grandeur, and the overriding intellectural grasp of Grousset's original. Hailed as a masterpiece when first published in French in 1939, and in English in 1970, this great work of synthesis brings before us the great people of the steppes, dominated by three mighty figures - Attila, Genghiz Khan, and Tamberlain - as they marched through ten centuries of history, from the borders of China to the frontiers of the West. Includes nineteen maps, a comprehensive index, notes, and bibliography.",
