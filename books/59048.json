  "description": "Al is an extraordinary individual stuck in a very ordinary job, and he feels that his life was meant for more. After an accident with a radioactive meteor, Al is physically changed. His strength and agility are heightened and his body is covered by a shimmering field of slow-time, giving him the power to decelerate oncoming projectiles. Al is also able to “fire” bubbles of energy, trapping criminals, said projectiles, and, repeatedly, his best friend. Everyone thinks he should be a “super hero” except Al, who feels his life is turning into a comic book. Enter a rogue agent who wants Al’s powers to create an army of super-mercenaries. Having obsessed over comic book villains in his youth, the agent sees Al as his nemesis and will stop at nothing to control him. Can Al accept his newfound abilities in order to save his friends and family? Well, duh! He’s The Collector.",
