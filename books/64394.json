Still, Sonya Richardson can't resist starring on a hit reality dating show to give America a taste of what a real black woman is like. And this former pro athlete is breaking all the rules of \"Hunk or Punk,\" refusing to bling-up like a diva, and tackling whatever high-octane drama her suitors have in store. But one contestant is throwing Sonya off her game. He's surprisingly kind, way too easy to spill her secrets to--and giving her the kind of hope she hasn't felt in a long, long time ...Widowed former pastor John Bond knows he's the show's \"designated white guy,\" expected to fail every challenge and be gone in a month. He also knows he has to take risks to change his lonely life and find love again. The odds may be against him, but Sonya's honesty and resourcefulness are inspiring him to do whatever it takes to stay in the running, win her heart ... and prove their dreams can be a reality.",
