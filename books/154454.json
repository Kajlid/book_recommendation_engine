  "description": "Who is Santa Claus? The answer is Wallace Davis. Each holiday season, Wallace plays the role of Santa Claus at his sister's toy store located in the heart of Village City. But after losing his full time job, struggling with a relationship that can't seem to get off the ground and finding out that a friend's young child seems ready to give up on believing in Santa altogether, Wallace is asking himself, where is the Christmas spirit? But on one special night, Wallace is visited by the real Santa Claus who whisks him off to the North Pole in order to attend a three-day workshop for those who play the role of Santa at shopping malls and stores all across the country. It provides them with the tools and understanding on how to rekindle the Christmas spirit back in their hometowns. But is it too late for Village City? For Wallace, it's a journey that starts like a dream, evolves into something magical and becomes a truly extraordinary adventure. The spirit of Christmas comes alive when Santa comes to town.",
