  "description": "***Named a Distinguished Favorite in the 2021 NYC Big Book Awards!***A fantastical spin on classic romance meets tabletop storytelling meets fantasy erotica!When David went exploring with his friends, he figured they might come across some old ruins or maybe even fight a few monsters. He never expected that he'd wind up captured by an orc and turned into his pet; he expected even less that he'd actually like it. It all started when he was sitting in a jail cell, so desperate to escape that he agreed to trial by combat: The Ritual of Steel & Thunder. He opens the fight strong, but when his competitor manages to overpower him, things start to heat up and he realizes he may have signed on for more than he bargained for.Captain Khazak Ironstorm is the orc ranger responsible for David's arrest--and after defeating him in combat, his new owner. Initially amused by his slave's antics, something deeper begins to grow between them--something dark that draws Khazak in as much as it troubles him. More confounding than that are the feats of agility and speed his new pet seems able to perform as if they were nothing. What he does know is that if there is anyone capable of taming this barbaric human's behavior, it's him.A tale of romance mixed with some humor, adventure, and a heaping helping of kink. Read all about the journey of David and Khazak as they learn to understand each other and uncover the mysteries of the magical world around them. Readers who love kink, BDSM, Dom/sub, and other elements of male-on-male romance will love what this story has to offer.",
