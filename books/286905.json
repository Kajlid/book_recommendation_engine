  "description": "For 11-year-old Lily, sometimes being a girl is a drag. Fortunately Lily's flute teacher, Mrs. Zinn, is a time-traveler. She takes Lily back in time 3,500 years to ancient Crete—when women and men lived in equality.There, Lily finds out what it's like for girls to be important. She also gets lost in the maze-like palace, and has to cope when Mrs. Zinn suddenly disappears. And she has to figure out how to tell the Queen what she knows—that this Cretan culture, and the people who've become her friends, will someday be destroyed and replaced with a male-dominated society.",
