  "description": "*** THIS IS A RERELEASE OF A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED BOOK ***  Wrath volunteers to live and work outside Homeland where he’ll once again be confined in a small space with other males. He was subjected to horrific abuse and conditioning and forced to view endless sex tapes of human females while chained to Mercile’s perverted machines. Wrath knows he’s too dangerous and emotionally damaged to ever be with a female.  Lauren has just been detained by three big, buff, well-armed men—New Species. One of them really catches her eye. He is tall, sexy, and…her new roommate apparently. She has never met a man this truly spectacular and she decides to taste every inch of his amazing body. Wrath wants to explore that plan too. The sex is incredible and he gives her everything she needs but he’ll only go so far. Something is holding him back.  Lauren has to make him unleash his desire and Wrath has to get past his fear to give them a chance at a future together.",
