  "description": "Joe Schwartz is a writer following in the footsteps of Dashiell Hammett, Donald Goines, and Chuck Palahniuk. In ‘The Games Men Play’ he has combined twenty-one short stories that will take the reader on a haunting journey through the darkest St. Louis streets to its most rural counties. A terrific, fast paced storytelling style that never wastes a word, his work constantly entertains and demands to be read. A St. Louis native, Joe Schwartz writes exclusively about the Gateway City. His first book, ‘Joe’s Black T-Shirt’ has been read thousands of times on the Internet and has sold hundreds of copies.",
