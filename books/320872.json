Xavier Propriety and preservation of tradition are important in maintaining a cohesive social hierarchy. My new chef doesn’t seem to care one bit. She’s distracting, infuriating. Intoxicating. She’s completely unsuitable for me. She’s too young, too argumentative, too mouthy. Someone needs to take her in hand and teach her some manners. That someone is going to be me, and I’ll enjoy every single second. Lily My new boss takes grumpy and controlling to a new level. He’s a duke. Who’s a duke nowadays? Uptight and reserved, Lord Xavier Acton, Duke of Roxburgh, doesn’t know what to do with a woman like me. I don’t care about his rules or conforming to his archaic social guidelines. I don’t care about anything, except pushing his control to the very edge. Because there is a completely different man, hiding underneath the Duke’s uptight exterior. I’m going to break him out, any way I can. Xavier is the first hero in the Spoiled Royal series. These heroes are badly-behaved billionaire aristocrats who are used to getting their way. They’ll go all out for their feisty, independent heroines and stop at nothing, to get their ring on their fingers. A steamy story about obsessed OTT billionaires, always SAFE, with a sweet HEA guarantee.",
