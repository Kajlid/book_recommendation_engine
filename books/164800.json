  "description": "It all started with a deck of tarot cards. Holly knew she had some kind of magical gift but she had always been forbidden to even speak of it by her now-deceased mother. Alone and suddenly free to explore her curiosity, Holly spreads the cards and has a vision and the first piece of the puzzle falls into place.But suddenly she's a target of an attack and two hotter-than-hot vampires burst in to protect her and claim she's their mate. Even as she finds it hard to believe these two alpha vampires want her in their bed as well as their lives, she falls under their spell and begins to believe that she just might be worthy of love after all.But there's no forgetting that she's got a past and a lot of unanswered questions, and her ignorance is putting her at risk. It's a journey that takes her from Seattle to New Orleans, where she confronts her past and embraces her future.Reader Advisory: This book features scenes of explicit male/male sexual exploration.",
