  "description": "In 1842, Lord Gordon claims his new estate in Northern Scotland and plans to replace farmers and fishermen with sheep. Mac McDonnell, suspicious of Lord Gordon from the beginning, leads protests – despite the impact his actions will have on his sister and three brothers. When evictions begin, a second protest at Westness turns violent. What will Mac risk to protect his family, his sweetheart, and his livelihood? Set in the Orkney Islands during the time of the Clearances, Standing Stones won an award from the Pacific Northwest Writers Association for historical fiction and was called “a very promising work, with appeal to a broad audience, peppered with a variety of characters the reader can identify with sympathetically or instantly distrust.” PRAISE FOR STANDING “Well-developed characters and well-researched background & history made this an excellent book that I found hard to put down. I felt as if I was a friend of the McDonnell family, living on the island and sharing their love and hardships.”“Camp’s characters step off the page in this finely detailed recreation of time and place.”“I strongly recommend this book to any one that enjoys Scotland and family sagas.”“This history should not be forgotten. The author’s writing style is exquisite, and her attention to detail is superb. If you are a history buff, you will enjoy reading this book.”",
