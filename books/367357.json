  "description": "Donâ€™t let family history set the course for your future. Triumph was strategically designed to help persons dealing with chronic illnesses and those that care about them understand the facets of living with life-altering conditions with faith, fortitude, and mastery. Gregory S. Works, a two-time kidney transplant recipient, helps others face their challenges head-on, and live a victorious life in spite of living with the pain and discomfort of his or her chronic illness. Gregory uses statistics, his own experiences, and comical anecdotes to help readers understand the complexity of kidney disease. He demonstrates how faith can become the cornerstone to triumph over the challenge whether kidney disease or some other life altering event. Challenges are inevitable, but the decisions that we make to face them or flee from will make a profound difference in our ability to overcome or be overtaken by trials, pain, and suffering in our lives.",
