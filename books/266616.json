  "description": "Nightingale shifter and performer, Lorelei, is the star of the Tri-Star circus. With her beautiful face and enchanting voice, she has an act that can't be beat. She'll learn the hard way, however, that things aren't always as they seem. Life as she knows it is a lie, a cover for deeper, and darker secrets and deceptions. Heartbroken and betrayed by the man she trusted most, she'll have to decide if she's willing to put her faith in the three handsome strangers that come crashing into her life, and unveil a past that a spell had hidden away. With a kingdom in the clouds she'll one day rule, and traditions she refuses to accept, she'll have to make a choice. Will she stay locked away in her gilded cage? Or will she take flight and show everyone that, princess or not, she makes her own rules? *Possible triggers for abuse and noncon*",
