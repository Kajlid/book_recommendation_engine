  "title": "The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950 - 1350",
  "description": "From our twentieth-century perspective, we tend to think of the Europe of the past as a colonizer, a series of empires that conquered lands beyond their borders and forced European cultural values on other peoples. This provocative book shows that Europe in the Middle Ages was as much a product of a process of conquest and colonization as it was later a colonizer.",
