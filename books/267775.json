  "description": "Will one truth set her free?  Kinsley thought she had found the truth, but she is only beginning to discover the real truth about her family. About herself. Her heart and body still yearn for Killian, but she has to keep him safe. The only way to do that is to lie, just like everyone has lied to her.  Killian thought he had everything he ever wanted. He had the perfect girl. He had the perfect job. All that was missing was a ring on her finger. But now both are gone. And the only way to get either of them back is to choose between the girl he loves and the job he feels destined to do. But as he sits in a jail cell he doesn't know how he will get either of them back.  Will Kinsley be strong enough to save herself and those she loves? If so, at what cost?",
