The more I learn about Lanie's dark past, the more I want to protect her. She's the missing piece to my fractured family, and I need to convince her to stay. To make her choose us. Choose me. And I'll do that one grand gesture at a time.Dexter Cross will never understand my kind of damaged...I've learned to be the kind of cautious that never lets a man close enough to hurt me again. It doesn't matter that Dex makes me feel like I'm someone special, someone who deserves to be protected. It doesn't matter that his kids have burrowed their way into my heart.Some souls are just too damaged to love. I need to leave soon before someone gets hurt.",
