  "description": "Ten years ago, I met him.He was popular, and I was a nerd, trapped on the outskirts of the “cool” kids.Ten years ago, I lost him.And even now, I can’t deny it still hurts, or that my mind occasionally wanders back to what could have been.I never planned to see him again.It was a fluke, actually. But since it happened, I’ve been floating around aimlessly, grasping for something to hold onto.Praying he sees me.Praying he ignores me.Praying I have the strength to ignore him.My heart still pines for him—still calls out to the only boy who ever felt like home.To embrace my future, I must look to my past.The heart can mend, but can the mind forget?",
