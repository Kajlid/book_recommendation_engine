Scoffing at rumors that the house is haunted, Kit and his family buy the place and move in. But Charles Scarlet’s death might not have been so accidental after all, and an evil presence that lingers in the house may now have set its sights on Kit’s young daughter Rosa . . .Arthur Calder-Marshall’s unusual haunted house story The Scarlet Boy (1961) is a rediscovered supernatural classic whose slow-building dread mounts inexorably until the chilling finale.",
