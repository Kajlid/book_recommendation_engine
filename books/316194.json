  "description": "Recently orphaned and facing starvation, seventeen-year-old Matty needs to get herself sorted before winter arrives. As the days shorten, so do her odds of survival. When an unexpected opportunity comes along in the form of a beguiling stranger, she sees more than just an escape from misery; she sees a chance at a better life.Alone but undeterred, she ventures west. It is a journey of far-reaching consequences, where law has no footing, and where every decision she makes must be weighed against the prospect of death.Set in the uncompromising American West of the 1870s, Nolan Cordovanoâ€™s fourth novel is a tale of romantic aspirations pursued through fateful decisions, told in prose as harrowing as it is seductive.",
