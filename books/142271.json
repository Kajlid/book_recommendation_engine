  "description": "\"Your Unicorn is a The Myth of Startup Success\" dives deep into the startup world's obsession with billion-dollar unicorns, pulling back the curtain on the inflated valuations, venture capital games, and relentless growth-at-all-costs mentality. Ashutosh Tripathy uses witty and critical analysis to expose how startups like Facebook and Airbnb created a dangerous myth that now drives unrealistic expectations in the startup ecosystem.The book unpacks how valuations are manipulated, often with little connection to real business performance, and reveals how venture capital can resemble a Ponzi scheme where early investors cash out while companies burn through cash in a desperate bid to appear successful. With case studies from companies like Uber, WeWork, and Theranos, Tripathy demonstrates how many unicorns rush to IPO without profits, relying on hype and PR campaigns to sustain their image.From the cult of the founder to the customer acquisition trap of constant discounting, this book shows how startups are often more focused on growth than sustainability. Tripathy tackles the harsh reality of what happens when funding dries up, leading to the collapse of once-promising ventures. Finally, he provides insights into how the startup ecosystem might move toward sustainability, offering a roadmap for investors, founders, and employees to rethink their approach to success.Packed with examples and case studies, \"Your Unicorn is a Lie\" is a must-read for anyone looking to understand the realities behind the glossy unicorn stories and how to build a business that lasts.",
