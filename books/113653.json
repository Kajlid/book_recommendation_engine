  "description": "Thomas Ross is an eleven year old boy who has just been orphaned. He wanders off into the Northumberland woods with no idea of where he’s going, or what is going to happen to him. After almost dying, he finds himself in a different world called Rainbow’s End. There he discovers that he is, in fact, a wizard, that fairies and dwarves and gods and witches really do exist; that his grandfather is a wizard himself - possibly the most powerful ever, and his grandmother, a gypsy… But Wizardry is no simple matter - even if you were born to it… There are seven levels, linked to seven crystals, which in turn, represent the seven Universal Elements. Each has to be mastered… The Rainbow’s End Saga, is Thomas Ross’ journey. It’s a story about a young wizard and a grumpy old man... A story about dreams and magic; and fairies and dwarves and little people. About an ancient race and demi-god twins; and children; an enchanted place where dreams really do come true. About choices and chances; and good and bad, and life and love and loss… and learning how to deal with them…",
