  "description": "Commander Fred Schmidt and Chief Gunner’s Mate Mike Stafford team up in this action packed, historically based, sea-land adventure. Veterans of WW II and shipmates during the darkest days of the Korean conflict, they now face a new enemy close to home. The Soviets are on the move with their new ally, Fidel Castro. The CIA covertly plans to topple the Castro regime by training and equipping a brigade of Cuban exiles. If they can establish a beachhead at the Bay of Pigs and declare a provisional government, the U.S. can come to their aid, militarily, and oust Fidel. A last minute decision places Schmidt’s new command, the destroyer Jaffey, in the middle of the action. The invasion begins, but before they can implement the plan, President Kennedy cancels all U.S. military involvement. Schmidt agonizes over the decision, but follows orders and withdraws, stranding Stafford ashore with the exiles. A Soviet submarine pursues the Jaffey while Stafford and two colleagues fend for themselves. Cuban forces close in for the kill.The exiles are defeated, and the Jaffey damaged. Schmidt faces a Board of Inquiry, and Stafford escapes the battlefield with two others. They won’t die on the beaches of Bahia de los Cochinos, but they aren’t safe anywhere on the island. Enter a beautiful Cuban woman and the anti-Castro underground. The escapees keep running, but a trail of bodies collects in their wake. Will they escape the island alive?",
