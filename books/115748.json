  "description": "The author of this report was the founder and CEO of the AUSTRALIAN MINDPOWER RESEARCH FOUNDATION. His Theta process takes around 30 days to learn thoroughly and uses a neat mental trick to retain beta awareness so that you don't fall off to sleep during the exercise. It does away with artificial binaural and stroboscopic aids so that once you have this amazing process locked in you can use it anywhere, any time. Theta is an elusive state to learn and can be quite tricky even for an experienced Alpha practitioner.This rapturous state gives the feeling of wonderment and profound relaxation and is a totally awesome experience, way beyond the feeling of Alpha. Only 15 minutes in Theta will totally rejuvenate your body. It would take more than an hour in Alpha to achieve the same benefit. In Theta you connect directly with your subconscious and it is absolutely ideal for solving medical and other problems. In this state you can, if you wish, become your own hypnotist in effect.You can reprogram your belief system and improve your medical condition. This program is for those who are already familiar with Alpha. There is no need to pay hundreds of dollars for Theta inducing electronic or mechanical aids when you can achieve better results at home for free!! The process involves making a simple very specially worded cassette tape which initially helps induce Theta.Within 30 days you should be able to access the Theta state without the assistance of the tape. Regular use of Theta puts you totally in control of your mind and body and will change your life in a way you never thought possible!",
