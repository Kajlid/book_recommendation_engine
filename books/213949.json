  "title": "Orlando Keeps a Dog",
  "description": "When Kathleen Hale's Orlando first made his debut in 1938, it was to instant acclaim. The adventures of the splendid marmalade cat, his wife Grace, and their three kittens grew into a series of books that have become classics of children's literature. The sophisticated, utterly gorgeous illustrations combine with warmly funny stories that celebrate the pleasures of family and friendship. Now reissued in oversized jacketed editions that faithfully reproduce the elegant folio format of the originals, these are books that will continue to be passed down from generation to generation. Orlando and Grace decide it would be good for the kittens to be have a pet, so they place an ad in the newspaper. A startling menagerie of animals applies for the job, but in the end, they adopt Bill, a boisterous poodle, simply because he refuses to leave! When Bill moves in, bringing Flute the cat with him, life is never quite the same again.",
