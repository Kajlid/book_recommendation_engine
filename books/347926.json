And when he turned his penetrating eyes on her, she was helpless against his magnetism. In an instant, Chelsey Mallon knew this was no ordinary man.\"I am Your Genie.\"But no genie ever looked like Alexander Duport. Genies were fairy tales, not flesh-and-blood male. Genies served their masters, they didn't ignite sexual fantasies.\"I am Your Destiny.\"Alex offered her a night to remember. And with three gold coins, he granted her three wishes - fame, fortune, forever love.... But could he ever give her the one wish she wanted: to spend 1,001 nights in his arms?",
