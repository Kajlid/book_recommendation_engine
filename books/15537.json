  "description": "Cuttlefish Bones, his epoch-making first book, completes the trio of books (with the previously published 'The Occasions' and 'The Storm and Other Things') that won Eugenio Montale (1896-1981) the Nobel Prize in Literature and established him as the Greatest Italian poet since Leopardi. The renowned classicist, translator, and critic William Arrowsmith translated all three volumes.\"Virtually incomparable. . . . Arrowsmith has quite literally distilled this poetry's essence in order to recompose it with all of its colors, scents, and exquisitely understated potency intact.\" â€” Rebecca West",
