He spent his weekends at clubs, rubbing elbows with fellow A-listers. I spent mine in yoga pants with cheese boards and a glass of wine—or six.Our relationship shouldn’t have worked, but it did. That is until Tanner proved to me that even though love happens when you least expect it... So does heartbreak.",
