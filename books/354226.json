  "title": "Concise Guide to Adult Faith Formation",
  "description": "In the newest addition to The Concise Guide series, Neil Parent lends his authoritative voice to the issue of adult faith formation. Parent articulates his view that learning about the faith in adulthood is not merely an extension of basic childhood religious education, but is rather a continuous, lifelong process. Drawing from years of experience leading the National Conference for Catechetical Leadership, Parent combines Church teaching and adult learning theory to make this a must-read for pastors, catechists, and students in faith formation ministries.",
