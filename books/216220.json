  "title": "Island Bush Pilot: Founder of san Juan Airlines",
  "description": "After serving as a carrier fighter pilot in the Navy during World War II, Roy Franklin returned to his native Washington State to fly, build an airport, and establish a commuter airline in the San Juan Islands. He developed the first successful air service in the otherwise isolated islands by persevering against the adversities of weather, lack of navigational aids, and the many hazards of bush flying. A candid and often humorous account of adventures and misadventures over 30 years adds to the rich traditions of bush aviation.",
