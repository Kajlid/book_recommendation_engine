  "description": "\"Graham Shelby has re-created with painstaking exactitude the medieval world of the Angevin brothers - Richard the Lionhearted and John called Lackland - and presented it to us with a novelist's flair for fleshing out the pasteboard figures of history with detail and imagination. The murderous tumult of England and Normandy in the twelfth century is superbly drawn in this fine tale of the conceits of kings and the wars of influence that marked the passing of an age. Eleanor of Aquitaine, Philip of Franc,e Henry the Second, and William Marshal, model for the knight chivalric - all are here to contribute by their words and actions to the forming of nations and the uneasy balance of history.\"",
