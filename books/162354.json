  "title": "Destroying Beauty: Hell Hounds MC",
  "description": "Jo… I’m only 25 years old, too young to have already been married and divorced—hard to believe it’s been a year since my piece of shit ex-husband left me, my soul broken, my bank account empty…at least his family’s lawyers let me keep my beat up old Corolla. Just when it seems like my life can’t get any worse, and my heart can’t possibly take another ounce of pain, fate comes crashing down on my head. The last thing I need is to get involved with another dangerous man… The wrong place at the wrong time is an understatement. I just witnessed two men get shot in the face—for no reason—and I can’t go to the cops because they’re in on it. I’ve never been more scared in my life, I have no money to run away, no family that can help. I’m the sole witness to a double murder, and I’m all alone except for him… Holt… One of my psycho brothers just executed a member of a rival MC and an innocent shopkeep in plain sight, and didn’t even bother to check the place for witnesses. At least he was smart enough to grab the security tapes, problem is there was a smokin’ hot little thing huddled at the end of the aisle, and I’m sure she saw everything. This girl may be the most beautiful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on, and her body…fuck me. But there’s one problem, she can bury me and my club, and I can’t let that happen. Women are a dime a dozen, and I’ll never let a good lay get between me and everything that I live for. So I’ll do what I do best—make her beg for it, make her need it… And then I’ll put a bullet between her eyes. This contemporary romance novel contains adult themes, violence, and sexual content. Fifth book in the Vegas Titans biker romance series.",
