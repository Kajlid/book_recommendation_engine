After learning some shocking truths about his family, and of the death of a woman months before, he soon sets on a journey with a mysterious sword and equally mysterious horse-breeder and elf and must venture past the boundaries of the unknown and give chase to the men that abducted his sister across the lands of Aluria. And while they must fight to save her, the trio discover they are not alone in following the trail left behind by the assailants. Can he overcome his fears and still save her in time as the beast grows ever closer? Elsewhere, far across land and sea, something ancient stirs from an ages long slumber. . . .
