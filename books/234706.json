  "title": "The Story Of Rock and Soul Music: Album Reviews and Lists",
  "description": "Music critic Scott Floman reviews his extensive record collection, and tells the story of rock and soul music in the process. Whether you want to read all about the classic bands (i.e. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, Nirvana, etc.) and solo artists (i.e. Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Elton John, etc.) or discover unjustly neglected artists and albums (too many to mention!) both old and new, this book offers something for everyone. In addition to containing many detailed album reviews, this book's various lists (such as an \"Essential Albums\" list) will also appeal to the dedicated list maker in all of us. It also includes the author's own Rock and Soul Hall Of Fame which is sure to be a conversation starter!Revised and Expanded Seventh Edition was published in October 2021.",
