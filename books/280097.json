  "description": "Gary Beaumier's From My Family to Yours mixes the individual human experience with universal themes and striking imagery, smoothly juxtaposing the personal and the historical. Reality lives side by side with with the magical in many of these poems--a harmonious coexistence for the most part, but sometimes a shock to the characters or the readers who are both asked to question whether the surreal might not be the truer reality after all.",
