  "title": "Queen of Wands",
  "description": "Life is unpredictable and what the cards read for each of us changes like the weather forecast. After David Allyn's daughter asked him to stop at a specialty store for her, he thought it would be a simple errand. Fate had other plans. Clueless about mysticism, magic, and fantasy; he wasn't quite sure what to make of a store that carried tarot cards, cupid sprinkles, and mystical looking decor. The Queen of Wands store was only half as fascinating as it's owner, Micki Davies. Gold Star widow Micki Davies is the breath of fresh air David didn't realize he needed. The quirky, free-spirited shop owner fascinates him like no one ever has. Humor, instant attraction, and the kind of desire that leaves them both weak in the knees join together with destiny to weave a charming tale of love at every age.",
