Amidst a series of twisted events, he learns from a tree possessed by a spirit that he is the Deliverer; a legendary being destined to take all souls that roam the earth to their final resting place, but that place is unknown and there are many who wish to stop him.

This ambitious, violent man holds many secrets, several of which concern Rae and his true origins… and when Rae is made aware of all that he is capable of, he must decide either to help the vicious Suidowgé rule the world that the ancestors of whom they both shared envied or continue the path given him by his suspicious spirit protectors. To whom will the Deliverer…deliver?",
