  "description": "Every native tree in Britain, whether it's part of a grand avenue, a thriving hedgerow, an ancient wood, or a bountiful orchard tells a different story. The Trees that Made Britain takes us on a journey of discovery to every corner of the nation. Through detailed portraits of individual tree species, author and photographer Archie Miles reveals the stories of the trees that have influenced the culture, myths, and fabric of the nation. The book is full of surprising facts on how trees have been used by man over the centuries, and includes practical information on visiting some of the finest living examples. The combination of rich historical material, lyrical descriptions, and over 100 color photographs captures the very essence of Britain's native species.",
