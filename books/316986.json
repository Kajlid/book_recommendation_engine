Above all, she needs to steer clear of Connor Blackwood, the sexy groomsman who broke her heart five years ago.A family wedding offers Connor the ideal opportunity to convince everyone he’s no longer an irresponsible playboy. If they see he’s changed, they might support his decision to leave the family winery and strike out on his own. With so much at stake, the last thing he needs is an alluring distraction like Jess.When Jess and Connor end up together, exploring the island’s lush, tropical beauty, the sparks between them become impossible to ignore. Throwing caution to the wind, they decide to make their own rules.Five days of passion. No strings. No tears. No promises.What could possibly go wrong?",
