  "title": "50 Places to See Before You Die and 50 Places That Are a Lot More Fun",
  "description": "Here’s just the antidote for the modern-day affliction of overachieving, even on vacation. This humorous anti-guidebook juxtaposes 50 must-see destinations with 50 places that will satisfy your inner child—you know, the one with the naughty streak. If the Coliseum seems a bit trite, indulge in some gladiatorial gazpacho at the world’s largest tomato fight, La Tomatina, in Valencia, Spain. Can’t make it to Stonehenge this year? How about a jaunt to Nebraska, where Carhenge adds a kitschy spin to this relic from prehistory? Got a problem with the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona? Check out the Running of the Nudes. Here’s your guide to the road less traveled—and more fun! 96 pages.",
