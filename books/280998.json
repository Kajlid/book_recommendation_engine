  "description": "When Grier Cushman's parents push her out of their diamond-studded nest, the shutterbug socialite scrambles to land on her stilletoed feet. She could take the job her mogul mom dangles in front of her, but Grier’s stomach cramps just thinking about Mom’s micro managerial tendencies. Instead, she’ll focus on flipping her photography into a legit career. Because there are two things Grier knows inside and out—her camera and how to make everyone look flawless. After all, she learned to project perfect when her ex-high school crush shredded her heart eight years ago. Cocky investment banker Quint Kincaid is back in town. He thought he’d left this city behind forever, but fate dealt his family a bad break, and now he’s on a mission to earn buckets of cash for his father’s medical expenses. When he runs into the one person he misses from back in the day, all grown up and sexy as hell, it brings up all the old powerful feelings he’d hidden as a teenager. He wants more, even if he hasn’t quite gotten over how she ghosted him. Despite their hesitations, the two former friends agree to help each other out—Grier reintroduces him to the moneyed social circles in Baltimore, and Quint guides her through setting up her business. As they fall into old patterns and rediscover what drew them to each other in the first place, they confront the secrets that snuffed their teenaged romance before it could even begin.",
