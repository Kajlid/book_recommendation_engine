  "description": "Yeh, so, you know how I left Briar dead to rights in that damned trial? Well somehow, she’s absolutely bloody fine. She’s happily skipping afternoon classes to hide what demon she killed and spends the evenings with Axel. (Who saw that one coming?)The real problem for me, though? Something happened to me during the trial, something dark, I know it’s their fault, the prince, his mutt and the woman who ruined my life.So, I’m stuck with a form that demands blood (just lovely), and now cocky-vamp-prick, Locke Fang, is hounding me to choose a source while he angles for Sylas’s territory. Not that it’s my business—so naturally, I’m caught right in the middle of it.Call it karma, or a grand bloody joke, but whatever’s going on demands I keep a connection to the very person I tried to kill. There’s only one way for me to do that without sinking lower. You and your stupid fang earring happy now, Locke? I chose my damned source.But there was one thing that I didn’t factor into the equation, and that was Madora Rose, herself.……The Witcher meets Zodiac Academy in a slow burn four book romance.
