When Kato unwittingly lends her his access codes, Lenore stumbles upon the grisly truth behind Xanadu’s glittering facade. Lenore, not knowing whom to trust, is soon on the run, hunted down by Saturn, a mysterious entity that moves aggressively to contain the security breach. With the interests of the world’s wealthiest people at stake and powerful technology at Saturn’s fingertips, Lenore is on a race for her life, against a truly formidable foe.",
