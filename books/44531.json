  "description": "Centavo is a dog, born on streets in a small fishing village in Baja, Mexico. One day she is adopted by a couple from Flagstaff, Arizona and taken back to the states to live. The story is from the perspective of Centavo as she goes through all the adjustments in order to be a pet living in a nice home in the U.S.After being gone for two years the family decides to go back to the fishing village where Penny was found. Penny has not seen any of her friends or family for all that time and she is a little worried as to their safety. When they arrive in Mexico, there are no street dogs on the street. Where have all the dogs gone? She finally comes across Pero, the dog she believes is her father. He tells Penny about all the changes in the town. Her mother has died and her brothers all have homes now. Many gringos have adopted the street dogs and have given them a place to live.The book is also a memorial to Steve Forman, a man who came to San Felipe and started ZAPP, an organization, which helps to spay and neuter animals and find homes. He died in 2011 and the group called Viva has taken over the duties of ZAPP. Part of the profit from this book goes to continuing the clinic in San Felipe. Any other spay and neuter clinic taking part in purchasing this book can also receive a part of the profits for their organization.",
