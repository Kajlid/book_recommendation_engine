  "description": "I shouldn't want him, but I do.  I've got one week to get through until my motherâ€™s estate clears, and then I'll be free to go.  All I've got to do is keep my hands off my new step-dad, Bruce. But that's easier said than done.  I shouldn't want her, but I do.  I can't remember the last time I touched a woman. Heck, I can't remember the last time I touched myself. But ever since little Sophie showed up, I can't think of anything but claiming her.  Forbidden love and secret obsessions will have you begging for the climax.  Warning: You can beg all you want...Bruce won't be forced.",
