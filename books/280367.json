The truth is much more sinister.   Olivia only ever wanted the truth behind the unimaginable power she was born with. What she found at Quiet Sanctuary, was much more than she ever bargained for.  Damien, a Sanctuary guard, lives his life in a self-inflicted exile, having abandoned everything and everyone he loved to protect them from the monster he was becoming. When a ghost from his past reappears in a startling way, he'll begin to question everything he thought he knew.   When helping a friend brings strangers with unbelievable powers into her home, Alaina's once peaceful existence is suddenly plunged into chaos. In her desperation to return to a normal life, she'll charge headfirst down a path with devastating consequences.  After making a dangerous escape with Olivia's help, Kasimir is more determined than ever to protect those he cares for. However, when the Sanctuary hunts them down and disaster strikes, everyone must face the inconceivable truth that not everyone should be saved.",
