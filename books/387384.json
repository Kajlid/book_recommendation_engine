  "description": "Poetry. \"I can't remember when a book of poems has invited such an attentive reading as Cindy King's marvelous first volume, PEOPLE ARE TINY IN PAINTINGS OF CHINA. Each poem, a descent through shifting strata of syntax and history, requires a sustained renegotiation of one's balance in language and the world. As I read I had the feeling of launching myself from an opening line and falling past gorgeous and complex surfaces, an intricate landscape of experience, until landing on the solid earth of the final lines of these extraordinary poems. PEOPLE ARE TINY IN PAINTINGS OF CHINA is a work of uncommon talent\"--Lynn Emanuel.",
