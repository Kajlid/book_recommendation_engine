  "title": "A Man Called Jesus",
  "description": "In the history of Western civilization, no individual has had a more profound impact than Jesus of Nazareth. Sadly, however, the findings of mainline New Testament scholarship have shown that the Jesus who has had this impact is largely an invention of the Christian church. This created Jesus has little relation to the Palestinian Jew who lived in the first century.Two important questions arise from this situation. Who was the real Jesus of Nazareth and what relevance does this man have for the twenty-first century? A Man Called Jesus attempts to answer these two questions.The novel is also a love story. It retells the Christian story by making two basic assumptions: that God is love and that Jesus reflects this love in a way few humans have been able to achieve. In writing a novel about Jesus, an author must make a number of significant historical assumptions. Readers familiar with the Christian story will note several places where the novel strays from that story. In comments at the end of the book, the author provides a detailed explanation of the historical assumptions he makes in writing the story. Readers interested in issues of New Testament scholarship should not miss this section.",
