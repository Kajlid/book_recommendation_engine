The next day the Pope was found dead. This we know to be fact.In The Serpent’s Disciple, an ancient evil threatens to take over the Catholic Church and use it to create a New World Order. Thirty years after John Paul’s death the new leader of P2, Peter Romanus, sets in motion the final stages of his plot to kill the current pope and take control of world governments throught the Church.Meanwhile, Anthony and Antonella “Nelli” Andruccioli feel a sudden call to visit Pesaro, the Italian town where their father was born and where they learn of their families long kept secret and their deep and ancient connection to Saint Anthony. The siblings learn of their fate to save the Church: Antonella as the Chosen One, and Anthony as one of the Guardians sworn to protect her from the false prophet.Together Anthony, Nelli and their new friends must navigate the labyrinth of ancient prophecy and Vatican politics. They soon encounter Peter Romanus and his inner circle, who want them dead. As Anthony and Nelli struggle to stay alive they must be the first one’s to find the ancient artifact spoken about in a prophecy.P2 did exist and was believed by many to be behind the death of Pope John Paul I.
