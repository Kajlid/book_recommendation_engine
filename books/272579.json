  "description": "**This is Josh Prescott's book and the 5th standalone book in the Prescott Series**I love my life. As owner and chef at one of the hottest restaurants, I know how to keep things sizzling in and out of the kitchen. What more could I ask for? But I’ll tell you what I didn’t ask for… a klutzy, curly-haired woman slamming into me with a unicorn cake. Yes, you read that right—a damn cake decorated to look like the mythical creature bathed in every color of the rainbow.What could be worse, right? I’ll tell you. My brother hired her to be my baker. You’d think that would be my biggest problem, but that was just the tip of the iceberg.Aside from her being one of the clumsiest women I’ve ever met, she turns me on like no other woman has. She tastes sweeter than anything she creates, and we make a great team in and out of the bedroom... I mean kitchen.When we first met, I worried my restaurant wouldn’t survive her. Now I worry that my heart won’t.I never wanted to fall in love, but sometimes life isn’t all unicorns and rainbows.",
