One that could destroy my reputation in a world where reputation is everything.That makes him dangerous. He could ruin me professionally, wreck my life, but the touch of his mouth to mine, the feel of him in my arms—they’re all I can think about. I’m intoxicated. Drunk on him, when I’ve always been sober. Micah I’m gay. The freedom in admitting that is intoxicating. Enough to make me feel drunk with the relief of finally being myself. But what feels better?Devlin. He’s my boss. He holds my future in his hands in more ways than he knows, but he isn’t as free as I am. Doesn’t have the same freedom I do to own up to what he is.Because of that, I know I’m losing him. I can feel us becoming DOA. But is he worth fighting for when he won’t admit what I am to him? What we mean to one another?I guess you’ll have to read on to find out…THE INTERN is a standalone contemporary MM romance, with an easter egg for fans of Serena Akeroyd’s novels.Sensitive readers please note, this book includes a graphic rape scene.",
