  "description": "After suffering a tragic loss, Mia Davis looks toward her future, to move on from a heartbreaking past. Will new life, love and laughter help her to find her way? Or will death, deceit, and disloyalty destroy her? Can she trust those closest to her? Can they trust her? It's often said that, “Whatever doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.” This may be true individually, but is this true in relationships? Does “No matter what.” really mean just that?",
