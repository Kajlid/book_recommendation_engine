  "description": "Set in post-World War I America, England, and from Israel to the Khamis Mushayt Desert, Sand for Dreams tells the tale of Nathaniel Caine Garnette. Accepting his own fate, he journeys both toward and away from the God he abandoned as a boy, while searching for forgiveness and love. It is 1921, just a few years after America signed the peace treaties ending the world war. The time has come for the U.S. Strategic Officer's four-year service in the sands of Israel to also end. Dogged by several sects who demand the head of the desert bandit \"Caine Ali Hakira,\" Caine doffs his disguise for that of a European to await the steamship home. An expert liar, he talks his way into the memory of a lovely English traveler by sheer suggestion, and she is too polite to admit that she cannot recall him. When the ship's horn peals, Caine is able to board safely, thanks to her diversion, but he cannot forget their brief encounter. In Washington, he learns that his friend, the British consul, has been murdered, his child kidnapped from his side, and taken with several other foreigners from the streets of Jerusalem. Caine resolves to return to Israel, this time as a civilian, to locate the stolen child. History comes to life in the thrilling novel Sand for Dreams. About the Author: V.S. Carnes was inspired in her youth by Lawrence of Arabia. She lives in rural Tennessee, where \"everyone knows everyone and their granny.\" She has written her next book series, The Waldemar Chronicles.
