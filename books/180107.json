  "description": "A Turkish hit squad goes rogue. An American surgeon faces a life-and-death choice. A terrorist group bent on murder draws ever closer. Assassinations rarely follow the plan, even when you’re the demolitions expert for the Ghazi’s top hit squad, the Katiller. Kenan gets caught in the crossfire when their latest hit goes south. Bleeding out on the cobblestones of Milan, the one person who can help him is the last person he expects. Just off her shift at a nearby hospital, American surgeon Kris Marshall thought she was done saving lives for the day—until Kenan falls at her feet half dead. She doesn’t realize saving him will put herself and her friends in the sights of the world’s deadliest terror organization. Honor demands the Katiller protect Kris and her friends, since she saved one of their own, but the Ghazi call for her elimination. On the run across the lush Italian countryside and the icy beauty of the Swiss Alps, Kenan discovers that there is always a choice between life and death. A choice that might cost him everything.",
