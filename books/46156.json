  "description": "In a land of vast forests and clustered cities, humans and anthelai live in uneasy proximity. Forced deep into the wilds, the anthelai are feared and hated. They are perceived as monsters, servants of the dark god Enas, master of the hell-like Plains of Centura. Halfbloods, the children of two species, are extremely rare. The blood does not mix easy, but when it does, the result belongs to neither side. They are outcasts. Anathema. Pariah. The lone survivor of an attack that destroys her home and family, one halfblood girl is captured by a man bent on transforming her into a deadly assassin. Guildmaster Lorcen Caspon hopes that her demon-like presence at his side will aid him in conquering a kingdom. Bound by magic to work her master's dark plan, the woman, known only as the Nightingale, silently vows her revenge. She has lost her home, family, freedom, and even her name. But the Nightingale is stronger than anyone realizes, and she will not break.",
