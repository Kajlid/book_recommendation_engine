Not even his wife knows of his other life when she finds herself unwittingly involved in a drug war.  Strap in with Tom as he navigates his way through the strata of a drug cartel. Lock and load with Lorena, a hard hearted assassin, as she lends her deadly skills to Tomâ€™s fight for his family.  Sit back and watch Tom and Lorena figure out how to work together without killing each other.

Some live. Some die.",
