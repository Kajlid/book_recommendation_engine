  "description": "Relly’s band is called Scorpio Bone. Screaming guitars, crusher drums, and a singer who looks like a golden god. Along comes a girl named Zee, with a bass guitar, a notebook full of strange lyrics, and exactly the right attitude.At the first practice, it all comes together. And Relly’s vision of a new kind of music, Ghost Metal, comes alive at last.“Now that we’re together, the four of us, it’s gonna start. The big time. The biggest thing you ever saw,” Relly says. “When we get cranking, the four of us, we can cross over to the other side, the other world. It takes four and no more. It takes four to win the war.”It sounds crazy, but Zee knows it’s the truth. And at their first gig, she realizes that music isn’t all there is to Scorpio Bone. They’re not just a band anymore. Together they are immortal.",
