  "title": "Mercury Revolts",
  "description": "After a lowly software tester named Suzy Cilbrith uncovers evidence of a vast government conspiracy, she turns to a fringe reporter named Eddie Pratt for help. Far from dismissing her wild claims, Eddie reveals that things are even worse than they appear: the U.S. government has been infiltrated by angels, who are attempting to bring about Heaven on Earth - no matter the cost.  Only one angel knows the secret to exposing the cabal: the rogue cherub known as Mercury. But when Mercury learns who is behind the cabal, he realizes he's going to need a lot of help. Old enemies become allies, old friends become bitter enemies, and as competing plots for world domination unfold, it isn't always clear which is which.  MERCURY REVOLTS is the fourth book by Robert Kroese featuring the wise-cracking, anti-authority angel Mercury. MERCURY REVOLTS takes place after the events of MERCURY RESTS, but is a standalone story that can be enjoyed whether or not you've read the other books.",
