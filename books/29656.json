  "description": "AN ORCHESTRAL ORDEALChiaki is beyond ecstatic. Maestro Stresemann has decided to conduct the A orchestra and has asked Chiaki to join him. But who will lead the S orchestra? Drastic measures mean a hilarious concert, and a festival to remember. From the student body to the faculty, the whole school is abuzz with anticipation. Nodame is playing a piano concerto, Chiaki is also tickling the ivories (and honored to be lead by the Great Master), and the S orchestra is just thrilled to be part of the program. Of course the real excitement begins the night before the musical event. . . .Plus, there’s a special story about Chiaki’s first meeting with Sebastiano Viera. You won’t want to miss it!",
