His friend, Owen, let him borrow his mansion on a tropical island so that he could throw a final party before \"marrying\" the business that would dominate the rest of his life. He brought his secretary, Brandy, hoping that he could kindle a relationship that would last through the long days and nights of running a company. However, while the party was great, the gold digging woman he brought was not, and Jack resigned himself to a lifetime of loneliness.That was until he took a walk down the beach and met her. A woman who didn't recognize him from the tabloids and only saw him, the man behind the money. Of all the women Jack had ever met, there was nobody like Emma LaRue. With one pretend marriage ceremony, she would change his life forever, and become the only one he ever wanted to give his saltwater kisses to.This novella is the first half of Saltwater Kisses written from Jack's point-of-view, with a few bonus scenes thrown in as well. It contains the first half of Saltwater Kisses as a sample and also throws in the cast of all the Kisses books in an ensemble that is sure to make any of Krista Lakes' fans happy!",
