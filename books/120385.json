  "description": "I'm out for revenge. After careful planning, I gave the man who messed with my family a taste of his own medicine. I thought it'd end there. It didn't. Landon King is a genius artist, a posh rich boy, and my worst nightmare. He's decided that I'm the new addition to his chess game. Too bad for him, I'm no pawn. If he hits, I hit back, twice as hard and with the same hostility. He says he'll ruin me. Little does he know that ruination goes both ways.",
