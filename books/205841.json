  "description": "Erotic spanking -- whether giving or receiving -- is one of the most exciting, arousing, and sensual experiences to enjoy. In this enticing collection, spanking enthusiast Rachel Kramer Bussel has assembled 22 tales of red-cheeked arousal. Whether being disciplined for naughtiness or simply because they crave the sting of a hand against flesh, the men and women in these stories revel in being bent over, paddled, punished, and possessed by their spankers. Those delivering the blows find extreme pleasure in pushing their bottoms' buttons, making them -- and the reader -- tremble and quiver in anticipation as they await the next smack. Featuring stories by Alison Tyler, Sage Vivant, Stan Kent, Elizabeth Coldwell, Thomas Roche, and others, this sizzling collection offers tales so breathtakingly vivid that readers might find their own cheeks sore just from reading it.Table of Contents \"A Fantastic Kind of Pain\"Spanking You Rick RobertsPerfect Bound Shanna GermainBetty Crocker Gone Bad Alison TylerLaser Tag Madeline GlassA Rare Find Donna George StoreyGame, Set, Match Sage VivantTied Down Andy OhioThrough a Glass, Sharply Elizabeth ColdwellReunion Madlyn MarchRiding the Storm Thomas ChristopherThe Breeding Barn L.
