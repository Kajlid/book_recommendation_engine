  "description": "What do you get when you add free and dumb?    FREEDOM    My name is Makoto Heart and I’ve always wished for a chance at freedom. Every day, I prayed before the Starlight gods, asking for their divine assistance in accomplishing such a difficult task.  Being an experiment for as long as I can remember, my hopes of obtaining freedom have diminished, drastically. The disappointment haunted me, as myself and my spirits struggled to survive. I had no hope left, believing my final plea fell upon deaf ears, yet again.  But what happens when my prayers are finally answered? I’m thrust into fulfilling a destiny, with the help of six star knights. Suddenly, I am no longer experiment 555, but the stolen princess of Heila.  Freedom, how you have teased my troubled soul. May the Starlight gods guide me and my knights, on this path towards the unknown.    ~In Stars We Trust~     Dark Wish is an extraordinary new paranormal reverse harem series.    Recommended for 18+ audience, containing mature sexual content and strong language.",
