  "description": "Beth Riley wasn't looking for commitment. Beth left Chicago to escape her ex's upcoming marriage to her sister. She thought a hot no-strings-attached vacation fling would help her forget her latest dating disaster, and the sexy guy she’d meet on the plane seemed like a perfect candidate. But Matt wasn't what she expected. Matt Carver wasn’t looking for a girlfriend Matt was trapped on a TransAtlantic cruise with his entire family, and his mother was set on fixing his dating life. He just needed to convince everyone he was already in a relationship. He knew the perfect woman for the role: Beth Riley, an adventurous beauty who’d already rescued him once. The whole ruse was supposed to be harmless, but things quickly got out of hand when their made-up relationship and fake kisses turned to real passion. Note: This book features plenty of panty-melting sex! Not for the timid!",
