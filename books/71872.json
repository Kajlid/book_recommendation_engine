  "description": "An ancient evil worshipped as a god in the depths of time has awakened and turned the world into a desolate and dark place. The remnants of humanity are forced to take shelter where they can, hiding from the ravenous walking dead and their inhuman shepherds, the Locust People, and the Ancient Enemy’s lieutenants, the Lords of Night. In one of New York City’s underground tunnels is a young man with a secret, a growing power he can use against the seething tides of walking dead and their sadistic overseers. His name is Jack, and he has taken it as his mission to retrieve an artifact from the Ancient Enemy’s past to free the world. Jack is untested...but he has help. The last group of Special Forces operatives is on his side.With the world at stake, the team must trek through dead-infested highways from New York to Washington D.C. and back, keeping out of the watchful eye of the Lords of Night, who have sensed Jack’s presence. Surrounded on all sides by the dead and the diabolical, and with Jack’s humanity slipping away as his power grows, the team’s clock is counting down to zero and they no longer know who they can trust. Madness. Betrayal. Temptation. The last of humanity is on the brink, and it all comes down to one thing: what will Jack have to become to defeat an evil older than mankind?",
