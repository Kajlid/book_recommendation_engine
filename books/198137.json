  "title": "Classic Tamil Cuisine: Traditional Cooking From My Grandmother's Kitchen",
  "description": "ANNAM or food is a form of the Almighty according to the Hindu scriptures. All beings are born and live by food and ultimately go back to the earth and merge in it to become food. Food is the supreme medicine of all. South Indian Tamil cuisine is mainly vegetarian and is based on the concept that food shapes the personality, mood, and mind. Food is always cooked with a great deal of attention to the balancing of nutrition, flavor, texture, and variety. Onion and garlic were not even thought of and garam masalas were unknown. It is very important to note that Tamil cuisine has a mild seasoning with a variety of spices and lentils that lend the flavor and aroma to every dish. This latest and comprehensive book sets a new path to a sattvic way of cooking.  Tamil vegetarian food relies more on the taste of individual vegetables, cooked gently with carefully matched seasonings. Classic Tamil is a classic book on a lifestyle that is healthy and pure of mind and soul. The recipes in this book are simple but flavorful with stories woven round tradition and good life. The author has won 7 awards for her cookbooks from 2008 to 2014.  The author can be contacted at the email addresses given in the copyright page.",
