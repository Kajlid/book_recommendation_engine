  "description": "Shinwell Cadwaller is an acquirer of rare and hard to obtain objects – it’s a shame that the owners of these items fail to see his talent. That has always been the case, and Shinwell’s preference, until a simple misread map, and perhaps the hand of fate stepped in. Shinwell now finds himself entwined in a conspiracy that threatens to unleash a darkness on the world like none that has been seen before. With the help of an astute and recently widowed lady of means, an inspector on the outs, and a supernatural companion of questionable loyalties, Shinwell will take the request to return a stolen statue and find himself thrust into a quest to save the world, or to at least survive the attempt.",
