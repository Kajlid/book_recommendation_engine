  "description": "What's left for the Lakota when everything around them is changing? Quiet Thunder and Black Bear's plans to be together are shattered by a military captain who promises Lakota children success in the white man's world. They journey to a Pennsylvania boarding school in hopes of securing their tribe's future in an increasingly white-dominated society. Despite its promise to help Lakota, the school strips students of their Native American identities. Forced to speak and dress as whites, can the love between Quiet Thunder and Black Bear survive if they no longer recognize one another? How can they return to their tribe if they cannot even recognize themselves? Where do they belong if they can't find a place in the white man's world?",
