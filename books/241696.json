  "description": "When Tynan Brayden, the Earl of Westcliff, rescues Lady Abigail Croft from ruffians one dark night outside the Wicked Earls' Club, he never expects his carefree life to be upended by this girl with big, brandy-colored eyes and a stubborn determination to save her reckless brother. He doesn't know why he feels the possessive need to help her. Perhaps it is because she doesn't ask for his help or seem to want anything at all from him. But this Wicked Earl wants more from her... nothing less than her heart.  Lady Abigail Croft is at the end of her rope, trying to save her foolish brother. The Earl of Westcliff's offer to help only complicates matters, for he is big as a gladiator and handsome as sin, and far too distracting. Her life is already in upheaval and she can't risk falling in love with Westcliff when she knows he will only crush her heart. Or will he?  This title is also Book 2 in The Braydens' Series. Book 1 in The Braydens, A Match Made in Duty, is available now.",
