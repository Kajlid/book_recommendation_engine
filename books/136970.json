  "description": "1988 and the band Bushmaster is on its 4th album and 2nd US tour. Vince and Hamish started the band, Bushmaster, as young college students. Now, Vince's nastiness has caused someone to exact the ultimate revenge, death. After coercing Lori into marrying him, Hamish isn't sure just how long she will stick around. His focus has been on keeping his wife happy and getting out of the band. He has a recording date in Glasgow. But, in Los Angeles, Vince is murdered. Hamish's artist wife, Lori, may have been involved with Vincent before Hamish met and convinced her to marry him. Is she involved? Hamish must find the killer. But when he finds the murderer will he be forced to protect that person? In a race to find the answer before the police, MacGrough has to use every resource he can, including the wife he fears may have had a hand in the murder. Lori had already been burned by one man. Can she trust her Scottish keyboard playing husband to respect her career? Will their marriage survive this last gig?",
