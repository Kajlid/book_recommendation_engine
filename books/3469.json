  "title": "Bødy",
  "description": "As indicated by the title, Bødy is a collection of horror stories, all thematically linked to people's perception of their bodies, and the consequences of vanity and low self-esteem. In the vein of the psychological suspense of the Twilight Zone, each story ends with a shock, leaving the reader unsettled with the old adage, \"Be careful what you wish for,\" echoing in their bones. Appropriately, each of the five stories in Bødy gets its title from the body parts featured, buttocks, blood, face, hair and chin.",
