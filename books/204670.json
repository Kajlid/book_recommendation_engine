  "description": "It appears impossible for anyone seriously interested in our civilization to ignore this book. It is a ‘ must’ book for those in every branch of science . . . in addition, economists, politicians, statesmen, and businessmen cannot afford to overlook cybernetics and its tremendous, even terrifying implications. \"It is a beautifully written book, lucid, direct, and despite its complexity, as readable by the layman as the trained scientist.\" -- John B. Thurston, \"The Saturday Review of Literature\" Acclaimed one of the \"seminal books . . . comparable in ultimate importance to . . . Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill,\" \"Cybernetics\" was judged by twenty-seven historians, economists, educators, and philosophers to be one of those books published during the \"past four decades\", which may have a substantial impact on public thought and action in the years ahead.\" -- Saturday Review",
