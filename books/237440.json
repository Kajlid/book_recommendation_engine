  "description": "Weasel never thought staying away from Renee, the sister of Vengeance, a fellow Patch of the Soldiers of Wrath MC, would be easy. But he did it because that’s the right thing to do. At least he thought it was.  He didn’t care that the club looked down at her because of some bullshit concerning Vengeance and words that had been said. Weasel didn’t care because he wanted her and had for a long time.  Now that she was back in town and staying for the unforeseeable future, he didn’t know if he was strong enough to stay away. Especially when he just made a deal with her that would have her moving into his place.  That was a temptation he may never be strong enough to curb … one he didn’t know if he would deny himself.   Renee knew coming to see her brother Vengeance unannounced might not have been the best idea. She’d said horrible things to him, offended the MC by those words, and she also would see Weasel.  The man she’d been secretly in love with.  Not letting her heart fall any harder than it has for Weasel is easier said than done.  Especially when the truth comes out.  Renee needs to figure out if she can handle what’s thrown at her, or if running away is the best option.",
