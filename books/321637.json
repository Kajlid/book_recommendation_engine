  "description": "The murder was ugly. The killer was sure no one saw him. Someone did. In a horrifying vision, Chelsea Adams has relived the victim's last moments. But who will believe her? Certainly not the police, who must rely on hard evidence. Nor her husband, who barely tolerates Chelsea's newfound Christian faith. Besides, he's about to hire the man who Chelsea is certain is the killer to be a vice president in his company. Torn between what she knows and the burden of proof, Chelsea must follow God's leading and trust Him for protection. Meanwhile, the murderer is at liberty. And he's not about to take Chelsea's involvement lying down.",
