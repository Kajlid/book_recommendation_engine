  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is an Advanced Reader Copy edition for ISBN 9781771611770 MEMOIR 2017 SILVER WINNER OF IBPA BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AWARD • 2016 SILVER Foreword INDIES AWARD • For readers of Cheryl Strayed, Martha Beck, and Elizabeth Gilbert\"My Journey Through War and Peace: Explorations of a Young Filmmaker, Feminist and Spiritual Seeker\" is based on Melissa Burch s experiences as a war journalist for BBC, CBS, and other networks. Her team was one of the first documentary crews allowed in the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, and she was featured in a New York Times story about her time in Afghanistan. She was just in my twenties when she traveled with the moujahedeen, filmed an attack on a Soviet convoy, slept with an Afghan commander, and climbed 14,000-foot mountains in the Hindu Kush. My Journey Through War and Peace examines how, through outward action and inward exploration, life can unfold in mysterious ways, far beyond cultural and family expectations. In looking back at this momentous decade, Burch shares why she pursued such dangerous and difficult circumstances at such a young age and continued to live on the edge. She now understands that she was seeking self-discovery, a connection to something greater, and ultimately inner peace. This exciting memoir will resonate with fans of \"Eat Pray Love,\" \"Wild,\" and other popular memoirs that describe extraordinary inner and outer journeys.",
