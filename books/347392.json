But her unexpected friendship with a human knight puts the High Elven at risk and she is banished. Hated by her elven kin, with only Dafydd mac Cuill as her guide, Raine must find her way in a new and increasingly hostile world. Even disguised as a human, Raine is hunted by those who would use her power for their own ends.
