  "title": "One Way Street",
  "description": "In his debut novel, REICHOLD STREET, award-winning author R.L. Herron created a powerful coming-of-age story set in the tumultuous Vietnam era, dealing with the tough issues of family dysfunction, alcoholism, bullying, suicide, madness and war. Endorsed by \"Compulsion Reads,\" it became a 2012 Readers Favorite Gold Medal Winner that Kirkus Reviews called \"Skillfully written and emotionally strong.\" In his new 5-Star-rated novel, ONE WAY STREET, Herron has created an equally powerful sequel in which several key \"Reichold Street\" characters return in a tense, gritty, historically accurate thriller. Set during and immediately after the turbulent 1960s, the electrifying story follows those characters again through war, despondency, love and a murderous stalker. Contains some (minimal) adult language.",
