  "title": "The Lonely Mailman",
  "description": "Every day, an old mailman rides his bicycle through the forest delivering letters to the local animals. These letters seem to have magic in them, as they always help resolve misunderstandings, exchange invitations to dinner or tea, and form friendships. The animals are always eager to find out what message will the mailman be giving them, and everyone is delighted with these letters. In the forest, there are fewer arguments, and harmony reigns. What nobody knows is that every night the dedicated postman writes each letter one by one, thinking carefully about what to write and who it will be addressed to. In fact, he is the only one who has no correspondence. Until one day he receives a very special letter in his mailbox.",
