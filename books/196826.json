  "description": "~This story CAN be read as a standalone, but for the most enjoyment the series should be read in order~SarahIn my wild, reckless past Carlos 'Beach' Rodriguez would have been my ideal man. He's handsome, experienced, rich, kind, and in complete control of his destiny. Unfortunately he's also a criminal, the President of an outlaw motorcycle club, and I've sworn off bad boys in my efforts to live my dream of being normal. It would be so much easier to resist him if he hadn't saved my life more than once and didn't treat me like his queen.BeachGorgeous, smart, and deadly, Sarah is my ideal woman, even if she is almost young enough to be my daughter. On the surface she's one of the toughest females I've ever met, but underneath all that hard beauty and menace lies an incredibly tender heart that's been damaged in the past. Winning her love is gonna be a challenge, but I'm determined to have her as my old lady and I'll do whatever I have to in order to make that happen. That would be a hell of a lot easier to do if people weren't trying to kill us all the time.Author's note- This is part ONE of TWO for Beach and Sarah's story and ends on a Happy For Now.",
