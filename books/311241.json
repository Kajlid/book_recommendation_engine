  "description": "It was only supposed to be a one night stand...You could say I was a successful twenty-four year old, if you looked at my house sitting on the edge of a cliff with killer views of the Pacific Ocean. Or my bank account with seven figures from my coaching business. But according to my frenemy, the girl who invited me to her bachelorette party at an exclusive resort in Lake Tahoe, I was just a sad, lonely girl without a man by my side. I’d show her who was living the dream by finding a tall, dark, and handsome man to rock my world for one night.I accomplish everything I set out to do in life, and that dark haired stranger was no exception. Unfortunately, I didn’t plan on him standing on my doorstep three days later, calling me his wife.It was only supposed to be one hot and pleasurable night. He wasn’t supposed to ruin my business with his risky proposition to save his own. And I definitely wasn’t supposed to develop feelings for the cowboy who knows how to wear a pair of jeans. They say to bring your A-game to the negotiating table, but we may find out the hard way there’s no winning in love….or one night stands.",
