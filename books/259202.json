  "description": "Jess Carter wasn't looking for a place to belong when she arrived in Banks, Idaho. It was supposed to be a temporary spot to finish out her last year of high school and bond with her dad. Meeting Dom changed everything. Now, the Pack needs her. Dom needs her. And she's figuring out she needs them if they plan to survive what's coming. A challenge has been issued and if the Pack doesn't respond they'll be seen as weak. With the motel at capacity, they have a lot to lose if the challenge coming their way isn't met. Caleb is struggling, Anna is absent, and Sam refuses to see her brother or father. Can Jess bring them together before the Hanley's finish tearing them apart? Book 2 in the Pack series. Recommend reading The Pack first.",
