  "description": "First in an all-new series of mysteries that could happen only in Tokyo... Yumi Hata went to school in the U.S., but now--back in Tokyo, living with her parents and working as an English translator--she no longer fits in with the fiercely traditional Japanese. If not for her friend Rika, Yumi would feel completely isolated, so when Rika is found dead--suspected of \"jisatsu,\" taking part in a suicide pact--Yumi is devastated. Fortunately, the police investigator in charge of Rika's case is Yumi's old schoolmate Kenji, who also wants to clear Rika's name. As Yumi and Kenji dig up more evidence, they discover that Rika's \"suicide\" is not what it seemed. Chasing Rika's murderer, Yumi and Kenji encounter doll-faced Lolita fashionistas, trendy bars inhabited by the social elite, and the dark side of a suicide pact website. The clock is ticking as they race to find the killer before the next victim is targeted... Includes more than two dozen photos of Japan!",
