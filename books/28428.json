It is everything the human population has ever dreamed of and Mara is no different. Only a simple twist of fate stops her from taking the drug.As the weeks roll by, it becomes apparent that Nevermore is not the miracle it claimed. A true to life nightmare, the drug steals the very essence that makes up humanity and unleashes a new and deadly species on the world, a species bent on filling its belly.Locked down within their small farm home, Mara and her husband Sebastian struggle against increasingly bad odds, fighting off marauders and monsters alike. But Sebastian carries a dark secret, one that more than threatens to tear them apart, it threatens to destroy them both and the love they have for each other. The secret forces Mara to make the ultimate choice. Will she live for love, or will she live to survive?",
