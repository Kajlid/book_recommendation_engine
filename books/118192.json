  "description": "Hippolyta ruled unopposed as queen of the Amazons until the mighty warships of the Greeks surrounded their island and laid waste to their culture. Only she and her warriors stood against their onslaught until the arrogant, brooding, muscular giant of a man Hercules swaggered out from amongst their ranks and claimed her as his own. Unable to overcome his god-like strength and stirred by shameful lust for this handsome savage Hippolyta finds herself thrown into a cruel and unyielding world whose only desire is to break her down until Hercules' iron will can bend her into his ideal ponygirl. Disclaimer: While this work contains sexual acts and situations including ponygirl training; all characters in this erotic work of fiction are consenting adults over the age of eighteen.",
