  "description": "On October 31st, 2001, six weeks after escaping the World Trade Center attacks, Chance Sowin moves back home, hoping for familiarity and security. Instead, he interrupts a burglary during which his father, Dennis, is shot and killed.What begins as a homicide investigation escalates when the Joint Terrorism Task Force arrives. Where he hoped for solutions, Chance finds only more questions: who killed his father, and why? Was his father--a physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study--working on dangerous research? Why did Dennis build a secret laboratory in his basement?Chance might not know the answers, but Cassie Lackesis, Dennis' research assistant, thinks she does. She isn't certain Dennis discovered a way to time travel, but she knows who told her: Chance.Together with Cassie, Chance will go on a journey across time and space that will challenge his every notion of ideas like \"right\" and \"good.\" One young man's desire to make a difference will become, instead, a race against time as he tries to prevent forces he could never understand from not just destroying the universe but rendering it nonexistent.When every action has a reaction, every force its counter, Chance will find that the truest measure of his character is not what he wants but what he will do when the prodigal hour returns.",
