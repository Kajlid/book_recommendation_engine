  "title": "Are We Dead Yet?",
  "description": "It's been a year since the infection started. Ariel and her small group have been working their way up the Oregon coast line ever since. It was a fairly straight routine, scavenge, kill, and sleep. Until Finn shows up bringing along with him a whole new mess of problems, proving that zombies aren't always the worst thing out there and when you combine them with what is, you get a chaotic mess of death, betrayal, and hopelessness. ***Due to violence and mild language, this book is not recommended for readers under 15.",
