  "description": "Sex is easy. Intimacy is not. No one knows it more keenly than Helena Madison. And widowed five years, celibate four, she can't imagine any reason to wrestle with emotional ghosts. Until a blind date injects Australian transplant Alex Barnes into her closeted world—a dozen years younger, he is searching for the very intimacy Helena fears.An intense night of sex leaves Alex desperate to break through Helena's defenses, but his efforts are complicated by her dead husband's identical twin, a formidable bloke called Sam Madison.Aided by a wise voice no one can hear, Alex sets out to uncover the truth behind Helena's life with the Madison twins—only to discover a tale of divided loyalties and sexual escapades as decadent as it is disastrous. A tale that also reveals a threat buried in Alex's story. A secret that could destroy Helena's tenuous trust, no matter how heartily his invisible companion argues otherwise.",
