Yet he’s brought her to an extraordinary place. The Okavango Delta in Botswana is a revelation. No towns, no roads. Just the wild—truly wild—expanse of heat and dust and nature all around. A place of life and death: elemental, immediate, primal, and unpredictable.For Audrey, it’s like being at the beginning of the world, and at the end—with a wealthy man who will provide for her in every material way but may not know, or care, who she is. Fraught encounters with wild animals—and, worst of all, with Max—will force her to look at what she really wants and who she really is.",
