  "description": "\"Tasty. . . . [Andrews is] the queen of sass, and revenge is her favorite ingredient.”  —  Daytona Beach News-Journal Battling TV chefs—a handsome Georgia redneck with a show called \"Vittles\" and a young professional woman with a cheating boyfriend, bad dye job, and overinvolved family—find themselves competing for a coveted weekly time slot on national television in Mary Kay Andrews’s delightful New York Times bestseller Deep Dish . After years of hard work, Gina Foxton, chef extraordinaire andformer runner-up Miss Teen Vidalia Onion, is hosting her own show, Fresh Start , on local Georgia public television. She's also dating the producer. But when Fresh goes bad, and she catches her boyfriend in flagrante delicto with the boss's wife, Gina decides it's time to pursue bigger dreams. Namely, a gig on national television. Gina knows she's destined to be the Cooking Channel's next superstar. But the execs also have their eyes on Tate Moody, Mr. \"Kill It and Grill It\" himself, host of the hunting-and-fishing cooking show Vittles . The ultimate man's man, Tate's a tasty side of beef with a large, swooning female fan base. Gina's loyal devotees consist of her free-spirit college dropout sister and her mother—who calls every single day. But when the smoke clears there can only be one TV chef standing as Gina and Tate get ready for the cook-off of their lives.",
