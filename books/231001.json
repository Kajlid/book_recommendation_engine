  "description": "DRIVE tells the story of a Second Spanish Empire, a galactic empire, and its looming war with a race called \"The Continuum of Makers\". Humanity has built its empire using technology stolen from the Makersâ€”and these creatures want it back with an almost religious fervor.In the brewing war, it's clear that humanity will lose, and lose badly, unless they can find some advantage in battle. That hope arrives in the form of a tiny, mysterious creature who can drive a starship like no one's ever seen. Now all humanity needs to do... is find 10,000 more pilots just like him.But no one knows where he's from.",
