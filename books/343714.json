He begs readers not to turn the pages, but of course kids feel they just have to see this monster for themselves. Grover is astonished—and toddlers will be delighted—to discover who is really the monster at the end of the book!\nJon Stone\n (1931–1997) is the author of this book, but he was also Sesame Street's principal director until 1996. Working with Jim Henson, he helped create many of the Muppet characters, including Big Bird and Cookie Monster. He was also responsible for the show's format and setting. Stone contributed occasional announcer voices (such as the soap opera promo spoof \"School in the Afternoon\"), and served similar duty on two Muppet Meeting Films. Stone died of complications from Lou Gehrig's disease on March 30th, 1997.
