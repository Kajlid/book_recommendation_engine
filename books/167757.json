  "description": "Life for Liam Sinclair used to be easy. Raves, work, sleep. Lather, rinse, repeat. Yet all of that changed with the arrival of the Urilqii...space aliens, technically, although they looked like everybody else. But if that wasn't freaky enough, they arrived on Earth to thwart a global usurpation by beings they called The Targolt. Climate change, long-denied, was proof of the invasion.Although at first Liam was as skeptical as everyone else, he couldn't deny one fantastic truth--those space-faring alien dudes were hot, Hot, HOT! Still, despite their smiles and affable natures, despite the continual coverage of their actions by the media, the aliens have been strangely close-mouthed, even after many months on Earth. And Liam, like most humans, can't help but wonder--what are they hiding?He is about to find out.First Sergeant Mike, a member of the Urilqii race, lost his love in the last battle with The Targolt and lives with the pain and guilt of surviving while his adored partner did not. But with Liam's sudden arrival into his life and into his heart, will Mike be able to accept or even admit his growing feelings for the handsome human?
