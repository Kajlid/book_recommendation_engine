  "title": "Operation Viking Hammer: A Green Beret's Firsthand Account of Unconventional Warfare in Northern Iraq, 2003",
  "description": "Before the Iraq war in 2003, Green Beret teams infiltrated Northern Iraq, linked up with the CIA, and embedded deeply with the Kurdish Peshmerga to prepare for war. These special missions were called “Advanced Force Operations.” Subsequently, these special teams brought in the rest of the Green Berets during an operation called \"the Ugly Baby,\" and then one of the most significant battles in Special Forces history \"Operation Viking Hammer,\" where six Green Beret teams and a handful of CIA personnel, combined with approximately 8000 Peshmerga took back hundreds of square kilometers from almost 1000 Ansar Al Islam extremists, and secured a poison production facility of national level significance. This book is the only firsthand account of these historic Unconventional Warfare operations, written by an operator. This book is a subset of \"One Green Beret\" by Mark Giaconia",
