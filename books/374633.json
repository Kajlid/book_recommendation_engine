  "title": "Obama Health Law: What It Says and How to Overturn It: The Left's War Against Academic Freedom",
  "description": "The fight against ObamaCare is just beginning. The new health law, signed on March 23, 2010, destroys our constitutional rights. For the first time in history, the federal government will dictate how doctors treat their privately insured patients. That will affect you, no matter what brand-name health plan you have. Worse, some hospitals will stop taking Medicare. Where will seniors go?Advocates for women’s rights need to reassess ObamaCare. Whether you are a man or a woman, pro-choice or pro-life, you lose freedom and privacy.In 1994, Betsy McCaughey read the 1,362-page Clinton health bill, warned the nation of its dangers, and made history. In this eye-opening Broadside, she dissects the 2,700-page health legislation, shows how it will affect you and your family, and presents a battle plan to overturn it. “We cannot falter now,” McCaughey says. “With the Constitution on our side, freedom will prevail.”",
