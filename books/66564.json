  "description": "The Barista and I is Andrew Szymanski's debut collection of stories. It takes on subjects such as idealized love in an illogical world, ruminations on the realities of failed relationships, and the inability to make meaningful connections. In these stories, a man recruits a sexual companion to chase his lost lover across the globe; a recent graduate remembers with bitter nostalgia his formative years; a young man makes his grandfather's funeral all about himself; a man and woman contend with their own neuroses and anxieties in trying to pick each other up. Szymanski's distinct voice permeates these stories of characters trying vainly to escape the ennui of their lives through the distractions of dreams and vices.",
