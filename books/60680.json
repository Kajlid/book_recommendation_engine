Lansdale, Robert Davis, and Adam Millard will love this fast paced tale of the Weird West.What good is a six-shooter against a horde of the undead?Nathaniel Caine wants to forget the War and see the frontier, and a trip by stagecoach seems like the perfect way.

Things go from bad to worse when the passengers fall under attack by people that should be dead, and Caine must call on old skills just to survive.
