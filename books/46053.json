  "description": "The Youth ceased his pacing and paused at the open window, his head resting against the cold slab of stone. He was waiting an anxious, dreadful wait. A duty had been thrust upon him, one which he was not certain he was prepared to attempt. Yet, he had no other choice. His father, the King, and his older brother had already tried and failed. They had been leaders and fighters, warlords over all the south lands. Corion was barely more than a boy, inexperienced and naive. He looked out upon the valley towards the mountains, now grey in the evening dust, as he contemplated the fate which they had left to him.",
