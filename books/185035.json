  "title": "Saladin",
  "description": "Saladin, who united the Arabs and saved Islam from Christian crusaders in the 12th century, is the Islamic world’s preeminent hero. Ruthless in defence of his faith, brilliant in leadership, he also possessed qualities that won admiration from his Christian foes. He knew the limits of violence, showing such tolerance and generosity that many Europeans, appalled at the brutality of their own people, saw him as the exemplar of their own knightly ideals.But Saladin is far more than a historical hero. Builder, literary patron and theologian, he is a man for all times, and a symbol of hope for an Arab world once again divided, and once again wrestling with the problems of dealing with the ‘West’. In cities from Damascus to Cairo and beyond, to the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, Saladin is central to Arab memories, sensibilities and the ideal of a unified Islamic state.In this authoritative biography, historian John Man brings Saladin and his world to life in vivid detail, exploring his legacy and its significance for the world today.",
