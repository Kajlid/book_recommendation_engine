Now I’m something different altogether.”\nIn this standalone companion to The Scout of Wounded Knee and In the Shadow of the Hanging Tree, a ten-year-old boy is taken from his family and sent to a Christian boarding school in southwest Kansas, where he’s given a new name and stripped of everything Indian. The school, run by an enigmatic man known only as Reverend, immerses its students in English and religion under the guise of assimilation into White society. As the boy becomes a young man, he finds himself caught between who he was, and who he was taught to be.",
