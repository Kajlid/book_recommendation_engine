  "title": "Yankees at the Court: The First Americans in Paris",
  "description": "Critical times call for unusual and urgent measures. Such are the years 1775-85, which turn colonists into rebels, rebels into statesmen, and statesmen into ambassadors. This vital decade, when Yankees \"go to court\" for friendship and aid, provides a lively narrative as told by Susan Mary Alsop.The court is Versailles and the Yankees are America's first diplomats. France's avowed enmity toward England is America's salvation, for the colonial rebels lack both diplomatic expertise and an equitable exchange for money, munitions, and supplies. So difficult is the task of sustaining a Franco-American alliance that even the imperturbable Benjamin Franklin complains of being \"indisposed by, continual anxiety.\"The European exploits of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, John Jay, and others are colorful histories replete with intrigue. For not only do these resilient ambassadors suffer the fear of failure, the rebuff of monarchies, and the demands of unreason, they also withstand the schemes of double agents, spies, and traitors. But success is imperative; without France's continued support, the War of Independence cannot be won.Susan Mary Alsop is a descendant of John Jay. Access to private documents provides stories never before told and pictures never before published. Susan Mary Alsop's humane approach toward history and her elegant, witty style vitalize those events, of two centuries ago, aptly described by Benjamin Franklin as \"a miracle of human affairs.\"",
