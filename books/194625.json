  "title": "Possessing the Secret of Joy",
  "description": "From the author the New York Times Book Review calls \"a lavishly gifted writer,\" this is the searing story of Tashi, a tribal African woman first glimpsed in The Color Purple whose fateful decision to submit to the tsunga's knife and be genitally mutilated leads to a trauma that informs her life and fatefully alters her existence. Possessing the Secret of Joy , out of print for a number of years, was the first novel to deal with this controversial topic and managed to do so in a manner that Cosmopolitan called \"masterful, honorable, and unforgettable storytelling.\" The New Press is proud to bring the book back into print with a new preface by the author addressing the book's initial reception and the changed attitudes toward female genital mutilation that have come about in part because of this book.",
