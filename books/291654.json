  "description": "There’s something wrong with me. Something dark, something twisted. Daddy always said I could make even the holiest of men sin…and you know what? He was right.  After being stolen for five years, my life is not my own. It’s unrecognizable. A new house, a new family…even stepbrothers. I’m the face America has prayed for, but I don’t want to be. I was safe when I was away, and now that I’m back in Midpark, the monsters will come out and play. Cruel. Vicious. Evil. Everyone sins, but some sins are worse than others. Some sins just can’t be forgiven, and it’s only when they enter my life that I realize this. Handsome and dangerous, Zane and Thorn make me question everything I thought I knew. Maybe I could have a life. Maybe I can ignore the darkness inside and forget the terrors of my past. Maybe they could teach me what love really means, how to fight back against the bullies in my life. Or maybe not. Maybe this new beginning is simply my ending. Sind is a dark standalone novel, centering around a girl in high school who’s never had a good life. There is some bullying, along with mentions of abuse and graphic violence. This is also an MFM romance, so be warned.",
