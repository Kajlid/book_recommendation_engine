  "description": "On the banks of the Skeleton River in a remote part of North Carolina lies the town of Starlight. Like most small towns in America, Starlight has seen better days. Once known for its tobacco fields and rural Southern charm, the stores on Main Street are now boarded up, and many of the residents have left town for good.Logan Shaw, a down and out used-car salesman living in Wilmington is convinced that the letter he has received from a small law firm in Starlight has to be a mistake. The letter states that Logan has been named the sole beneficiary in the last will and testament of one of Starlight’s residents, a reclusive old woman recently found dead in her home on the outskirts of town.After arriving in town, Logan meets an attractive young woman named Colby who has lived in Starlight all of her life. No one knows better than Colby about the stories passed down through the years of a vengeful ghost that can return from the dead when the harvest moon rises over the tobacco fields outside of town – a ghost that kills in such a fit of rage that the bodies of the victims are left unrecognizable. For nearly a hundred years, no one in Starlight has ever seen the ghost and lived to tell about it.With Colby by his side, Logan struggles to comprehend the unspeakable evil that has entered his life, and to understand how he is strangely connected to it. Under the light of the harvest moon he will learn of the dark secret that Starlight holds, and of the legend the locals refer to as “the ghost of tobacco road”.",
