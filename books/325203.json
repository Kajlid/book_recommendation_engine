  "description": "As children, we were friends. Inseparable. Trusted. I hid my Omega nature as best I could, shielding myself behind contact lenses and heavy perfumes. But he found out. Alphas always find out. Gone is the young man who wiped away my tears and held me in the dark. In his place is a relentless pursuer, determined to force me to do the one thing I never wanted... submit. I won’t give in. I can’t give in.",
