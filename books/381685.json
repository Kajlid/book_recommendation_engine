  "title": "Stolen Youth: How Radicals Are Erasing Innocence and Indoctrinating a Generation",
  "description": "American children are facing a crisis unlike any in human their very extinction. Every day, thousands of American kids are being robbed of their youth as they are converted into foot soldiers for an aggressive agenda of woke politics while parents watch in horror or resigned indifference. The insidiousness of wokeism is a phenomenon most American parents never fully realize, yet these ideas pervade children’s minds because of the woke narrative ever-present in society. In this book, Bethany Mandel and Karol Markowicz present data about the impact of wokeism on childhood and give parents tools to identify how wokeism has encroached in their lives—and limit its influence.",
