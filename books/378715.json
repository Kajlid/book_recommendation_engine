  "description": "Clybourne park had its UK premiere at the Royal Court Theatre, London. Set in Chicago, the play \"applies a modern twist to the issues of race and housing and aspirations for a better life.\" It is loosely based on real events. The first act depicts the racial atmosphere in Chicago in 1959. The second act is set in 2009 in the same house where a white couple wants to move into the now-gentrifying black neighborhood. The premise is gentrification, but Norris bares much more. He peels away layers of propriety with acuity, subtlety, and boldness.",
