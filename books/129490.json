  "description": "Juliet is never taken seriously, she is just that cute unobtrusive girl who sits in the corner of a south east London Caf√©. Minding her own business or so everyone thinks. For weeks she has been listening to the conversations of others and piecing together information. She is surprised at how people are connected without realising and uses this information to get what she wants. Albeit with deadly consequence to others.",
