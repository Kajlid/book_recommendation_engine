  "description": "Kathryn is on the look out for a new roommate. She's pretty sick of her constant diet of ramen and needs to find someone to help pay the rent, but every time a potential roommate candidate comes to see her place, it doesn't end well. Because Kathryn likes Christmas. A lot. And her apartment is, in her words, a Christmas Wonderland. To everyone else, it's a Christmas Nightmareland.  But when Kat meets Jewel, she has high hopes for this potential roommate. For one, she's gorgeous as hell...actually, Kat's pretty distracted by that fact, and her budget concerns fly out the window because of the intoxicating chemistry between the two women.  There's just one problem...in a world where werewolves were recently outed in society, Jewel is having problems of her own finding the perfect place to live.  Because Jewel just happens to be a werewolf...  Full of Christmas cheer, heartwarming moments and sexy romance, THE CHRISTMAS WOLF is just the novella to read to get you in the holiday mood.",
