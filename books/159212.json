  "description": "Jill St-Jane is in trouble when a handsome stranger blasts back into her world during the wildest tax demonstration London has ever witnessed. Caught in the middle of a campaign led by mad-cap artist, Krusader, she finds herself imprisoned as politicians, bankers, tax-specialists and bishops argue outside the Cathedral. Riot police, spies and ordinary folk become embroiled in a bizarre love-laced plot to randomly pair them all off. But what does this have to do with tax?You'll never view politics the same way again as The Tax Protest Love Romp in London keeps you laughing as the scandals keep surfacing. Enjoy the author's original wit and warped take on reality with a generous dash of romance to go. Definitely a unique romantic comedy reimagining events set outside St Paulâ€™s Cathedral during the Occupy London protest of 2011.",
