  "description": "Canadian Children's Book Centre Our Choice, 2007 Hamilton Literary Awards Program, 2007 - Mixed Media Award for Young Adult Book Beauty's back - with a bound! Liz and her best friend Alicia are this year, no boys! It doesn't take long, though, before Liz falls off the wagon. She's irresistibly drawn to Kyle, and Kyle is drawn to Liz - dragged to her, actually, by Beauty Two, who is so glad to see her old friend that she starts to forget the finer points of her dog guide training. Kyle doesn't care. Every time he hears Liz's voice, he feels like he's flying. But the reasons for Kyle and Liz to stay away from each other just keep piling up. Kyle's got a teacher with a grudge who's loading him down with work. Liz's parents think she's too young, and sneaking around behind their backs certainly doesn't make her feel mature. As for Beauty, she needs correction, or she'll be taken away; and that, Kyle just can't stand to think about. Whatever happens, he knows his future depends on having Beauty by his side. The final book in the trilogy of Elizabeth and Beauty, her seeing eye dog, will have you in tears-of laughter and of pain. Conclusion to the Beauty trilogy The other two books in the series have received rave reviews and awards.",
