  "title": "How to Hack Back Your Mind: Reclaim Control Over Your Life",
  "description": "Negativity is not a character trait; it is the accumulation of damaging thoughts and emotions such as fear, worry, stress, and powerlessness over an extended period of treasured time.Our minds often get programmed to steal what is most valuable to us - time, inspiration, optimal performance, and goal achievement.Changing these patterns is the most valuable investment that big companies seek, often without realizing it. And this is a global phenomenon.When Ramzi Najjar, a multi-award-winning bestselling author, changed his life by transforming his overthinking and controlling his mind through the knowledge he shared in his library of four acclaimed books, things changed. He wondered if others could benefit from what he had discovered. So, he decided to share all his insights in books, passing on the extensive knowledge he had gained to help others.The good news is that his latest literary work, HOW TO HACK BACK YOUR MIND, offers a proven plan to change negative patterns and overthinking, allowing individuals to reboot their lives and transform this super problem into a superpower.When we do not control our negative thoughts, they control us. And if our lives are already filled with broken people, thoughts, and emotions, we become our worst enemy, holding ourselves back from achieving what we truly desire.The solution to our negativity lies not in disregarding it but in consciously running our minds and lives through awareness and intentional behavior rather than letting them operate on autopilot.Everything begins to change once we learn how to deal with our subconscious minds and give our conscious minds the green light to regain control. Only then do we become our own best friends.This newfound empowerment drives us toward achieving our goals and building ourselves on solid foundations.Suppose you want to tap into the surprising power of the conscious versus the unconscious, relieve the burden on your shoulders, and give yourself the opportunity and time to excel, shine, and save your life. In that case, you can find unparalleled knowledge in this book to orchestrate your life and truly define yourself.Just as one can be fearful, they can also become resilient. Just as one can doubt themselves, they can also build resilience and take charge.Just as one falls, one can also get back up. Life is all about \"can\" and \"will,\" and it requires the right knowledge to master it.You cannot become the architect of your life without learning and gaining experience in architecture.",
