The Christmas Deer touches him anyway, telling him he has a special destiny.Cut down and transported to a Christmas tree lot in the city, Treewing waits anxiously for a happy family to buy him, take him home, and love him. But this doesn't happen, and after the other trees have been sold, he's left all alone.
