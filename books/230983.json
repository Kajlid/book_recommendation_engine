  "title": "Some Beheadings",
  "description": "Here the -beheaded- poet displaces her mind into the landscape, exploring territories as disparate as India's Western Ghats and the cinematic Mojave Desert, as absurd as insomnia and dream. Some Beheadings asks three questions: -How does thinking happen?- -What does thinking feel like?- -How do I think about the future?- The second question takes primacy over the others, reflecting on what poets and critics have called -the sensuous intellect, - what needs to be felt in language, the contours of questions touched in sound and syntax.",
