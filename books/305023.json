  "description": "When it comes to being a demon, I’d say I’m a pretty solid five—a high seven on a good day. I’ve lied. I’ve cheated. I’ve picked a pocket or two. It’s not like we can all be harbingers of death or great Babylonic beasts. Ambitions like that got you noticed, and getting noticed got you dead. So, maybe I wasn’t that good a demon, but hey—I was alive.Some demons are born to bring forth nightmares. Then there's Nate.Nate Godwin is a laidback demon enjoying his laidback, boring life in the comfort of good-old rainy England, until he gets conned into babysitting a hapless hunter and young fugitive. On the run from angels and demons alike, Nate soon finds himself going up against his own personal nightmare—the high-level demon that owns his soul. Amon.Whether he likes it or not, Nate is in deep, and the worst part? Amon has plans, and not just for Nate's charges. Their only hope is to seek out a mystical amulet said to have the power to conceal its wearer from anything and everything. The only problem is finding the damn thing, and with Heaven and Hell drawing ever closer, time is running out. Inspired by such authors as Jonathan Stroud, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Rob Thurman, the Occultus is an urban fantasy novel that drags the reader on a journey and adventure filled with sarcasm and humour. If you're a fan of a good old fashioned antihero like Crowley from Good Omens, or Loki, the god of mischief, then you should enjoy Nate, the antisocial and troubled demon who denies having a heart of gold and if questioned on it, he would only tell you it was stolen. The Occultus is ideal for fans of TV shows such as Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Lucifer, and Midnight Texas, focusing very much on the characters and their connection to each other.",
