  "description": "1959. Key Largo, FL. The landscape of America is about to change forever. Paula Taylor is not only ahead of the curve. She is the curve. Bold. Determined. Still stunningly beautiful at thirty-nine. Every fiber of her being screams to be free.She finds that freedom in the arms of Kurt Younger. Pirate. Rogue. A six-four monument to man in his most primal state. Paula knows nothing about him except that he taught her the joys of being a woman for the first time in her life. She can't lose that.Does it matter that she doesn't know where Kurt lives? Or what he does for a living? Would she feel differently about him if she knew of his bloodied past?Paula only knows she has to have him and won't let anybody or anything get in the way. Not her overbearing husband. Or her battle-ax mother-in-law. Or her Pi Kappa son. She's secretly emptied the family checking account (careful to take only half), bought a daring new wardrobe, a sexy red '56 T-Bird, and peeled rubber out of town. For good. When Paula joins Kurt at his secluded island paradise, he neglects to tell her about the two million dollars in stolen emeralds. Or the ruthless men who will kill to get them. Or his involvement. Why? Are these cutthroats really lusting after her more than the emeralds? And what havoc will Hurricane Judith wreak on everyone's nefarious, passionate schemes?In Paula's quest to have it all, she risks losing everything. Consequences? Unthinkable.",
