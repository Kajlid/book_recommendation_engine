  "title": "Second Chance Christmas",
  "description": "Mistletoe means so much more than kissing.  It’s Saylor Bates’ first Christmas Eve alone since her divorce. While killing time window shopping at the mall, Saylor manages to catch Santa and pleads with him to reassure her son via FaceTime he’ll be coming for Christmas.  What Saylor doesn’t expect is for Santa to also be dazzle-eyed and drop-dead gorgeous beneath that fur-trimmed hat and fluffy white beard.  When Cole Osteen is snagged by Saylor under his guise as Santa on Christmas Eve, he can’t help but get to know her better. Soon their romance ignites quicker than a Christmas display. It isn’t just Cole’s kissing under the mistletoe that keeps Saylor warm. While kissing is definitely a perk, Saylor discovers mistletoe represents so much more.  Both Cole and Saylor are battling pain from past relationships. Maybe this Christmas, it’s about giving someone a second chance. Not only at love, but at forgiveness.  Can Saylor and Cole both let go of the pain of their past to find it?  This Christmas romance is humorous enough to make you laugh, touching enough to make you cry, and swoony enough you'll fall in love right along with Cole and Saylor.
