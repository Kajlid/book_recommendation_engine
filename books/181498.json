  "description": "A swan princess hunted for her bones, a broken musician and his silver pipe, and a rat named Maurice bring justice to a town under fell enchantment. A gang of courageous kids confronts both a plague-destroyed world and an afterlife infested with clowns but robbed of laughter. In an island city, the murder of a child unites two lovers, but vengeance will part them. Only human sacrifice will save a city trapped in ice and darkness. Gold spun out of straw has a price, but not the one you expect.World Fantasy Award winner Ellen Kushner has called Cooney's writing \"stunningly delicious! Cruel, beautiful and irresistible.\" BONE SWANS, the infernally whimsical debut collection from C. S. E. Cooney, gathers five novellas that in the words of Andre Norton Award winner Delia Sherman are \"bawdy, horrific, comic, and moving-frequently all at the same time.\" Cooney's mentor, Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Grand Master Gene Wolfe, proclaims in his introduction that her style is so original it can only be described as \"pure Cooney,\" and he offers readers a challenge: \"Try to define that when you've finished the stories in this book.\"",
