JoAnn really loves her new Hell phone. Problem is, the frequent calls home--time really moves like Hell in the Abyss--are putting a large dent and Susan and Marcus's bedroom time.In their attempt to retrieve JoAnn, THE GRATEFUL UNDEAD team ultimately finds themselves knee-deep in vamp critters, demons, rogues, and a host of new and colorful characters, when the mission takes them from their home in Florida to the streets of New Orleans.",
