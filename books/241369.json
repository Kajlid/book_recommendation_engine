  "description": "They say running is good for your health. But Marley finds out that it’s the most dangerous thing she’s ever done. Harrison knows exactly what he wants and what’s owed to him. She thinks she’s safe out here alone, but she’s never been in more danger. WARNING! Welcome back to the Forced Submission series. Just like before, these books contain situations involving forced submission and dubious consent. These themes are triggers for some but sweet candy for others. If you’re willing to hold off judgment until the last page, the ending is worth it, we promise!",
