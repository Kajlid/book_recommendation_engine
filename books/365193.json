  "description": "Jacob \"Yasha\" Livingston is having a bad day. First there is the head cold. Then the orgy, the fight, and the hospital. Between that and the bus driver who ejects him -- after accusing him of transmitting the Swine Flu -- the rest of his day seems fairly vague. Now he's stuck in a small town called Santo Ignacio and he has a whole lot of thinking to do.One thing is, when fate speaks in the form of an EMT, maybe it's time to listen. One man in particular, EMT Jason \"JT\" Lents, with his shy smile and jade green eyes, seems more like an angel than a paramedic. But Jason has a date with a newer, prettier girl every night, despite the fact that he seems to return Yasha's interest.What will make JT happy? If JT is afraid of his feelings it might be Yasha's chance to heal the healer. For this couple to find their way, it's up to Jacob, his new friends, and the magic of St. Nacho's.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices.",
