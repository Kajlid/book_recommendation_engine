  "title": "Murder at Avedon Hill",
  "description": "Welcome to the land of Caern, where the gods — the Children of Az —can choose to be born into the world as mortals to directly affect events... and often do. And where the conflict between religious faith and arcane magic has reached a breaking point. Gretta Platt, Housemistress of Avedon Manor, has been murdered. Only a handful of people live in Avedon Hill, and most are suspects. Arames Kragen, retired Aarronic Advisor and scholar of prophecy, must gain access to Avedon Hill’s mountain pass. But Lord Avedon is not in a giving mood... To earn his passage, Arames Kragen must discover who killed Gretta Platt. He must also uncover the truth about a town that seems to have more secrets than inhabitants.",
