  "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A big sweeping novel of friendship and marriage” ( The Washington Post ) by the celebrated author of The Prince of Tides and The Great Santini Leopold Bloom King has been raised in a family shattered—and shadowed—by tragedy. Lonely and adrift, he searches for something to sustain him and finds it among a tightly knit group of outsiders. Surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, as well as Charleston, South Carolina’s dark legacy of racism and class divisions, these friends will endure until a final test forces them to face something none of them are prepared for. Spanning two turbulent decades, South of Broad is Pat Conroy at his a masterpiece from a great American writer whose passion for life and language knows no bounds. Praise for South of Broad “Vintage Pat Conroy . . . a big sweeping novel of friendship and marriage.” — The Washington Post “Conroy remains a magician of the page.” — The New York Times Book Review “Richly imagined . . . These characters are gallant in the grand old-fashioned sense, devoted to one another and to home. That siren song of place has never sounded so sweet.” —New Orleans Times-Picayune “A lavish, no-holds-barred performance.” — The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “A lovely, often thrilling story.” — The Dallas Morning News “A pleasure to read . . . a must for Conroy’s fans.” —Associated Press",
