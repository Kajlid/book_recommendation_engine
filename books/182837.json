  "description": "When Callie Pierce turns 18 she has three very simple goals; avoid her stepfather, escape to an Ivy League university of her dreams and party with her friends. But on a night like any other, when the moon is full over the ocean, her life changes in a way that nobody ever sees coming. On the sandy beaches of San Diego she meets Orion, a man with whom she cannot stay away, to whom her return becomes as inevitable as the tide kissing the shore. If that isn't enough, a kiss which changes everything plunges Callie head first into a world of Mythic responsibility, epic danger and heart stopping romance. The Mer, an ancient race of warriors brought forth to defend the seas, show her wonders beyond what is humanly possible, forcing her into an archaic chain of events that bring together power, seduction, violence and beauty in a terrifying yet exhilarating mix. Then thereâ€™s The Banished to contend with, a group of Psirens, corrupted by the Oceans abyss, that stand to destroy the eternity Callie has been promised. Will she sacrifice herself for the greater good, or is the gravity that pulls her to Orion just too great to bear?",
