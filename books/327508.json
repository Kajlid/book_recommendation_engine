  "description": "From the critically-acclaimed authors of Back for Seconds: A Reverse Harem Feast and Regifted: Ganged by the Ghosts of Christmas comes a brand new reverse harem tale of holiday hedonism, and this time love (and lust) are on the line. They’re magical monster-hunting vampires living in a van, she’s a fed-up middle-aged divorcee attempting to geocache her Valentine’s Day into oblivion. Perfect. Now the question is: can Quintain, Fletcher, and Marcus convince Ruby that the best way to resurrect her love life is with a few guys that are also back from the dead?Ruby and the V-Day Vanpires is a 9,619 word stimulating short story about the importance of cleaning up public parks, practicing safe archery, and that age - and getting absolutely RAILED in the back of a van by three bi vampires - is only a state of mind. This tale is written for adults, and intended for 18+ audiences only. It involves explicit group activity, unprotected “interactions” with said undead suitors and their ahem nocturnal emissions, slight kidnapping, the ol’ fangy kiss to access liquid vampire chow, being impaled (the fun way, with 2 peens in 1 V), being impaled (the NOT fun way - like, with an arrow), sex pollen/poison (aka have to the deed to survive), as well as brief mentions of Homeowner’s Associations (HOAs), and geocaching.",
