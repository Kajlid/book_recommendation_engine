  "description": "Edited by Hot Tree Editing Alexia, Lexi to all her friends lived her life her way. Even if it meant putting aside her dreams and dealing with her overbearing mother. She loved the world she had created for herself as a waitress in a chic Montréal bistro. Until one day a businessman comes into the bistro and challenges the life she’s come to love. She’s caught between her desire for him and the desire to protect what she herself has created. He is domineering and strong with all his wealth and power, as he unapologetically pursues her. Should she give in? Should she set aside who she is and be with him in his world? Lukas Blakk is exactly what Lexi has always wanted but the man has a past that Lexi might not be ready for.",
