  "description": "Hunter\n When my business partner asked me to do him a favor, I had no idea he was sending me on the blind date his mother had arranged for him. I walked in the bar, saw the woman drinking her third martini, and knew I was in for an eventful night. After the unexpected second date, she didn't know my real name or who I really was. By that time, the lie was too far gone, and I wanted her too much to admit the truth.  \nLaney\n It's not every day you find out your ex-boyfriend is engaged. I shouldn't have agreed to the blind date, but I wasn’t in any position to turn down a night out when my mother insisted. I will admit, I definitely shouldn't have ordered that fourth martini before said blind date even arrived. The man turned out to be swoon worthy, handsome, condescending — a perfect distraction.  Then I found out he was a liar.  I've never been in over my head to this degree.  Then again, I've never been mixed up in love.",
