Do your research. Ask questions. Read this book.\" - Matt Forbeck, game designer and author of Amortals and Vegas Knights \"To those looking to save hours of field research into two highly specialized and hard-to-crack fields, Jennifer Brozek's pragmatic, down-to-earth advice serves as an essential clue-dispenser.\" - Robin D.

You need to look for (or make) the opportunities and grab them.\" The first opportunity you should grab is this book. It will give you the information you need to decide whether you're dedicated enough to become a freelance RPG writer or anthology editor, and if you decide you are, then it will tell you how to go about it. Take Brozek's advice to heart. She knows what she's talking about.\" - Angel Leigh McCoy, writer for Guild Wars 2 and editor of Wily Writers Podcast",
