  "description": "A poker-playing businessman working secretly as a contract killer, Carl Hill lives a apparently quiet life near Niagara Falls, Canada This former resident of New York, N.Y, is considering retirement when a shadow from his past looms up to threaten his plans. Carl is uncovered through a land development proposal of his real estate agent wife, Joyce. If news of Carl’s present whereabouts got back to certain people it would threaten the life of both Carl and Joyce. Threats of exposure are accompanied by an offer to accept a payoff to remain silent. Flight is almost impossible; giving in to blackmail is unattractive; one possible solution occurs to Carl. He hopes it hasn’t occurred to his blackmailer. Carl strives to save his business secrets, his marriage, and his life. Someone must die.",
