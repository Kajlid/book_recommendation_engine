  "description": "“I'm not scared of sex. I want it like crazy. But not like that, with someone I don't even like.” Peter is fifteen, a typical Australian boy who enjoys riding his dirt bike and wants to be a photographer. In his world, a boy is considered a man only if he obeys an unwritten set of rules: he must seek out danger, talk rough, get girls—any girl. If he's different, he's labeled a “poof.” Pressured by his peers and by society to conform to this stereotyped male image, Peter feels both confused and repelled. His confusion, and his horror, increase when he finds that he is attracted to his brother's friend David, who is gay. Here is a daring, exceptionally honest novel about sexuality and the need to be true to oneself. Peter shares his every muddle and perception with us, and his candor just might help us find our own way.",
