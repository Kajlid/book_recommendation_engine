  "title": "Third Worlds: The politics of the Middle East and Africa",
  "description": "In this book Heather Deegan provides a re-examination of the way in which we conceive of and describe the very different regions that we know as the ‘Third World’. She asks whether such an umbrella term can have real validity when applied to the Middle East and Africa, arguing that the traditional categorisation of these regions has masked not only their contrasts and contradictions but also their historic and cultural similarities. Once removed from the category of the Third World, a different picture of these regions emerges. Dr Deegan looks closely at the alternative Islamic development agenda for Africa which in part mirrors that of the World Bank and the IMF. The Islamic agenda contains political, religious, economic, regional and cultural influences. Deegan focuses on each of these themes, examining the relationship between Western patterns of democratisation and Islamic notions of democracy; comparing the policies of Western international aid agencies and their Islamic counterparts—the Islamic Conference Organisation and its funding agency, the Islamic Development Bank; looking at Islamic economics and ‘ethico-economics’ and their potential for reviving the more impoverished economies of African states; discussing religious devotion and women’s worlds; and looking at the influence of political changes in South Africa and the Israel-Palestinian peace negotiations. What emerges is an original and very revealing view of Third World politics in general and the politics of the Middle East and Africa in particular, which will be invaluable for those with interests either in politics or in development issues.",
