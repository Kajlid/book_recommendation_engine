  "title": "The Battle-Ground",
  "description": "1902. Glasgow's realistic fiction novels often showed the female characters as stronger than the male characters. It was this new type of Southern fiction that made Ellen Glasgow one of the major writers of her time. The vantage point from which most of her nineteen novels were written was her native home of Richmond, Virginia. She received the Pulitzer prize in 1942. The Battle Ground is the earliest of a series of novels which Glasgow hoped might become in time a complete social history of Virginia since the Civil War.",
