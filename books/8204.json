The man knows what to do with paper and ink. Read the damn thing.\" -Charlie Huston \"Someone once said of Raymond Chandler that he wrote 'as if pain hurt and life mattered.' That's true of Josh Stallings, too. Hop on, kick the starter, and let him lead you on a long, painful, but entertaining ride through Moses McGuire's world. One hint: wear your helmet and your leathers. It might get messy.\" -Tad Williams BEAUTIFUL, NAKED AND DEAD is hard-boiled crime novel.
