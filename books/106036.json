  "title": "Up Syndrome:  It's all about the attitude!",
  "description": "In this autobiographical account of living with an extra chromosome, Megan Abner shares stories of her adventures in traveling (from Los Angeles to Graceland to New York City and in between), childhood encounters with bullies and heartache, the family that has loved and supported her since the day she was born, and how she has come to redefine \"Down Syndrome\" as \"Up Syndrome.\" Megan's depiction of her journey of turning a \"disability\" into a \"different ability\" is funny, poignant and, above all, honest. Her story is an inspiration to not only a child with Up Syndrome, but to anyone who has experienced life's \"ups\" and \"downs.\"",
