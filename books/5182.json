  "description": "Everyone knows Jack Tulle as a widower, a doting father, and an honest businessman. The problem is, it's all a lie. For eight years Jack has enjoyed the quiet life in the sleepy little town of Bodey, Colorado where he owns and operates the General Store. He sits on the town council. He dotes upon his eight-year-old, headstrong daughter, Abigail. He is even being sized-up as a prospective new member of the family by the bank president. But when the local saloon announces plans to host a grand prize poker tournament, Jack realizes it could spell trouble. One of the many secrets he's been hiding is that he used to be a con man - mainly underhanded poker, but he wasn't above the odd swindle when the situation presented itself. And a contest like the one his town is planning is sure to draw some old business acquaintances - fellows Jack would really rather not admit to knowing. Of course there's one man in particular Jack is worried about seeing - Tom Jude is the only person who knows the truth behind all his secrets. Tom wasn't just Jack's partner-in-crime, he was also the love of his life. And Tom knows things - like the fact that the little girl Jack is raising, really isn't his... As Jack scrambles to maintain his deceptions by lying to friends and neighbors as well as the child he has grown to love, he discovers the real truth: when your world is built on A Hundred Little Lies, exposing a single one of them can bring the whole thing crashing down. \"Charming, witty, and intensely romantic, this is an outstanding debut novel from a writer to be watched.\" - Victor J. Banis, author of LOLA DANCES",
