  "title": "Cry Wolf",
  "description": "Peter is a kitsune. Chaos follows him wherever he goes. Good intentions, bad intentions—-it doesn’t matter. Even mimicking the howl of a friend he hasn’t seen in over a decade turns out to have disastrous consequences.  The wolf doesn’t have a name. For now, he goes by Luca. He has no past, and as an escaped slave, if he can’t stay hidden in the shadows, he’ll have no future. When someone steals his howl, he’s drawn to investigate, and ends up saddled with a mouthy fox who insists they used to be friends once upon a time.  Petty problems and a dubious reunion are pushed aside the longer they're stranded together. The Underwood is a dangerous place.  They have two choices: work together or die.  Join Greta Stone in a dark paranormal MM romance retelling of Aesop’s fable, The Boy Who Cried Wolf, and David P. Mannix's classic novel, The Fox and the Hound.",
