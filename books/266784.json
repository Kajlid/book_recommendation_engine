  "description": "(Edited version of two earlier \"Indaba, My Children\" & \"Africa Is My Witness\".) 'Credo Vusamazulu Mutwa is a practising witch-doctor in a township outside Johannesburg. . He . maintains that western Christianised civilization has imposed alien values on a proud, religious and historic race. . These stories are sometimes violent, sometimes passionate, always eloquent and never self-pitying. All Mutwa asks is that the traditions of the Bantu peoples should be understood and respected. He shows, for instance, that if the dam builders had taken the trouble to propitiate the Holy Ones of Kariba, the riots of 1958 in Rhodesia would not have taken place. A western reader should not regard such superstitions as contemptible for, says Mutwa, who has never left his native land, \"if you think that the Africans are primitive, superstitious, sub-human rabble, try hurling a dead pig into a Mosque in Dar-es-Salaam, or into a Synagogue in Jerusalem, and see what happens. Or try disfiguring a statue of the Virgin Mary in the presence of a group of Sicilians on their own island, and see what they do to you\".",
