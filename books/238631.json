  "description": "A vacation isn’t the same thing as running away. At least that’s what I told myself.  Waking up next to Ethan in a rustic mountain cabin makes me feel like the luckiest woman in the world. Without the connection to the outside world, we could forget our troubles. When we go into town for supplies and cell phone signal is restored, all bets are off.  Logan is on assignment, but his friend needs help. My partners and I jump into action with Ethan along for the ride. We’re on bigfoot’s trail, trying to catch up to him before a hunter does. Rider is distant, Vincent is uneasy, and Ethan is way too excited about meeting a bigfoot. When we find traces of the stalker, the scent Rider is tracking and what I see in the Path don't line up. Something strange is happening in the mountains.  Are we tracking a hunter, or something else altogether different?",
