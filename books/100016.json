  "description": "Known as a writer whose stories “ balanced romance, scandal, and a considerable amount of heart” (A.V. Club), New York Times bestselling author Eric Jerome Dickey  fearlessly explores how bad even good people can sometimes behave in the game of love....Stephan loves ’em and leaves ’em, just like his dad. Chanté thinks she’s found her dream man—until his wife and kids come banging on her door. Jake is a player—left with bad dreams he just can’t shake. Darnell is true to his wife...but the temptation’s getting tougher every day. Tammy is caught between the man she loves, and the woman he’s promised to. And while Karen lectures her friends about fooling around, she may not live up to her own high standards....This is the world of Eric Jerome Dickey. It’s heart-wrenching and hilarious, smart and soulful, and as honest and recognizable as your own—and that of everyone who never loved you back.",
