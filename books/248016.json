  "description": "Diana Campanella is the owner of a vintage clothing store in Washington, D.C., teetering on the brink of disaster. She and her blue-blood lawyer fiancé still have not set a date for their wedding. And it's becoming more difficult than ever for Diana to keep the peace in her big, unruly Catholic family. But just when all hope seems lost, Diana meets a rumpled New Yorker named Harry, who casts a new light on her life and its possibilities. Now all she has to do is decide whether Harry's warmth and great sense of humor is a better bet than the familiar security her fiancé has to offer.",
