  "title": "No Fixed Address: an amorous journey",
  "description": "\"Winner of the Writers' Guild of Alberta Award for Fiction Nominated for the Governor General's Award for Fiction\" Arachne Manteia is a road rider, a traveling sales rep who drives a classic Mercedes and peddles women's underwear for a living. From her working class childhood to her comfortable adult life, Arachne refuses the conventional and embraces whatever adventure fate throws in her path. A rogue sales rep with a man in every town, she lures each into her web of desire. All of them she claims as part of her never-ending journey, which promises fulfillment but offers no map for her longing. Always ready to fight and flee, Arachne Manteia is the quintessential picara, skillfully reckless, frighteningly irresistible, ready to go to the edge of the mappable world and beyond.",
