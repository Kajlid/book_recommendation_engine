  "description": "Steve Huntington had a way of offering jobs that were too good to be true. Mark Huntington made offers too good to turn down. Sedona had a habit of being caught in the middle; somewhere in the proximity of bad guys with guns and family members she was trying to avoid. Good thing the latest case involved a hospital. Then again, not all hospital personnel were interested in the lasting health of the patientsâ€¦or that of their co-workers. Executive Sick Days is book three in the Sedona O'Hala series. Book one Executive Lunch. Book two Executive Retention.",
