  "description": "An unsentimental, unsparing and surprisingly funny account of cancer in the family. \"When my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, I joked that I couldn't decide between overeating and alcoholism as a coping strategy. My wife suggested I write about it instead. She is always right. I couldn't write a cloying, sentimental story of inspiring courage, so instead I wrote what was real to me -- fear, lust, annoyance, love, fatigue, resentment, existential terror, horror movies, alcohol and country music. It's not pretty, but it is real. I hope you like it\"",
