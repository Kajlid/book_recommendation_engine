  "title": "Suckered: The History of Sugar, Our Toxic Addiction, Our Power to Change",
  "description": "Suckered tracks the stealthy infiltration of one of America's greatest threats, a silent killer 10,000 years in the making-sugar. From Napoleon to Fidel Castro, sugar's role in transforming societies and defining national boundaries is explored and reveals the shocking truth of how sugar has come to saturate our diets. Dr. Eisenberg unveils this addictive toxin's ability to wreak havoc on our biological systems, from diabetes to cancer, heart disease to dementia, hypertension to obesity, and more. With a plan for the future to empower personal and nationwide change, Suckered provides insight into combating the nation's biggest addiction. Backed by extensive research from Dr. Eisenberg and Sandra Canosa, Suckered tells the story of how sugar became a dietary staple in societies all over the globe, and how a lack of government regulation allows it to dominate our food industries. Through well-established scientific research, a strong historical background, and interviews with several of Dr. Eisenberg's patients, the two authors establish exactly why sugar is the reason behind our declining public health and rising healthcare costs.",
