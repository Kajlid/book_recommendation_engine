  "description": "From Vampirella’s fiftieth anniversary to her very own series! She started as Vampirella’s lover and ended up a very powerful pawn of Vampi’s mother, Lilith. Along the way, Victory’s made new friends, seen countless horrors, been saddled with a demon’s ring that she can’t get rid of, encountered the ghost of an old friend, and opened too many dimensional gateways to count. Despite that, there’s so much that we don’t know about Victory, like what her childhood was like. Or what she’s been doing with her demon ring and the crazy powers it has granted. Or which old — well, foe wouldn’t exactly be the right word — is about to show up to cheer her on. From writer David F. Walker (Compass, Young Justice, Naomi) and artist Brett Weldele (The Beauty, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?).",
