  "description": "Bear Sshh...can you keep a secret? If you’re hiding in the dark, How long ‘til you leak it? If you really must tell all How far can we sweep it? If you lay down the gauntlet Can you make us leap it? You know who we are You know what we did Will you keep it to yourself Or will you lift the lid? Sshh...can you keep a secret?   Honey Psst…want to know a secret? It’s big, it’s bad, it’s ugly And I don’t think I can keep it If I tell and you find out Your wrath, you will heap it The tide will turn, you will learn And now you shall reap it I know who you are I know what you did Will I keep it to myself Or will I lift the lid Psst…want to know a secret?",
