  "description": "I’m the girl you hated in high school. You know, the one with the hot boyfriend, the college scholarship, the flawless skin, the perfect life. I go to the best parties. I hang out with the coolest people. And I don’t worry about a thing. I’m a star volleyball player, a two-time state champion. Life is good. Until I lose it all. A freak injury, and now I’m left fighting to hold on to everything I once knew. The only escape? Pretending to be someone else for a few hours everyday in the school play. Now I’m spending time with the people I once laughed at, and with each passing day, I’m growing more and more distant from the life I used to love. Russ Vincent is the play’s gorgeous male lead, a writer/singer/actor/whatever. He knows about Emma Thompson — everyone in school does — but when he meets her outside the auditorium, he realizes she’s someone who knows what she wants, but can’t seem to figure out what she needs. Can Russ figure out how to show Emma where she needs to go to find a life worth living? Or will Emma run back to the safety of a life she’s always known?",
