From first words to high school halls, our childhood years braided a bond that wove in a direction neither of us could predict or outgrow. He was completely off-limits. But forbidden became a word we ignored. It wasn’t that we didn’t care. It was that we cared too much to let go.We had it all planned out. We just needed to keep our secret until college. We thought we could make it. We thought we’d been careful. But all we’d managed to do was prolong the inevitable.Our destruction. Years later, he’s back in town. He’s changed, grown colder, and he’s determined to rub salt in our wounds until I bleed anew…An angsty and emotional forbidden romance standalone with heat and a happily ever after.",
