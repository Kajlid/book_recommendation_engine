  "title": "Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies",
  "description": "D-Day, 6 June 1944, was a victory of arms. But it was also a triumph for a different kind of operation: one of deceit, aimed at convincing the Nazis that Calais and Norway, not Normandy, were the targets of the 150,000-strong invasion force.The deception involved every branch of Allied wartime intelligence, but at its heart was a team of five double agents, one of the oddest military units ever assembled: a bisexual Peruvian playgirl, a Polish fighter pilot, a Serbian seducer, a Spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming, and a Frenchwoman whose love for her pet dog nearly wrecked the entire operation.These were not conventional warriors, but their masterpiece of deceit saved countless lives, and Double Cross is their story.",
