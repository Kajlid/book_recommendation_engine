  "description": "When an unknown virus that turns humans into flesh-eating zombies begins to spread, a small island community in Lake Huron offers a potential refuge from the unfolding apocalypse. Isolation, organization, and cooperation are difficult to maintain, so survivors also need to learn how to defend themselves against a horrific enemy that can survive seemingly fatal wounds.Zombie Crusade Snapshots are quick glimpses of critical locations around the world as the zombie pandemic detailed in the Zombie Crusade series begins to unfold. While the snapshots connect to the main storyline of the novels (some in obvious ways, others in ways that will become more apparent as the series continues), they may also be read as stand-alone novellas.",
