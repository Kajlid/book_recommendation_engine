  "title": "Shadowbosses: Government Unions Control America and Rob Taxpayers Blind",
  "description": "The labor union movement is now firmly entrenched in American government--federal, state, and local--and is hell-bent on expanding its sway over the nation's political and economic life. This densely researched, compellingly argued book exposes how public-sector unions and their leaders--the \"shadowbosses\" of the title--are destroying the rule of law, stealing elections, degrading government services, paralyzing public education, and pushing the United States into a grim future of insolvency and decline. Authors Mallory and Elizabeth Factor disturbingly reveal the unions' plan to exert control over Social Security and disability recipients, veterans, and every other group that receives government money. A chilling expos√©, SHADOWBOSSES is also a call to citizen action against those who really hold the power in America today.",
