When she's sent to the wrong time entirely, Aila knows she's been played. She knows she should return to her own time and give Donell a piece of her mind... One the other hand, what's the rush when an undeniably handsome Scot crosses her path?Finn Keeley, Lord Rossmore, has no time for a new assistant. Especially one as sassy and bonny as the fiery redhead who'd come to fill the role.

He cannot let Aila divert him from his purpose now...even though she's the most passionate distraction he's ever known.As far as Aila Marshall was concerned, a good man was hard to find and love even harder. Fairy tales and white knights were nothing more than a myth. Despite her best friend finding a man in the past to steal her heart, Aila has no intention of following in BrontÃ«'s footsteps. She's content to indulge in the smoldering desire she shares with Finn while she solves her mystery. Nothing more. Until more is all Aila desires.",
