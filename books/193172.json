  "title": "Husband Fur Hire",
  "description": "Elyse Abram is desperate. On the wrong side of a relationship with a man who has lost his mind, she’s making big changes, starting with being utterly done with love. But life on her Alaskan homestead is too hard to handle alone, so she’s got a plan. Hire a husband. No romance, no emotions, just a marriage certificate that will tie an able-bodied man to her. But when a strapping giant of a man shows up on her doorstep and gives her all the right answers, leaving romance off the table might prove harder than she thought. Too bad the growl in her new helpmate’s throat and his careful way with explanations have her thinking she’s stepped into something much bigger than she bargained for.  Dominant grizzly shifter, Ian Silver, has a job to do. One of the local werewolves is on a violent bender, and as a shifter enforcer, Ian has an order to put him down. But when his mark begs him to check on the woman he hurt, Ian can’t help his curiosity. One meeting with Elyse and his shock nearly doubles him over. A husband for hire? Hell no. Forget his protective instincts and his inability to stay away from the beguiling woman. He would make a terrible mate and besides…what Elyse doesn’t know about him could kill her.  A full-length first book in T. S. Joyce’s brand new Bears Fur Hire series.  Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
