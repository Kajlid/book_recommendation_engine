  "description": "As a political journalist, Kate Winters is no stranger to stepping behind enemy lines. But putting her faith in the wrong informant lands her in a Kosovo jail controlled by rebel forces. She knows she’ll be tortured and beaten until they’ve asked their fill of questions… but she soon learns that it’s not the low-ranking guards she should fear the most. They’re nothing compared to their leader — dangerous, sinfully sexy, Adam. His purpose?  Extract information from her by any means necessary.",
