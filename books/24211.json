  "title": "Breve Historia de la guerra del 98",
  "description": "This book looks to analyze and understand the reasons that led to the outbreak of this war, the global event that caused Spain to lose its last colonial territories in the Americas and in Asia. For example, the book uses vast historical details and records to talk about the background events - the sinking of the Maine - that pushed the US to war and about the naval battles that were decisive in determining the outcome of the transnational confrontation. This work also examines the disastrous decision-making of Spanish politicians of the time who, by the period between 1891 and 1895, had allowed 85% of total Cuban exports to go directly towards the United States. Authors Miguel del Rey and Carlos Canales provide battle maps to help us relive the individual conflicts and, consequently, understand this war in its full scope",
