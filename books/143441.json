But I’m the daughter of Venus, and I was always meant for more.When a hunter targets legendaries like me, stealing their power and leaving them for dead, I’m pulled back to the world of gods and magic. Somehow the attacks are linked to a human girl called Fray—a girl who makes my heart race unlike anyone before.Fray doesn’t know anything about the legendary world, but somehow, impossibly, she has magic of her own. And her mysterious power could get all of us killed.READ THE ENTIRE LEGEND MIRROR Book 1: The Beast of CallaireBook 2: The Dryad of CallaireBook 3: The Powers of CallaireBook 4: The Divine of Callaire",
