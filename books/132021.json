  "description": "Amanda Taylor has given up her life as a high flyer and celebrity to become a full time sub. The next step seems the obvious one, to become a ponygirl. However, in the hands of the Power Play people, this is far more than she ever dreams. She is turned into a ponygirl, her vocal cords are paralysed, her life reduced to that of a pony/workhorse and body to be taken at will by all. She finds this to be the perfect life for her and falls willingly into all that is done to her.",
