  "description": "After a lifetime of taking care of everyone around him, Lout prepares to take on even more responsibility. A chance meeting at a friend's house introduces him to a beautiful woman he can't get off his mind. He wants her, but can she handle all the problems and responsibilities that come with being a part of his life? Experience has shown Willow that there are very few people who will stick around for the long haul. The only ones that she can rely on are her family, and even a few of those have gone away forever. When she meets Lout, she sees a side of him that no one has noticed before. She sees a man who never had many reasons to laugh, had a horrible childhood and the responsibility of raising his siblings. Willow wants to be the reason he smiles. Forever. Circumstances force Lout and Willow to lean on each other and become a team quicker than either of them imagined it would happen. Life is an adventure, but will they make it through together?",
