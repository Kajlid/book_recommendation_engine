Now, months into his ordeal, he's called in to investigate the mysterious death of beloved music professor, Emma Gagnon. It doesn't look like murder... until someone breaks into Emma's office and another body turns up.  Lawrence and his partner, Sohm, find themselves drawn into a complex web involving a missing girl, drugs, a popular author, a disappointed man, a grieving widower, a driven student with a past, a drug ring, and a killer who will strike again.  But as the body count rises and the case takes on new and disturbing twists, everyone including Michael is beginning to wonder: has the consummate professional finally lost perspective?",
