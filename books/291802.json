  "description": "The Executioner Knights are back! Alexander de Sherrington seeks to marry a daughter of the great Christopher de Lohr (Rise of the Defender). But not if King John has anything to say about it!  Alexander de Sherrington, the man affectionately referred to as ‘Sherry’ by his friends, is off on the greatest adventure of his life… and his target is Lady Christin de Lohr.  Lovely and vivacious, Christin is as head-strong as her mother but born with her father’s innate sense of politics. She fostered in the finest homes and proved herself to be smart, intuitive, and calm under pressure. Unbeknownst to her father, William Marshal recruited Christin into his network of spies and even as she serves a de Lohr ally, the House of de Winter, as a lady in waiting for Lady de Winter, she completes missions at the Marshal’s directive.  Enter Alexander de Sherrington.  He is intrigued with the beautiful new spy, and he and Christin are thrown together due to necessity. But Alexander soon realizes there is something very special about the daughter of Christopher de Lohr. As a romance blossoms, King John has his own plans for Christin – marrying her to his bastard son to undermine Christopher’s power.  The only one who can stop the marriage is Christin herself.  Join Alexander and Christin, Christopher and David, and the rest of the Marshal and de Lohr allies in this epic adventure of intrigue and romance that pushes the bonds of trust between allies. It’s Medieval Mayhem in 13th Century England!",
