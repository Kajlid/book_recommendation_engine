Fans and critics alike hailed it for its power, its thrills, and its gripping style, and recognized Ketchum as a master of suspense. Now, Jack Ketchum is back to frighten us again with…Red!It all started with a simple act of brutality. Three boys shot and killed an old man’s dog. No reason, just plain meanness. But the dog was the best thing in the old man’s world, and he wasn’t about to let it pass. He wanted justice, and he’d make sure the kids paid for what they did, even if it cost him his life. They picked the wrong old man to mess with. And as the fury and violence escalate, they’re about to learn that…the hard way.",
