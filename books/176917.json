  "description": "Get ready for the new three R' Resist, Revolt, Rewild More than ever, people are longing for deep and meaningful change. Another world is not only possible; it is essential. Yet despite our creative and determined efforts to attain social justice and ecological sustainability, our global crises continue to deepen. In Drinking Molotov Cocktails with Gandhi , bestselling author Mark Boyle argues that our political and economic system has brought us to the brink of climate catastrophe, ransacking ecosystems and unravelling communities for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many. He makes a compelling case that we must \"rewild\" the political landscape, as history teaches us that positive social change has always been wrought by movements prepared to use any means available. The time has come for pacifists, revolutionaries, and freedom fighters to work together for the creation of a world worth sustaining. Eloquent, visionary and beautifully written, this incendiary manifesto strikes at the heart of the world's crises and reframes our understanding of how to solve them, signaling a turning point in our journey towards an ecologically just society. The three R's of the climate change generation-reduce, reuse, and recycle-are long overdue for an upgrade. Welcome to resist, revolt, rewild.",
