  "description": "Dart and Dash Terrance are more than twin brothers, best friends, and college football starters; they are as opposite as night and day.Dart was more than a running back with his nose in a book. He was also head over heels in love with his long-term girlfriend, Daisy Bowlings. On top of trying to spend time with her, study, and be the best player he can be, he has to keep an eye on his man-whore brother. Dart did everything he could to to keep everyone peaceful and happy.Dash played wide receiver and studied when he needed to, but was more interested in the females around campus. Dash would do anything for his brother and he even tolerated his annoying girlfriend. His focus was to be a professional football player and he’ll do anything to make it happen.Daisy and Garnet Bowlings are two sisters who are not best friends, and have a hard time seeing eye-to-eye.Daisy fell in love with Dart the first time they met. She has her life, along with his, completely planned out and she even knew what was best for her little sister, Garnet, since their mother died. Daisy wanted her one and only goal to be with Dart.Garnet doesn’t want to be anything like Daisy. She wanted to be her own person and if it meant she had to attend parties, drinking alcohol and flirting, then she’ll do it. She didn’t want to appeal to the normal status of college. Garnet wanted to be her rebellious self.Growing up is hard enough, but add college life,family life, trying to find yourself, football, studying, and it even becomes more complex. Who will survive it?** this is for 18+ readers. There is underage drinking, sex, and strong language.**",
