Corrections and addenda are also available online.The cover conveys the inequalities in human development of a changing world. The dots in different colors represent the complex and multidimensional nature of these inequalities. The shadow of the climate crisis and sweeping technological change, evoked by the color of the cover background that suggests heat, will shape progress in human development in the 21st century.",
