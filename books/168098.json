  "description": "Wallflower, Conner Stonebrooke, would rather be left alone to read about the werewolves and other creatures rumored to roam the forests near his college dorm.  Instead, he is assigned a much more frightening task: interviewing the star football player, Gage Lockwood. Gage isn’t just a star– he’s also Conner’s crush. Tall, dark, and undeniably handsome, Gage’s perfect body and bad boy attitude keep Conner both aroused and at bay.  However, Gage is a notorious recluse shrouded with secrecy– and the closer Conner gets to him, the more mysterious things begin to happen.  Werewolves and Wallflowers is a hot new gay paranormal, erotic romance between a geeky guy and his muscular, jock crush. Adult Content Warning: Contains explicit scenes, language, and themes indented for a mature audience that enjoys man on man erotic fiction.",
