  "description": "Everyone knows that Santa and his elves wrap the most beautiful presents. But have you ever gotten a present that’s…not? Too much tape? Not enough paper? A ribbon that just doesn't curl? Well there's a story behind those presents. The story of one very special elf, two big hands, and an even bigger dream. Ham Hands the Christmas Elf is a quirky, laugh-out-loud tale that helps wrapping-impaired parents explain why everything isn't always picture perfect underneath the Christmas tree - and why you should do what you love, even when you're not the best at it.",
