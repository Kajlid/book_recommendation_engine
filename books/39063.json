  "description": "\"Wet Matches: A Novel\" is an inspiring and uplifting story about five homeless 'throwaway' teens getting a second chance at a better life when a young couple on a high school reunion trip rescues them and takes them on a cross-country journey to their new home in sunny California. 'Wet Matches' is about friendships, and it asks the question, \"How far would you go for a friend?\" Fifteen years of separation didn't stop Crystal from being there for Jalan. What Crystal did for Jalan will inspire us all to take a closer look at our own relationships and friendships...Could you still laugh knowing that death was possibly lurking around the corner? Meet five free-spirited teens: Shelly, Robbie, Josie, Micky and Cole, who will inspire you to enjoy every second of your life. Shelly is pregnant. Robbie plays guitar. Josie's a little confused. Micky likes cars. Cole's a little shy. Some people called them useless. They were told to get out of town. Some people said that they were about as good as wet matches...but Jalan, Crystal and Jack thought otherwise. If you had ever been ridiculed, bullied, mocked...or if someone had ever made you feel like you was good for nothing or worthless then Randolph Randy Camp's award-winning 'Wet Matches: A Novel' is a story for you. Without being preachy-but yet-entertaining, 'Wet Matches' takes a fresh contemporary look at America's ever-increasing youth runaway and teen homeless problems. 'WET MATCHES' is a Quarter-Finals Winner of The Writers Network 14th Annual Screenplay and Fiction Competition.",
