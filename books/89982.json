  "description": "'Chasing Fears' the first instalment of 'A Broken Paradise'. Awen finally escapes from the family home, from her initial fears and spontaneously decides she's going on a self-discovery mission to America, where her childhood holidays took her and she met her friends. But the moment she leaves her home, with her poor teenage sister Dylis, she's faced with danger and utter terror as it seems there really was a reason her family kept her so secret and it wasn't because of her many gifts that were unnatural to human's such as you or I, it was because Awen is being hunted by beings we can't even begin to grasp, understand, comprehend. And to accomplish any of that you'd also have to believe that they not only exist, but they are human, their far more human than you or I, that the possibility that you and I aren't what we thought, that maybe we're the Aliens of this planet and not Awen and her kind.... In any case, she'll go searching to find out what her family have kept from her, her whole life!. \"Ooh!, and do you wanna know what Jesus was really protecting you from?\"",
