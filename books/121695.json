  "title": "The Song of the Cypress",
  "description": "Annie sets out to make a better life for herself in a mystical, timelessly beautiful Tuscan valley. Intrigued by Joe, her American neighbour and strangely drawn to the ancient cypress which protects her new home, she begins to stretch the boundaries of her world. Her inner journey is guided by the cypress and by its old guardian Fiammetta, who the locals believe to be a witch.Let the cypress reveal the secrets of its song, in a story that will enchant you and surprise you with its power.“The rough bark of the cypress beneath my fingers and Fiammetta’s calloused hand in mine felt almost the same and there was a strange energy in the air that seemed to run through us all as if we were part of a single entity. I closed my eyes and leant back, feeling the connection run through me. Blood and sap flowing together. The power was incredibly strong and beneath it a sound like a low hum, a sound that could have been a small insect buzzing in the grass, or the breeze among the dry needles at our feet, or the clouds gathering in the sky. It could even have been time itself, humming as it glided inexorably within our cells”",
