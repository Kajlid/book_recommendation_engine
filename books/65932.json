  "title": "The Unfinished Garden",
  "description": "A successful software developer, James has thrown himself into a new goal — to finally conquer the noise in his mind. And he has a plan. He'll confront his darkest fears and build something beautiful...a garden. When he meets Tilly Silverberg, he knows she holds the key — even if she doesn't think so. After her husband's death, gardening became Tilly's livelihood and her salvation. Her thriving North Carolina business and her young son, Isaac, are the excuses she needs to hide from the world. So when oddly attractive, incredibly tenacious James arrives on her doorstep, demanding she take him on as a client, her answer is a flat ‘no'. When a family emergency lures Tilly back to England, she's secretly glad. With Isaac in tow, she retreats to her childhood village, which has always stayed obligingly the same. Until now. Her best friend is keeping secrets. Her mother is plotting. Her first love is unexpectedly, temptingly available. And then James appears on her doorstep. Away from home, James and Tilly begin to forge an unlikely bond, tenuous at first but taking root every day. And as they work to build a garden together, something begins to blossom between them — despite all the reasons against it.",
