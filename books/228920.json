  "description": "Gregory \"Knuckles\" O'Shay is a man trying to make two halves into a whole. He's the clown, the tension breaker, and the designated assassin for the Red Rebels MC of Markham, California. He'll kill you as easily as he makes you laugh, if his president wills it. The club is his family, the only people he'd put his life on the line for. A new assignment requires Knuckle's deadly expertise, but this task that is supposed to buy protection for his club is twisting his conscience.  Danielle Prince is the new coroner in Markham County, poised to take over when the previous long-serving coroner retires. Her life is as simple as she can make it, and revolves completely around her daughters and her work. Living next door to a Red Rebel has never given her pause until she meets Knuckles O'Shay, and watches as her youngest daughter makes friends with the biker over the building of a new motorcycle.  With Knuckles, Danielle finds a new measure of exhilaration that she had thought she could live without, but she has to decide whether to open her family to this new experience, whether to take that risk.  With the Prince family, Knuckles finds a new measure of contentment. As he tries to pass off his wet work as just another club duty, the draw of a traditional family makes him question why some lives are easily taken, while others leave a deep mark.",
