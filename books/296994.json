  "description": "RavageAs president of the Untamed Sons MC, I'm no stranger to pain, but three years ago Sasha broke my heart and put another black mark against my soul. Even the mention of her name is enough to bring my demons out to play. I still don't know what happened, but what I do know is she walked out on me, the club, and the future we were working towards without a backwards glance. I should have known she wouldn't stay gone.SashaLeaving Rav was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, but I didnâ€™t have a choice. Staying and facing my past wasn't an option. I suffered through hell, but I'm stronger than I've ever been, at least I was until my daughter got sick. Now, the only person left who might be able to save her is her father. Only, I have no idea who it is. Ravage, or his brother, Sin.*Warning : Contains adult content, reading age 18 +. Graphic violence and dark emotional scenes that may trigger some readers.",
