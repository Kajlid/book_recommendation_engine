  "description": "Michael has never put much stock in clich√©s, but there's one he probably should have listened to: You can never go home again. His family assures him that plenty of young people take a few semesters off between high school and college, that a year of travel is practically a prerequisite nowadays. Somehow Michael's neglected to mention he's not just driving around aimlessly, stopping only to have sex with his chain-smoking boyfriend--he's hunting vampires. After a disastrous family reunion, Michael unearths a vampire commune where he and Wild Bill can settle down. But Michael is the only human in residence, and the other vampires can't stop themselves from sniffing around him. In the words of Wild Bill, \"This can't be good.\"",
