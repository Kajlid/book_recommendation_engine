  "description": "Four middle-aged men form a Three Tenors/Il Divo-style operatic singing group as a diversion from the idiocy of 9-5 life.They meet a mysterious impresario, Ximena Terreblanche, who takes them to instant, worldwide stardom. Ximena’s song choices stray from the usual syrupy crap served up by the genre. She loves songs of meaninglessness, betrayal, deception and death (To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before, Eye in the Sky, All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You).Disaster follows wherever they Sunrise TV hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage incinerated in a studio fire; an encephalitis outbreak in London; terrorist attacks and civil war in France; locust plagues in China.When it's made into a Hollywood blockbuster the tagline will \"The End of the World Has Never Been So Much Fun!\" One of those good-book-but-terrible-film situations.",
