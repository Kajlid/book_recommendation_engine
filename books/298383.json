  "title": "The Night of the Lights",
  "description": "The Webster's dictionary defines \"mind\" as \"the part of a person that thinks, reasons, feels, understand, and remembers.\" The beautiful thing about children is that their minds are open to so many possibilities. They naturally problem solve, and discover solutions where adults often get stuck. This is the principle behind the series Little Mind Books. We explore problems and find creative solutions. Our goal is to inspire children to explore for themselves, not only in seeing themselves in the characters, but to feel like they are part of the adventures. In the Night of the Lights we join Sam on an adventure with Grandma \"Gigi\" to discover what the lights are in her garden. What Sam discovers is better than magic, it is real. Sam learns a lesson in problem solving, and also learns the importance of respecting the natural habitat of earth's creatures. Join us with your children in discovering this real magic, it may spark adventure in your own backyard!",
