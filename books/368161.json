He wants someone just like him - a nice guy he can build a nice, simple, uneventful life with. He's hoping that's just the sort of man who will answer his internet ad.Donovan's nothing like Craig. He's all about leather, fast cars and relationships that last hours rather than years. They may work at neighbouring desks, and Craig may have a crush on his colleague, but that doesn't mean he should forget about the kind of man he's sure will make him happy in the long run.The only trouble with internet ads is you never know who will answer them...Reader Advisory: The stories in this collection are linked solely by theme. Each story can be read on its own and the stories can be read in any order.",
