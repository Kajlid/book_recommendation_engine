  "description": "I had always been the type of girl that followed the rules. “Stick to the plan, Kat,” is what I always told myself. I was never a risk taker or chanced anything to fate. That’s until I was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. All of my hopes, dreams, and aspirations fell by the wayside. I was dying. What else did I have to look forward to? Definitely not love.That’s until Lee Daniels came tapping at my window.Determined to push him away, the jerk kept coming back, over and over and over. There was no way I was going to give my heart to a man that would eventually leave me worse then I already was.But he didn’t see it that way.He saw strength, determination and a stubborn woman ready to give up on love.Why wouldn’t he just let me give up? For one very simple reason.Love, my friends.An unimaginable love. A love that didn’t require rules, stipulations, or even expectations. A love filled with dancing on Mardi Gras floats, three a.m. breakfast sessions and swimming with pigs in the Bahamas. That’s my kind of love, and it all started with a stupid paper crane.Perhaps it was time to take chances because…If not now, then when?",
