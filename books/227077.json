  "description": "There are reasons we fear the night. He might finally be one of them. A goddess returned, a war between primal powers, and a prophecy to fulfill. That's a lot of crap to heap on anyone's plate, much less a former game programmer from Brooklyn. But that's exactly what Bill Ryder - gamer, geek, and legendary vampire - has to deal with. Half his friends are missing and those that are left are mired in chaos. Sadly, Armageddon isn’t about to give them a breather. The White Mother, a vile evil from the distant past, is amassing her forces to exterminate all who stand in her way - be they human, vampire, or other. Bill and his buddies need to find a way to stop her, while also keeping the other supernatural factions from tearing the world asunder.It’s finally time for Bill to master his powers, sort out his relationship woes, and figure out how to survive his date with destiny. Because if he can’t get his act together, the curtain will fall and mankind will be forever plunged into everlasting darkness. ---------- The Last Coven is the grand finale of the bestselling Tome of Bill saga, an urban fantasy series with a nasty overbite. If you like gory fight scenes, dorky humor, and Bigfoot-sized action, then you'll love Rick Gualtieri's latest installment in this kick-butt vampire series for the 21st century adult.",
