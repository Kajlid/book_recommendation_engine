  "title": "The Gift of Ben: Loving through Imperfection",
  "description": "On a hot, New England summer day in 2014, tragedy befell author Lindsey Rogers-Seitz and her family when her husband inadvertently left their fifteen-month-old son, Benjamin, in the back seat of their car all day where he then passed away from the heat. With raw emotion and grit, Lindsey chronicles the aftermath of her son's death in this debut memoir as she and her husband explore the intricacies of unimaginable pain, love, and the challenges of forgiveness on the other side of broken. She skillfully weaves in her personal experiences with manic depression and the mutual support and love found throughout her marriage. Aside from overwhelming grief and loss, the family also had to deal with the media and public scrutiny due to the emotionally-charged and highly politicized nature of Ben's death. We learn of their grueling journey navigating the legal system and battles with child protective services, through which Lindsey was profiled and discriminated against due to her history with mental illness. After years of reflection and healing, Lindsey finds her path to self-acceptance, as the love she found in her son's life gives her the power to, in turn, love herself. That is the love of a son for his mother-the gift of Ben.",
