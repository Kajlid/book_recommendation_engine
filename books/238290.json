  "description": "Being bad never felt so good... Everything in my office is off-limits. Making a charity calendar of the hot guys on your floor? Not allowed. Shrinking your boss' underwear when he sends it for dry-cleaning? Can't do that either. But those things keep the natural balance. See, Avery Banks, our resident rising star, is a shark. The tall, blond, and gorgeous kind with zero patience and even less forgiveness. Good thing I'm the Mae West of executive assistants. I live to put grown men in their place.\nHe wasn't supposed to find out.\nNow he's made it his personal mission to screw me the way I screwed him. OK. Not exactly the way I screwed him..Avery's new game is hot. Messy. Twisted.But he's my boss. And what we're doing is strictly NSFW. Luckily, Avery and I have one thing in common.We both suck at following the rules. NSFW is a fresh, modern twist on office romance from bestselling author Piper Lawson.",
