  "title": "The Rock Star in Seat 3A",
  "description": "Following her hilarious bestselling volume of humorous reflections on life, love, and whatever ( Sometimes I Feel Like a Nut ), Jill Kargman makes a triumphant return to the world of fiction with The Rock Star in Seat 3A . The author of The Ex-Mrs Hedgefund , Arm Candy , and Momzillas delights with this smart and sassy modern-day fairy tale romance…with a twist. The story of a woman whose most cherished romantic fantasy comes true—at the possible expense of everything else in her life—when she finds herself seated right next to a rock ’n’ roll demigod on a business flight from New York to Los Angeles, The Rock Star in Seat 3A is fresh, funny, and outrageously entertaining women’s fiction that will strike a loud power chord with fans of Lauren Weisberger and Jennifer Weiner.",
