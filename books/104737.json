Enter Alexandra Anderson--the last woman he should ever work with, but the only woman who can help. Gabe and Alex have always been a lethal combination, and with so much at stake for them both, failure is not an option. Can they ignore the powerful attraction between them in order to maintain their professionalism...or is it only a matter of time before the cork is popped on their passion?",
