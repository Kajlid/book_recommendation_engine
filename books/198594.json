  "description": "A wild, quirky, and truly original project that delighted fans of Sam Kieth’s previous work on The Maxx, Zero Girl is the story of a high-school misfit coming of age. Young Amy Smootster, weirdness magnet that she is, has never been the most popular girl in school. She can speak to insects and believes that circles are good and squares evil. Awkward and different, she doesn’t quite fit into any social circle, and she likes it that way. But strange things seem to happen when Amy is around, the spontaneous appearance of puddles of water for instance, and it has made her the target of relentless bullies. With the aid of a sympathetic guidance counselor whom she develops a mad crush on, Amy explores the meaning of her surreal abilities and discovers her place in the world.",
