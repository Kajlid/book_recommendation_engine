  "description": "When Emily Bishop is knocked unconscious by a rogue football on her first day, she knows high school won’t be easy. Sure, she has the money and a beautiful best friend, but Emily fears she’s genetically destined for dorkdom. In her first couple weeks of high school, Emily suffers a very public puke episode, a near-death experience involving a drunken Neanderthal in the shallow end of a swimming pool and the ultimate date from hell, resulting in rumors that would make a hooker blush. On top of everything else, Emily is forced to confront the division that has grown between her and her best friend and when the two go their separate ways, Emily is left to navigate the social “statusphere” of high school on her own. With rumors swirling and her reputation on the line, there’s only one way to prove her innocence…naked burglary.",
