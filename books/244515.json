  "description": "Detective Scott Hawkins and his partner, Detective Stacy Davis, Chicago PD, land a gruesome case. Three women, shredded with a wood chipper, are recovered in a plastic tub full of bleach. The same strength of bleach they have seen connected to other murders in the city, which speaks serial killer. When their investigation leads to several quick dead ends, a reporter they have ties to brings them an intriguing yet disturbing theory -a cabal of police and alderman in the city are intentionally killing minorities and making profits off of the drugs they take. Dismissed as outlandish, the detectives stumble onto an unintentional clue during the course of their investigation that the theory may in fact be correct. Worse yet, Scott’s own twin brother may be involved. When Stacy’s wife Mia goes missing, is it the serial killer with another victim or the cabal trying to shut down their investigation?",
