  "description": "When Richard Slater receives a letter of complaint from one of his constituents, a Margaret Hayton, he merely responds with his standard letter of empty promises. Clearly, this woman is insane and must be avoided at all costs. But she will not be dismissed so easily, and when Richard finally sets eyes on the \"twenty-something vision in stone-washed denim,\" he risks losing his heart, his head, and quite possibly his political career.",
