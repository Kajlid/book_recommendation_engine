  "description": "My SEAL training gave me confidence and the strength to take on any challenge... Except her... I carried her picture through the mud, the live fire training, the punishment and the long lonely nights. She's the one girl I can never have. The only woman I could truly love. I'm heading home now, but I can't help but wonder what she would think of me, her stepbrother, if she only knew...  To hell with the rules. I'm coming home, and I'm going to make her mine.",
