  "description": "Who knew pretending could be so hot?Clark: It started as a joke. After all, I’d never pretend to date a woman just to get my mom and sister off my back.I would, however, pretend to date her to get her ex-husband off hers.Now the two of us, the wilderness warrior and the wedding planner, are stuck sharing a very small tent. I had no idea how fast things would heat up in here, or how hard it would be to keep my hands—among other things—to myself.I also didn’t guess how quickly the news of our “relationship” would spread to my big, nosy family.We can’t “break up” yet, because she’s planning my brother’s wedding and I’m his best man. Through venue visits, DIY disasters, and Vegas trips, we’re thrown together, and the chemistry’s off-the-charts. But the kicker is, I feel like she gets me.Maybe that’s what scares me the most. I’m still reeling from the loss of my wife, and she’s still hurting from her ex’s betrayal. There’s no way this can ever be real.But what if I’m starting to hope it is?",
