  "description": "Caden was a Foster; the most respected, most influential family in the county and one of the most prestigious in the state. Royce was the nephew of the town drunk, a boy no one expected to amount to anything. That hadn't kept them from a friendship that had deepened into love. Ten years ago, Caden had followed his father's expectations rather than his heart - and he'd regretted it every day since. But now Royce is back in town, and Caden has a second chance for the life – and love – he's always wanted.",
