  "title": "The White House Mess",
  "description": "At last, a White House reminiscence that pulls no punches! Herbert Wadlough, personal assistant to President N. Tucker (TNT), offers his unique and utterly self-serving inside view of the historic years 1989-1993 of the ill-fated Tucker administration, in which he played such a crucial role. From the inauguration crisis--when President Reagan refused to vacate the White House--to the epochal War on Bermuda, to the delicate negotiations (sexual, for the most part) between the President and his First Lady, Wadlough gives an account that is open, honest, and hilarious.",
