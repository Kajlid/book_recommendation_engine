  "description": "In an attempt to go after the truth, Caitlin Moore runs into a very unnerving predicament, not knowing who or what to believe. Caitlin Moore is about to uncover the story of her career when she realizes she has put herself into a dangerous, life-threatening situation. Will the mysterious Damon Beckstead believe in her innocence or will he think she's a part of the scheme, as well?Glimpse of the Heart is a clean romance that shows that sometimes using the intuition of a heart is the best way to discern the truth.A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.
