One hot summer, he broke my heart in the worst way, and I promised myself then and there that I would never fall prey to the sinner of Pembroke Prep again. Even if it meant re-inventing myself into a girl I barely recognized.There is a fine line between duty and desire.I'm not just any girl, I'm a princess. When my family begs me to get engaged to save the family name, I'm trapped with no way out. In a panic, I blurt out the ultimate lie and create myself a fake boyfriend. Which means I need someone to foot the bill immediately.The problem? The only person willing to help me is the one person I never want to see again: the careless, heartless, hot-as-Hellfire playboy himself.Phineas Yates.The even bigger problem? His help doesn't come for free. And this sinner won't be satisfied with anything less than my absolute ruin.",
