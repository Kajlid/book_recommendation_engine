  "title": "Farewell, Everything",
  "description": "In a world waking from a dark age, a young musician finds himself thousands of miles from home, covered in bruises, and falling in love.And it’s only downhill from there.Chronically clueless and incurably naïve, runaway street performer Osha Oloreben has known his share of hard knocks – but none like those he’s dealt in the city of Valena. Dragged into war and battered by disease, Osha unwittingly trades his life for a fever dream of half-truths and hidden realms. Helped and hindered by a cast of mystics, rebels, and ghosts, he struggles to reclaim his body, his identity, and reality itself – before it’s too late.With humor and horror in equal measure, ‘Farewell, Everything’ delves into the dissolution of a transforming mind. Stumbling through the stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance – our unlikely hero braves the surreal landscapes of love, loss, and death, from which no one emerges unchanged.",
