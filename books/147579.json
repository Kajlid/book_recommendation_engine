It follows him through his battles with Julius Caesar, and his need to triumph over adversity.

No easy task; there are many obstacles to overcome before the tribes will acquiesce with his desire for war - after all, Getorix is just nineteen when he first appeals to the tribal leaders for their loyalty, a loyalty not forthcoming from his own uncle, Gobannito. Against the odds, Getorix unites his nation’s disparate tribes, and together they make war on Caesar and his legions. Getorix’ army chases the depleted legions all the way to the mountains. But he decides not to pursue; instead, he turns his army around to winter in the fortress town of Alesia. This is a mistake; Caesar turns his army and follows. Caesar builds a wooden wall around the town, “imprisoning” Getorix’ army. This leads to a dramatic and highly moving denouement, the siege of Alesia…",
