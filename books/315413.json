But then they find a mysterious music box filled with letters from a former resident of PTH, and together they set out to solve the mystery of who this girl was . . . and who she’s become. The investigation will bring them together, and what they find at the end might just bring them hope.From award-winning author Stephanie Kuehn comes a breathtaking tale of friendship and healing.
