  "description": "A tale of love after betrayal, A SAFE SURRENDER follows one young woman as she finds love and heals the scars carved into her soul. At twenty-two, Kamilla Reyes has survived the tragic loss of her mother, the foster system, physical and mental abuse—and Rhett. Once her savior, Rhett had become her prisoner. She knew Rhett inside out: his quirks, anger, impatience, and even the sting of his quick fist. There was no pain Kami thought she could not shoulder until, finally, Rhett crossed a line that couldn’t be uncrossed. Desperate for an escape, when a friend shows her an advert for a position at the Donnelley Ranch, Kami packs her bags and disappears. She wasn’t looking for romance, or even friendship. All she wanted was a safe place where she could lay her head each night, a home to call her own, and a steady wage. She found a whole lot more in Kyle Donnelley, one of four sons who work the Ranch alongside his parents. Before long, Kamilla is working alongside Kyle in the rock-climbing facility, falling ever so swiftly into friendship, she doesn’t realize until it’s too late that she’s also fallen in love. But can Kami find the strength to surrender herself to a good man after having lived the pain of standing beside a man with demons?",
