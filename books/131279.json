  "description": "Eve isn’t used to failure. Especially when it comes to her Errands, but that’s exactly where she finds herself waking up in a hospital bed, bruised and bloodied.  Not only has the Tucker Errand been derailed, Henry Callahan’s is about to do the same. When G informs Eve that the competition is moving in on Henry, she orders her to drop the Tucker Client and get back to Henry, forcing Eve to decide what’s more important: winning the big-time Errands, or keeping her promises to her small-time Clients. Whatever her answer, she knows one thing—she can’t succeed at both without threatening to fail everyone.    This is the fourth installment in a series of short stories (20,000-25,000 words) Installment #1: Mischief in Miami (currently available) Installment #2 Scandal in Seattle (currently available) Installment #3: Trouble in Tampa (currently available)",
