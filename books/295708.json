  "description": "The Naked Chef is for people who want great modern food but who also want things simple - people who work for a living, so haven't got time or energy to spend all night cooking. It is all about giving people confidence and getting them to feel at ease in the kitchen. This book presents recipes for different occasions, whether you want healthy food, portable grub, one-pot meals, ideas for cooking for two or with kids, or food that is as cheap as chips. As well as Jamie's favourite recipes, he looks at fridge friends (all the lovely, snacky things that can be kept in the fridge) and a chapter is dedicated to foody prezzies for Christmas and birthday surprises.",
