Using a newly developed technology, PSS tries a simulation process on Jo to restore her abilities, but during the attempt, PSS is hacked and a blacklist file containing some of PSS’s most sensitive secrets is stolen. Meanwhile, a mysterious caller who seems to know more than he should delivers a warning to Jo about Kai, who then goes missing.Despite her father’s concerns, Jo sets off on a risky trip to Tunisia with a PSS team of teen prodigies to find an urgently needed solution for PSS and locate Kai. All the while, Jo has to trust the mysterious informant who, frighteningly, is like no one she has ever met before.”Simulated has all the Mission Impossible action you could hope for, paired with a love triangle that rivals the intensity of Twilight’s. Be Prepared to choose sides and hold on tight. You’re in for one wild ride.—Chelsea Bobulski, author of The Wood and Remember Me",
