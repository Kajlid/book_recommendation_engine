  "description": "In a race against cosmic darkness, a celestial alchemist must protect the cradle of earthâ€™s mystic civilization. Atlantis, a bejeweled continent, fashioned by the ancient Lemurian race on a bed of crystalline wonders, teeters on the brink of untimely destruction. Here, the celestial astro-alchemist, Ariom, must don the fragile guise of a human form for the first time. Daunted by the realm of human needs and vulnerabilities, Ariom must navigate this alien terrain, a vivid tapestry of ancient traditions imbued with an undercurrent of impending doom.The peril that lurks in the shadows is no ordinary threat. It's coming from Mara - a maleficent Archangel with an appetite for destruction, hell-bent on proving the ephemeral impermanence of the Earth. Only a powerful set of tools hold the key to salvation - Andarean Orbs. Hidden amidst the sprawling splendor of Atlantis by Ariom himself eons ago, these orbs possess the pent-up potential to create or decimate worlds. For Ariom, the stakes are monumental. Should he fail, not only Earth, but the entire cosmic order could crumble under Mara's malevolence. Ensuring the safety of the orbs and foiling Mara's sinister scheme becomes an imperative not just to save Earth, but also to preserve the grand blueprint of universal evolution, as dictated by the wise Galactic Council.As the celestial clock ticks down, Mara is frighteningly close to completing a doomsday contraption, a black hole gate fashioned by the stolen Andarean Orbs. Time is in scarce supply for the lone astro-alchemist. Can Ariom rise above his newfound human frailties to embrace his cosmic purpose? Stand at the precipice of the planet's fate in Atlantis and the Seven Andarean Orbs, where the survival of terrestrial and celestial realms intertwines within the warp and weft of cosmic scheming.",
