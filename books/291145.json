  "description": "“It will take the whole night at least,” he said, “to implant all my eggs.”  The colony planet is a death trap. Only the tiniest fraction of humanity survives the gruesome rejection virus.  And then the aliens arrive.  The Nepenthe, too, seek a new home world, but discover instead a species capable of incubating their precious eggs: humans.  The two dying races can either reach an agreement to help each other live on … or prepare for extinction.   Publisher's Note: The We Are Nepenthe series contains tentacles, shapeshifting aliens and squirm-in-your-seat depravity. A one-click read for the seriously adventurous only.",
