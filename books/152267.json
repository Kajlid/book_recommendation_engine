  "description": "Pretending to be a couple may drive them crazy.Feisty mechanic Betty Smith should have only one thing on her mindâ€”catching the conman who swindled her mother. Not the sexy stranger who kissed her then completely disappeared. Undercover FBI agent Joe Carter needs to focus on the bad guy who got away, not the gorgeous headstrong brunette who watches too many cop shows and keeps interfering in his case. Unfortunately, catching their prey before he skips town means working together.But while entering the vintage car rally as a couple seemed like a good idea at the time, faking feelings for each other turns out to be the easiest part. Neither one can allow anything to get in their way, but staying away from each other is impossible. They both know, though, once their plan is complete, so is their time together.",
