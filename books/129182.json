  "description": "A prince.A ball.A glass slipper left behind at the stroke of midnight.The tale is told and retold, twisted and tweaked, snipped and stretched, as it leads to happily ever after.But it is not the true Story.A dark fortress.A past forgotten.A life of servitude.No one has ever broken free of the Godmother’s terrible stone prison until a girl named Pin attempts a breathless, daring escape. But she discovers that what seems to be freedom is a prison of another kind, one that entangles her in a story that leads to a prince, a kiss, and a clock striking midnight. To unravel herself from this new life, Pin must choose between a prince and another—the one who helped her before and who would give his life for her. Torn, the only thing for her to do is trade in the glass slipper for a sword and find her own destiny.",
