  "description": "Charity Powers is a young, intelligent woman that has left behind her predictable small town life, and even more predictable lover, to gamble on a fresh start in New York. She arrives with no leads or friends, just an armful of optimism and determination. When an attack at a local bar, a possible kidnapping attempt on her, is thwarted by a stranger, her life takes on an unforeseen turn.Gorgeous and overly-experienced Justin Collins saves Charity from her attacker, and continues to save her in many other ways. \"He's just the right mix of gentleman and caveman,” is how she describes him. He gives her exactly what she wants, and almost everything she needs, but his damaged past makes it impossible for him to commit.At a new job, she falls into an online relationship with JP, the company’s owner. She hasn’t seen him, but he fills the gaps of Justin’s absences and feeds a fire Justin left unattended.The return of her ex-lover exposes the dangerous secrets around her—one of these men has the power and connections to keep her safe at any cost, and the endless love for her to use this power or give it up to keep her.",
