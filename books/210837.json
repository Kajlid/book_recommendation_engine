  "title": "Bane County: Forgotten Moon",
  "description": "The large river-island of Bane County has a troubled past; but some histories are eagerly forgotten, especially those written in blood. Nestled into the foothills of the National Wildlife Refuge, the small rural town of Silver Canyon seems idyllic to most; but a long-slumbering evil is about to reawaken. Seventeen-year-old Bryce McNeel is your average teenage boy, living on a cattle ranch with his grandparents. Well, average genius, but he prefers to keep that fact to himself, no one likes a know-it-all. When Bryce learns of a series of grisly deaths and mutilations that occurred decades earlier, his curiosity gets the better of him. Together with his cousin Jackson, Bryce sets out to learn more about the macabre event; but as they delve deeper into the history and legends of Bane County, the two boys are horrified by what they find. Unfortunately, history has a way of repeating itself. As friends and neighbors begin to go missing, or worse, they find themselves embroiled in a battle for their young lives.",
