  "description": "From Scotland to East Anglia and internationally in Australia and America all ages are riveted by this story. The unique style of using the journey back to England as a frame to tell the deeper story is proving to be a great enticement to those of East Anglia as their acts of kindness are revealed. Helen Eadie, Member of the Scottish Parliament, writes in the forward \"Jon . . . provides insight into a way of life that is beyond most of our experiences\" \"From barren rocks . . . to living stones\" is an incident packed memoir that covers eighteen months in the teenage life of the author in the nineteen sixties. It is seen originally from a young person's perspective; and, as the writer matures and shares his experiences, in turn the reader gains from his reflections on the people and the places, beginning in Colonial era Aden, where he has lived. The book is a meditative postscript to the twentieth century bringing some perceptive insights. The story reveals a life that swings from the sadness to the times of joy, times of humour and times of thoughtfulness, times of tragedy and times of tenderness. The story faces the dual challenges of a western youth culture in a home in the East. Like wise there is the contrast of an Islamic and Christian culture side by side. However, deep concerns of middle eastern terrorism of the sixties also brings a topical aspect into the learning from the events as we begin the 21st century with strong concerns about the dangers of living with the threat of terrorism. This is the true story of one person's journey in life that brings lessons for so many in their own journey of life.",
