  "title": "Can I Come Over?",
  "description": "It all started with a sex scene…\nWell, I was failing to write a sex scene. As an author of over fifty smut books, I was struggling to do what I did best. So, for fun, I asked one of my best online friends for some help. I really shouldn’t have done that… He wrote the scene far better than I ever could, and seven months of platonic, yet-flirty friendship were wiped away in ten minutes. He asked to meet me in person… We’d previously agreed to keep things digital, to remain faceless friends—since he was forty-two, and I was twenty-six, but neither of us could resist. When I saw him at the airport, I was instantly attracted to him. But I knew, right then and there, that we could never be. It turns out that the man I’d been talking to for the past several months was the last person I expected. The last person I should ever think about… He’s my dad’s best friend.",
