  "title": "Jillybean's First Adventure",
  "description": "This is the first novella starring Jillybean and Ipes. These side adventures occurred randomly throughout the first 10 book series. If you have not read the 10 original novels, you will be confused!When the apocalypse hits and nearly wipes out humanity, the survivors band together in little knots, fighting desperately to stay alive. All except one forgotten child. Six-year-old Jillybean has been alone for months with “monsters” prowling endlessly around her house, looking to eat her as they did Mrs. Polarski from up the street. A big bunch of them ate the old lady down to the bone and left nothing but chunks of scalp with long strands of bloody, brown hair attached, and also an elbow. They left her elbow behind and Jillybean could never understand why. That elbow haunted her, as did Mrs. Polarski’s screams. When the monsters first came there had been many screams. All night there would be horrible, scary screams, and they had been simply awful, but the silence was worse. The heavy silence went on and on until Jillybean couldn’t take it any longer…and that was when her stuffed zebra began to talk to her. From then on, things got better. She even left her house. This is the story of a mentally shattered little girl finding the courage to live when so many millions of adults had died pissing their pants and choking on their own blood as they screamed.",
