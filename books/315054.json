  "description": "Playing house in the mountains was supposed to be temporary, but a woman would have to be made of stone to resist the most eligible bachelor in Pine Ridge and all his small-town charm....\nDenny Torres needs a break. After a series of embarrassments on and off the field, the Adirondacks provide the perfect hideout for his new, quiet, post-football life. The fresh mountain air is a welcome balm for his soul, but what's even more soothing? The sexy, sweet touch of fellow Pine Ridge newcomer Bethany Jones. If only she planned to stay....Bee does not have time for a hunky former athlete--no matter how good he looks shirtless. Her artistic ambitions are in ruins, her brother is a disaster, and while Pine Ridge has its charms, the small town is nothing more than a pit stop on her way to getting back on track. Bee's just going to ignore the fact that when Denny offers her the chance to channel her creative energy into redesigning his house, she finds herself building the home--and the life--of her dreams.With their time together coming to an end, Denny will have to move quickly to prove he can be the man Bee needs. Who better than a defensive back to knock down those walls?",
