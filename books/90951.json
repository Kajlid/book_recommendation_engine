  "description": "When a designer drug rocks the small town of New Brighton and makes junkies spontaneously combust, Paramedic Jayda Swenson suspects the super-methamphetamine her husband created before his death has resurfaced. She’s worked hard to create a safe, tidy life and put her meth-ravaged past behind her. Jayda has a secret to keep and her new life is the perfect cover. But when tourists start disappearing and charred body remains crop up, Jayda learns the hard way that this drug doesn’t just fry people’s minds—it also fuels demons.Luckily, the sexy new medic, Ben Tierney, is a demon-hunter in disguise, except his demon-busting powers don’t work so well anymore. Until he realizes Jayda’s touch can refuel the energy he’s lost—a touch she’s not so willing to dish out. Now Jayda finds herself wedged between an ancient demon that knows her past and her secret, and Ben, who has plenty of secrets of his own. Fighting to hold onto her carefully controlled life, Jayda must decide if she’ll let Ben help her defeat the demons who threaten to infect the town by the 4th of July—even if it means exposing her true self and losing everything.
