  "description": "Shoes, unlike magic, are predictable. They don’t change shape, bite, or alter a person’s destiny.And that’s just how Faryn likes it.But his Uncle Harvey has a bad habit of dying. While inconvenient, this hasn’t ever been a problem until now. Thanks to an evil witch and a poisoned apple turnover, Harvey is dead again—permanently this time.As his uncle’s heir, Faryn has to give up shoemaking in order to accept and refine his magic.Magic he never wanted.Unwilling to let go of his dream, but unable to escape his destiny, Faryn combines the two and discovers a knack for making magical shoes. He also learns that turning a person into a goose is a lot easier than turning her back, and that he severely underestimated how much trouble magic can be.The witch who killed his uncle is trying to control all the magic of the land, and it’s up to Faryn to stop her. If only he can get his magic to cooperate in time.",
