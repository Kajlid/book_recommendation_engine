  "description": "The long awaited first collection by Will McPhail, with over 150 cartoons, including his New Yorker classics and new gems. With his shrewd eye for mundane absurdities and hysterically astute drawings of animals, Will McPhail is the New Yorker’s most distinctive cartoonist. His cartoons delight in the everyday anxieties of modern life, skewer contemporary politics, and cut to the core of the most bizarre human behaviors.Now, in McPhail’s first collection, new cartoons mix with old favorites: mischievous mice and opportunistic pigeons offer portals into McPhail’s crackling curiosity, while Lady No-Kids’ adventures continue with high-flying glee. With chapters ranging from the contemporary to the universal, and a classic black and white interior that evokes the timelessness of the craft, Love & Vermin proves why Will McPhail is one of the most cherished cartoonists of his generation.",
