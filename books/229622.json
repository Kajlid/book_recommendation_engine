  "description": "At what date are we in cosmic history? Ed Lukowich's dramatic new Trillion Theory (T Theory) estimates a trillion years. Trillion Years Universe Theory is the 2nd book in the cosmology theory series of Canadian theorist Ed Lukowich. Ed says, “This TYUT book takes the new theories seen in Trillion Theory (TT) and places their founder Ed Lukowich under the scrutiny of a questioner. Answers supplied by Ed widen and clarify the scope of the new and fascinating concepts purported and professed within Trillion Theory (TT).”Are you open to reading a new universe theory which TRUMPS the fraudulent Big Bang? Most definitely, Trillion Theory (TT) reverberates a new robust voice to cosmology theory. Trillion Theory, in search of the true origin of our cosmos, demolishes the explosion notions associated with any type of Big Bang origin, thereby negating the Big Bang as a theory. Trillion Theory states, \"Stars in our sky are merely the current rendition - just today’s story in an amazing trillion-year cosmic history of recycled stars and solar systems. Ever wondered why our cosmos is so gigantic, or why there are billions of stars, solar systems, and galaxies? Well, Trillion Theory (TT) takes the wrapper off of those ageless mysteries. Discover the hidden power behind magical black holes which TT claims to be responsible for all of exponential cosmic growth over the past trillion years.”Trillion Theory (TT) is a new theory which depicts our universe as far older that the supposed 13.7 billion years of the preposterous wrongly accepted Big Bang. TT shows how our cosmos has steadily marched forward and grown in size each 15 billion years or so over the past Trillion years of cosmic history. Follow Trillion Theory as it correctly depicts the exciting origin and growth of our cosmos. Justifiably, the ways in which Trillion Theory advocates this cosmic origin and growth surprises even the top echelon of astronomers and astrophysicists of today. Trillion Theory can be found both as a paperback on Amazon and as an ebook through Kindle.
