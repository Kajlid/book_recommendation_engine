  "description": "When Agata wakes up in the middle of nowhere after drinking an herb concoction given to her by an old Norwegian woman, she is confused and just wants to get home. She doesnâ€™t get time to think about her situation because a towering man with battle scars and wielding an ax takes her as his property. Although there is a language barrier between her and the barbarian, she understands the word he keeps calling her: wife.  When Stian Dagmar finds a woman alone and unconscious in the woods, the first thought he has is that he wants her as his wife. She will probably fight him, struggle for her freedom, but being with him is a lot safer than what his world will give her.  Can Agata accept her new life and the feelings for Stian that grow within her, or will she go home the first opportunity that arises?",
