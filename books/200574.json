  "description": "In the aftermath of a deadly alien invasion, a band of survivors fights on...\n\nHell Squad sniper Shaw Baird is a man on a mission. His squad is his family and now the invading aliens have done the unforgivable... taken one of his team. Claudia Frost - soldier, friend, and all-round badass - is running on borrowed time. Shaw has vowed to bring her home, whatever it takes... and he’s only just realising now she’s been taken that Claudia is a vital piece of him.Claudia Frost is surviving... barely. Kept in chains, made to fight for the aliens’ enjoyment, she can’t survive much longer. But she knows her squad is coming for her... knows Shaw is coming. Only thoughts of the sexy, charming sniper get her through the hell, and for the first time in forever, she wishes she hadn’t let the wounds of her past stop her from taking a taste of the man who is her friend, her sanity and her secret obsession.But rescuing Claudia is only the first dangerous step. The alien keeping Claudia prisoner is far more intelligent, far more patient and a hell of a lot deadlier than any they’ve faced before. Not only is he hunting their band of human survivors through the forests of the Blue Mountains, but he wants Claudia. And he’ll let nothing get in his way.",
