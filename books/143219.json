  "description": "Elle wasn’t mine. Not the first time I met her, and certainly not when I spotted her in the arms of another man. And not just any man—-a criminal. She wasn’t just any woman either, but a girl gone missing more than ten years earlier, when she was the love of my brother’s life. The eyewitness reports said he’d died trying to save her. That might have been true, but it didn't stop me from blaming the shy, sweet girl who had lived down our street. I’d grown to hate her. My once happy family had been torn apart, and the secrets surrounding her disappearance never let the matter rest. Now fate had brought her back into my life again. As a Secret Agent, my undercover status led me right to the heart of the most corrupt men on earth. I never thought it would also lead me into the darkest recesses of my mind. That’s where Elle resided. Where she deserved to be, especially with the pampered life she now lived. She might have been dripping in diamonds and dressed to kill, married to a billionaire, but she was about to disappear again. With me. I wanted her to feel our pain. I wanted her to suffer. Worse, I wanted her. Warning: This book contains very graphic violence, disturbing situations, dubious consent, and very strong language.",
