  "description": "I awoke dead. It was a real bummer. Being covered in blood and having fangs was the icing on an already terrible day.Things go from bad to worse when I get a summons to attend the vampire king’s court, where I get my marching orders. I’m given one lousy week to get my affairs in order and then I’m to present myself to the conclave to commence my hundred years of indentured servitude, where I get to learn Vampire 101.The thing is, I have an eidetic memory and I’m a fast learner. It’s not going to take me a hundred years to grasp this stuff. And I have plans – mediocre ones, but they’re mine. One hundred years of servitude isn’t going to fit the bill.I need to make my escape now, before they sink their teeth into me (again). The only problem is they’ve sent the vampire that turned me to keep a sharp eye on me, and he keeps looking at me like I’m a fine glass of merlot. Escape isn’t going to be easy.My name may be Bunny, but they’re going to learn there’s nothing fluffy about me…Dive into this fast-paced urban fantasy series if you love humour, heart, found family and a slow-burn romance.Don't miss the other Portlock Paranormal adventures:1. The Vampire and the Case of her Dastardly Death2. The Vampire and the Case of the Wayward Werewolf",
