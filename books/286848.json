  "title": "The Black Shade of White: Justice",
  "description": "\"Justice\", the first part of \"The Black Shade of White\" trilogy, takes place in medieval Aragon, modern-day London, the Kingdom of Heaven and the Kingdom of Samael. Across time and space, good and evil struggle in all their forms. There are so many things that divide them, but there is something that allows them to meet in one place, at one time, and that something is - Justice. With her fantasy novel \"The Black Shade of Justice\", author Cattleya hopes that the characters in her novel, angels and demons, become a part of her readers lives and that her novel will allow them not only to transport themselves to another world, the fantasy world, but will make them stop for a moment and reflect upon the topics raised in it, for example, upon one of the ultimate questions around justice, the legitimacy of the death penalty. \"The Black Shade of Justice\" differentiates as well... Love. Love, which is the warp on which this novel was created - fairy-tale-like, magical, unusual, strong, true and indestructible. Without love, despite all the other topics raised in it, this novel would not have the power of communication it has at the moment.",
