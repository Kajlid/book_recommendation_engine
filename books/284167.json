  "description": "A family's love can be everything ...  From the Wreckage of Illicit affairs and the Lies that Bind us close together, how can it be wrong when it seems so right?  Even Against the Spread of an Indecent Craving, there is a hope that can't be broken between the blood that runs through our veins.  And if you look closely enough in the South of Nowhere, you'll find that even the most Intimate Relations end in ways that satisfy the curious mind that follows their heart.",
