Life, now, is a hidden retreat above a quirky Bloomsbury museum, where she waits and watches. Nick Tawes is an unexpected intrusion. He's a landscape architect filming a television series on roof gardens, and he intends to build one in Lanie's aerial territory. He has his own demons, old family troubles, that lure Lanie out of her refuge and into living again. But as summer progresses and the sky garden grows, Lanie's enemy is closing in--because some secrets must go to the grave.",
