  "description": "A reverse harem, enemies to lovers, slow burn romance.“This world has fallen to sickness and shadow. It has bound my hands and blinded me, picking away at the things I love until even my conscience has slipped off to some forlorn cage within my mind, locked away as a traitor. I once feared the storm inside me. Now I would give anything to have it back.”To prove the purity of my soul, I sacrificed everything. I lost my magic, my best friend, and tied myself to the five kings of the afterworld in unholy matrimony. Now, every day is torture at their hands. I am their final hope, a perfect weapon to wield in the ultimate war still looming ahead of us. They will push me as far as it takes, no matter what.Every day, I give a little more of myself away, and they’re snapping up each piece as though they have a right.Every day, the Darkness takes another victim, picking off people all around me until those of us who fight for light and life are outnumbered in a world we’re no longer sure is our own.The end is drawing near, but the closer it gets, the more impossible our victory seems.Even after everything I’ve sacrificed … I fear it won’t be enough.Book 4 of 5 in the Tempest of Shadows series. This is a slow burn with DARK themes, unwilling anti-heroes, and one hell of a kick-ass heroine woven through a rich fantasy setting.",
