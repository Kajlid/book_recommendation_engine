Miles anticipates Reginald's wandering eye, but is caught off-guard when he pursues a wholesome woman, one Miles is honor-bound to protect. It will take all Miles' effort to keep his brother in line, Marjorie from harm, and himself from falling in love.In a society keeping them a world apart, can Miles and Marjorie find a future together?
