  "description": "After a disastrous engagement, Faith Grace Roussell fled the city to return to the country home where she grew up, looking for peace and solitude as she nurtures the berry farm on the property. She's not looking for love. In fact, she's vowed to give her wounded heart so completely to Christ that any man looking for it will have to find Christ first.That is, until she meets Matt Allen, and neighboring cowboy farmer. Faith's reaction to Matt stuns her and sets her careful plans to insulate herself on their ear. Complicating matters, a series of incidents too strange to be coincidence begin happening around her, convincing Faith that someone wants her gone again.The incidents escalate from arson, to attempted murder, and, finally, to murder, and Faith has to decide who she can trust. Should she put her faith -- and her heart -- in Matt's hands? Or will she have to go against her stance on guns and pick up a weapon of her own before it's too late?",
