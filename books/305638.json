But it’s been two years since the summer that changed everything between them, and their friendship hasn’t recovered.Now, Dani is faced with all the challenges of her freshman year of college—navigating rush week, making new friends, and living on her own—which is both exhilarating and intimidating. In high school, Dani was homecoming queen and head cheerleader. She should be able to handle the pressure, but college has been more overwhelming than she expected. Chase, on the other hand, is living the dream. It’s his senior year of high school, his football team is hoping to go undefeated, and he’s being heavily recruited.When Dani returns home for a weekend, she realizes why college feels so overwhelming—she doesn’t have Chase to share it with. In hopes of salvaging their friendship, she repeats an old tradition—sneaking over to his room with pizza after his game. But instead of fixing their friendship, they end up sleeping together. Chase is thrilled that Dani is back in his life, but being friends with benefits when feelings are involved is more complicated than Chase imagined. Will Chase and Dani work through their feelings for one another, or will their childhood promise be shattered when Chase announces what college he will commit to?",
