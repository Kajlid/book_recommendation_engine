  "description": "USA Today bestselling author Catherine Gayle presents the second novel in the Tulsa Tunderbirds hockey romance series. When dark desperation meets opportunity… On a celebratory trip with his best friend, Ray “Razor” Chambers meets sultry Viktoriya Dubrovskaya and immediately recognizes the desperation in her eyes—a sight he remembers all too well. Permanently in survival mode, the destitute and broken Viktoriya makes him an offer—a proposition he immediately refuses. However, Razor’s counter-offer changes everything for her. A ring. A marriage. A lifetime of opportunity. But learning to live together as husband and wife is as foreign as interpreting Smoke Signals. And where there’s smoke, there’s usually fire. CONTENT contains graphic and potentially disturbing descriptions of abuse, both physical and sexual.",
