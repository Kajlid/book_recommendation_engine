  "description": "When it was first published in 1970, \"Miracle on 33rd Street pushed the envelope of sports journalism and created a story that had never been told in any previous book about basketball. In his enthralling account of the Knicks' first NBA championship, from preseason to play-offs, Phil Berger doesn't just cover the baseline jumpers and backdoor passes; he takes readers out of bounds to capture the whole story in all its gritty details-from the anguished cries of legendary coach Red Holzman shouting at his team to \"See the ball,\" to the beer-swilling fans shouting at the players and spitting on the court, to life on the road, in and out of hotels.A brilliant, moody, tricky book that shifts from quick description to fascinating chunks of self-revealing monologues . . . to clear and nontechnical explanations of how Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier executed the backdoor play, and how the Knicks won the world championship.\" --Robert Lipsyte, \"New York Times",
