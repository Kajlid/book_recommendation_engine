  "description": "When a day begins with burying your wife in an Ohio graveyard, most people would agree that it can’t get much worse, but for Kendall McCaslin and his son, Josh, it can. On their way back from the cemetery they’re caught in a chain-reaction traffic crash on the freeway and both killed. Surprisingly, they don’t stay dead. The fatal crash propels father and son into a series of alternate timeline crashes that prove equally lethal until they fashion an escape route. Confused but intact, they struggle to understand what just happened. They know they survived but they can’t comprehend where they are now or why their own memories are in such conflict. It’s not that it’s all bad: in the new timeline, Kendall’s wife turns up alive again; but Josh’s longtime girlfriend has vanished. Oh, and along the way, they suddenly learn that they aren’t the only ones jumping timelines – and those others are not at all pleased. And that’s just for starters.",
