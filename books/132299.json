Asking them to keep a second is unforgivable.”Briar Lennox enters the Iolite Academy ready to take her place as Luna of the shifter pack.

A moment’s loss of control could mean her discovery and death.As she works to avoid detection and reclaim her rightful place at the head of the pack, signs pointing to the return of her kind become impossible to ignore. With more lives than her own hanging in the balance, Briar hedges the line between her duty and downfall.Isolated and betrayed, Briar must navigate the politics and perils of the Academy, where every whisper may hold a threat and every step may mean her undoing. She must protect not only her right to lead but her right to live.",
