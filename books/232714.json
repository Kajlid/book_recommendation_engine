  "description": "The city of Flecton is ruled with an iron fist by Demon Prince Vehr, whose human citizens suffer under demonic enslavement and live in fear of her ever-watchful presence. The prince herself is never seen, living in her underground palace and sending demons to kidnap skilled humans to serve her.  Ten years earlier, Merle's best friend and closest confidante Abeille, a promising silversmith, was taken to Vehr's palace. Now, Vehr seeks a hairdresser, and Merle has exactly the skills she needs. Surviving the hairy situation will take more than witsâ€”it'll take good people to rely on, old friends and new.",
