  "description": "\"Agape & Ares\" is a thrilling and clever romantic story.Agape is an attractive, mysterious young woman enjoying her holiday on the picturesque Greek island of Santorini. There she meets Ares, a handsome man with a shady past and provoking manners. Will a romance spark between them? Should it? ... 'A poem “Agape and Ares” is an attempt to tell the world about the importance of having a positive attitude toward other people. If only we could stop criticizing and blaming others — even if the person in question is a criminal — the world would be a better place. Whether consciously or subconsciously, we all seek acceptance, kindness, and love.' - Ksenia Sein, author ... 'Any young person who has taken a holiday on a Greek island will immediately take to this poem. From the start, the reader feels close to the two participants and English readers will feel envy and admiration that a writer who is not a native speaker uses the language so powerfully, so correctly and yet so warmly.' -  Neil Taylor, author Bradt Guide to Estonia",
