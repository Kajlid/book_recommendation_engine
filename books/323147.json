College brought new challenges even as Bound Hearts brought us more.Whether we’re making music, love, war, games, or trouble, we’ve found a good balance. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.Together, we know we can do anything.We’ve learned that even being apart doesn’t mean we aren’t together.Life has a habit of throwing curve balls. School, careers, new hobbies, friends in need, and family demands are hitting us from every angle. We’re going to need each other more than ever.Archie, Coop, Ian, Jake, and I are a team. We’re constantly figuring it out and sometimes, we fight. We also make up.And we’ll have each other’s backs, today, tomorrow, and into the future.*Please note this is a reverse harem and the author suggests you always read the forward in her books. Contains some bullying elements, mature situations, violence, and is recommended for 17+. This is the eleventh in a series and the story will continue through future books.",
