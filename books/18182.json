  "description": "Sandy dozed intermittently with her head on Jons shoulder as they headed west on IH-10. She thought about the changes that had just occurred in her her fathers death, quitting her teaching job in New Orleans, and packing all her belongings in the U-Haul truck in which she was riding. Her mind then raced to the changes that were to her marriage to Jon, moving to the town of Richmond, Texas, and the effect that the community would have on her and she would have on the town. However, things don't always turn out as planned. Sandy could not have foreseen the arrest of Jons partner for murder, the teenage marijuana ring, or the complete perversion of justice about to take place.",
