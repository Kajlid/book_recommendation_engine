  "description": "The one thing that kept red-headed and troubled Wall Street wizard Evan Deveraux from giving into his own depression was the love of his family. But as Evan digs deeper into his family’s past he discovers a secret that shakes his faith in the Deveraux family and his grandmother the Senator Eleanor Deveraux. Now the only person Evan can trust is the girl who insanely believes he’s her white knight—Dr. Olivia West. The brilliant and adorable Olivia is clueless, not just about the size of Evan’s bank account, but his family as well, and Evan would like to keep it that way. But Evan’s abusive past and dark family history are on a collision course with the present and even as Evan fights to keep Olivia safe from the mercenaries targeting his family, Evan and Olivia find their relationship in cross-hairs of both their families. When Evan is given an ultimatum between protecting his family and breaking up with Olivia, he knows that his own happiness has to come second. But Evan’s cousin Jackson has no intention of letting Evan’s one chance at love get away and Evan is going to need the strength of all of his cousins to make his happily ever after come true.",
