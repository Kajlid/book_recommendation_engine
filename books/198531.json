  "description": "When an ice storm left professor Lucy Guerin stranded in rural Arkansas, she was forced to accept shelter in the secluded home of woodworker Richard Banner. Handsome as sin and twice as grumpy, Banner was not quite what Lucy had envisioned when she'd added \"eligible bachelor\" to her Christmas wish list.But his awkward kindness - and a rare smile that warmed her insides - were more than she'd bargained for. And his reluctance to open his home - or his heart - to anyone was a challenge she was ready to face. Wasn't Christmas the season for miracles? Well, Lucy would entice Banner to slip under the mistletoe with her... and then she'd tempt him with a love he could believe in.",
