Yet somehow she has been chosen by the Muse of Horror to collect the horrifying true stories of her hometown, Centerville. These stories included a haunted drive thru, why vampires should never ever ever drink animal's blood, in addition to the town's inhabits of Hellions, Bronies, and spiritual leaders. As Xarissa writes more stories she is slowly noticing just how messed up her home really is, and what happens when evil is allowed to roam unopposed. She is going to have to find courage or all will be lost.",
