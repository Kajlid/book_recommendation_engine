  "description": "Alexandra Hensley awakens to a world she doesnt recognise. The city is covered in eternal night and nothing makes sense. As she desperately tries to piece the last few days together, a well funded and armed government sect emerges out of hiding, with great knowledge of the supernatural in Sydney. Are they friend or foe? In England, Alicia Slade is faced with a daring situation. Let her infant grandson be used as a pawn for a tyrants plans of domination. Or enter civil war to retrieve him. For her, the choice is already made. For her potential allies, the choice isnt so simple. Alicia just may have to face insurmountable odds alone. But maybe, just maybe. Help from an unknown source might not be far away. But will it be enough to defeat an entire army?",
