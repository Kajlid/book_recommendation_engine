  "title": "The Last Founding Father: James Monroe and a Nation's Call to Greatness",
  "description": "Founding Father James Monroe (1751-1831) long outlived the birth of the country and became so revered that he won two presidential elections (1816, 1820) with no significant opposition. In retrospect, it's easy to discern why: His credentials as a solder, congressman, senator, ambassador, governor, and secretary of state establish him as arguably the best-prepared president in our nation's history. Harlow Giles Unger presents this unjustly neglected leader within the context of his times. A major biography by the author of Lafayette.",
