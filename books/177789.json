  "description": "You only live once—unless you're Denton Little!This amazingly funny YA novel is for fans of John Green, Andrew Smith, and Matthew Quick   The good Denton Little has lived through his deathdate. Yay! The bad He's being chased by the DIA (Death Investigation Agency), he can never see his family again, and he may now die any time. Huh. Cheating death isn't quite as awesome as Denton would have thought... Lance Rubin's debut novel, Denton Little's Deathdate, showed readers just how funny and poignant imminent death could be. Now in this sequel, he takes on the big questions about life. How do we cope, knowing we could die at any time? Would you save someone from dying even if they were a horrible person? Is it wrong to kiss the girl your best friend is crushing on if she's really into you instead?  What if she's wearing bacon lip gloss?",
