  "description": "Kevin isn't into guys at all. He's had a string of girlfriends, done all of the usual things a straight man is supposed to do, so why is he dreaming about guys. And why are his dreams better than any reality with his ladies? When Ben, the IT guy, starts flirting with him, Kevin isn't sure what to think. He knows Ben is gay, knows Ben is experienced in the things he only thinks about when no one is watching. When a computer problem turns into a steamy encounter, Kevin tries to go back to being totally straight. Can Ben convince him that dreams can become reality?",
