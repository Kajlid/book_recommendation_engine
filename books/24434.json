Forced to move to New Hampshire with crazy Madame Kloochie, Zachary soon learns that cleaning her filthy house is the least of his problems. When the evil wizard Krage sends creatures to kill him, Zachary tries to defend himself with the magical items his father left behind, but after accidentally getting poisoned by a dragon and getting his friend turned into a werewolf, he realizes that he is in way over his head. Flying snakes, mysterious shadow hags, orcs and trolls are all after both boys and the beautiful young thief next door as they struggle to stay alive long enough to save the kidnapped little boy next door.",
