  "description": "“Her boobs are real, and so is her attitude.”—Ali Wentworth, actress and New York Times bestselling author Intentionally child-free, Dani falls in love with Julian, a divorced father, and must embrace a lifestyle she’s purposely avoided, or return to her single life, eating oatmeal for dinner, standing half-naked at the kitchen sink listening to gospel music. \tShe can’t give up Julian. He makes her feel like she’s the heroine in a trashy romance novel, and they move in together. The alternating weekends with his kids, Nicole and Tyler, are like babysitting—only without compensation. She’s presented with a Whitman’s Sampler of motherhood and makes rookie mistakes. As it turns out, donations made to the Alzheimer’s Foundation in the kids’ names aren’t what kids expect on Christmas morning—even when the receipts are wrapped with a pretty bow. In time, Dani unclenches and welcomes more responsibility and invests in the kids’ well-being. “Julian! How are switchblades and crossbows appropriate toys for a 10-year-old?” \tAnd just when she falls in love with Nicole and Tyler, Julian pulls the rug out and dumps her for a natural blonde. It’s not a traditional divorce, and Dani is unsure if she has the right to see the kids. She won’t be ignored and suits up for hand-to-hand combat and fights for a place in the kids’ lives, including befriending Marie—the ex of her ex. With Nicole and Tyler’s insistence that Dani remains in their lives, and with Marie’s help, they DIY a new kind of family.",
