  "description": "The Freewill Trilogy: We are not defined by the choices that are made for us; but by the choices we make when we believe that all other options have been taken away. Freewill is the first book of three, in the Freewill Trilogy. The trilogy is a Young Adult slipstream series that embodies both science fiction and dark fantasy, with strong paranormal romantic overtones. Within its pages a world comes to life, where mythology is real and evident in humanity's interaction with the ethereal Others. Ellie, once a human but now an Other (an empathic creature surviving in a fugue state, inside the otherworldly veil for over sixty years,) has been finding the strength to exist through her compulsion to be a muse; that is, until she meets Christopher. Christopher, a present day young man with the special talent to foresee the truth of the intangible Others, quickly becomes Ellie's heart's desire. Ellie and Christopher inevitably find themselves developing an unusual relationship, where touching one another can only happen in Christopherâ€™s dreams. Unbeknownst to them, ever since Ellie's birth in 1922, destiny's hand, guided by mythical forces and fairytale lineage, has been pushing them into each other's embrace, while also potentially into the arms of evil Others called the Timoro, and into the sights of dangerous feuding organizations-- the Symboulio: the council of the ancient and divine, and the Symbio: the new world council of acceptance.",
