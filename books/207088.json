He does what he must to survive, no matter what. Sex is a business and one that he has learned to do well.Prince is the last person Trevor thought he'd be spending his night with, but when the two meet, there is an explosive desire that draws the two of them together.There is nothing wrong with sharing a night of pleasure, unless one night turns into two.",
