  "description": "“We deal in blood, friend.” With those prophetic words, John “Big Slick” Elder, a professional killer with an unbendable set of ethics, finds himself trapped between the harsh concrete will of a brutal boss of bosses and Slick’s own never-broken boundaries on what he will or won’t do for money. Slick had vowed never to work in Ohio, for very personal reasons, yet now he’s found himself in that great flat state with his work-partner, Thumper, and at the beck and call of a very violent criminal underworld boss who forces them to carry out on a very unusual errand, one that he claims involves no violence and appears harmless at first. The question is, will Slick and Thumper figure out the end game behind this simple chore in time, and are they prepared for what it will reveal about who they are, as men? The thrilling followup to Elijah Drive's debut mystery novel BULLETS. “Razor sharp writing, crackling dialogue, characters that jump off the page and slap you in the face. In BIG SLICK, Elijah Drive delivers a compulsively readable thriller that held me captive until the last page. Can’t wait to read the next one.” —Dwayne Alexander Smith – FORTY ACRES. “An emotional roller coaster of a novel that manages to be profound, moving and completely surprising. A rarity for a thriller, BIG SLICK shocks you by exploring the mystery of the characters in addition to the situation they’re trapped in.” —Ato Essandoh – HBO’s VINYL, DJANGO UNCHAINED, BLOOD DIAMOND, CBS’s ELEMENTARY, BBC America’s COPPER.",
