  "description": "'It was the day of the Chatton Show, the biggest event of the riding year in our part of the world, and every single person I knew would be there - except me.' After a disappointing start, the summer holidays improve for Jill when she is asked to help organise a gymkhana, raising money for charities that protect horses. Life gets better still when Mrs. Darcy suggests Jill ride her beautiful roan hack, Sandy-Two, at the show. Yet the arrival of Dinah, a strange girl who will do anything to learn to ride, becomes a problem. Despite Dinah's odd behaviour, Jill helps her by giving her old riding clothes and a ride on Black Boy, but when Dinah disappears with three horses, Jill wonders exactly what she has let herself in for.",
