  "description": "Twin sleuths Goldie and Godiva, the Silver Sisters, are at it again-tracking seven stolen teapots from Alaska to LA. When a shipment of Russian samovars fails to arrive in Alaska, antique shop owner Goldie Silver starts to track it down. The ladies from the Russian Orthodox church have ordered one of the fancy tea urns as a gift for the retiring priest, but before the wayward antiques are located, his young replacement is murdered. That's just the tip of the iceberg in quiet little Juneau! After Goldie's twin, the manipulative Beverly Hills advice columnist, Godiva Olivia DuBois arrives for a visit, the lost crate finally arrives. The samovars sell quickly, and Goldie has only one left when two menacing Russians bumble into her shop claiming that the fancy teapots belong to them and demanding their return. She throws them out, but by the next day it seems that the seven beautiful antiques are cursed. Everyone in town who received one of the samovars has been beaten or murdered, and two more customers are likely targets: a lady from Seattle and Godiva's boyfriend, chef Caesar Romano. What are the thugs really after? Will they get away with murder? Our curvy sleuths, Goldie and Godiva, are hot on their trail as they track the Russians from Alaska to Seattle and Los Angeles. To add to the fun, the twins' eighty-year-old mother and uncle, Flossie and Sterling Silver get into the act!",
