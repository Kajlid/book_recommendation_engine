  "description": "When I purchased a home in an upscale neighborhood, I never imagined having one of the Charleston Pirates living next door.Knox Irons knows just how to push my buttons. Every part of him rubs me the wrong way—well, not quite every part.So imagine my surprise when Mr. Tall, Dark, and Infuriating comes to me for help with his kicking. I want to say no, but the desperation in his dark gaze has me agreeing all too soon.Being around Knox while he’s bare chested and sweaty is challenging. But the way he listens and responds to my instruction is downright intoxicating.I keep reminding myself, no matter how well we work together on the football field, he’s still my enemy when we’re off it.I’m only here to coach the kicker, not crush on him.Author's Note: This is a full-length, steamy, heartfelt, standalone sports romance. HEA. Opposites attract. Enemies to lovers. Forced proximity. Contemporary romance. Laugh-out-loud banter, a swoony NFL kicker who likes to push her buttons, and a soccer star heroine who gives as good as she gets.",
