  "description": "Keith Knight's comics are simultaneously lighthearted, wild, and clever, and his great strength is the deftness with which he blends political insight, whacked-out surrealism, neurotic humor, and personal honesty. His comic strip, K Chronicles, runs in the San Francisco Examiner, on Salon.com, and in dozens of alternative newsweeklies across the country. Reminiscent of Calvin and Hobbes, Knight's drawing style is fluid and dynamic.",
