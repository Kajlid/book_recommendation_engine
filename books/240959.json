  "description": "LGBT Shape-shifter ParanormalCade is a demon hunter with one distinct advantage--he is also a shifter. His animal side makes him immune to the deadly venom of demon bites. Always a lone wolf, Cade is surprised when a young man named David shows up as his door begging to be trained to hunt and kill the evil forces of the night.But David is pure human with no immunity to protect him from the deadly demon venom. Cade isn't about to turn him since over half of those infected with lycanthropy die. Still, there's something about the young man with the beautiful eyes that calls to him, and Cade decides to train him against his better judgment. He takes David into his home and into his heart but not into his bed--for despite David's obvious desire he can never bring himself to admit his true feelings.Then the unthinkable David is fatally wounded during a demon hunt. Only by risking everything and taking David to bed can Cade save the young man who is so much more than a protégé. For now he must give David The Last Bite--the curse of lycanthropy which will either release the wolf within or kill the man he loves.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find male/male sexual practices",
