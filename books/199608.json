  "description": "From the very moment their eyes met, there was an electricity between them. She could feel that very strongly, even though they were sitting in a crowded meeting room at the time. There was something about the way he looked at her â€“ as though he really was looking at her, seeing the parts of her that nobody else saw. The way his eyes danced in her direction made her come over all hot and tingly. She busied herself with her papers as a way of distracting herself.",
