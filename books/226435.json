  "description": "\"The story flowed like scenes from a movie. I could see the vivid descriptions of both the characters and the background scenes.\" - Author/ Reviewer Marilyn Thompson of Mind Fog Reviews\"I found the simple yet powerful message in this short book refreshing. Through the characters, we are taught the value of such traits as honour, compassion, justice and meekness--a quality often misunderstood in today's selfish world that fails to realize it takes far greater strength to be meek than to be a brute.\" - Laura Fabrini of Library of Clean Reads\"Despite there being so many characters and events in a shorter book it was wonderfully written and gives a full story. It really sucks you in and brings you along on an adventurous ride.\" - Jennifer Kitchens of Clean Romance ReviewsDescription -A sweet romance about deliverance and sacrifice, it demonstrates the cost of loyalty and sacrificial love. Set in a world similar to Medieval Europe, this novella has none of the magic or mythical elements typical of this genre.\"The vibrant characters felt like they could step off the page at any moment because of their realism.\" - E. A. West, author of Dreams Do Come True\"There is plenty of swordplay, intrigue, and danger to want you to keep turning pages, and Darius's tender treatment of Brice is heartwarming.\" - Roseanne Evans Wilkins, author of Tangled Hearts",
