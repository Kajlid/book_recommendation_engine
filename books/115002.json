  "description": "Grace Masters always dreamed of a family she could call her own and always knew that for her, those dreams would never come true. Yet here she is, in an old Victorian home, living and loving under the cover of night. Who knew the source of her lifelong torment was really her gift as a Daughter of Man or that this gift could be controlled and used for something good? Who knew there was another race called the Paenitentia who live side by side with humans? Who knew that demons were real?Grace certainly didn't until one fateful night when her world falls apart and comes together again in a place where she finally belongs. Sometimes a person just knows when something is right and destined to be. Sometimes convincing someone else of that fact is a little more difficult. Canaan ad Simeon is that someone else.Canaan is Liege Lord to a House of Guardians whose job is to protect the Race from a demon threat many no longer believe in. Already breaking away from the outdated traditions that are depleting their numbers and threatened by a hierarchy resistant to change, the last thing Canaan needs is to fall for this innocently sexy Daughter of Man. But fall he does, with a mixture of comedy, drama andÂ tantalizing sex that will touch your heart..",
