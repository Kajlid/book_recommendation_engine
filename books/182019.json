  "description": "Abby Burns has a new life in Vegas. She’s got a great job as a dealer in a casino. New friends. Awesome house. Everything is going smooth, until she gets pinned under the back porch trying to rescue some kittens.  Zane Randolf is an EMT. He also has it all—great job, awesome group of guys he fights MMA with, and a membership to the local BDSM club. He’s also the last holdout of the six member of The Fight Club, still not in a serious relationship with a woman.  When Zane arrives to rescue a woman trapped under her back porch, he almost swallows his tongue at the first sight of her fine legs and sexy butt. If that isn’t enough, Abby can’t seem to stay out of trouble. He has to rescue her yet again the following week from an accident.  Abby’s initial reluctance to start a relationship with Zane is caused by her skewed view of BDSM. Her only local friend, Lauren, has fallen into the wrong hands with the local head of the Russian mob. If Lauren’s experiences are anything to go by, Abby wants nothing to do with the BDSM scene.  When Lauren breaks off her relationship with the mobster, she has nowhere to turn but Abby. But, the Russians don’t take “no” for an answer. They are out for revenge, and they will stop at nothing to get what they want.  No one is safe from their retaliation—including Abby and Zane.",
