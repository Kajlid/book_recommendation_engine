  "description": "It has been two years since Violet Eden walked away from the city, her friends, her future and - most painfully - her soulmate, Lincoln. Part angel, part human, Violet is determined to stand by the promises she made to save the one she loves. Living in the perpetual coldness of a broken soul she survives day to day as a Rogue Grigori in London. It has been more than a year since she felt Lincoln searching for her and Violet has learnt to focus on nothing more than the war against exiled angels. But when an unexpected visitor shows up at her door, the news he bears about someone she swore to protect leaves Violet with no choice. Even worse, she fears that this might all lead back to the night she tries hardest to forget. And what was taken without her permission. Violet is going back to New York...and she knows exactly who is going to be there. With Phoenix in her dreams and Lincoln in heart she knows it is only a matter of time before the final choice must be made.",
