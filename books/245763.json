  "description": "When a Christmas witch meets a gorgeous grinch, sparks fly... literally!  Merry Tremayne loves Christmas in Rivers End. Festivals, food, and family make the holiday magical—which is fantastic, as long as she’s not the one making the magic. The last time she used her Gift to improve someone’s Christmas spirit, it ended in catastrophe. So when she accidentally casts a spell on a grumpy, gorgeous Grinch, she thinks she’s ruined everything. That is, until he kisses her with enough heat to melt a snowman.  For Dillon Clarke, nothing good has ever come from Christmas. But things start looking up when he meets perky, sexy Merry, who’s determined to put the tinsel on his tree and the jingle in his... bells. Together, they might just be able to conquer their fears and begin some new Christmas traditions of their own.  ***  \nA note from author CJ Hunt\n Welcome to Rivers End!
