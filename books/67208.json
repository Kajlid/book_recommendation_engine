  "title": "Edith and Mr. Bear: A Lonely Doll Story",
  "description": "Mr. Bear's expensive clock fascinates Edith. She just has to touch it. But when she does, it falls down with a crash. Unable to admit that she has broken it, Edith's guilty conscience makes her so unhappy that she can't even enjoy her birthday party. In fact, Edith feels so badly about lying to Mr. Bear that she contemplates running away. What happens next makes for a timeless story that will resonate with anyone who has ever tried to cover up the truth. Dare Wright's innovative black-and-white photographs make EDITH AND MR. BEAR as intriguing as it was when first published in 1964.",
