  "description": "Deputy Sergeant David Wolf has been waiting sixteen years for today's opportunity to follow in the footsteps of his late father and become Sheriff of the Sluice County SD, headquartered in the small ski resort town of Rocky Points, Colorado. What he's offered, however, isn't quite what he's expecting. And for Wolf, refusing turns out to be harder, and much deadlier, than he could have anticipated. When a rich and powerful enemy corrupts the SCSD from within, Wolf becomes hunted by his own department, along with a special forces killing machine whose psychotic lust for blood is never denied. In this action-packed, suspense filled adventure -- the second installment in the David Wolf series -- Wolf must draw on all his skills in the high Rocky Mountain forest and solve a disturbing mystery involving an item from his Native American ancestry if he wants to live to see another day.",
