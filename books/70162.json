  "title": "Phoebe and the Ghost of Chagall",
  "description": "Marc Chagall appeared exactly twenty-five years after his death, in the twenty-first century, in the brightly tiled wonderment of Phoebe's kitchen in Sonoma, California. Once he got his bearings, he stood in the center of the kaleidoscopic room, appreciating all the color and watching Phoebe's daughter, Audrey, prepare for a surprise birthday party that would begin in less than two hours. Chagall did know certain things before his arrival: that Phoebe was currently at work, something to do with wine or wine labels, that she was in danger of losing her home, that a small painting he had painted before the first World War that rightfully belonged to Phoebe had ended up in the hands of another. But Chagall did not quite understand why or how he had come to know these facts.",
