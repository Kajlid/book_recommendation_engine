  "description": "Dreaming of travel? You need this book!You'll laugh all the way to the travel agent after reading Nanna's collection of travel tips. They're quirky, homespun, sometimes questionable, probably dangerous and by no means comprehensive. After a lifetime of travelling and living life to the full, fuelled by sweet sherry and talcum powder, there is no-one better equipped to help prepare you for your next travel adventure. It's not quite all the travel insurance you'll ever need!As short as it is insightful, don't dare leave home without Nanna's Travel Tips. Travel humor at its best! \"This book is hilarious!\" Kindle Book Review.\"What I enjoyed most was the irreverent tone and funny examples throughout the book.\"\"This little book is a gem, easy to read and eminently practical, as all tips from Nanna are.\" BONUS: Now with a bonus short story, \"Lost\" from \"Cracks in the Ceiling\" by the same author.",
