But how long can he hide from love?I'm wealthy, powerful, and able to get any woman I want.So why do I feel so empty inside?In search of a deeper me, I take a sabbatical from my privileged life. One year of backpacking around Europe: a new identity, no contacts, and no money. Not a bad plan, I think.Until I get there.A crowded hostel room, body odor, and beer bongs—there are no words for the fresh hell I’ve landed in.But amid the chaos, I meet my new roommate, Hayden Whitmore. She sleeps in the bed opposite me, and I openly admit to staring at her more than I sleep. Beautiful, innocent, and smart. Not my usual type but perhaps the perfect woman.There’s just one small problem with the divine Miss Hayden. She’s totally unaffected by my charm. Nothing is working, and now, I’ve been friend zoned.What?But the good thing about me is that I’m an incredible problem solver, and I’ve come up with a diabolical plan. I’m going to slide right in under her friend zone. Be the best damn friend she ever had, hold her hand, make her laugh, and spoon with her in bed.But now there’s another problem.Hayden is the one who is sliding under my skin, and maybe friendship isn’t enough.",
