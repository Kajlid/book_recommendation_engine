  "title": "Proposed Evaluation of Cervical Cancer Prevention Strategies Does Current Approach",
  "description": "Cervical cancer continues to be a major public health problem, not only in the United States, but also worldwide. Nearly all cervical cancer cases are linked to genital infection with human papillomavirus, a common sexually transmitted virus, raising concerns that more cases of cervical cancer may arise among young and menopausal women. And yet, cervical cancer is a preventable and treatable disease; hence, if detected and treated in its early stages, the survival rate is fairly high. However, researchers at the National Cancer Institute have suggested that the high incidence and death rates of cervical cancer can be considered as markers of access to medical care, which highlight the need for developing evaluation programs aimed at reducing the risk of developing cervical cancer.The main objective of this paper was to develop a plan for the evaluation of cervical cancer prevention strategies targeting American females in the post-HPV vaccination era. Relevant articles were identified by searching databases and viewing reports, and other documents. The paper proposes an outcome-based evaluation of the current approach to cervical cancer prevention. A mixed methods framework could be employed, and emphasis should be placed on technical, practical, and ethical issues concerning program implementation.",
