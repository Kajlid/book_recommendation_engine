  "title": "Humanity's Moment : A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope",
  "description": "When climate scientist Joëlle Gergis set to work on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, the research she encountered kept her up at night. Through countless hours spent with the world’s top scientists to piece together the latest global assessment of climate change, she realised that the impacts were occurring faster than anyone had predicted. In Humanity’s Moment, Joëlle takes us through the science in the IPCC report with clear-eyed honesty, explaining what it means for our future while sharing her personal reflections on bearing witness to the heartbreak of the climate emergency unfolding in real-time. But this is not a lament for a lost world. It is an inspiring reminder that human history is an endless tug-of-war for social justice. We are each a part of an eternal evolutionary force that can transform our world.Joëlle shows us that the solutions we need to live sustainably already exist – we just need the social movement and political will to create a better world. This book is a climate scientist’s guide to rekindling hope, and a call to action to restore our relationship with ourselves, each other and our planet.",
