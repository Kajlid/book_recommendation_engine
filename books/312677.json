Including each other.Val aims to destroy Geraldo, the man who stole their company. Meanwhile, Dane just wants to get even with Noelle, the woman who publicly dumped him. All he needs to do is woo her back, then break her heart. Easy. When Geraldo's daughter shows up in an internship program, Val plots to send the girl home to daddy with her ethics compromised. and she ropes Dane in to distract him from a fake romance that's beginning to look too real. Behind a sterling reputation, Val weaves a nefarious plan to ruin Geraldo's daughter, eliminate Noelle, and seduce Dane for herself.
