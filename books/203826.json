  "description": "To Sartre, Hell was other people. To the game designer, Hell is the game.Damico writes games for a living. When called in to rescue a local roleplaying game demo, Damico is shot in the head by a loony fan.He awakens in a game. A game full of hackney’s tropes and clichéd plots. A game he was there to save, run by the man who murdered him just moments ago. A game that has just become world-swap fantasy. Damico, to his horror, has become the heart of the cliché.Set on their quest in a scene that would make Ed Wood blush, Damico discovers a new wrinkle. As a game designer, he is a creative force in this broken place. His presence touches the two-dimensional inhabitants. First a peasant, then a barmaid, then his character’s own father…all come alive.But the central question remains. Can Damico escape, or is he trapped in this nightmare? Forever.Wait, what? This is a comedy?Ignore all that. Death by Cliché is a heartwarming tale of catastrophic brain damage. Share it with someone you love. Or like. Or anyone at all.
