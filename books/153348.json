  "description": "Wolfi Schönborn, self-confessed Wunderkind, chose as his PhD thesis ‘Reality: Beyond the Limits of Perception’. Wolfi didn’t think much of limits. Or reality.Then Wolfi vanished - leaving a fellow student a pile of photographs, letters, philosophical notes and sexual passages.Narrator and reader are left to piece together, clue by clue, a bizarre patchwork of intellectual brilliance, deviant sexuality, farcical horror and wilful innocence to reveal at last, stripped of illusion, the final bare reality that is Wolfi. Or is it?Detective story, Bildungsroman, sexual chronicle and philosophical odyssey. Out of the line of fire is a multi-layered masterpiece - the most highly praised Australian novel since Peter Carey’s Illywhacker.",
