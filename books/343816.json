  "description": "Following the lives of children into orphanages and through the streets and slums of India—where millions of them live without families—this account pulls a significant amount of research from the infamous Dharavi slum of Mumbai, where many of the scenes for the Oscar–winning film Slumdog Millionaire were shot. Here, more than a million people live on its 500 acres of former swampland surrounded by luxury high-rise condominiums. Yet this is a book filled with hope, telling the story of those with huge hearts and individuals from around the globe standing up to create a wave of conscious steps toward a better planet and better life for these 25 million Indian children.",
