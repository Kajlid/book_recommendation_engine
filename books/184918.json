  "title": "Loving the White Liar",
  "description": "I met my true love when I was twenty-seven.He was handsome, charming, witty, and irresistible. Jayden Monroe came along when I was struggling with indecision and made things simple, turned monochrome into vivid color, and forever altered my perspective on life. I was not naive enough to believe in happily ever after, but with Jayden, it seemed possible . . . until I realized something wasnâ€™t quite right. You see, I met a man who would be anyone I needed him to be, and after I found out that fact, I knew it would be impossible to walk away. His disorder, however, would change everything I ever thought about love and what it truly meant to accept someone for who they are.This is not my sob story; this is his success story.",
