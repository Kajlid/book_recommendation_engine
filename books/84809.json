  "description": "[Siren Erotic Contemporary Romance, light consensual BDSM, spanking, HEA] When Rainey Ann McKenna's dying husband asked her always to be there for his brother, Tex McCoy, she had no idea that five years later her promise would bring a murderer into her home. According to the conditions of his release, for the next three months Tex will be on house arrest. Obligated by a promise, Rainey Ann takes the gorgeous but dangerous felon in. Tex McCoy may have gone to jail for murder, but after a decade of being incarcerated, he too is dead inside. Resurrecting any of Tex's feelings—including the ones he once had for Rainey Ann McKenna—could be fatal. In jail, he fantasized about Rainey Ann. Behind steel bars it was acceptable to think of her in such a way, but in the real world, it's dangerous. Yet as desire awakens, Rainey Ann’s threat heightens. After years of being locked up, Tex is ready to reclaim some control, and his fantasy woman is only a touch away. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
