  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 9780007350780\nI always deserve the best treatment because I never put up with any other.\nBeautiful, rich, self-assured and witty, Emma Woodhouse delights in match-making those around her, with no apparent care for her own romantic life. Taking young Harriet Smith under her wing, Emma sets her sights on finding a suitable match for her friend. Chided for her mistakes by old friend Mr Knightley, it is only when Harriet starts to pursue her own love interests that Emma realizes the true hidden depths of her own heart. Delightful, engaging and entertaining, Emma is arguably Austenâ€²s most well-loved social comedy.",
