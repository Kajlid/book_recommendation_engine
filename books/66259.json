  "description": "To increase her sense of wonder, Grace is chosen by Nature’s spirit guides and guardians to travel on ‘a funny sometimes fearful journey’. Her unlikely allies are small and often overlooked – plants, flowers and insects. Grace is about to discover what lies in and beyond the rainbow, but her decision to help a lost, bitter boy named Downcast Don rediscover ‘wonder’ diverts her through colourful and fearful forests, down a well to find an underground forge, and into a meeting with an ancient desert giantess! Her chief guide, Heartsease, assures her that it’s all part of the search for rainbow wisdom, to see how all things and people matter. Join Grace on her journey to the other side of the rainbow as she learns to look below the surface and to make important choices, in this whimsical and wayward tale that explores the gift of wonder, the power of selfless love to make lasting changes, deceptive appearances, and the energies of the living world.",
