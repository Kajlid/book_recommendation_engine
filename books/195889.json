  "description": "*Don't let the title fool you, this is a story about true love, not cheating.Without love, marriage is just business. At least that’s what Claudia Mason tells the women who seek her firm’s unique services. With wealthy husbands who see their wedding rings as meaningless pieces of jewelry, they trust Claudia to do whatever is necessary to gather the hard evidence needed to shatter an ironclad prenup.  She is the best in the business and has yet to meet a mark she couldn’t get the goods on— solidifying her belief that no man can be trusted. After landing a client who is her ticket to retirement, she is on top of the world. Until a chance encounter with Greyston Michaels turns her carefully controlled world upside down. Greyston shows Claudia a part of herself she thinks she’s lost, making her question everything she believes about men—and love. But in Claudia's world, following her heart is bad for business. And business is everything.",
