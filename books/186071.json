  "description": "Maxine Merryweather has never been one to wish upon stars. There is no logic in wishing and dreaming. Everything she’s accomplished is a result of hard work and stringent testing and evaluation. As a neurologist, Max has ordered her life based on these principles. So, when her Hollywood producer sister asks her to be a part of the next mega hit TV show, Around the World Tonight, as the nanny to the star’s new ward, Max agrees, which makes no logical sense. Nannies pretend. Nannies play. There is no pretending and playing in science. Edward Dunn never really wanted to be on a reality dating show. It started as a joke by his late sister. Now as the new guardian of his six-year-old nephew who is suffering in unimaginable ways, his priorities have shifted to father mode. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way out of a Merryweather Production contract and he has no choice but to trust that the nanny is as capable as promised, and hope that he can survive the drama of thirteen women vying for his love. There’s only one problem. After meeting her, Edward is unable to get the nanny out of his head, and soon she has captivated every part of him. Max cannot deny her attraction to Edward, but has made it very clear that she is not a part of the show. What she feels is certainly not love. Besides, what is love beyond misfirings of the brain’s synapses? But… there is something about him that makes the music in her pulse and spin, allowing her to momentarily shut down all logical reasoning to wonder if perhaps the path to happiness involves a little wishing after all.",
