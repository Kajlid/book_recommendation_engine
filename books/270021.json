  "description": "For those of my friends and colleagues who are interested in spiritual writing, my 93-year-old father’s first book may be of interest. “Inspirations from Life: The Complete ‘A Word from Father Roy’ Collection”, was released today by Friesen Press. It can be ordered in e-book, trade paperback, or hardcover at Chapters/Indigo, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo, iTunes and other online retailers and bricks and mortar bookstores. It is also available direct from the publisher.For the last thirty years, my dad, the Reverend Roy Shepherd, has been a priest specializing in Christian congregations that are undergoing a process of change. From parish to parish, he has helped them to move forward, and in the process he has shared with them brief stories – homilies, you might call them – that connect the teachings of the Bible to everyday events. Those 250 stories, published over the years in church bulletins, have now been compiled into a complete set.The book will be most of interest, I guess, to Christians, particularly those who would like to understand more clearly the lessons from the Bible. I know some people already have partial collections that they use as daily devotional readings. People of other faiths may also be interested: Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and Hindus often share many of the same basic spiritual beliefs as my dad’s parishioners.If you find this interesting, please share this post with your friends. Yes, I am trying to make my dad’s book go viral. If it does, of course, I will then have to explain to my dad what going viral is, but I’ll do my best. Please share.The link to find out more, and order the book from the publisher, is here.https://books.friesenpress.com/store/...",
