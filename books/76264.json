  "description": "Think you know about gargoyles? The beautiful winged race disappeared eight hundred years ago. When they last walked the earth, they traveled in close-knit packs, their throats marked with ancient runes. Their greatest enemies were the ugly and brutal harpies that people today mistake for gargoyles.When a fabulous winged sculpture mysteriously saves Elaina's life, she travels across the country in her search to learn more about him. But the good-looking gargoyle she finds in Colorado isn't exactly happy to see her. Too bad he's going to be her new college roommate. Now sparks fly every time Elaina and Reason look at each other.",
