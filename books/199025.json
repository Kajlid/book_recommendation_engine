  "title": "A Rey of Hope: Feminism, Symbolism and Hidden Gems in Star Wars: The Force Awakens",
  "description": "The new Star Wars: The Force Awakens offers a world of diversity – its heroes span the races and genders. Yet under this, there’s much to explore – Rey is a butt-kicking heroine, but some might say she’s so overpowered she has no challenges left. Others might observe that from her clothes and skills to her friends and enemies, she’s excelling more at the hero’s journey than the heroine’s. Does Finn undergo the classic hero’s journey, or is his too subverted? There are fascinating symbols as well, as Kylo Ren’s lightsaber is as unstable as he is, while perception and sight dominate the story arc. From themes to novels and comics, this book explores the hidden depths of the series, revealing them for fans to enjoy. An unauthorized guide.",
