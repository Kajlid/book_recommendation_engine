They are comfortable with their new way of life away from the Christmas atmosphere they despise. The only things missing for these serious gamers are their human mates. Horse's hatred of Santa brought him to Illinois, where he has always viewed guys as entertainment rather than people to start a serious relationship with. That is, until he meets Bren. Bren Griaule is a detective who is used to being in charge whether he is at work or in the bedroom. When he meets Horse, he has a chance to relinquish some of that control. As the two start their relationship, will Bren be able to accept Horse's dominant ways? Will the two of them be able to eliminate the threat that indirectly led to their meeting? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
