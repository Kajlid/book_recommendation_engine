  "description": "When Cara and Frank were a young married couple, he was a high school football coach and half the team used to hang out at the coach's house, leading more than one player to crush on the coach's pretty wife. Fast forward years later and one of Frank's former players is a major football star. When Marcus is awarded for his charity work, he invites his old coach and Cara to the black tie banquet as a thank you. Frank and Cara make the most of the chance to dress up and go into the city, deciding that on their night on the town \"anything goes.\" The fun starts in the limo, but when they arrive at the banquet and Cara starts shamelessly flirting with Marcus, the couple must decide if they are ready to cross the line and make their fantasy a reality. And Marcus must decide if he's ready to finally close the deal and enjoy his old crush.",
