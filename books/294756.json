  "description": "“Women and children to the right. Men, to the left,” I once said.  From 1942 to 1944 I was what some called a Jew killer. Though, I have never hurt a soul, I was responsible for separating Jewish families, ensuring they would never see each other again. Those who were sick, were sent to their death ... by me because I was forced to follow the enemy. The war stole my right of beliefs, my goals for a future, my left arm, and the love of my life.  I saved Amelia …  … then I lost her.  And after more than seventy years, I’m told she’s alive and asking for me.  Will love be enough to overcome the silence of more than seven decades?",
