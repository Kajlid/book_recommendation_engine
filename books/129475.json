  "title": "The World War Deception",
  "description": "Were the two World Wars historical accidents or were they the undertakings of powerful yet undocumented cabals for the creation and expansion of the Soviet Union? Was the Soviet Union the ultimate successor to European colonial empires? What role did the alliance with Germany play in the implosion of the Ottoman Empire? Why were so many soldiers sacrificed at Gallipoli? Why did Germany avoid invading the newly formed Soviet State? Why did the Nazis avoid a ground invasion of Britain? What happened at Dunkirk and Dieppe? Who was Fritz Kraemer? How did Germany end up with one half under the Soviets and the other half under NATO? Why were atom bombs dropped on Japan even though bombing raids had brought greater destruction to Japanese cities? Was a bipolar New World Order, dominated exclusively by NATO and the Soviet Union, a strategy for controlling the populations of the world? Incorporating more than two hundred sources, the World War Deception comes up with some unlikely answers to these original questions.",
