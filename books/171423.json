  "description": "Michael Bunker (Pennsylvania) and Nick Cole (The Old Man and the Wasteland) bring you a gritty tale of survival in the Post Apocalyptic Weird West Texas Badlands where towns have become abandoned wastelands and “Hordes,” packs of feral, cannibalistic humans made so by a diet pill Slenderex, devour anything and anyone they can find in search of protein. A band of children, led by a boy barely a man, will stand against a rising tide of humans gone feral, greedy precious metal pirates and psychotic roving biker gangs to make a home for themselves atop a hidden valley. But when a member of the 88, a Man in Black simply known as Mayhem arrives in the badlands, Ellis and his small “family” of orphans and lost children will have to go underground into a mysterious system of tunnels to fight back and survive. Lord of the Flies meets Mad Max beneath the Apocalypse Weird.",
