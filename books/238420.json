  "description": "There’s a dark power growing within me. And I’m not sure I can control it.  The fae king wants me dead. His assassins tracked me down and nearly killed me— now they’re the ones lying lifeless in a pool of blood. But the price I've paid is too high. They hurt someone I love, and I burn for revenge.  I’m done watching from the sidelines. Following the seductive fae Roan, I join the rebels but find myself surrounded by suspicion at every turn. But with the strange new magic in my blood, no one trusts me anymore.  It's the magic of fear, of terror, of nightmares. The king’s minions have given me another name: Mistress of Dread. My power is unstable and deadly, and to get my vengeance, I must learn to control it. Yet with fury boiling in my blood and desire for Roan kindling my heart, it seems like an impossible task.  FBI Agent, Pixie, Terror Leech, Mistress of Dread. Will I become a King Killer as well?",
