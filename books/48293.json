  "title": "The Russian Revolution/Leninism or Marxism?",
  "description": "Rosa Luxemburg (1870-1919), one of the most remarkable and controversial personalities in the Marxist movement, opposes in this book not the Bolshevikâ€™s quest for power but the way they took power, the way they held power, the way they justified themselves in doing both. In the light of the soviet collapse her penetrating but not unsympathetic criticism becomes a grave indictment and her fears for the Communists uncannily prophetic of events to come.",
