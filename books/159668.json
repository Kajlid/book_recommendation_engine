  "description": "They took his humanity…but left a hero's heart. Feisty and street-wise, Private Sofia Touma has too much at stake to risk being distracted from her duty to the marine corps. That is, until she's assigned to help the compelling and disabled veteran Johnny Lam. More than a war hero, he's also a werewolf who can't shift back to human form. And Sofia is quickly, inexplicably drawn to him. Unlike Sofia, Johnny understands the risks involved in her loving a monster. But with each day bringing them closer together, he isn't sure he'll be able to continue to do the honorable thing…or protect her from the enemies intent on keeping him a werewolf forever.",
