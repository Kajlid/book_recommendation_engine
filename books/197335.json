  "description": "When Fifteen-year-old Raven Wishmore, a member of a secret society devoted to protecting magic, is charged with finding a priceless cauldron hidden in the infamous Saint Cloud Library, she thought her most difficult task would be keeping up her disguise as a gum snapping, skirt wearing flake-of-a-girl. She was entirely unprepared for a chilly reception from her teenage coworkers, the tyrannical library director, and the poor state of the library.The already difficult assignment turns dangerous when magic abusers threaten to destroy Saint Cloud unless they are given the hidden cauldron. If Raven wants to complete her mission and save the library, she’ll have to work with the library staff members—including the mischievous Montamos brothers—and use her taboo magic that she has kept hidden for years: the ability to read things to life.",
