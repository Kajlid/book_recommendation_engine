  "description": "Sometimes a dream might need a rewrite…  Erin Sinclair’s dream of running a successful B&B is on shaky ground. Her tiny Inn is building a good reputation but needs more guest and more good reviews. When a New York Times bestselling author’s agent books the honeymoon suite as a writing retreat it is an opportunity to put The Inn at Sunset Bay on the map. The Nash Bond is coming to her B&B for two months and Erin can hardly believe it. But he has a reputation of being hard to handle when he’s in the midst of a book. And he’s reclusive too. So what is he doing coming to her B&B? And what if she’s unable to satisfy him? What if instead of a good review he gives her a terrible review?  Everything is on the line, is she up for the challenge? She has to be.  Nash Bond needs this book. He needs to get out of the slump he’s in, but a year ago his life changed when he lost his adoptive father, his hero and the words that had once flowed without worry suddenly dried up in his grief. Now his agent is shaking things up by booking him a special room in a special place, her words, and she insist he give it a try. She reminds him his publisher is getting impatient. He knows everything is on the line. He doesn’t like it at all and when he meets the gorgeous, but pushy B&B owner sparks fly. He’s suddenly feeling things he’s never felt before…but with his past he knows all too well that longing for love leaves a person open to pain thus he locked his heart away a long time ago and has no plans to change.  But on the shores of Sunset Bay can romance bloom? Can love heal a broken heart and give him a happily-ever-after he never thought he wanted? Or needed?",
