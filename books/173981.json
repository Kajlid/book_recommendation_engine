  "title": "Saving Orion",
  "description": "In contemporary Hollywood, the kids who don't make it, and many who make it all the way to the top, get thrown away. The deviance, the drugs, the alcohol and the abuse burned into their souls scars them, and it's up to a former throwaway kid to save as many as she can. Saving Orion is the story of Orion Eliot, a child-star, model and beauty of a boy who is spat out of Hollywood's underbelly. After a suicide attempt, his closest friends bring him home to a place of wellness, recovery and safety in the wilds of upstate New York. Here, Lucy Daly runs her private practice, taking in throwaways and seeing them through to health and a return to wellness. Orion will reunite with childhood friends, old flames, and family that transcends blood relation. On the outside, his abusive parents and the paparazzi dig away at his world, but through the strength of his angels, Orion will find the keys to metamorphosis.",
