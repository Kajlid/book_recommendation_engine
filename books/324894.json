  "description": "From the time I joined the Knights of Boudica, I’ve pretended to be just like all the others. A magic specialty or two. Skilled with a blade. An innate sense of justice.But normal is overrated, right?Now that I know there are more ancient and powerful stones out there, I won’t rest until I find them. If that means using more of my magic and risking exposure, then it’s a chance I have to take.My research leads me to a place I never imagined. A place where history is stored.And secrets are revealed.Unfortunately my discoveries put a target on my back. I can’t make a move without a vampire breathing down my neck. Of course, there’s one vampire whose closeness I don’t really mind—if only he wasn’t a dark prince with a deadly past and a monstrous family.If only he wouldn’t kill me on the spot if he finds out what I truly am.With the race on to claim the remaining stones, I have to put my personal feelings aside and do the job I was born to do. These stones could change the world for the better—or they could be the end of us all.",
