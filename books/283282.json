  "description": "\"We are all pawns in the games the gods play\" A forsaken prince. A golden era. An infernal fate. When a prophecy brings a priestess to his humble home, Arme must abandon his tranquil existence to become the nationâ€™s only hope, a celestial warrior tasked with protecting an unborn child carrying an even heavier burden than he. Whispers of invaders threaten the safety of all, testing the bonds of love and the limits of honor, bringing forth the long-forgotten might of the heavens back into the world of mortals. As the flames incinerate all in their path, divided nations and broken families must band together to save the innocent and rise from the ashes of war.",
