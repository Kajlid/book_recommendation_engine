  "description": "Nigel Mullet is just your average fifteen-year-old immortal vampire: he likes to play video games, laze about, awkwardly pursue girls, write in his diary and occasionally save the day. But now Nigel finds himself in charge of the vampire coven on the remote island of Hirta, a responsibility he's not particularly enjoying. He's sick of resolving petty disputes between vampires when he could be using his position to get to know the hot vamp girls who have been increasingly showing interest in him, especially the sultry Lenora. Power does have some other positives, though, such as having the biggest room in Hirta Castle and getting away without doing vampire history homework.",
