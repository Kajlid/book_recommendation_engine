  "description": "Nobody was safe anymore. Huge ships from outer space hung over major British cities and took command by sending orders (disobeyed at risk of death) in strange bubbles. Anarchy is encouraged in an England totally isolated from everywhere else in the world, and the streets are battlefields for communist and fascist bands. Yet it is a summer of wildflowers on the rail-tracks when Pel's strange and wild cousin Frijja comes to stay and everyone has to battle against a mob of hoodlum fascists who try to take over the house. Jane Gaskell introduces a violent world in the not-so-distant future when Englishmen are forced to fight violent forces of darkness among their own people as well as super-powerful extraterrestrials in order to maintain a semblance of civilization.",
