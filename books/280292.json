  "description": "\"My name is Adonia. I am Empress of Zaras and I'm lost. I was in the palace, dreaming of a man I do not know, but who comes to me in dreams and inspires passion unlike anything I've ever imagined.  Or perhaps that's not true. My memory only extends back two years. I don't know why and no one will tell me. Nevertheless, I was safely in the palace when two men appeared. Strangers. I knew they meant me harm. I've been studying Earth history and have been particularly drawn to a city on the North American continent. Los Angeles. When the men came, I wished I could be there, in that cit,y for surely the men who threatened would not find me there.  \"I was right. People here want only to use me as a way to further themselves and their fortunes. They aren't honest or honorable. Well, maybe one is. Dante. He loves me. I care for him but â€¦ but there are faces that haunt my dream and pull at my heart.  \"No matter how much he promises, I do not fit in and I have no family here. I belong with my own kind. And I really want to go home.\"",
