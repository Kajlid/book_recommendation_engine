  "description": "Dani and Levi Blackburn have slid from being in trouble to borderline hell...  They uncover hints of a dangerous conspiracy permeating the very foundation of their society. And people are disappearing, one by one...  If it weren't for Levi’s twisted-genius brother and Charmin Marvin, Dani's talking cat, they wouldn't have gotten this far. At least, not alive.  Only they aren't far enough, because someone is still after Dani – and everyone connected to her.  They need to find a way to expose the massive cover up- and fast… before they are eliminated. Forever.",
