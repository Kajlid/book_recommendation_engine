  "description": "Things have been quiet in Hemlock Cove. That means the Winchesters are due to find trouble.This time, the trouble comes in the form of a dead radio doctor who calls himself Dr. Lovelorn and fixes relationships in distress. Unfortunately for the Winchesters, if he can’t help his normal patients, he’s going to help them… whether they want it or not. Love seems to be the topic of discussion, because in addition to searching for a murderer, Bay Winchester has her hands full dealing with another surprise. It seems Chief Terry, her favorite father figure, is dating… and he’s not opening his heart to her mother as she expected.Bay is trying to be mature, but she always thought Terry would officially become part of her family once the barriers were lifted. To make matters worse, Terry’s new girlfriend wants to be friends… something Bay can’t quite wrap her head around.Thankfully for Bay, she has a murder to focus on. Since Dr. Lovelorn had his fair share of enemies – and a rather unattractive habit of getting too involved with his patients – there are numerous suspects to focus on.Her expanding magic is also an issue, because she can’t quite get a handle on the ghosts that keep popping up… mostly because they’re mouthy and prone to fighting her efforts.Basically, it’s going to be a busy week… if everyone survives to see the end of another convoluted case, that is.It’s all witches on deck for this one, and things are about to get weirder than normal.",
