  "description": "Abigail Johannes wasn't interested in romance. Jake Murphy couldn't stand physical contact. They were perfect for each other. When a troubled young man named Jake moves into the little yellow house, he struggles to overcome a painful past and begin a new life outside the prison walls that he had known for so long. Abby's future is secure â€” or so she had thought. With the prospect of marriage to a childhood friend, and the opportunity to attend college, Abby's life seems already determined. Then the new neighbor arrives, and Abby finds she must learn compassion. As she befriends Jake, the young woman wonders where her future really lies.",
