  "description": "Miguel Rivera had sworn revenge on the creature who had made him less than a man-had sworn to strike him down. Then he met nurse Karen Freed, who reawakened all the best parts of his latent humanity. But Miguel knew he was putting her at risk-and not only from himself. His old enemy Baltazar took an unholy interest in all Miguel's affairs. Karen was a fighter, though. She believed in Miguel. She believed he could be cured of his \"condition,\" that they could have a normal life together. But she hadn't reckoned on Baltazar, who was determined to thwart Miguel-and Karen-till the end of time!",
