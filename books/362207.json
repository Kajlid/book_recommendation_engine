Her father insists they were supposed to move here for some unknown, important purpose, and the voice in her head tells her not to argue.After resigning herself to being a miserable outcast, Tiana finds that she is not only accepted by most of the students at her new high school but is also the recipient of unwelcome attention from the opposite sex.
