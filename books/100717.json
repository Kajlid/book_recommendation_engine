Just when she fears life is doomed, Cassie meets Shane Emerson, the stunningly handsome cowboy who’ll be posing as her newlywed groom.

So why is it when he takes Cassie into his home, Shane wants nothing more than to turn their make-believe marriage into more than just a sham?  In a moment of weakness, Shane steals a kiss. In return, Cassie steals his heart. Yet before they confess their undying love, a hidden danger threatens to tear them apart.*Although this novel is considered clean romance, it does contain passionate kissing and a few mild curse words.",
