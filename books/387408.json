  "description": "Being kidnapped is teaching Miss Celia Seaton a few things about life:Lesson one: Never disrobe in front of a gentleman . . . unless his request comes at gunpoint.Lesson two: If, when lost on the moors, you encounter Tarquin Compton, the leader of London society who ruined your marriage prospects, deny any previous acquaintance.Lesson three: If presented with an opportunity to get back at Mr. Compton, the bigger the lie, the better. A faux engagement should do nicely.Lesson four: Not all knowledge is found between the covers of a book. But an improper book may further your education in ways you never guessed.And while an erotic novel may be entertaining, the real thing is even better.“Sizzling, addictive, and deeply romantic: Miranda Neville’s novels are a joy to read.—Eloisa James“Wickedly sexy and just as witty, Miranda Neville is one to watch!”—Lisa KleypasThe raves keep rolling in for Miranda Neville, a “fresh new voice” (Madeline Hunter) in historical romance.
