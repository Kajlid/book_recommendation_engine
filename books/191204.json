  "description": "\"Garrett O'Mahony would like to be your friend on Facebook.\"  This is new. This is something I never expected to happen.  Garrett has ignored me for the best part of a decade, ever since we lived together, ever since he snuck out of my life, too afraid to admit who he was and how he felt.  Now, Garrett O'Mahony is one of the best rugby players Ireland has seen in years. Back then, he was my roommate; back then, he was just another Irish-man desperately trying to convince himself that he wasn't gay.  I've changed since then. Ireland has changed since then. I don't know if Garrett has changed too. But I guess there's only one way to find out?",
