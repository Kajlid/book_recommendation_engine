When he’s unable to save the life of his wounded medic, the soldier's dying request is for Jack to personally deliver his wedding ring to Laura, his newlywed bride. He vows to do so the moment he returns home. Jack’s been through Hell on earth, while Laura’s a feisty, stubborn survivor of her own personal Hell.
