  "title": "Of Making Many Books",
  "description": "From its beginnings in 1846 in a brick chapel on Park Row to its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s at 597 Fifth Avenue, the publishing firm of Charles Scribner's Sons reflected many of the dominant movements in nineteenth- and twentieth-century American book publishing. Working with the correspondence and business papers of the house, Roger Burlingame prepared this centenary account of the firm in 1946. Filled with lively portrayals of writers and publishers, Of Making Many Books illuminates the professional careers of many Scribner Henry James, Edith Wharton, Joseph Conrad, Robert Louis Stevenson, Harold Frederic, Henry Adams, Rudyard Kipling, George Santayana, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, and others. Burlingame shows publishing from the editorial side as wellâ€”from the perspectives of W. C. Brownell, Maxwell Perkins, and John Hall Wheelock. Out of print for many years, this history of one of America's most venerable publishers is now reissued, with an introduction by Charles Scribner III, on the 150th anniversary of the founding of the house.",
