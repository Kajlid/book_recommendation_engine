  "description": "THE COPYBOOK TALES follows Jamie and Thatcher, two friends with a dream of making comics. When Jamie starts going through his \"copybooks,\" journals he'd kept of his high school misadventures, the two find the inspiration to create stories all their own. Through ups and downs, accomplishments and setbacks, THE COPYBOOK TALES explores the story of storytellers. And while the tale is rooted in the culture that has arisen around comics, it's not about comics, it's about taking the chance to follow your heart. Reprinting J. Torres and GOTHAM ADVENTURES artist Tim Levins' classic comic mini-series, all the mini-comics, and several unreleased pages and illustrations, THE COPYBOOK TALES is a must-have for any comic fan.",
