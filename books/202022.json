  "description": "In 1944, Rosie Ewing is returning to German-occupied France. She's carrying a radio, half a million francs, a pistol, and two cyanide capsules. Her destination is Finist√®re in northwest Brittany. D-Day is not far off, and the Maquis is still dangerously under-armed; part of her brief is to organize immediate para-drops of weaponry. There's also a chateau that's used as a resting place for U-boat crews and where naval top brass periodically gather; Bomber Command needs only a date and a few days notice. Rosie knows that the man who'll be meeting her on the ground tonight may be a traitor, that a frighteningly large number of agents have been arrested recently, and that the likely end of the road for women agents is Ravensbruck. Nothing like a safe bet.",
