Or so she thinks...WHAT THE HELL?Next thing she knows, she's accidentally signed over her soul. Literally.

IT'S A MISADVENTURE.From learning to boost the morale of some paper-pushing demons to navigating her way through blood-red tape, Kate has to work closely with her super-hot supervisor and get her flaky act together, before somebody clocks her out — permanently!",
