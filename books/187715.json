  "description": "Book Two of the Interlands series takes up right where INTERLANDS left off: Historian Angela Morse is trying to keep a secret. At the end of INTERLANDS, she'd spent months searching the forests near Providence for a lost stone obelisk once worshiped by a colonial-era cult that perished at its feet. When she found the monument, Angie realized it contained a malevolent spirit and decided to never reveal its existence. Unfortunately, the supernatural entities awakened by her quest have other ideas … Praise for INTERLANDS: Strong Lovecraftian themes are present throughout the story, most notably cosmicism, and in the end, a few unanswered questions. Lovecraft fans won’t be disappointed. I found the book to be so engaging that I stopped everything and read it from start to finish in one day. -- S.A. Nappa in \"Speculative Fiction Reviews\"",
