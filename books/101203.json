There is a catch — he does not get to pick the memory and, unfortunately for him, he has things in his past that he very much wants to keep hidden.Walking into the White Technologies building to fulfill a prerequisite for his dream job, he hopes the rumors about the company are greatly exaggerated. Because if they are true and the whole process is not a hoax, he doesn’t know if he can face the demons lurking in his shadows.",
