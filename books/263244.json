  "description": "This rhyming picture book encourages children to celebrate their individuality and lets them know that it's okay to play with whatever toys they want to!Girls perform to fairy songs.Boys play football all day long.Boys yell, \"Boo!\" and run away. Girls like kittens and ballet.\nExcept when they don't.\nChildren are often told by many different people about what toys they're supposed to play with, what interests they should have, and who they should be simply because of their gender. This stereotype-breaking book invites children to examine what they're told \"boy\" and \"girl\" activities are and encourages them to play with whatever they want to and to be exactly who they are! This book is published in partnership with GLAAD to accelerate LGBTQ inclusivity and acceptance.",
