  "description": "The night Alexander discovers he possesses the power to control his dreams, he just knows a weird school year awaits him. After he notices random sneakers hanging on electrical wires and other peculiar details from his dreams manifesting in the “waking” world, he realizes he has won the unwanted attention of someone . . . or something. To make matters worse, his father (aka Mr. Workaholic) abandons Alexander on a business trip, leaving him with his grumpy Haitian Grandpa Jean. Alexander is surprised to learn a personal secret of his grandfather’s past—a fatal, guilt-ridden secret that threatens the fate of his family. He follows clues between two places: the “waking” world and the alternate dream world of iridescent clouds, the home of a mysterious Moon Prince and befriends a beautiful girl named Sol, a living sun. And when his mother’s life is used against him, Alexander begins a terrifying chess game to save her and several children trapped in the world of dreams and clouds. With his overactive imagination as his only weapon, Alexander must undo the mistakes of the past to rescue the people he loves",
