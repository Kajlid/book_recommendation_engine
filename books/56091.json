  "description": "Big Sky, Old Bones, and Murderous Obsession. Blue Deer, Montana Has it All...A Cleveland hunter has just shot off his best friend's hand and the first blizzard fo the season was blowing into Blue Deer, Montana, when a camper found an old skeleton on Magpie Island. Sheriff Jules Clement, one-time archeologist, now his hometown's cop, relishes the chance to identify the remains. In a small-town job riddled with gas station robberies and domestic abuse, the bones offer a chance to use his skills..a diversion from a dying love affair..and a break from hunting a rapist who continues to strike. But old bones bring new troubles--the kind that have Jules questioning his own friends and family, stripping away his last illusions about justice...and the kind that can get a lawman killed in a Montana minute.",
