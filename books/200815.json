  "description": "What massive event happened to destroy the world 100 years ago? No one left alive seems to understand. But there is one thing they understand perfectly... When civilization collapses, only the uncivilized survive.  Nobody really knew what catastrophe caused the demise of civilization, only that whatever it was happened 100 years ago. Those first few survivors from many years before were now long gone, leaving behind nothing more than their stories, passed down and embellished over time. Impossible tales, of steel buildings a thousand feet tall and cities of millions, were all that remained. Now the world is a harsh place, filled only with the ruins of an erstwhile time. Hunger and fear are constants for those who remain, while the cold serves as a reminder of mankind’s ultimate frailty. The survivors or this harsh new world trade with each other in bullets and books in their desperate bid to survive at any cost. But when a new danger suddenly surfaces, all of these troubles suddenly seem insignificant. A ferocious band suddenly invades, killing and slaughtering everything in their path in a pitiless frenzy of mindless violence. It seems that nothing can stop them. But there is a place where help can be sought. It is a place which is veiled in mystery and blood. A place connected to the old world and is a place that few have ventured to and fewer still have returned from. It is simply called The Wall-without-Walls and, if anyone is going to survive, then someone must cross beyond the barrier and seek the help they need… Before it’s too late.",
