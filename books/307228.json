  "description": "All I want for Christmas is a fake boyfriend to bring home for the holidays... Find a boyfriend, get married, buy a house in the suburbs with a white picket fence, and pop out 2.5 Sixty days.That’s possible, right?HAHAHA. *Faints*I’m kidding. Well, kind of. I mean, I’m not going to attempt a shotgun wedding or try to get knocked up by some guy I met on the internet, but there is no doubt that, this year, home for the holidays takes on a whole new, terrifying meaning.I have to travel from New York City—my home and safe haven for the last fifteen years—to my tiny hometown in Vermont for Christmas, my baby sister’s wedding, and my high school reunion.Talk about a trifecta of single-doom.Throw in Callie Camden—aka my high school class’s version of Regina George—and it’s a recipe for certified disaster.Especially since my mouth ran away from me when she asked me if I’d be bringing someone to our reunion, and I told her to put me down for two.Now I can’t go alone.But the online dating world is a cesspool of bad manners, speedy hookups, and outright weirdos.Handsome, single, successful—that’s what I’m looking for. And it just so happens that my best friend Luke London fits all of the criteria.The only problem is best friends don’t kiss…But maybe it doesn’t count if it’s pretend?",
