So when the police deem the mysterious death of a Russian woman with rainbow-colored hair a suicide, Robin Harris knows better.  But he soon he finds himself in the middle of an awesome plot that seems to have been lifted directly from one of his father's old Spy Squad episodes, and, as he discovers, his father really was a spy. Now Robin and his brothers have inadvertently walked onto the scene of a real life-and-death spy drama. And as far as the free world is concerned, Robin's entrance into the family business comes not a moment too soon.",
