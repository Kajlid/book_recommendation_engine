  "title": "Obeying Olivia",
  "description": "Mark’s been working as a bartender at the monthly meeting of local female dominants for months. He’s played out scenes, he’s knelt, he’s served to the best of his ability, but he’s still yet to date any woman who inspires inside him a genuine desire to completely submit in the way he’s always desired. There’s one domme at the meetings who Mark longs to submit to—Olivia—but she’s never shown any interest in him, and he knows it’s not his place to approach her. When he suddenly feels someone watching him across the room, Mark doesn’t expect it to be Olivia. He really doesn’t expect the interest he feels in her to be returned either. However, Mark needs to learn to expect the unexpected, once he starts obeying Olivia.",
