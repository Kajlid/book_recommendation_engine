Now self-preservation and protecting my heart have become second nature. But Jameson Strauss... he's my weakness. Give me the occasional shot of tequila, a game of Truth or Dare, and I’ll do almost anything for that man. * Four years ago, I didn’t follow my heart. I let the one girl that consumed my soul walk away without a fight. Now I go through the motions never truly living. But, the day Ashton Sullivan needed me was the day my world changed for the better. Tequila, truths, and the occasional dare are all I need to show her how good we can be. Sometimes the truth is in the dare.  *This book may be read as a standalone but may also contain spoilers. Not intended for anyone under the age of 18*",
