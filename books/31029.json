  "description": "Chosen and Introduced by Dr Keith Carabine, University of Kent at Canterbury, and Chairperson of the Joseph Conrad Society. This specially commissioned selection of Conrad's short stories includes favourites such as \"Youth: A Narrative,\" a modern epic of the sea; \"The Secret Sharer,\" a thrilling psychological drama; \"An Outpost of Progress,\" a blackly comic prelude to Heart of Darkness; \"Amy Foster,\" a moving story of a shipwrecked, alienated Pole; and \"The Lagoon\" and \"Karain: A Memory,\" two exciting Malay tales. \"Il Conde\" and \"The Tale\" are subtle portrayals of bewildered outrage. \"An Anarchist: A Desperate Tale,\" and \"The Informer: An Ironic Tale,\" are sardonic depictions of revolutionaries; and \"Prince Roman\" is a story of magnificent, doomed heroism set in Conrad's native Poland during the Uprising of 1831.",
