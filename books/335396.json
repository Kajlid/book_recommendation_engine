  "description": "It’s been said, \"You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.\" If there is no thirst, the horse will not drink. The same is true for atheists. If there is no thirst for God, there will be no search for truth. Comfort assures us, however, that something more than the evidence of creation must spur the atheist to head for the truth. In this informative and enlightening book, Pastor Ray Comfort, author of the million-selling The Atheist Test, talks to the atheists and reveals not just the weakness of their arguments but the solid foundation upon which the Christian stands. Few books take the time to address the atheist's conscience. You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence not only gives empirical evidence for the existence of God, it shows atheists that they desperately need His forgiveness. Based on conversations Comfort has had with atheists on his blog, this book is an effective approach to questions about the existence of God. Comfort answers questions such This entire stream of conversations between angry, “fundamentalist” atheists and Ray Comfort is witty, intelligent, and thought-provoking. Comfort responds with grace and boldness to each argument, proving without a doubt the existence of a Creator.",
