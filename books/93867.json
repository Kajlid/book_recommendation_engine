  "description": "Outspoken and opinionated, Katherine Sutherland is ill at ease amongst the fine ladies of Regency London. She is more familiar with farmers, and her blunt opinions and rough manners offend polite society. Yet when she hears the scandalous rumours involving her sister and the seductive Duke of Darlington, the fiercely loyal Katherine vows to save her sister's marriage – whatever the cost. Intrigued by Katherine's interference in his affairs, the manipulative Duke is soon fascinated. He engages in a daring deception and follows her back to her country home. Here, their intense connection shocks them both. But the Duke's games have dangerous consequences, and the potential to throw both their lives into chaos… Wildly romantic, Untamed is a passionate and beautifully written debut novel. This decadent historical romance defies convention and will shock and delight in equal measure.   'A strong and original voice, a unique story and characters you won't easily forget — this is an exciting and memorable debut. Anna Cowan is an author to watch.'  Anne Gracie  'One of the most mesmerizing books I've read this year.' Dear Author 'Utterly absorbing, beautifully written, and full of insight and humor.' Ruthie Knox 'Cowan's ability to balance the light and the dark shows what a real talent she is.' Rakehell",
