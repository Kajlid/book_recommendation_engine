Although he should be announcing his engagement of convenience to a neighboring princess, Rachelle is the one he desires in his bed and by his side.While the drop-dead gorgeous Magnus might be almost everything she craves, Rachelle can’t help but think that falling for him would be a royal mistake. He may be ruling a kingdom one day, but she’s in charge of her heart. And he’ll have to win it with more than a lap of luxury—as inviting as it is.",
