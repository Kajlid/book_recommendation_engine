  "description": "Levi Donovan is best friend and wingman to Keanu Lee. He is also his business partner in Limbitless Tees. (There is a pun in there, folks.) Well, he was wingman, but now Keanu has Hope in more ways than one.  Things are changing for this sexy brotherhood … for the better.  Retro has the love of his life, which has turned him into an overprotective caveman. Keanu is a goner. Text is trying his best not to screw things up with his complicated relationship with Faith—it’s a work in progress. Harley’s ‘spidey’ senses are working overtime. And ... Slade has gone MIA, not that Phoenix cares. Not much, anyway.  Damn Behemoth of a man.  Now the crew and the ever-expanding sisterhood are off to spend Thanksgiving in Cedar Hill, Texas with the people they love. Of course, what should have been a relaxing break away from OB turns into more than Levi bargained for.  When the girl he used to trip in elementary school with the mile-long legs and the ice blue hair crosses his path ... Let’s just say Levi is going to put his best foot forward, much to the amusement of the “inner circle.”  For once, Faith isn’t the one behind all the shenanigans; she has handed that baton over. Now she’s into matchmaking.  Oh, and of course there is that ever-pressing question:  Who is Hudson Raine?",
