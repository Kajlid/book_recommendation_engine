  "description": "Dylan McKendrick—the tough, brawny, outspoken CIA field agent—has been exiled from Langley for bending one too many rules.

But when his best friend, undercover CIA agent Brian Keller, is kidnapped in Turkey—and when the Langley bureaucrats refuse to do anything about it—it’s up to Dylan to build a team to bring back his friend.  Only problem is, some of those bureaucrats don’t want Dylan and his friends to succeed—and will stop at nothing to make sure that he fails . . .",
