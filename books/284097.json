  "title": "Inspector West at Home",
  "description": "Chief Inspector Roger West opened his front door to find his Superintendent, Abbott, standing before him. \"I think you know why I've called,\" said Abbott, as he drew a folded piece of paper from his overcoat. It was an official search warrant. Facing a career on the verge of ruin, West must dive into a mystery that involves murder, conspiracy and, most shockingly, corruption at Scotland Yard. Born in Surrey, England in 1908 into a poor family in which there were nine children, John Creasey grew up to be a true master story teller and international sensation. His more than 600 crime, mystery, and thriller titles have now sold 80 million copies in 25 languages. These include many popular series such as Gideon of Scotland Yard, The Toff, Dr Palfrey and The Baron. Creasey wrote under many pseudonyms, explaining that booksellers had complained he totally dominated the 'C' section in stores. Never one to sit still, Creasey had a strong social conscience, and stood for Parliament several times, along with founding the One Party Alliance which promoted the idea of government by a coalition of the best minds from across the political spectrum. He founded the British Crime Writers' Association, which to this day celebrates outstanding crime writing. The Mystery Writers of America bestowed upon him the Edgar Award for best novel and then in 1969 the ultimate Grand Master Award.",
