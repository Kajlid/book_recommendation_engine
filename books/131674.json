  "description": "1977, stated First Edition numbered 17058, light tan cloth hardcover with embossed title on the front cover & black lettering on the spine, with Dustjacket, about 118 pages (no page numbers) printed on heavy paper, fully illustrated with beautiful drawings & etchings, measures about 11 1/4 inches X 12 1/8 inches. \"Incandescent, startling in it's immediacy, God's Images is the combined vision of poet James Dickey and artist Marvin Hayes, who have each made a contemporary journey into the heart of our Judeo~Christian tradition ~ the Holy Bible ~ and have emerged with a powerful new testimony to its truth and majesty. Hayes has chosen as his medium of expression that most delicate and intricate of fine art forms, the etching. Working with small, almost infinitely small gradations, he has painstakingly cross~stitched in copper a magnificent suite of fifty~three scenes and personages from the Old and New Testaments. Responding as poet to Hayes's artistic visions, Dickey has created a series of deeply personal commentaries. The result of this collaboration is both an artistic and religious poet and artist have newly resurrected the men and women of the Bible and have brought them forth, alive and living in our own time. Adam stirring at the dawn of his creation; Moses starting in wonder from the burning bush; Saul wrestling with his soul in a tormented moment; Lazarus rising from his deathbed; Paul blindly seeking Truth on the road to Damascus. Here are Cain, Job, Ruth, Jeremiah, Jonah, Tobias. John the Baptist, Judas, Simon; and at the center, Christ ~ infant, youth, healer, teacher, sufferer, Redeemer. Unique, incomparable, visionary, God's Images is an exultant Biblical illumination for our time.\"",
