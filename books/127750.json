  "description": "Charles Hythloday observes the world from the comfortable confines of his family estate, and doesn’t much care for what he sees. At twenty-four, Charles aims to resurrect the lost lifestyle of the aristocratic country gentleman. But Charles’s cozy existence is about to face a serious shake-up. With the family fortune teetering in the balance, Charles must do something he swore he would never do: get a job. Booted into the mean streets of Dublin, he is as unprepared for real life. And it turns out that real life is a tad unprepared for Charles, as well.",
