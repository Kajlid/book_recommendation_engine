  "title": "The Year After",
  "description": "With unflinching honesty and unsinkable spirit, The Year After offers a rare and intimate portrait of trauma. Inspired by original journal entries, the daily challenges of recovery from rape at the restless age of 24 are artfully interwoven with reflections from early childhood and twenty years beyond in the search for understanding so familiar to those who have wrestled with life-changing upheaval. Now a psychoanalyst, Warner subtly brings a forward-looking perspective to the narrative while remaining true to the arduous journey through emotional volatility, interpersonal conflict, and the tasks of criminal prosecution after the rapist is identified in a lineup. The result is an empowering memoir about the courage to heal and the promise of peace.",
