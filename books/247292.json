  "description": "Stealing an ancient artifact is a strange test, but going up against her family and the law adds a new level of difficulty.   Imara wants nothing more than to find a different course, but Stealth Magic gives her the credits she needs to stay on track and there arenâ€™t any other options rearing their heads. Stealth Magic is not what she thought it would be, and the idea of breaking into a home to rob an ancient artifact for her final exam was a little daunting. Luckily, Imara has friends who are going to help her through training, some old and some new. Through some work with the XIA, she finds a tutor for her training, and a place to do it. Ritual Space offers her a welcome and the inhabitants set themselves to the monumental task of her training. The exam is getting closer and time is a factor. Mr. E just likes chasing the enchanted bunnies of Ritual Space.",
