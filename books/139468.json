  "description": "Long ago in Russia, a proclamation went out through all the land that whosoever could build a flying ship would win the hand of the Tsar's daughter. But when a country bumpkin and his oddball crew of extraordinary friends show up to claim her, the dumbfounded Tsar quickly has second thoughts. This hilarious retelling of a fantastical Russian folktale will be a delightful treat for your family.",
