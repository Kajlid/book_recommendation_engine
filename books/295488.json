She disappeared without a trace—kidnapped—and I’ve made it my personal mission to save her.To call my life complicated would be an understatement, but it gets worse when an old enemy resurfaces and threatens to slaughter the already tenuous peace in our city.The strong have to rise, before life as we know it is stolen.Ancetol is stronger than it appears—and so am I.This Upper YA/NA series is intended for mature audiences. It contains cursing, sexual situations, bullying, and violence.",
