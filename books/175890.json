  "title": "Blues to Blessings: from Fearful to Faithful",
  "description": "By her late thirties, Suzette Webb appears to be living the dream - a husband she loves, three great kids, a beautiful home, and a decent corporate job where she can retire comfortably, but instead of feeling satisfied, she feels trapped between portraying the appearance of success and actually being fulfilled by purpose. On a quest for life's deeper meaning, she risks traveling a new path - overcoming personal, professional, and self-imposed obstacles to achieve transformation and success. This spiritual memoir is her step-by-step journey towards self discovery, but it doesn't come without her having to confront the painful complexities of her past. Humorously honest and shockingly transparent, Blues to Blessings is an interactive spiritual odyssey in which each chapter leaves you craving more.",
