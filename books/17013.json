  "description": "An evil wind blows across the Kingdom of Ark. A powerful sorcerer named Alzedo has rallied the forces of darkness and threatens to unleash a whirlpool of destruction upon the land. Only a conclave of the most powerful wizards can thwart his plans - but King Mark is powerless to convince his people of the coming danger. As a murderous fog paralyzes the island, an ancient prophecy decrees that the fate of the kingdom will depend on Mark's son, the young prince Luke. Following in his father's footsteps, Luke must go to the center of the circle of evil - to rescue his people from a dark enchantment and challenge the greatest enemy Ark has ever known.",
