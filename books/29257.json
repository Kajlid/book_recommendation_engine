  "description": "Bogies, baddies, bagpipes and bums! Farting, false teeth and fun! Gorgeous George and the Giant Geriatric Generator begins when George witnesses something rather disturbing from his bedroom window late one night. Maybe it was a UFO or a ghostly apparition, or maybe it’s even more sinister. Whatever it was, nobody believes him. People are disappearing fast and no one seems to care. Why are the people of Little Pumpington so miserable? Why has his evil teacher started smelling of wee? Why is Mr Watt so fat? Why does Mr Jolly the Janitor collect hundreds of pairs of false teeth in a cupboard in his workshop? And what will happen when mad Kenny sticks two crayons up his nose? During detention George discovers a secret stash of soggy tea-bags and a hundred boxes of broken biscuits hidden in a mysterious tunnel beneath the school. Can his new friend Alison help, even though she’s just ‘a boring girl’? Will Alison’s mum give them money for sweets? Can Gorgeous George (who’s not really gorgeous at all) solve these mysteries with the help of his Grandpa Jock, the wild-haired ginger Scotsman before Grandpa Jock deafens the whole town with his bagpipes? Oh, and do not try the ‘burning brown bag of poo prank’ at home! You have been warned! Gorgeous George & The Giant Geriatric Generator is straight from the (ever so slightly crazy) mind of Stuart Reid. Featuring around 50 wonderful illustrations by UK children's illustrator Calvin Innes. A must read for children (and anyone else) who love crude, rude, exciting, silly, sometimes smelly and humorous books.",
