  "description": "By the year 2123, nearly thirty-million American males all share the name Calvin Eisenberg.A century earlier, in the year 2047, an object appears without sound, without any witnesses, and without any warning. Through a confession three decades later, it is revealed that a human perished in the object and his name was Calvin Eisenberg. Few details are released regarding the object but speculation runs rampant. Conspiracies and theories all begin to point towards one defined possibility; that of time travel.Soon, time-travel hysteria takes grip of the nation. Wanting their children to succeed and become the 'one' Calvin Eisenberg who travels back in time, millions of parents rename their children. The workforce is flooded with Eisenbergs. Colleges of Engineering cannot support the sheer volumes of applicants. Everybody has the same end goal - to be THE Calvin Eisenberg.But what happens when you are born into poverty? What happens when you have little education and no relative work experience? When you are simply one of millions of other Calvin Eisenbergs, you are left with one of two options: fade into obscurity like so many others, or take what is rightfully your own. For Calvin V. Eisenberg from Raleigh, North Carolina, the choice becomes clear. History has selected him to become the one who travels back in time and he will go to any lengths to ensure it.",
