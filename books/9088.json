  "description": "Amanda is a lonely little girl. Her mother means well, but doesn't have a lot of time for a 9-year-old and, after plenty of begging from Amanda, agrees to let her have a pet. Amanda chooses a ferret (and names her Peach) because ferrets aren't ordinary and, darn it, neither is she! But her mom sets up Two Big Rules: 1) Amanda has to care for Peach, and 2) Peach can't ever bite Amanda. It seems like Amanda finally has the friend she's needed... but Peach sees Amanda's hands as five-serpent monsters - and bites in what she thinks of as self-defense! What will little, lonely Amanda do now if her mom finds out her new best pet is actually a biter?!",
