  "description": "Shawn McDaniel is an enigma and a miracle except no one knows it, least of all his father. His life is not what it may seem to anyone looking at him. Not even those who love him best have any idea what he is truly like. In this extraordinary and powerful first novel, the reader learns to look beyond the obvious and finds a character whose spirit is rich beyond imagining and whose story is unforgettable.\nMy life is like one of those \"good news-bad news\" jokes. Like, \"I've got some good news and some bad newswhich do you want first?\" \nI could go on about my good news for hours, but you probably want to hear the punch line, my bad news, right? Well, there isn't that much, really, but what's here is pretty wild. First off, my parents got divorced ten years ago because of me. My being born changed everything for all of us, in every way. My dad didn't divorce my mom, or my sister, Cindy, or my brother, Paulhe divorced me. He couldn't handle my condition, so he had to leave. My condition? Well, that brings us to the guts of my bad news.",
