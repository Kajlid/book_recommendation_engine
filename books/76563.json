  "description": "Stalinist Poland. The terrors of the Second World War yet reverberate nearly a decade since its close. In the small village of Maljenka, a man is arrested for making an anti-Stalinist remark, but his punishment is not the gulag. Rather, it takes the form of a decrepit barn, deep in the wooded canopy beyond Nadmorski Park off the Baltic coast, where four other men serve their own sentences under the eyes of a small cluster of guards. Nameless, all of them, the four men traverse each day away from the barn, returning at dark, and never speak to their new consociate of what comprises their hours away. In ignorance blooms the seed of terrible possibility. Until an event of perfect cruelty leaves the guards no choice but to add this fifth man to the work detail and to trek him alongside the others to where lies a truth as horrifying as any event since the travails of the war.The Remark is a story of the radiating effect of postwar occupation and of what sustains the human spirit in the stark face of forced labor, and, ultimately, a song for the anonymous thousands lost like ash on the sea.",
