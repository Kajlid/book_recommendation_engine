  "description": "Tika is not like the other princesses on Fathara. With her wild hair, pointy ears, and disheveled appearance (not to mention the collarless sand tiger who follows her around), it is hard for her to make and keep friends. To complicate things further, Tika discovers she is more than Human, with surprising abilities. And all she wants to be - is normal. Yet the very abilities that set Tika apart are the very things that Fathara needs to save it from destruction. For Mortan has been searching for Tika â€¦ and he wants her dead.",
