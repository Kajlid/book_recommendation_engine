  "description": "When I was three-years-old, I was found homeless in the woods, alone and feral.  When asked how I survived all of those years by myself, I had one answer: the Shadow Man.  I have no memory of that time. No memory of anything, really, before the accident. I rely on stories from my fathers about this supposed imaginary friend.  Got into a fight at school? The Shadow Man made me. Stole from a store? He forced me to. Snuck out of the house? He came with me.  I had almost completely forgotten about him.  Until I move into the horror house - the house rumored to be a gateway to hell. Strange things keep happening, and I am helpless to prevent them.  More importantly, people keep dying.  Particularly, people that harm me.  Itâ€™s already a struggle to survive a new high school and town (including the attention of a dangerous gang), but now I have to survive ghosts too?  One thing becomes painstakingly clear:  The Shadow Man wants me to come home.   This is a young adult, slow-burn, horror reverse harem romance. It is the first in a series and WILL end in a cliff-hanger!",
