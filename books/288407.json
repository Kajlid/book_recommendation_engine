  "description": "Dear Very Hot Crazy Woman,You didn’t have to call the cops on me.I was just looking after my niece.Okay… maybe I shouldn't have been spying on her date. But I know how teenage boys think and what they want.Did it make you feel good scolding me in front of everyone for just being a good uncle?Because damn, you sure looked good doing it. I’m almost positive you were cussing me out and if I understood a lick of Spanish, I’d have shut you up with a kiss told you exactly what I thought about your meddling, even if you are her teacher.In fact, I’d like to schedule a date over dinner and wine parent teacher conference to discuss our differing views on raising the youth of today so we are on the same page when we have children—preferably together.Your Future HusbandMason Brisken",
