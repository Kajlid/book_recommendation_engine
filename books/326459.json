  "description": "Miss Tolliver a woman of great practicability had little use for romantic fiddle-faddle. But when she was kidnapped, and mistaken for an actress that, her orderly world went scandalously atilt.It wasn't the abduction that perturbed the lovely Miss Margaret. That was merely a prank by two brothers so charming that she spent the night at an inn nursing their wounds. Rather, it was the arrival of their imperious elder brother, the suave ladies' man and elegant Earl of Manfield, that sent Miss Tolliver into a tizzy. By morning, even local busybodies surmised that hey had spent all night at the inn alone - together! Whereupon the earl promptly announced that he and Miss Tolliver were betrothed. And so the prim miss became an unwilling leading lady in a romantic charade that neither amused nor interested her in the least - or, so she thought!",
