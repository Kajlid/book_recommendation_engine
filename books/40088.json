  "description": "Book One in the Arda Collection Kidnapped from Earth by sex-slavers, Elise Ashton is rescued by a space knight with midnight hair and obsidian eyes. Maddened with desire, Ki Tul'Mar puts his life on the line to win his soul's mate, even knowing he'll have to go to war to claim her from the slaver prince. A galactic battle for the freedom of one woman. An unwitting betrayal with deadly consequences. A passion so primitive it brings to life a legend that will change a world. When Ki and Elise join in a hot union beyond erotic fantasy, they make more than love, more than a couple... and more trouble than they bargained for.",
