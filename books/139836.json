  "description": "HE CAME FOR A DREAM, BUT FOUND A NIGHTMARE. By the thousands they come, searching for a better life, hoping for the dreams to materialise. Mayo man Thomas Fox is just one of these dreamers. After borrowing money from Eddie McGoldrick, the local Irish hood, so his family in Ireland could visit him, Fox is now paying it back with hard work in The Starlight Club, a nightclub in the Bronx owned by McGoldrick. One day, however, Sean McGoldrick, Eddie's nephew and psychopath, offers Fox a job he can't refuse â€“ going up to Boston as the driver to execute members of a rival gang. Fox turns it down, but the stresses of working in the club and the pressure from his Irish-American girlfriend for a better material life become too much for him. Reluctantly Fox accepts, and it is this one act that begins a spiral of violence in the Irishman's life that he has little hope of escaping from. This violent crime thriller sprinkled with dark Irish humour is set in 1980's NYC when it was a very dangerous place to be.",
