  "description": "How do you find a ponygirl? There may be some young women out there who actually want to become a ponygirl, but they are likely to be rare, and more importantly they are likely to be very submissive. Interestingly it has been proven that the best ponygirls are more spirited girls.You will not be surprised to learn that a top quality ponygirl candidate can be selected and obtained from the population at large.Neither Brin nor Mia thought of themselves as ponygirl candidates. Their knowledge of this area was very limited, and certainly it was not appealing to either of them. That is why the ponygirl candidate is not involved in the ‘recruitment’. Brin and Mia were both selected and obtained. Each will do everything in their power – which is limited – to fight back and escape from this destiny.Is there any chance of escape? These are two very strong willed assertive young women. Neither can even believe that they have been turned into an animal. They also quickly learn that obedience is required and that they must do as their trainer demands. Failure to do so quickly becomes painful, very painful.With their arms locked in a restraint across the middle of the back; with a control line threaded through the nasal passage to rings just below the nose; with shackles imbedded in the flesh to provide control points; dressed in heel less boots with a horse shoe on the bottom; and with a tail secured by means of a protrusion imbedded in the back body passage, large, strong, athletic, and headstrong girls find that they had virtually no control. What will they do?This book contains adult content. It involves domination, humiliation, bondage and corporal punishment. 97,000 words.",
