  "description": "Roman prefect, Pontius Pilate, is sent on an unwilling errand for Caesar; subdue the Judean province and establish undisputed roman rule. But dangers from religious zealots and political scheming are nothing. A nightmare being; only whispered of in the ancient tales of the Greeks, reveals itself. As the world he once knew shatters, Pontius must decide; do battle with the malevolence, or flee.Absolom Rex is a unique work in the world of the horror genre.

What makes Absolom Rex truly unique is the subtle warping of historical fact into riveting and entertaining fiction.Absolom Rex will entrance and entertain both history buff and casual reader alike.
