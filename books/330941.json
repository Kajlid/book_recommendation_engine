  "description": "Twin brothers, Zakan and Javek have been chosen by the god Aztra to save the Chrêt race from annihilation. The twin planets Saecula and Trychnos have a galaxy’s wealth of gemstones beneath their surface. The Chrêt on Trychnos have despoiled their planet by mindless quarrying and their ruthless Leader, Rhondal, plans to invade Saecula to do the same.But powerful forces in both the living and the dead of the Seven Worlds have sworn to destroy Trychnos and the Chrêt race if this happens.Deep within the bowels of Trychnos lies a magical mirror, made of one perfect diamond by the god Aztra herself. Whoever gazes into Aztra’s Mirror—if they survive the Mirror’s gazing back into them—will have power beyond their wildest dreams. If they do not survive, they will pay a price beyond imagination.Zakan and Javek want no more than to live as simple acolytes to the Grand Vizier in their pastoral village. But the god Aztra herself calls them to the challenge of the Mirror. Driven by Aztra’s calling, aided by saints, sinners, sorcerers, and the dead of both planets, they set out to find Aztra’s Mirror and use its power to save the Chrêt.If they fail both planets and the Chrêt race will cease to exist.But the Mirror has its price. And it will be paid.",
