  "description": "At one of the most conservative colleges in the country — Brigham Young University, where both angst and premarital sex are verboten — returned missionary David Them and his flamboyantly Texan roommate Curses Olai set out to pen a rock opera about the ultimate quest for the twentysomething Mormon male: avoiding matrimony. There’s just one problem. Dave’s best friend since age five, lacrosse player Martha “Referee” Plantree, is a girl — and Ref is on a quest of her own ...Full of delightful absurdities at every turn, Byuck also offers surprisingly tender and insightful meditations on love, lust, friendship, and marriage ... and in the process, provides definitive proof that men and women can be friends, as long as the woman holds a lacrosse stick.“If you ever wanted to know what would have happened if Godot had shown up, read Byuck, wherein coffee tables are transgressive and Billy Joel claims to be innocent. I LOL’d. For real. Not like you do online where you just kind of huff with a mouth twitch. No, I totally LOL’d. Woke up the cat.” — Moriah Jovan, author of The Proviso and Magdalene",
