  "description": "They are 100 short notes of progressive ideology. These thoughts aroused from Zen, Sufi, and Kabbalistic wisdom baptized in Vedantic doctrines.They are random thoughts when my mind meditated on words which lay in a sublime realm. Words flowed freely from the Upanishad Ganges by the Grace of my Masters who imbibed me in Spiritual Ocean from their Merciful Heart.These thoughts were widely appreciated in social networks. Due to this inspiration, I chose to compile them all into a concise book and put forth appropriate images to enhance the quality of concepts.",
