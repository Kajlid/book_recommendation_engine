  "title": "Confessions of a Counterfeit Farm Girl: A Memoir",
  "description": "A laugh-out-loud memoir about a city slicker who discovers that Manolos and manure just don't mix.At her husband's prompting, suburban mom and New York career woman Susan McCorkindale agreed to give up her stressful six-figure job. Together, they headed down south to a 500-acre beef farm, and never looked back. Well, he didn't look back. She did. A lot. From playing spot the religious billboard on the drive to rural Virginia, to adapting to a world without Starbucks, to planning bright-orange hunter-resistant wardrobes for the kids (We moved here to get away from the madness of Manhattan only to risk getting popped on our own property?), this is her hilarious account of how a city girl came to love, or at least tolerate, country life.",
