  "description": "Be careful who you root forWhen a violent, decades-long feud between two powerful men comes to a head in the small settlement of Bladestay, Colorado, cunning resident Theo Creed must use her wits to stay alive. Disguising herself as a young boy, seventeen-year-old Theo bluffs her way into the inner circle of August Gaines, the magnetic leader of the ruthless gang that has descended on her town. But the deeper Theo gets into the con, the more she starts to question her loyalties. Complicating her subterfuge is a mysterious outlaw whose small moments of kindness contradict the blood he has on his hands, making Theo wonder who, exactly, is conning who. To save her town, Theo must parse facade from reality and choose between the barefaced malevolence she’s infiltrated and an evil she didn’t know lurked at home. For readers who enjoy No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy and Under a Painted Sky by Stacey Lee.",
