Forced to face obstacles and relinquish our demons we'll come together--or fall apart-- to prove our existence: Hollyn: The perpetually hurtDaisy: The sheltered and na√ØveJace: The athlete with a heart of goldCarter: The bitter and pained dreamer Win big or lose it all, we're at a crossroads in our lives; four strangers meeting in the middle. Do we have what it takes to use this one chance and start over? Or will we fall apart?",
