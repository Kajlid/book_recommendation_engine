  "description": "This omnibus collection of Thomas Ott’s short shock-ending horror stories —imagine E.C. Comics done with no words, and executed in an impossibly lush black-and-white scratchboard style—collects material originally published in three (now out of print) thin European style “graphic albums” during the 1980s and 1990s, plus a few extras.Presented in the same deluxe format as the now sold-out Cinema Panopticum (for which a softcover release is planned for 2011) and The Number 73304-23-4153-6-96-8, R.I.P. offers up an even dozen tales of murder, suicide, oppression, terror, mutilation, crime, marital strife, and nuclear annihilation.",
