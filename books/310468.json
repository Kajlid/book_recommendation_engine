  "title": "Sarabande",
  "description": "Sarabande is a novel of struggle and conflict, as much Janna's - as she wrestles with her choices - as her native Bosnia's. As Sarajevo and her family suffer, will she be able to remain in London, however passionate her commitment to her work and relationship there? She is determined not to get drawn into the unfolding tragedy, despite the fact that her parents remain there, in serious danger. But the brutal war won't let her forget, and she finds herself - despite everything she is working for - unable to escape her past and the consequences of her country's history. Sensitive but hard-hitting, Sarabande paints a vivid portrait of events that shocked the world.",
