  "description": "\"McKinney-Whetstone uses her gift for language to weave a love story that spans more than twenty years and three lives. . . .  Blues Dancing  is a novel well worth curling up with a long winter’s night.\" — Essence From acclaimed writer Diane McKinney-Whetstone, a richly spun tale of love and passion, betrayal, redemption, and faith, set in contemporary Philadelphia. My aunt says if you smell butter on a foggy night you're getting ready to fall in love. For the last twenty years, the beautiful Verdi Mae has led a comfortable life with Rowe, the conservative professor who rescued her from addiction when she was an undergrad. But her world is about to shift when the smell of butter lingers in the air and Johnson—the boy from the back streets of Philadelphia who pulled her into the fire of passion and all the shadows cast from it—returns to town. In \"this story of self-discovery that moves seamlessly between the early 1970s and early 1990s\" ( Publishers Weekly , starred review), McKinney-Whetstone takes readers into a world of erotic love, drugs, and political activism, and beautifully illustrates the struggle to reconcile passion with accountability and the redemptive powers of love's rediscovery.This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.",
