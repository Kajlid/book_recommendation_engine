  "description": "Victor Scalia was no Tony Soprano- oh, he was a mob boss, to be sure. But the comparisons stopped there. When Victor had troubles with his immediate family, he didn't go to a psychiatrist; he took off his belt and dealt with the troublemaker who was almost always his sister, Patty - through strict, loving corporal punishment.But orphan Lily was, originally, too intimidated by the big man when the family adopted her. Now that she'd grown up, though . . . all bets were off. The perfectly behaved little girl was a thing of the past.And she was going to live to regret her misbehaviors; Victor would see to that- if she didn't get herself kidnapped and/or killed first.",
