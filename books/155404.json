  "description": "Roxanne has suffered a concussion after a severe bump to the head, but that's okay - she's having the best hallucination ever. It involves being rescued by an incredibly handsome man who can turn into a wolf and lusts after her like no man ever has before. No, really - in her home town, plain, chubby Roxanne was lusted after by no-one. Her handsome shifter hallucination is so hot, she finds herself wishing she'd never recover. Steele Battle, wolf shifter, Sheriff of Timber Valley, has met the love of his life - and he must leave her behind, with her memory erased, because she's human and can never know about the existence of his people. A year later, he's still mourning the loss of the woman who captured his heart - when she strolls in to the bar in his remote, out of the way town, which is not on any human map. How did she find him, and what does she want? To keep her safe, Steel has no choice but to hold her captive until the town's shaman returns to erase her memory for good - but will Steele be able to part with the love of his life a second time?",
