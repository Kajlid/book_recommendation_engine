  "description": "Los Angeles, 1988… thirteen years have passed since the events in THE BLUE PARROT… Crusading attorney Paul Winters has settled into a quiet life representing AIDS patients as the disease takes a deadly toll in the community. But his peaceful existence is shattered when a brutal bathhouse murder and a briefcase stuffed with blackmail money propel him into a nightmare world of fear and danger. Against the backdrop of 1980s AIDS activism and depraved government indifference, Paul and investigator Jim Blake embark on their final case. As they follow the clues, Paul and Blake are hunted by murderous adversaries who will stop at nothing to bring them down. And they are ultimately forced to examine their past choices—and to ask… is it too late for us? THE RED RAVEN is the fourth book in the Lambda Literary Award nominated series The L.A. AFTER MIDNIGHT Quartet, a four-book four-decade spanning saga of gay life from the 1950s to the 1980s in the City of Angeles. In order to fully enjoy the series, the author recommends reading the books in the order they were written, starting with THE YELLOW CANARY.",
