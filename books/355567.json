  "description": "Her marriage is over. Her newspaper career went belly up. And it won't be long before her two teenage sons are off to college... and then what? Sometimes it seems like the only thing Ginger Garrison can count on is her beloved Bichon Fris√© and the loyal women in her dog-walking group. But her luck is about to take a wild turn. . .\nA diplomatic snafu has sidelined the globe-trotting nature photographer Lucio \"Lucky\" Montevez, a man known as much for his wild personal life as his wildlife images. Now stuck in the States and forced to shoot pet portraits for a living, his prospects look downright tame... until Ginger enters his world (along with her boys, her spoiled pooch, and her egomaniacal ex-husband). Lucky's always been a love-her-and-leave-her kind of guy, but something about the spirited, sensual Ginger makes him want to stick around. But will Lucky's playboy past end up costing him the only woman he's ever really loved?",
