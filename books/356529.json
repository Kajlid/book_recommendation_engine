She returns to Sri Lanka, the country of her birth, seeking out the \"beach people\" who scratch a living from the beautiful coastline. Aruni yearns to know more about her mother, Mala, who grew up on the beach.In the comfort of her hotel, Aruni flirts with Paul, an older, married Australian man, but she is also drawn by the careless, laughing attentions of the handsome beach boys. Happy for the first time in her life, Aruni thinks she has found the place where she belongs. But as reluctant relatives mine their memories, and the story of Mala's tragic life unfolds, it becomes clear that, for Aruni, belonging will never be that easy.",
