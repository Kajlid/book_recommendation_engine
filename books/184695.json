  "description": "THE BLADES OF KHAZAK KHRIM MARCH FOR VENGEANCE. WHO CAN STAND AGAINST THEM?  The Dwarves of Khazak Khrim, rulers of the Vvath Empire, thirst for war against the Chosen and their allies. The only way for Gavin to prevent a war that will drown the continent in blood is to lure the Vvath into a decisive engagement. But his allies have plans of their own. Sadira thirsts to avenge the death of a lost Hearthbound, Goldfin seeks to avoid the grasp of her enemies, and no one can be certain what the new Chosen, the Gladiator once known as Blue Hornet, will do. Their foes are the invincible warriors of The Blood, the warrior nobility of a fortress that withstood the Reckoning itself, and the Sword-Bearers, fanatics whose spirits are bound to blades that can possess those who touch them.  The Shugothoth lurks. The Legions sharpen their swords. The drums of war beat. The Hundath howl. The Blades of Khazak Khrim come. Are you ready?",
