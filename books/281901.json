  "description": "FAMILY FEUDThe feud between the Barons and the Murdocks spanned generations...Jill Baron was determined to make the Utopia ranch work - for herself and to justify her grandfather's trust in her. Her heritage was important, and if making the ranch a success meant working twice as hard, then she'd triple her efforts.Aaron Murdock wasn't a man who asked - what he wanted he took. Jillian Baron was someone he wanted...very much. And he didn't like wanting anyone quite that badly. What he liked even less was that he might not succeed in getting her.It was no longer a matter of taking and taming, but of wooing and winning.",
