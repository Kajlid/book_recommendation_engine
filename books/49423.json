  "description": "When those in the intelligence community gather to drink, they joke about the myth of the Oiorpata, beautiful assassins trained in seduction and programmed to kill using firearm, knife, bare hands, or a myriad of seemingly benign objects with equal ease. The Oiorpata have practiced their deadly art undetected. Until now.The United States and the western world have won the Cold War. Or have they?When Ben Gordon, CIA Station Chief, sets out to recreate a blown network of agents, a minor KGB clerk tells him of a mole in the highest ranks of the CIA. Ben sets out to identify the mole and along the way meets a woman who helps him, or does she?The more Ben learns of the plot, the more enormous it becomes. Every discovery proves to be ephemeral, vanishing to reveal something more monstrous and far more dangerous. Behind it all, Soviet Spymaster Alexei Karkarin uses the world as a chess board, now feinting a move, now sacrificing a man to gain a queen, always anticipating the future, and with one goal. To conquer the world.Their memory erased, programmed to hear and obey only the Good Words, the Oiorpata are perhaps the most deadly creatures ever imagined. The woman known as 57-J is the best. Except for one little thing. Of all the Oiorpata, only she retains a wisp of memory.",
