  "description": "“Give me a memory, Noah.” That’s what she said … the woman who rendered me stupid in the shadows at a wedding reception. I did everything I could to figure her out. She wore more veils of armor than I’ve seen in a lifetime. On the outside, she was strong and self-assured. But within those beautiful, guarded blues? She was laced with vulnerability and grief. We had one night. The best night. She got the memory she wanted, but in the process, I was left branded.Then she thought she could strut out my front door and my life, right after announcing she was my boss’s baby sister.  I had no choice but to follow. Not only did I go after her, I chased her halfway around the world. Because when it comes to her, one memory isn’t enough. It doesn’t matter that there couldn’t be a more opposite pair than us.  Gracie Cain is a healer. I’m Noah Jarvis, a cold-hearted killer.  But when my job came back to bite me in the ass, I wasn’t the only one caught in the crossfire. It bought us memories no one was counting on.That’s when all the veils were ripped off.",
