  "description": "Views from the The Journey of a Son is a memoir born from pain. Page by page, year by year, tender father-son memories of airplane watching transform into nightmarish, turbulent family drama. Upon the discovery that his father had been the victim of severe elder abuse as his health was rapidly deteriorating, the author finds himself reevaluating the decisions his father made throughout his life. With an unshakable ending, the author's probing dissection of a man he thought he knew reckons with disloyalty, depression, religion and death, leaving no stone unturned. Through sharp, sometimes hilariously brash analysis, decorated in plane metaphors and imagery, the author expresses his commitment to truth with sincerity and transparency. He reaches for forgiveness, understanding and compromise in the face of absurdity and uncompromising rigidity. Ultimately, he contemplates a different \"flight path\" drawn from past lessons. He encourages readers to do the same. A must-read for sons, fathers and families. Book-club discussion guide included.",
