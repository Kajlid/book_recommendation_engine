  "title": "The Jews' Beech",
  "description": "Based on a true story, this haunting tale centers on two brutal murders—the first of a local forester and the second of a Jewish moneylender near a beech tree—and the impact these events have on the life of Friedrich Mergel, a herdsman with a turbulent family history. A prototype of the murder mystery and a thoughtful examination of village society, this intriguing novella contains hints of the Gothic and the uncanny, including ominous thunderstorms, mysterious disappearances, eerie doppelgangers and grizzly discoveries, as well as a famously ambiguous climax.",
