On their travels, Devil and Moon Boy are beset by dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes, from triceratops and pterodactyls to tyrannosaurus rex...not to mention giant spiders, armies of enormous ants, and even aliens from outer space! And don't forget the Small Folk, led by the warlord Seven Scars, who rejected Moon Boy for befriending the fearsome Devil and who aim to dominate the forest by force! But in the end, what wins the day is Devil and Moon Boy's courage, friendship and fierce loyalty to each other! Relive Kirby's most offbeat saga ever in its prehistoric prime!
