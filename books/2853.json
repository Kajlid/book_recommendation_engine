  "title": "Rock 'N' Roll Mole",
  "description": "Mole has a rock 'n' roll soul. He wears a leather jacket (even in summer) and shades (even at night), and he can strut just like his idol, Mick Badger. But then Mole's friend Pig plans a talent show and, to everyone's shock, Mole refuses to play. He's a rock star, see-just as long as no one's watching. The night of the big show, Pig is ready for his sizzling dance number, but wait-his iPod's broken! Can Mole step up and save his friend's rep, or will the bright lights and big crowds make him shake in his shades?This tale of loyalty and self-esteem crackles with rockin' comedy for every generation-perfect for every kid, and their parents and grandparents",
