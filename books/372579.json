  "description": "Framed as a discussion between a pastor six months out of seminary and a veteran pastor, this book tackles the issues of how churches grow and how church size determines effective strategy for ministry. The pastors Saturday morning dialogues reveal ten areas that will help readers understand their own churchs psychology, addressing questions such -How do churches grow?-How does change take place?-What is the churchs orientation?-How is the church structured?-Who sets the direction?-What is the pastors role? This is a vital resource for any new pastor, church planter, or lay leader concerned about his or her local church. Each chapter concludes with a Taking It Home segment.",
