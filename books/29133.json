  "description": "Riley Mansfield is not your typical hero. He writes songs for a living, smokes pot for recreation and just wants to live and let live. But when he foils an apparent terrorist plot to blow up a small plane over his hometown of Greenville, South Carolina, he is thrust into the spotlight, which is exactly where he doesn t want to be.Suddenly, everyone wants a piece of him, including both major political parties. They aren t willing to take no for an answer, partly because it s an election year and partly because what happened on the plane may be a bit more complicated than it appears.Emboldened by his own obstinacy, Mansfield and his girl Friday, Melissa Franklin, lead the government and the Republicans on a sometimes merry, sometimes painful, sometimes lucky chase. Along the way, they stumble across unlikely friends a Democrat strategist, a Rolling Stone writer, a pair of sympathetic FBI agents and ruthless enemies. Theirs is a love affair of sex, drugs and country-folk set against a backdrop of political scheming, hidden agendas and an unraveling plan to maintain control of the government.The American people deserve to know the truth, and it s up to Riley to tell them...if he can live long enough to get the chance.",
