  "description": "Darryl Cook is a man who seems to have a quiet home in Western Oregon, a beautiful wife, and a lot of friends to fuck her while he watches. But as he explores the cuckolding lifestyle, he finds himself tugging at threads that threaten to unravel his marriage, his town, and himself.With empathy and humor, debut author Jackie Ess crafts a kaleidoscopic meditation on marriage, manhood, dreams, basketball, sobriety, and the secret lives of Oregonians.\"Underneath the sharp satire and hilarious sexual irreverence, this is a deadly serious a brilliant novel of a seeker, like The Pilgrim's Progress refracted by queer internet culture.\"-Torrey Peters, author of Detransition, Baby",
