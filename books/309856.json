  "description": "Children will sympathize with bad-kitty Piper Paw when he refuses to wear the clothes his mother sets out, squirms from her when she smothers him in kisses, and won't eat when she desperately tries to please him with his favorite foods.Through every disruptive means available to him -- slingshots, stink bombs, spiders, pea shooters. and firecrackers -- young Piper manages to earn the wrong kind of attention from parents, teachers, anti classmates. It ultimately takes a fight in the schoolyard to bring Piper's problems to a head. When Mrs. Paw reacts with her usual caring but overly protective ways, Piper comes back at her with angry words, and both feel hurt anti misunderstood.Finally, Piper takes a big step toward truly growing up by giving up some of his childish pranks and learning to let his mother know, in his own way, that he loves her, but that he is uncomfortable with too many kisses! Throughout this entertaining tale. Tomi Ungerer's expressive, imaginative illustrations show each character's deeper feelings as both Piper and his mother finally learn to respect each other's preferences.",
