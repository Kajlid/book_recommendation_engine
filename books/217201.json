The trouble is, when is a win truly a win—and when is a win the worst thing that could happen to you?  Jimmy Brewer is a middle school boy. Everyone knows he is small and bullied, but nobody knows he is transgender. Then, with the help of a loving mother, friend, and doctor, Jimmy begins exploring life as the girl she should have been all along.  And then Mrs. Brewer wins the lottery, and everything changes. People who were strangers want to be friends. People who were friends, aren’t. What was impossible is now possible, but it’s also possible that a criminal from the past will destroy the new mother and daughter’s future.",
