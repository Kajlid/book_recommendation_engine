  "description": "From the back cover:\"Somewhere in the unknown country was the man she loved and had risked everything to find again .... proud and beautiful Anna Haynow could hardly remember the luxury and gracious aristocratic life she had known in Europe. In a heartbreakingly short time, all that had been swept away by the currents of intrigue and the winds of war. Now she was a stranger in a strange land -- America, where marauding armies ravaged the countryside and no place promised her safety. Somewhere was the man who had once loved her dearly -- the man who would make her desperate gamble worthwhile, or mock her folly. Somewhere in the storm of conflict around her lay the happiness she sought, or the doom she could not escape.\" This is a novel of early America.",
