Allie is a runner and her latest job should go down easy pickup, easy payoff-- easy money. But in a bar outside Seattle, everything goes horribly wrong. Allie finds her contact with a bullet in his brain-- and a government-issued Colt in his jacket.Suddenly Allie has a killer on her trail, and the computer disk he killed for burning a hole in her pocket. For Allie, it's a cross-country journey through the Cascade Mountains to the winding back roads of Montana and into the darkest corners of a country's secret history. Because somewhere between the killing fields of Vietnam and the wide-open heartlands of America, a horrifying truth is buried. A truth about a people, a war, and one woman's past. A truth Allie may not survive...",
