  "description": "***Silver Medal Winner for Readers' Favorite International Book Award for Young Adult-Fantasy*** 2016Above a small hill lay a home.And green men peer out under the dome.Thirteen crisscrossing arches behold,with angels singing must be told.Cubes like teeth thus showed,pierce one and the door shall glow. Part the sea like Moses, to see the bundle of red roses.Only then you shall see,what is destined to be free.But beware, if you are not the heir,for damnation you shall declare, for the false burden you shall bare.Eli, Lucia’s half-demon love interest, has been stabbed with a true-cross dagger and captured by Cyrus, master of the possessor demons. The Chosen Knights must work together once again not only to save Eli, but also to decipher a clue to find the second missing page of Jacques de Molay’s journal. Meanwhile, Uncle Davin informs Crossroads’ Divine Elders of the danger ahead and learns there is much to fear. Countless children are being taken from all over the world to be turned into demons. Michael has no choice but to intervene. The Chosen Knights track down Mortem, the demon who is the key to finding Cyrus, and learn they must travel deep into the pit of a Hawaiian volcano. When they astral travel to the past in search of a clue and follow Jacques de Molay to Rosselyn Chapel in medieval Scotland, what they find will rewrite history.",
