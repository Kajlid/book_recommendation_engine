Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device. Have you heard about Chakras but aren’t sure what they are and how they can improve your life? The fact is that Chakras are energy points located throughout the body. When one of points becomes blocked, energy cannot flow as it is intended to flow. Thus, there are certain actions that you can take to heal the flow and make sure that the Chakra is cleared. This book assumes that you are a beginner. It explores where the Chakras are located and what each one of them does to your sense of wellbeing. When you learn that, you also learn to respect your posture, your interaction with others, and increase your self-esteem levels by making sure that the Chakras are always in perfect alignment. Although you may be a little doubtful about whether this really works, it has been proven over centuries and is not something new. Those who have been able to keep the Chakras open to the flow of energy that life offers them, tend to be healthy and happy. This book is written to help you to achieve that same level of happiness that is available for all, but that few achieve because of their own inadequacies. The book explains exercises that you can do to open up problematic Chakras. It talks about things that are important to human beings such as lifestyle and shows you how to gain harmony in your life by balancing your Chakras and to encourage great energy flow. The energy that you gain in your life isn’t just a matter of physical activity. Sometimes other things can help you and this book looks at the body as a whole and shows you how to make the most of the life that you have, using the energy flow to keep you enthused about each day of your life. Read through it. Find out where your Chakras are blocked and learn how to unblock that chakra that may indeed be stopping your energy flow.
