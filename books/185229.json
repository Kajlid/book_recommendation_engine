  "description": "\"Our love may have been forbidden, but that didn't stop me from giving him my heart.\" When I was born I met the man who would destroy my life. When I was sixteen I met the boy who would help me put it all back together. Nicholas Rossi was the best thing that ever happened to me. He protected me, loved me, and in the face of all my life had become at home, he gave me hope that maybe someday hell would turn to heaven and everything would be okay. Then one day he was gone, sending my life into a tailspin I never thought I'd be able to pull out of. Now, seven years later he's returned, and he's definitely no longer a boy. The kid everyone used to refer to as Saint Nicholas is all grown up, and only one thing stands in the way of us being together again... Me. Saint Nicholas is a standalone novel.",
