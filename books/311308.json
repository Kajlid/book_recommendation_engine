I knew the terms of the contract when I signed it. For one year, my life isn’t mine.For one year I am to obey, to be seen not heard. For one year I’m theirs, mind, body, and soul. The bodyguard. The fixer. The maniac. The boss.Four men on a path to ruin me.I may be theirs for a year, but the damage they plan on doing to me will last a lifetime. That’s if I even survive, because between the family and their enemies, the odds of me even making it past the end of winter are low.",
