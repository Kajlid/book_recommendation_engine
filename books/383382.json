  "description": "First published on FictionPress in June of 2006, Chemistry is the story of Travis McCall, a seventeen-year-old track star and straight-A student who is battling depression in the years after a failed suicide attempt. When he meets Garen Anderson, the charming, musician son of Bill, Travis' mother's boyfriend, everything changes. The two fall in love and attempt to navigate a relationship that faces a long line of threats--the necessity of secrecy from everyone they know; Travis' struggles with mental illness and self-injury; Garen's reckless, hard-partying lifestyle that borders on addiction. Travis quickly realizes that, while nothing in the world seemed as easy as falling in love with Garen, finding a way to stay together might be impossible.Status: CompleteWord Count: approx. 168,000Author's Note: I was fourteen years old when I began this novel, and as such, some of the earlier chapters dabble in cliches, melodrama, and generally poor writing. I am currently in the process of rewriting this novel now, with an additional decade of writing experience under my belt, and it is my sincere hope that anyone who was disappointed by the quality of the original version will someday have a chance to read a much better version of it.",
