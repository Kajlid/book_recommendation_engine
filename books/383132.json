  "title": "Jason Willow",
  "description": "Jason’s father has a secret past of wielding arcane power in a hidden war against demons and the fanatical Brethren who summon them. After years fleeing from inhuman assassins, Jason’s mother is killed and the hunt is on for the rest of the family. A terrifying new world opens up all around Jason - a grey world of demons, possessed innocents and secret societies. Amidst first love and betrayal in an isolated abbey, Jason has to decide whether to embrace his own supernatural powers and enter the treacherous, deadly life his father swore to leave behind. But time is running out. Nothing in the abbey is what it seems and slowly, the ripples of Jason’s unlocked abilities begin to draw in the darkness that has stalked him since birth. Jason Willow is packed full of hard-hitting martial arts and gun action, suspense and tightly controlled powers. The high-octane elements are balanced by friends and enemies embroiled in complicated family and romantic relationships. The story plays out over such locations as a remote Scottish island, a high-tech abbey stronghold, a gang-controlled school and a hellish brewery town lost deep in the Yorkshire moors.",
