  "description": "Is the cure for a breakup a hookup? Marissa Duplei has one mission. Pick herself up, dust the ex off, and get dirty with someone else. However, sexy, inked-up, metal-musician Jack (what was his name again?) is not the average girlâ€™s revenge fling. Women throw themselves at Jack, toss their lingerie on the stage, and scream his name. Marissa has no idea of his public identity, and while she doesn't initially throw herself at him, she does go on to toss aside her lingerie and scream his name. A one night stand gone awry. A secret to keep at all cost. A couple from two very different worlds. A second chance. Will it all lead to love? Prefer 1st POV? Eye of the The Rock Star's Gulf Coast Girl is the \"I\" version of this novel served up extra steamy. Award winning and Kindle bestselling romance Jack Who? is the first in the Silver Strings Series (G String Set) Rock Band Romance. 'Weathering Jack Storm' is second, and 'Snow Storms' is third. The Silver Strings Series will contain trilogies for each string on a guitar, and is kicked off with this G String Set.",
