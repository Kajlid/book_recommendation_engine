  "description": "Five possessive gods and the end of mankind. That's my fate.  I always thought the end of the world was a myth. But then, I also thought Norse gods were make believe too.

The only one who can save gods and men alike from annihilation.  And in the shadows lurks betrayal so deep it will change the fate of the world...",
