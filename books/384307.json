  "title": "Amelia 1 - Captive of Watchnest Hall",
  "description": "Thinking she was safe and secure as Mistress of Watchnest Hall in the 19th century, Amelia's life is turned upside down when a distant relative successfully challenges her right to live there and has her evicted. As she is about to leave, with as much of the assets as she can take, the new owner appears and accuses her of attempted theft. Faced with the choice of being jailed or submitting to his will, Amelia finds herself the unwilling sex slave not only to the sadistic Victor, but also to his lawyer and to Judith, a woman who was once Amelia's friend and companion. And she is not the only sex slave now being held at Watchnest Hall.",
