He isn’t a man you befriend—trust me, I’ve tried.No, he’s made it crystal clear what he thinks of me. Vain. Spoiled. Underserving.

He expects me to turn it down, of course.I accept out of spite.Three months of arguments and dark stares. Of sudden, stolen kisses at company parties. The heat between us grows, bursting into a wildfire that threatens to consume me whole.Nick has pushed me away all these years for a reason. For your own good, as he says. I’m not the man for you.But I refuse to listen.We're done playing it safe.",
