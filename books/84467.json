  "title": "Awakening to Zero Point: The Collective Initiation",
  "description": "There is a process of unprecedented change unfolding within the earth. You are part of the change. Without knowledge of the artificial boundaries of religion, science, or ancient mystic traditions, the change is characterized as dramatic shifts in the physical parameters of Earth accompanied by a rapid transformation in human understanding, perception, and experience. This time is historically referred to as \"The Shift of the Ages.\" As science witnesses events for which there are no reference points of comparison, ancient traditions say that the timetable is intact; the events of \"The Shift\" are happening now. Each event carries with it a similar message, and is a by-product of something much more significant than the event itself. During key moments in human history, wisdom has been offered allowing individuals to experience rapid change without fear. This is one of those moments. You are living the completion of a cycle that began nearly 200,000 years ago, and a process of initiation that was demonstrated over 2,000 years ago.",
