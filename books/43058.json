  "title": "VII",
  "description": "In a strange, sometimes unrecognizable Europe, VII is the fictional autobiography in seven parts of a playwright whose life might or might not be influenced by his own plays, an account that seems to reshape the world around him as it is written. A decadent libertine in a macabre city, our protagonist chronicles a history of sordid affairs mingled with impossible journeys, steeped in a pathology of vice, terror, and lies. The result is a novel both troubled and complex, a striking insight into a mind whose darkness is all too human",
