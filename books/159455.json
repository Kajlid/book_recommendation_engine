  "description": "A GENTLEMAN HOPES HIS OVERTURE....Neil Spelling, man-about-town and desirable bachelor, is in a pickle. He has fallen desperately in love with Lady Alice, but her father, the Duke of Sotherland, calls him a dunderhead--and unsuitable for a son-in-law. Now an intimate holiday house party may provide the perfect occasion for Neil to appear dashing...daring...and irresistibly darling. If only a stranger hadn't intruded, a sinister plot hadn't developed, and the irascible Lord Nightingale hadn't piped up... ...WILL WIN A LADY'S HAND!Lovely Lady Alice doesn't know what to make of Mr. Spelling! In town he is so polished, and now he appears so shy. Worse, Lord Nightingale is making him a mockery. What is a lady to do? Lady Alice is ready to offer a kiss...when an unexpected guest makes her tremble. Villainy is afoot during this Yuletide, and Mr. Spelling may prove a hero...if discord can be ended, a father's heart softened, and love is able to conquer all with a Christmas surprise!",
