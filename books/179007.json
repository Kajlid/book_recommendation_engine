But that was before an insane scientist took an unhealthy interest in his cousin Quincey's very rare blood type... Before people began vanishing from the streets, to reappear as the mad doctor's undead minions... Before the villain's infernal devices gave him the ability to strike at will, destroying all who opposed him!  With chaos descending on San Francisco, only two boys know the secret to defeating the undead doctor. But can they act in time?",
