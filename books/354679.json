  "title": "Cringe: Toe-Curlingly Embarrassing Teenage Diaries, Letters and Bad Poetry",
  "description": "Did you keep a diary during your teen years? Do you have a box of loopy-cursive, never-sent notes to your crush? Or some overwrought poetry about your bleak existence? An unfinished rockopera? Well, you're not alone, and in \"Cringe,\" you'll find a reason to unearth your adolescent angst and have a good laugh--at yourself. A compilation of real teenage diary and journal entries, letters, songs, stories, and lists--along with biting commentary, background, and self-examination from the now so-called grown-ups who wrote them--\"Cringe\" offers a voyeuristic glimpse at the roller coaster of youth in all of its navel-gazing, soul-searching, social-skewering glory. Cringe -worthy excerpts include Really bad poetry: I lumber like the sad clown withthe hope that my performancemight make you smile.Yet I am a flickering star overa cloudy sky. Blush-inducing pep talks: OK. It's the end of February. No morekidding around! You have to go outwith someone! You haven't gone outwith someone since the summer!At least fool around with someone!Come on! You've got it in ya! Questionable motivations: My mom is madly in love withher boyfriend. . . . Cool! He's so rich. . . I could get a lot out of this--vacations, a car--if he buys my momone + she gives me hers--psyche! And rages against the world at large: I am living in a dream world.Wishes are a bunch of crap.They never come true so what'sthe use of even wasting yourtime hoping they'll come truewhen they don't? Inspired by the New York-based reading series of the same name, \"Cringe\" will help you realize that being a grown-up isn't all that terrible. At least you don't have to worry about who's going to be at the mall anymore.",
