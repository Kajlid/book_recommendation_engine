  "description": "Micah Beck is tempting, talented, and addictive to the last drop. Not to mention, he’s completely confident in all that he does. Especially with those fingers and I can’t deny that it’s such a turn-on.Micah is the last thing I expect to find wandering around my brother’s beach house, naked, only wearing an acoustic guitar, but he’s the first thing that has ever had me craving for just one ‘anything goes’ night.My plan was to come to visit my brother for the summer and hopefully find a little inspiration for my book at my brother’s bar on the beach. A little inspiration is more than what I get slapped with. Talk about wanting to make love to a voice. I never knew exactly what that meant until I heard Micah playing at Vortex, but now just the thought of anything that has to do with that man’s tongue, leaves my whole body vibrating with a hunger I’m not sure I can fight.Just one taste. One night. No strings.I’m a liar if I said I thought that would be possible because if I thought his guitar playing abilities were hot, seeing him in charge, demanding orders at Vortex has me completely coming undone and about ready to fall at his feet and give him anything he desires, despite the fact that my brother warned us to stay away from each other. He’s a master at getting whatever he wants with little or no effort at all and I can’t help but to hope he wants me.Micah is cocky with a body that screams trouble with every rock-hard muscle. He’s wrong in every way and…I’m completely strung.",
