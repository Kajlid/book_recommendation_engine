  "description": "Mummies… Genetic anomalies… Espionage & intrigue… Time travel back to Egypt What’s not to like? Not until the evidence was uncovered in the 1870s would we have ever known. With the discovery in 1922 of Tutankhamen’s tomb, more hints beckoned. As with so many things, clues often go unnoticed until accident, science, and intrigue collide. That collision began with the harvesting of DNA samples from a group of royal Egyptian mummies. Meanwhile, another team noticed, while x-raying the same mummy collection, some unexpected physiological details. The chromosomal and radiological data proved disquieting. They argued for the introduction of a genetic anomaly into the human genome…the source…unbelievable. Bow Tie tells how an international scientific effort resolved the situation by using an unorthodox means for executing an unscrupulous task…time travel and murder.",
