In an attempt to prove to herself where she belongs, Alex throws herself into the mission, only to discover that her training may not be enough. As her perspective changes, she begins to realize that her memory isn't a canvas of realistic paint strokes, but an impressionistic landscape influenced by her own emotions. Scaling buildings and discovering secrets may not be as hard as finding her own heart. And the enemy she is fighting against could be the one person closest to her.",
