  "description": "Short description“All life is a revelation through images and observation. Discovery can be through the eyes of another. . . Present to me your mind as a blank canvas, and see a portrait of humanity. Within this composition, the two of us shall meet upon the common ground.”Extended descriptionWritten thoughts are the avenues into the souls of others, connecting points which provide a common ground of similar experiences, feelings, or discussions. In this collection, I hold the mirror up for you to see your own reflection. This is life captured in poetry.I am painting mental pictures with words of actual moments in time, complete with the thoughts and emotions of that moment. Think of it as a kind of snapshot for you to view and ponder.The Common Ground is a poetic journal, though not presented as such, comprised of life experiences and encounters at different ages starting from a young girl to mature adulthood.“I invite you to take your time and explore the human emotions found here: pain, joy, death, love, hate, life. It is my hope and intention that just as in viewing a picture in a gallery, you will be able to observe, absorb and relate to what is presented.I hope that you will be able to find and draw something of your life’s experience in what has been mine.”",
