  "title": "The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal Resistance to the European Invasion of Australia",
  "description": "The publication of this book in 1981 profoundly changed the way in which we understand the history of relations between indigenous Australians and European settlers. It has since become a classic of Australian history. Drawing from documentary and oral evidence, the book describes in meticulous and compelling detail the ways in which Aborigines responded to the arrival of Europeans. Henry Reynoldsâ€™ argument that the Aborigines resisted fiercely was highly original when it was first published and is no less challenging today.",
