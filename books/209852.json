  "description": "Bethany should be dead, just like the doctors predicted.But along came the butterflies, altering the order of nature.And now nature is hell bent on revenge.Because when fate's path is disrupted, it's only a matter of time before balance must be restored.At birth, Bethany Keatley was diagnosed with a rare bone disorder and sent home from the hospital to die. Despite losing her mother to cancer before she turned two, Bethany defeated her prognosis and now, at fifteen, with hindered growth making her appear ten years old, she is alive and well thanks to the hormone injections which her scientist father developed. But if growing up isnâ€™t hard enough already, being small makes her a target and a social outcast. The only way she's been able to escape her high school tormenters so far is by working hard, achieving good grades, and through her unusual friendship with star football player Jeremiah Wright. That is until a misunderstanding with new girl Zoey Margold. Beautiful and brazen, Zoey and her followers make it their focus to break Bethany. Yet dealing with the bullies becomes the least of Bethany's worries. The mice on which her dad tests the butterfly hormone are showing side effects no one saw coming, and now her plan to leave the small minded town of Springs, Georgia and become a scientist has all but shattered. Her world becomes a prison and her existence a life sentence. But nature has her own plans for Bethany. Haunting and twisted. Like nothing you've ever read before.",
