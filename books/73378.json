  "description": "Evil is deeply entrenched in society during the First Crusade, as two worlds collide over faith and powerful figures manipulate religion and men to further their own agendas. In the middle, three oridinary people are in danger of being overwhelmed by war and political expedience – but they do not fight alone… The novel's title, East of Ashes, is a play on words from two scriptures in the Bible that speaks of God removing our sins \"as far as the east is from the west\" and bringing forth \"a crown of beauty instead of ashes\". Part romance, part historical epic (much like Francine Rivers' bestselling The Mark of the Lion trilogy), East of Ashes is a Christian fiction novel that follows the journey of Lamech – a young knight with blood on his hands who seeks redemption in the love of a beautiful woman, but instead finds that his path leads him right into the midst of the brutality of the First Crusade. As he fights in the Crusader army at the siege of Antioch in the year 1098 A.D., Lamech witnesses horrific deeds that echoes with his own guilt, but begins to discover something so radiant that it threatens to consume him.",
