  "description": "Use nature's elixir to lose weight, prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and beautify skin and hair.  Can saturated fat be good for you?  Natural coconut oil-not the hydrogenated version often found in processed foods-is a saturated fat, but not the kind your doctor has warned you about. Studies have shown that this uniquely curative oil actually has innumerable health benefits ranging from disease prevention to anti-aging. Now, in his revised edition of the first book to describe the therapeutic properties of coconut oil, Bruce Fife offers a nutrition plan with dozens of tasty recipes that will allow anyone to experience the healing miracles of what he deems the \"perfect food.\"  When taken as a supplement, used in cooking, or applied to directly to the skin, coconut oil has been found to:  - Promote weight loss - Help protect against heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and many other degenerative diseases - Strengthen the immune system - Improve digestion - Prevent premature aging of the skin",
