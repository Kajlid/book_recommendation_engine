  "title": "The Sven Hassel Collection",
  "description": "From the fight for survival against the ferocious Red Army and the icy, shell-ravaged wastes of the vicious Russian winter, to the bloodiest battles on the Eastern Front, Sven Hassel's gripping novels are based on his own experiences in the German army. Convicted of deserting the German army, Sven Hassel was sent to a punishment regiment on the Russian Front. He and his comrades were regarded as little more than dispensable killing-machines, cannon fodder for Hitler's war. His unflinching narrative takes us to the most extreme outposts of war, where soldiers face an inferno of blood and butchery. THE SVEN HASSEL COLLECTION includes all 14 books in Sven Hassel's series and exclusive extra material.",
