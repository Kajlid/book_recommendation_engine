  "description": "MURDER BY ROAD TRIP is a comedy murder mystery, staged in the medical biotech and pharmaceutical industry. John J Jessop co-wrote the book with his daughter, Jackie. The story was inspired by a once-in-a-lifetime cross-country road trip they took together in 2016. While the destinations may be real, all events in MURDER BY ROAD TRIP are hilariously fictitious.A missing research monkey, a tiny jewel thief, the great cheese caper, and a bumbling FDA reviewer/wannabe private eye trapped in an RV with three daughters. What could go wrong? Well-Healed Pharmaceuticals wants to interview Dr. Jason Longfellow for a lucrative job in San Diego. As incentive, they pay for a family road trip cross-country. The trip has its violent cowboy holograms, moving Border Patrol mannequins, Titan Missile Base military police, a mad dentist, and Fred Flintstone all try to steal Jason's teeth and kill him. His wife, Chelsea, nurse detective, blames these 'hallucinations' on excessive napping. Most nights, kids asleep, Jason takes Chelsea to the top of the RV, where he...takes Chelsea. She doesn't hate it. Other oddities include boundless energy and strange cravings. Who wants to kill Jason and take his teeth? They must solve this mystery, or Jason could end up a lifelong toothless FDA reviewer, or dead, whichever comes first. MURDER BY ROAD TRIP is the sequel to TAKE AS DIRECTED.Dr. John J Jessop, a Ph.D. pharmacologist, spent nearly 40 years working for the FDA and pharmaceutical industry. He retired to write murder mysteries. Jacqueline J Jessop has a degree in media arts and design, edited and designed the covers for John's earlier books, and co-wrote MURDER BY ROAD TRIP with her father. She also designed the book cover.
