  "description": "I have a daughter. The betrayal from the woman I love was like a knife in my heart. Two years I knew nothing of Ava, but if I had, I would have changed my womanizing, binge drinking ways. The feelings for Victoria are still there, but so is my mission to find a sub and wife. Dom Fever is in full effect from the women that surround me, but I have eyes for only one. The mother of my child. No…my children. She now carries my second child, just like I had prayed she would. Will I forgive her before it’s too late? Will she forgive me? Or will Karma come around and knock me on my ass? I’m an honest person, but I do have one secret. One…that could ruin everything. This is book 2 and picks up where book 1 leaves off so be sure to read Dom Up before reading this book!",
