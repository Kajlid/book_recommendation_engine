  "description": "Haunted by his recent divorce, a cautious IT worker agrees to accompany his best friend on a bachelor party trip to a Central American resort where he discovers the amenities include a stable of young women dedicated to fulfilling their guest’s every desire. Sid Carr is no prude. But the idea of a sex vacation, even one at the high class Hacienda del Toro resort in Central America, just seems wrong. And while his best friend, Pat, insists this is exactly the kind of thing a guy in his situation needs, Sid can’t bring himself to participate. But then Sid runs into Marta, a stunning young “Hospitality Girl” girl being mistreated by a guest. And without a second thought, Sid intervenes, whisking Marta away to a secluded beach and out of harm’s way. It’s there, in the moonlight, that Marta’s considerable charms begin to reawaken a part of Sid he thought he had lost forever. Despite numerous warnings from his friends, Sid can't help falling in love with Marta. He becomes determined to learn everything about her, pestering her with questions until she finally reveals her story. How she came to work at the Hacienda del Toro. How she is a virtual prisoner there. And how her fate is controlled by a ruthless local gangster known only as The Patron. With their trip coming to an end, Sid opts to stay behind, telling Pat and his friends he needs a few more days R&R. But the truth is, Sid’s come up with a plan to rescue Marta from the clutches of The Patron and bring her back to the States with him. But Sid's carefully crafted plan goes awry. He is nearly killed and the woman he loves vanishes. Now Sid must decide whether to return home alone or join forces with a ragtag band of locals who have vowed to end the Patron's reign of terror.",
