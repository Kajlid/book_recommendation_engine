  "description": "An Outsider on the Inside is a unique coming-of-age tale that follows the atypical ambivert Zac Kallest. Zac is, by most definitions, normal, and he likes it that way.Being normal means you can steer clear of the ever-painful social structures of high school and altogether avoid unnecessary drama.But as a moment forces him into the social spotlight, he is required to navigate his way through waves of teenage gossip, family-fuelled embarrassment and just plain old puberty in an effort to unearth a way back to consistent normality.If there ever was such a thing.",
