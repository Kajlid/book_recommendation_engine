  "description": "TIME STONE â€“ SAVING THE ROCK No one would have believed that there was so much more to Simons work than just a set of black polished stones. Even Simon, though having faith in his work would not be ready for what the stones had in store for him. Caught up in a struggle well beyond what Simon had bargained for, he is thrust into a series of potentially cataclysmic events that either by accident or by destiny will set him on a journey that could potentially change the world he knows. In events that could most possibly be real, and in destinations more distant than meters or kilometers could explain, comes an epic quest for the very essence of life itself. Powerful forces are at work and one man, is all that stands between total domination, and life as we know it. Time Stone, what you thought you knew and how you thought it happened is about to change, forever",
