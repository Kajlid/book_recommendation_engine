Now its power, harnessed by a new generation of optical computers, attempts to answer mankindâ€™s last great question: What happens to us when we die? But this is perilous knowledge, as Dr. Miles Fleming, a brilliant young neurologist discovers. To find the truth he must challenge the certainties of both science and religion, and embark on a journey that jeopardizes his most basic assumptions and beliefs. On reaching the final terrifying revelation he realizes that there are perhaps some things mankind should never know. For shining a light on the truth can sometimes reveal the darkestrecesses of hell itself.",
