A man who’d give up everything to save me.Things I’ve lost: My dignity. My honor. My mortality. My blacklist has been narrowed down to two: the king of the vampires, and the slayer who helped him.

I’ve promised my stalwart knight I’d do anything to destroy his Maker, and I’ve got plans to put a new queen on the throne. I have Càel. My new sisters. A demonic Prince’s infernal spy. And the son of a man who might have a far darker soul than I ever imagined.We’re a crew of misfits, but sometimes that’s who you need for dirty deeds. And against all odds, those deeds might just be the way to my newly-immortal heart.Dirty Deeds is the third and final book of Victoria’s Trilogy in the Bonds of Blood universe, a steamy, medium-burn reverse harem bully romance in a college-age academy setting.
