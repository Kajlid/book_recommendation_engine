  "description": "VexI’ve lived my life free and easy. No attachments, no entanglements. I easily move on after an evening with a woman. For a night, they get all I have to give. After that, it’s time to go. They’re warned ahead of time, so tears and ploys have no effect on me. I love my MC family, the Devil’s Angels, and my bikes. Not much else. Certainly, none of the various women I’ve known.Then I meet someone who changes all my rules, thoughts and beliefs. But as luck would have it, she’s the unattainable one. She seems immune to my charm and that tweaks my ego. After being warned away from her, I try to push her to the back of my mind. She doesn’t stay there for long though. Now I’m determined to have my night with her, consequences be damned.TajaTrying to raise my sister, working any job I can while fighting to keep a roof over our heads, I don’t live the life of a normal woman my age. I don’t have time for dating, sex or men. Especially a member of an MC. My father’s an MC President and I want nothing to do with that lifestyle. Not even for the gorgeous biker whose nearly golden eyes follow my every move. Common sense tells me he’s in it for a night, and that’s not my style. Best to keep my head on straight and ignore what my body’s craving.Actions have consequences and fate has a way of messing up the best laid plans.Adult Content Warning: This book is intended for readers 18 years of age and older.
