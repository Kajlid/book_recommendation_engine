  "description": "Starving, starving … Grace is always starving these days.But Grace is also strong, and determined, and skinny. For the first time ever Grace is as thin as she wants to be – nearly – and there’s no way she’s giving that up.Except, what if she has to give up other things to be able to keep wearing her new “skinny” breeches?What if it comes down to a choice between all the horses she loves – Sprite, the ferocious jumper, and Iowa, the sweet greenie, and Whinny, the abused but tough mare – and the numbers on the scale, the numbers on food labels, the numbers always running through her head?Grace knows what her stepmother, Annabelle, wants her to decide. She knows what Matt – gorgeous, amazing Matt – wants her to do. She knows what the doctors think.But she also knows nobody else can make this decision for her. And sometimes she’s not even sure if she’s got the strength to do it.There is danger in living with anorexia, andthere is also hope. Objects in Mirroris a truthful exploration of these extremes and of the struggles that lie between them.",
