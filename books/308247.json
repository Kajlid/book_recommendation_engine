  "description": "\"All I want to do is make you think, think, think...\" and to wonder and explore, and to laugh and dream. Crawl, walk, run, fly. It is a beautiful world so take your time to learn. Your mind is wide open for everything. Love and peace and friendship. This is a book of thoughtful poems and extraordinary imaginative illustrations, meant to instil and promote the love of life, learning, and creativity, and not just for children, but all of us. This book is for young children to be read to and enjoy the funny drawings. It is a book for older children who can read this for themselves, and find ideas that might draw them to a greater appreciation for all things. It is a book for adults to help them remember that children have beautiful minds and are happiest when they are allowed to think and dream in their own way. Truth, beauty and kindness be.",
