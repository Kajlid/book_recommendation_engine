To land one of the city’s biggest clients, she wants us to put our differences aside and play fake fiancés for the next thirty days. So, I slip the diamond ring onto her finger and agree to play the perfect fiancé. How hard can this be?  A hell of a lot harder than I thought... She’s infuriatingly stubborn and she thinks I’m a cocky jerk with an enormous ego. (She’s right, but I can definitely back it up...)
