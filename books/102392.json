  "description": "I stared at the overly large bags that lay by the front entrance with what must have been the world’s largest what the fuck look on my face. “I’m done, Paxton.”After his bitter marriage ends, Paxton seeks respite from his loss.  Rediscovering his writing, he never expected to create a piece worthy of reading, nor for two unsuspecting paths to cross in the most unconventional of ways.Thousands of miles separated them, yet he’d never felt closer to anyone.  Finding out that happiness and love was attainable again was one thing.  But having Alissa - that was something else all together!When the two finally meet in person, sparks fly. Their chemistry is beyond explosive, and emotions reach a boiling point.  Their brief love affair ignited the fuse, but Paxton is shocked when his young son fans their fire. His sweet four-year-old boy immediately falls for the loving, meek, demurred woman in Alissa, and she starts to change both their lives. Then, she becomes their salvation - in ways no one could see coming.",
