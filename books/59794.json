  "description": "Self-proclaimed nerd, BrookLyn Scott, is an eighteen-year-old high school senior in upstate New York who has never held a boy’s hand let alone one’s interest. She has some friends at school and church but is never far from the watchful eye of her abusive parents. BrookLyn’s plan is to escape the abuse by excelling in high school and running safely to college just as her older siblings did. Her plan is derailed after she’s invited and attends her first party. By the end of the night, BrookLyn finds out that church friend, Gabriella Michaels wants more than a friendship, and although her head says no, her heart thinks of the possibility. BrookLyn is focused on her escape plan while flying under the radar of her father’s swinging belt when she is thrust onto an emotional roller coaster. The question is, when the ride ends, where will BrookLyn stand?",
