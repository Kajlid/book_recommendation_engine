  "description": "Newsflash: Carolina Catfish Baseball Game delayed due to humping incident.There it is, in flashing lights. My most embarrassing moment for everyone to see. When I accepted my dream job working in the marketing department for my favorite team, I wanted to hit the ground running. I wanted to make an impact immediately. I even hoped I’d make a good impression.I made an impression alright. Right on Tate Scorchin’ Sorenson’s thigh. Laying there, on top of the best shortstop in baseball, I wanted to crawl into a hole a die.What’s worse than making the team’s best player and your not-so-secret crush the laughingstock of the MLB? Him finding you nursing your injury in the First Aid room and staring at you like you’re a Philly cheesesteak.I tried my best to stay away. I did everything in my power to ignore my feelings, but Scorchin’ Sorenson got too hot to resist.",
