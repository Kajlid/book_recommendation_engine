  "description": "Gabriel Sweeney is about to fulfill a promise long overdue; a promise made to an old army buddy who had been cut down in the same firefight that had put him in a coma for three months of his life. It might be six years late but better late than never right? Gabriel though having a rough idea of what’s left of Phil’s family from the many stories his old pal used to share is in no way prepared for the little sister with the pigtails and gamine smile who is now a woman with curves in all the right places, a head full of the most beautiful fiery red curls this side of heaven and the temper to match. With one look he’s hooked but will the headstrong beauty who likes to run unsuspecting salesmen off with her father’s old shotgun fall in line or will she run circles around him?",
