When she’s broke and needs to make rent, the answer seems simple: start a ghost hunting vlog and become an internet celebrity.At first, the “Hot Spots” channel comes across nothing spookier than a couple of creaky doors and the odd eerie moan until she and her friends discover a murder.Jane has it made if she can prove a ghost was responsible. But if her half baked murder investigation goes awry, they’ll end up dead, arrested, or worse.",
