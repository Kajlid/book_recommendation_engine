  "description": "Fantasies - we all have them. For some it’s their dream job; others want the wedding, the 2.5 kids, the white picket fence.My fantasies are a bit more...depraved.Dark and sinful, they have destroyed relationships and my livelihood, yet I still submit to them like a slave. Sex.For most, it’s a natural expression of love, caring, or lust.But there are those of us who can’t stop once we’ve had a taste.Those of us who don’t want to.And the shame of that never-ending cycle will eat us alive...My name is Evan James, and I am a sex addict.",
