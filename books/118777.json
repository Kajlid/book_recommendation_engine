Go crayfishing in the summer at Nocken, \"dipping in the pot\" at Christmastime with Lisa and Karl, and join Britta and Anna who know the best way to go about \"nutting\" for the New Year. In this gently humorous tale, master storyteller Astrid Lindgren takes us through a year in the lives and customs of six Swedish children living on a group of three farms in the countryside.",
