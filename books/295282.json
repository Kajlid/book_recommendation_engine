Jackson comes a friends-to-lovers romance about an unattainable rockstar and his best friend’s younger sister…\nMaggie Fitzgerald is the last girl I should think about taking to my bed.On the cusp of turning 21, she has her whole life waiting out ahead of her. Sexy AF while still radiating an innocence that I know better than to taint.And here I am, itching to reach out and touch a girl who is so forbidden that just thinking about her feels like committing a mortal sin.Thing is, I love playing with fire.Rhys Manning is everything I shouldn’t want.Country-rock’s newest superstar.Fun. Wild. Ready to show the world a good time.He’s so off-limits it isn’t even funny.So out of reach he might as well be a poster tacked on my wall.Too bad every time he looks at me, my heart races out of control.Now, I’m stuck living with him for the entire summer…We’re only supposed to be friends. Still, I should have known it was a terrible idea when I started sneaking into his room. Especially when it’s clear he’s keeping secrets.Secrets that might destroy us both.One touch, and I want more.One kiss, and I’m spiraling out of control.I know it’s reckless to start dancing in the flames.But in exchange for getting to spend one night with this brooding bad boy? I might be willing to get burned…",
