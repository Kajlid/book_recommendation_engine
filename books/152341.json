  "description": "The Beloved Invader is Anson Dodge, a wealthy young Northerner, who, when he came south to St. Simons Island, found God and lost his heart to the beautiful land. Called into the ministry, Anson becomes the pastor of the little island church and gives his life to the people there. His wife, Ellen, also loves St. Simons and its inhabitants, but despite their caring, many of the islanders turn their war-inspired distrust of Yankees against the Dodges. There are a few, like the Goulds, who open their hearts and homes, and Anna Gould falls in love with Anson - both she and Ellen devote themselves to him. When tragedy strikes at the heart of the little community, they seek consolation for their grief, struggling with their faith and attempting to rebuild their dreams.",
