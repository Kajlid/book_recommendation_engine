  "description": "Seventeen year old American Vivi James gave up texting for milking sheep. She traded her tight, skinny jeans for a heavy, dark Burqua and sacrificed her straightener for frizzy, unkempt hair tucked away in a shrouded veil, all for the love of twenty year old Doumin Hassan, a Bedouin boy she met while vacationing in Israel.Doumin Hassan has never been to a restaurant, a dance club, or even high school, yet, he eats the most deliciously prepared foods, dances with passion and reads and speaks two languages fluently. If only he hadnâ€™t fallen in love with Vivi; it was not going to bode well with his two wives.As war in the Middle East continues for both sides, so does the risk of losing family, faith and country for both Vivi and Doumin by the choice they made to each other; a choice between what they are expected to do versus what they long to do.AMERICAN BEDOUIN is a young adult story that poignantly explores humanity from the observations of two young people in love, caught in the middle of religious, political and cultural strife.",
