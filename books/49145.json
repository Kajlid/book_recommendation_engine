  "description": "Lucretius (c. 100-c. 55 B.C.). who devoted his life to the exposition of the teachings of Epicurus, wrote with the force of an unshakeable personal conviction in the materialistic doctrine. This poet's view of the scientific attitude of his time towards matter, atoms, the workings of the mind, cosmology, and geology, inter alia, can be read today as it was intended two thousand years ago: as an appeal to a disillusioned age to take comfort from the sanity of science. R. E. Latham's direct and lucid prose translation makes clear for the reader both the differences and the resemblances between ancient and modern materialism.The cover shows a Roman fresco (Snark International)[From back cover.]",
