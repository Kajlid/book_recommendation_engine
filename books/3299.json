  "description": "The San Francisco Chronicle declared him \"one of the most brilliant writers to ever come out of Ireland,\" and Neil Jordan called Winterwood \"the most terrifying book I've ever read.\" In this chilling and unforgettable novel, Patrick McCabe shows us that nothing-and no one-is ever quite what they seem. Shortlisted for the Irish Book Award for Novel of the Year, Winterwood is a disturbing tale of love, death, and identity from a masterful novelist whose \"books are skillful exercises in the macabre and the horrific. It is as though Stephen King had learned how to write\" (New York Review of Books).",
