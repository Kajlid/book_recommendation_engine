  "description": "My god, if I have to watch one more happy couple get together, I’m going to lose it completely and probably rip out all of my awesomely pink hair. My older brother is now married and has a family, my best friend is in a committed relationship, and the man I’ve wanted to be with for the last two years just can’t give me what I want… what I know I deserve… I need to do something, go somewhere else and clear my head. So, when I get invited to a photographer’s convention in Florida, I jump at the chance. Now I can get away from all the coupled happiness around me and surround myself with… all the photographers from back home.Well, crap. Why didn’t I realize that I already knew half the people here? How did I not know that Andrew—the head of the jerk brigade—would be here too? Ugh. Well, at least I can hang out at the beach, right?***Left Behind is the third book in the Finding My Forever series, but is a standalone novel. Each book in the series will feature a different couple, but the couples will show up throughout the series. It’s a 114,000 word contemporary romance between two men with explicit language and graphic sex intended for Adults Only.***",
