  "description": "A Caldecott Honor Book and  ALA Notable Book A bedtime book and a counting book! “A delightful bedtime book.”— New York Times Acclaimed author Molly Bang shares the going-to-bed countdown in a loving family. “Ten small toes all washed and warm,” begins the story, and then young readers journey toward tuck-in time, counting down along with the story’s African-American father and daughter. In the satisfying conclusion, one little sleepyhead settles in for the night. An award-winning classic,  Ten, Nine, Eight  has been comforting and delighting children and their parents for more than thirty years. “This beguiling picture book, with a palette of eye-filling colors, appears to arise naturally from the love binding a father and his little ‘big’ girl who turn bedtime into playtime with a rhyming game.”— Publishers Weekly",
