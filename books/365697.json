  "description": "THE ORIGINAL DARK ROMANCEPublished in early 2010. If you love dark romance, this is where it started…\"... Grabs hold of you from the first paragraph and never lets go.\" - Pam Godwin, NYT Bestselling AuthorIt was just another Tuesday, really. I went to a conference to give a motivational speech for women. I woke up bound to a chair in a cold empty cell. My captor is a beautiful monster, offering me comfort in exchange for my obedience and punishment when I displease him.He has never spoken a single word to me. He has other ways of communicating, of reducing me to the animal who only lives to obey his twisted whims. He may be a monster, but he’s turning me into something not quite human as well, something that hopes some day he’ll say… anything to me.\" Dark, provocative, and glaringly honest,\" H. Turley, ReaderPublished in March 2010, Comfort Food is considered the Original Dark Romance.",
