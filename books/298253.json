  "description": "Hammy and Gert, just like Hansel and Gretel, were lost in the forest. Abandoned by their mother. Well, actually both parents if you want to get down to the nitty gritty. Needed to find their way home. But they seemed to be trapped in the woods without a path to follow. How would they find their way? Hammy and Gert had been taking care of each other for a long time. They had skills that most children did not. They could scavenge food to eat and find ways to stay warm and safe. Even have fun with each other when the world seemed dangerous and threatening. But would they ever find a true home? One where they were treasured and welcomed?",
