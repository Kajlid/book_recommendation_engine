  "description": "Tara Spencer’s mysterious pregnancy turns her life upside down. Her plans for medical school are sidetracked, her fiancé severs all ties, assuming she must have slept with someone else, and her parents question her mental health when she insists she’s never had sex. Only a stranger, Cyril Woods, believes her claim that she’s still a virgin. The religious order that Cyril belongs to believes Tara’s child may be a new messiah, fulfilling signs in the Book of Revelation. But when Tara discovers the baby will be a girl, the order sees her as the mother of the anti-Christ who must be destroyed before she triggers the first stage of the Apocalypse. Tara, uncertain whom to trust and afraid of endangering those she loves, fights for her life as she seeks a safe place to give birth and the answer to whether she and her child are meant to save the world or destroy it.",
