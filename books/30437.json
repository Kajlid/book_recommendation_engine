  "description": "Sheila Watson's The Double Hook and Ray Smith's Cape Breton Is the Thought Control Centre of Canada are the twin fountainheads of experimental fiction in Canada. A McLuhan protégé, steeped in the formal adventures of international modernism, Watson brought a new sophistication to Canadian writing with The Double Hook. A lyrical, allusive novel about a remote BC village, The Double Hook is a pure and challenging beauty of a book.",
