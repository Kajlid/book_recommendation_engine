  "description": "When Laura Munson's essay was first published, the New York Times was so flooded with responses that they had to close down the comment feature on their website. Readers sent it to their friends and therapists gave it to their clients. What did Munson write that caused such a fervour Laura detailed what happened when her husband of more than twenty years told her he wasn't sure he loved her anymore and wanted to move out. Laura's response to her I don't buy it. In this poignant and funny memoir, Laura recounts the time her faith in her marriage was put to the test. Shaken to the core after the death of her beloved father, not finding the professional success that she had hoped for, and after much therapy, Laura, aged forty, realised she had to stop basing her happiness on things outside her control and commit to an 'End of Suffering'.",
