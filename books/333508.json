  "description": "In the town of Disappointment, Oregon, washed-up boxer Lewis Yaw makes ends meet as a fishing guide. He's lived a life of violence but doesn't understand real strength until he meets Janey, who can see good in even the most damaged things--including him. When she gives birth to their daughter, Grayling, Lewis worries that he'll mess her up as badly as his father did him. But he also sees a chance to right the wrongs of the past.By high school, Gray has become his apprentice guide, his sparring partner, and his pride and joy. Life in their small town is nothing short of challenging--there's a marauding bear roaming the streets, a rival guide trying to kill Lewis, and a poacher littering deer carcasses along the river--but he is closer to happiness than he ever thought possible. When tragedy strikes, Lewis can't break free of his past, leaving Gray to fight to save the only thing she has left: her family.",
