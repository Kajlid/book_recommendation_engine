  "description": "When twenty-one year old Nahla Marks decides to start her junior year at Wake Forest University as an education major, instead of continuing on the path to pre-med, everything seems to fall apart. Her parents have practically disowned her, stripping all financial help and communication away. Then, there is this feeling, this color -as she calls it- that has begun to take over her body. She doesn't know how to control it, and the more it happens, the worse it gets.  Gideon's bedroom, Gideon's apartment, Gideon had saved her, nursing her wounds. Nephilim was the word he used, but not quite, he cautioned as he told her a story -a story that explained what was happening to her, and why he now stood before her seemingly, an angel.  She'd never asked for this to happen to her, and didn't want the chaos that seemed to follow her everywhere now. Not only was the media looking for her, but someone else wanted the gifts they possessed, at any cost.",
