  "description": "WHO SAYS A WOMAN CAN'T HAVE IT ALL?Cleo Arlington dresses like a cowboy, is fearless and fun-loving, and can ride, rope, and wrangle a horse as well as any man. In 1916, however, those talents aren't what most young women aspire to. But Cleo isn't most women. Twenty-nine years old and single, Cleo loves life on her father's Idaho ranch. Still, she hopes someday to marry and have children.Enter Sherwood Statham, an English aristocrat whose father has sentenced him to a year of work in America to \"straighten him out.\" Sherwood, who expected a desk job at a post spa, isn't happy to be stuck on an Idaho ranch. And he has no idea how to handle Cleo, who's been challenged with transforming this uptight playboy into a down-home cowboy.Just about everything either of them says or does leaves the other, well, fit to be tied. And though Cleo believes God's plan for her includes a husband, it couldn't possibly be Sherwood Statham. Could it?",
