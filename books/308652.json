More than that, he found a family—but his new companions came with new complications.Michael was kidnapped by pixies, thrown into a world outside of his reality, and watched his only home burn to the ground. He fought elves, dragons, and even a race of beings sworn to hunt and destroy vampires. Vampires like Michael. But every bizarre and wonderful twist confirmed that he was part of something he never thought he’d have again, and Michael swore nothing would come between him and his new family.Now, to protect the very people he holds so dear, he embarks on a new quest. Michael must fight a new enemy…but he’s never faced his own kind before. He’ll be forced to confront the one who created him—the very vampire who abandoned Michael just hours after changing his life forever, who left him alone in a new and dangerous world so many years ago.Michael must now face Elizabeth.…and that’s the least of his concerns.",
