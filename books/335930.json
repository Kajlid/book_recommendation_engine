  "description": "Fasten your safety pins and spike your mohawks for another round of pop culture activity fun! Aye Jay, creator of the Gangsta Rap Coloring Book and the Heavy Metal Fun Time Activity Book (ECW 2007), takes on punk with mosh-worthy results. This activity book will challenge kids and adults alike with word searches and drawing games, or just sharpen your crayons and color legends of punk’s past and present! Help Siouxsie Sioux apply her makeup. Draw Henry Rollins’ tattoos. Color in the members of Green Day. Part history lesson and part activity time, the Punk Rock Fun Time Activity Book will be more fun than a night at CBGB. With a foreword by American Hardcore author Steven Blush, and a cover collage of punk art legends, this is a must-have for the music lover in your (dysfunctional) family!",
