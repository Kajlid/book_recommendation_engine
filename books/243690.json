  "description": "“They told me I wouldn’t live to be 2 yrs. old because they found me starving on someone’s porch…. I’m 55 now…. They told me I wasn’t smart enough and that I didn’t need a higher education…… I have an AA, BS and MS. They told me I would never be part of anything worthwhile. I’m a member of MD-Military-Holding-Lodge No. 122 - MWPHGL of Maryland, The Monday Cub (Oldest Social Club for African-American Men in Delaware and maybe the Nation—1876) recently resigned, The Drill Sergeant Association, and Bethel AME Church to name a few. They told me the Army wasn’t the way to go and I was wasting my time and the organization wouldn’t teach me anything. I was Squad Leader, Platoon Sergeant, Detachment NCOIC, CID Investigator, Drill Sergeant and an EO Advisor for 5,000 Soldiers and Civilians just to name a few. It has taught me a lot. They told me I couldn’t run a full marathon. I finished in the top half. They told me I was too small for martial arts—I received a 2nd degree black belt in Hapkido and a Red Sash (Chamber 5) in Kung-Fu. They told me that I will fail in life. The Lord has blessed me with a lovely wife, four grown men (sons), a lovely stepdaughter, and six grandchildren. It was rough getting there, but I’m here.” (Started from the bottom) They told me I would never, never find my bloodline. Well, I found my birth mother, father, sisters and brothers and a host of cousins and combined my bloodline to my family that raised me and taught me everything I needed to know about life altogether into one big happy family. I now have two mothers and fathers. THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THOSE THINGS.… KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, AND LIVE YOUR DREAMS. MAKE NO EXCUSES….",
