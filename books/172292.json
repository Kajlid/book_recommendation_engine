  "description": "People say that when you have an unfinished business your soul will stay lingering on this world until you resolve whatever you have to do. And they are right. In my case: I have to tell my best friend I'm in love with her. Long ago I made a promise I would never leave without expressing my feelings, and I'm planning on keeping that promise; even if I'm dead, even if I have to hide in another body just to be around her. I know I'll tell her.",
