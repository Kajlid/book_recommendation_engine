  "description": "Vivienne Courbet may have lost her innocence over three centuries ago, yet in the eyes of those who sustain her with their blood, she is a young, desirable beauty. But the eternal life Viv has reveled in is now facing a dire threat, one that has separated her from her blood sister, Deirdre, and may mean the end of their kind. A dangerous cross breed known as the Others has declared war on the vampire fellowship. The fatalities have begun. Having fled to a small New England town, Deirdre Griffin and her lover, Mitch, have found a temporary respite. But when the Others close in, they wonâ€™t go down without a fight, the bloodier the better. And when the battle calls for Viv and Deirdre to join forces, they will have to summon every morsel of thirst to live another lifetime.",
