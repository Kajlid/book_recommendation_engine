  "description": "Ever since the fiery accident that killed her parents, Elisabeth Sawyer has been bounced from one foster family to another. All the quiet sixteen-year-old wants is a normal family, but the unexplainable incidents of her past overshadow her future. Until the beautiful and enigmatic Julian Mallory appears, claiming to be Elisabeth's guardian. Spinning a bizarre tale of orphaned infants switched in the aftermath of a horrible accident, Julian informs her that Elisabeth Sawyer is dead and she is Elisabeth Sinclair, lost heiress. Before she can adjust to her new name or new life, Elisabeth is whisked away to an exclusive boarding school where everyone - from her new roommates to the gorgeous but cryptic Alexei - knows more about her than she does. But the mysterious Julian isn't telling Elisabeth everything. The past lives on at Saint Clare Academy, with a greater danger than anyone realizes. Because Elisabeth's inheritance involves far more than just money. And the fire that killed her parents was far more than a simple accident. ECHOES OF FIRE is the first book in the Echoes Trilogy, a young adult paranormal series.",
