  "description": "Artists See Things Differently, Including Love  In his 42 years of living, Drake Barrymore had seen the best and worst life had to offer. He had loved and lost a wife. He had managed to raise his son alone. But now all he can think about is a woman who is way too young for him. Dr. Brooke Daniels has an enticing body, a kiss-me mouth, and a sharp gaze that questions all the excuses he tries to make.  On his canvasses Drake can often cover the truth with paint, but he knows all too well that strategy doesnâ€™t work in real life with its real problems. Yet all he can see without Brooke in his life is more loneliness than he's already known. Regardless of the challenges, he has to take a chance on loving her, no matter what the future brings.",
