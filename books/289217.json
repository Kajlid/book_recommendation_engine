  "description": "Gosling Wakefield is a reclusive, torment man haunted by the shades of his past. Self exiled in his home, his mental state is scarred and diminishing. His only chance of redemption is the challenge he must make into his inner recess. Only there will he find his resolve. Lucid, surreal and present in solid obscurity, his search for peace begins in his mind home. \"Go further. Find Thalamus\"First Review\"This is a powerful story of a man's struggle to battle the demons occupying his mind, demons that the protagonist Gosling Wakefield tries to defeat and overcome. He serves as a perfect allegory for what we all feel when depression consumes usâ€”trapped, fearful, helpless. There are superb elements of magical realism. The writing is fluid and brimming with vivid imagery, a tricky thing to achieve when dealing with a subject matter that can at times be too ambiguous to define. This is a story that has the potential to help people with their own struggles and one I couldn't recommend highly enough\" R.Billing",
