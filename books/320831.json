  "description": "An unemployed \"little man\" contemplates suicide and is besieged by discontented groups wanting him to turn his suicide into a gesture on their behalf.\"More than a half a century ago, Russian playwright Nikolai Erdman came up with a comic cure for political THE SUICIDE. It gave Joseph Stalin a pain and Erdman got twenty years in a Siberian work camp. But a strikingly American adaptation of Erdman's political farce is proving just the pill for election-year depression. Playwright Richard Nelson's rollicking, larger-than-life adaptation of the 1920's Russian script explodes with laughter.\" â€”Jack Lesar, UPI",
