  "description": "Caz Tallis restores rocking horses in her London workshop. When shabby but charismatic Joe and his dog turn up on her roof terrace, she is reluctantly drawn into investigating a rock star's murder from three years before - an unsolved case the police have closed. Which, as her best friend James says, is rather like poking a furnace with a short stick...REMIX is a feel-good page turner, that you won't want to put down until you reach the satisfying ending.Now available as an Audible audio book.Oracle, AMAZON VINE VOICE REVIEWER , \" This is a highly addictive novel, a good old-fashioned murder mystery with a dash of 21st century celebrity glamour. I struggled to put it down. Lexi Revellian is great at crafting a plot that moves at speed but her biggest talent is in creating characters that the reader can really care about, characters that seem like old friends as the novel draws to a close. Overall, Remix is great fun, extremely entertaining and - dare I say it - would make an excellent transition to the small or big screen.\"Full length 75,000 words, by the author of REPLICA, ICE DIARIES and WOLF BY THE EARS .",
