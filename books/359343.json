We’re clothed the whole time, unfortunately, spinning around the crowded ballroom. But I guess it’s for the best, because if Beckett Yates ever saw beneath my mask, he’d never want to touch me again.As far as he’s concerned, I’m the mysterious stranger who meets him in the rose garden each year.As far as I’m concerned, one dance in his arms is better than a lifetime with another man.There’s no way this ends well. No way I can have the man I love.But I’ll reach for my mask tonight all the same.\nThe Stranger is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a stern rival and his star-crossed love.",
