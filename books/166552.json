  "description": "Surreality is the most popular Massively Multiplayer Online Simulated Reality on Earth. With full sensory immersion indistinguishable from the real world, millions of people log on to experience its vast and fantastical dreamscape.  Some never log off.  Maverick is one such ‘Blue Pill’, but for him the Everdream is no decadent fantasy. He sustains himself by gold farming, mining imaginary gold to exchange for Reality’s equally imaginary money.  It’s a dreary, grinding existence which thankfully comes to an end when he comes across an Adventurer named Vega. She enlists him for his mining skills in acquiring some of the most valuable treasure in Surreality. To his amazement they succeed, and soon set off on an even greater quest.  Unbeknownst to either of them, their success has humiliated and angered one of the most powerful players in the game. Desperate to avenge his humiliation and reclaim his lost prestige, he dreams up a plot that will not only put an end to their adventuring but change the very nature of Surreality forever.",
