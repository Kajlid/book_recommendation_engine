  "description": "An intense look at the rules of high school attraction - and the price that's paid for them.It happens every year. A list is posted, and one girl from each grade is chosen as the prettiest, and another is chosen as the ugliest. Nobody knows who makes the list. It almost doesn't matter. The damage is done the minute it goes up.This is the story of eight girls, freshman to senior, \"pretty\" and \"ugly.\" And it's also the story of how we see ourselves, and how other people see us, and the tangled connection of the two.",
