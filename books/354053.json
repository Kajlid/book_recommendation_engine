Enter Oz, the only person/werewolf Buffy knows who is down with the suppression of magic, and can take the Slayer army off of Twilight's magic-specific radar.With Oz's assistance, the Slayers and Wiccans try to become \"normal\" through meditation and hard labor -- although, not everyone sees the advantage of being magicless, namely, Willow, Giles, and Andrew. And they could be right. After all, is a peaceful life for a Slayer even possible?* Oz appears in Buffy Season Eight!* Collects issues #26-#30 of the ongoing series.",
