  "description": "WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE TOWN YOU LIVED IN HAD BEEN INVADED BY FLESH-EATING ZOMBIES? WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF A LOVED ONE TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THEM? What started off as an experimental drug used to improve the food grown on a local farm, was now the reason behind why the dead were rising and feasting off the living. The small town of Clifton Falls had been caught up in a gruesome battle between good and evil, as the recently deceased stalked their prey. In the space of a few days, the local police force had to battle the strange beings in the hospital, the cemetery, the forest, and finally ending up at the Holiday Village. Before anyone could work out what was happening, humans were falling down and being devoured by the hungry, brain-eating creatures. Could the local Police Chief find a way of eliminating the un-dead before the virus spread into the CITY and BEYOND?",
