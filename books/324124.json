  "title": "Life Lessons: The Story of Little Crab",
  "description": "To follow your dreams is a hard enough task; when others interfere it can seem to be impossible. This is a story about a little crab reaching its dreams while the crabs around it continue to pull it down. The story inspires us to follow our dreams in spite of what other think, say, and do. The little crab teaches us a valuable lesson, that we can overcome barriers to reach our goals and help others reach theirs, too. When growing up we are presented with lots of different choices and decisions. If the people around us only want what is best for themselves, we will be pulled down like the little crab in the bucket. We need to learn to follow our aspirations despite others' opinions and comments. This will allow us to reach our dreams and help others along the way by encouraging them on their path to success.",
