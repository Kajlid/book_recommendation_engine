Three months have passed in startling silence since I left New York behind. There’s been no trace, no trail, nothing that points to this safe haven. Reporters haven’t figured out the girl they’ve been trailing in Manhattan isn’t me. Thank God.Down here, I’ve kept my head down. No one knows what I’ve done. They can’t.
