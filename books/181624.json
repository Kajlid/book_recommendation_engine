The wealthy, powerful Nikkos Thanos owns a woolen mill and almost everything else on the north side of Delphi, Missouri, and is the overseer of a fractured society. The brave, judicious Thaddeus \"Cousin\" Taylor owns a grocery store and a tavern on the south side and carries a past hauntingly shrouded in tragedy.

With the passage of time, those caretaker roles are filled by Evangelina, Nikkos' beautiful and strong-willed daughter, and T.J., the grandson who worshipped Cousin.
