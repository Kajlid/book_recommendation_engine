  "title": "The Hunting of the Snark",
  "description": "The Hunting of the Snark , Lewis Carroll’s classic masterpiece of nonsense verse, takes the reader on a wonderfully witty and inventive hunt for the ever-elusive Snark. The tantalizing mysteries of the poem are here perfectly matched in these brilliant new illustrations by artist Mahendra Singh, who has created a visual treasure hunt, full of riddles, puns, and allusions. When asked what his poem meant, Carroll would always reply that he did not know. But, on one occasion, he did write to friends that perhaps “…the whole book is an allegory on the search for happiness.” “To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;To pursue it with forks and hope,To threaten its life with a railway-share;To charm it with smiles and soap!”",
