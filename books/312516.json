  "description": "Looking at Julie, you would think she had it all. She's the type of woman who turns heads when she walks into a room. Her raven hair is always meticulously coiffed, with designer sunglasses perched upon her head. She has spent years crafting the perfect persona. However, living a privileged life is not what she thought it would be.The man she once believed to be her prince charming shows his true colors. He takes control of every aspect of their lives, giving her nothing but heartache in return. The big house and fancy cars can't keep the demons of her childhood from invading her psyche. They remind her of the days when she was powerless.Julie tries to resist her descent into depression with alcohol and sex, but some battles are too hard to fight. Maybe there is no such thing as a happily ever after for people like her, or maybe there is.",
