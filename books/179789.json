  "title": "Love Beyond Life: The Healing Power of After-Death Communications",
  "description": "Despite our cultural aversion to death, two in five Americans--over 40 million people--have experienced contact with the dead. What do these communications tell us about life here and beyond? What can these glimpses beyond the veil teach us about acceptance, love, and faith? How can they help us to resolve our grief, incorporate a loved one's death into our daily lives, and draw purpose and meaning from unspeakable tragedy?Joel Martin and Patricia Romanowski, authors of the classic, We Don't Die, here explore the power of after-death communication--deathbed visions, dream visitations, apparitions, and other phenomena--to comfort us, to strengthen us, and to create a new, life-affirming notion of what it means to grieve and to die. In the midst of life we live with death, a fact we are culturally conditioned to deny. We avoid the dying, the dead, and the bereaved at every opportunity and then wonder why we feel so alone when death touches our lives. Love Beyond Life is an invaluable resource for those who have lost someone dear, and for anyone who yearns to make sense of life's final journey.",
