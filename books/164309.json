  "description": "She's not your typical small town psychic. With cynical wit and a foul mouth that would make a sailor blush, Natalie Miller will soon become your new best friend.  Hollywood starlet Hannah Gold was living a charmed life. With money, fame and super-hot actor boyfriend Simon Bellamy, her life was seemingly perfect. But everyone, no matter how rich and famous has secrets, and some of them are deadly.  In stark contrast, small town psychic, Natalie Miller once had it all- a good job, new car, beautiful home, and a handsome husband. Fast forward three years and Natalie finds herself working as a minimum wage cashier, driving a twenty year old car, living in a cracker box apartment and divorced. Life has not been kind.  One night while working the closing shift at Super Thrifty, Natalie crosses paths with the Hollywood super couple. With a little twist of fate she finds herself knee deep in murder, danger and maybe, just maybe a little bit of romance. With her trusty canine sidekick Honey and best friend Karen Cain, Natalie will use her psychic abilities to help unravel the secrets of one of Hollywood’s biggest stars. But can she do it without becoming a casualty of the killer’s sick fantasy?",
