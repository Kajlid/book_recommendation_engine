  "description": "Stunning memoir, including fourteen images and poems from art exhibit on the transforming possibility of depression.It looked like Ann Keiffer had it all: an exciting career in a prestigious advertising agency, an adoring husband, a teenage son who kept her laughing, and a circle of close friends.But there were signs Ann was in trouble. Her son was prophetic when he made a plaque for her with three chiseled words: work, work, work. A short time later, Ann realized something was terribly wrong. She had begun a harrowing descent into the black abyss of clinical depression.What do you do when the spark of your life goes out...when you feel dead, sorrowing, hopeless? How do you re-light the flame? Ann writes with gripping candor of her depression...and equally powerfully of her healing process. Like close friends, readers will understand why Ann now views her depression as a blessing--dangerous and dark, but ultimately, a blessing.Is it possible our wounds may sometimes be our healing, that transforming possibilities may be hidden in the darkest passages of our lives? Blest by the Dark Angel is a celebration of the capacity of the human spirit not just to survive emotional and physical pain, but to be transformed by suffering.",
