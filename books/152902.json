  "description": "After three years of social work in Nashville, Eliza Redding is eager to leave behind her life at home for a new adventure. Nestled deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina is the site of her first job as a clinical counselor: Rockbridge Academy, a rehabilitative boarding school for troubled youth. Anticipating that she'll be the only Latter-day Saint at the academy, Eliza is pleasantly surprised to discover that English teacher Henry Jacobson is a fellow member of the church. Her excitement is quickly diminished, however, when she discovers Henry's standoffish and cold personality--undeterred, she commences the monumental task of befriending her reserved coworker. As they face serious familial struggles, Eliza and Henry find themselves drawn together by their growing understanding of each other. But when a life-threatening crisis arises at the academy and family conflicts escalate, will these two independent spirits realize they are meant for each other?",
