  "description": "Jess never expected her life to unfold this way.  Running from a lifetime of pain and torment, her dream of making it big was becoming less and less of a reality. Falling victim to all the tempting vices always present in the world she lived in now, she was sinking further in the abyss.  Falling deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. In love with a man as dangerous and complicated as they come.  Nick Roman.  Very married.  Very out of her league.  But, impossible for her to stay away from.  Nick knew he needed to let her go. His life was messed up enough as it was without her being in it. But Jess belonged to him. He refused to give her up.  An addiction neither of them could kick, no matter what the cost.  Enemies and bitter hostilities continue to build around them, as a lover and a spouse hang on like a vice grip, refusing to let go.  Their love was all-consuming, risky, life threatening.  Would it destroy everything and everyone around them as well?  ***Fallen Angel is a mafia romance serial novel. Due to sexual content, implied and actual scenes of abuse, violence, organized crime, language and frequent illegal drug use, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter. ***",
