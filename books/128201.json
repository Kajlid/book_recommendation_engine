He’s married to his job and doesn’t have room or the desire to be tied down. Until Hollie. As a cop he's learned to trust his gut instinct. Perhaps he should have trusted it when told him to approach her long ago. Is he ready for the forever he sees in her eyes?When Hollie is framed for a murder she did not commit and the key to proving her innocence seems impossible to find, will John be able to locate the shady character who committed the crime before Hollie is put behind bars? Is their love strong enough to withstand such a hardship to find their happy ending?",
