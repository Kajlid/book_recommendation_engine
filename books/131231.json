  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Karpov Kinrade comes an award-winning academy series full of romance and page-turning suspense. \"She escaped, but she'll never be free.\" \"Time held no meaning as my mind darted in and out of memories. Past and present collided to create a full-sensory collage out of my playing hide-n-seek with my best friends Luke--who always cheated by walking through walls when he was about to be caught--and Lucy; Mr. Caldrin critiquing my sketches and offering ideas to make them more realistic; targets changing faces, blending into the same person, their thoughts rippling through my mind like waves. Through it all, a demon stalked me from the shadows of my memories, never quite showing its face, but crouching, waiting. And then I dreamed....\" Sam and Drake may have escaped the paranormal spy academy that had sinister plans for them, but they aren't free--not with a powerful Seeker after them. As Sam struggles with the ethics of her new powers and embraces a blossoming physical relationship with Drake, Lucy and Luke face challenges of their own. With forces coalescing inside and outside the Paranormal Spy Academy dorms, it's only a matter of time before the fire they started forces each of them to make choices they can't undo. But will it be enough to save them?",
