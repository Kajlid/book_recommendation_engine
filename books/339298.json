  "description": "Mary Alice has spared nothing for her only daughter’s wedding—providing enough gourmet food and glittering elegance to make Sister think seriously about finding herself a rich fourth husband to pay for it all. Practical Patricia Anne has put away her aunt-of-the-bride blue chiffon and settled back into domesticity when fun-loving Mary Alice informs her that they have a post-wedding date with a genealogist from the groom’s side of the family. But lunch is an abbreviated affair when their guest interrupts a fascinating talk on the hazards of finding dirty linens in ancestral boudoirs and scurries off with the local judge. And the sisters are only just finishing their departed luncheon companion’s cheesecake when the police arrive.Their recent guest has taken a plunge from the ninth floor of the courthouse building—an apparent suicide. But given the scandals the nosy genealogist was capable of uncovering, Mouse and Sister are betting that some proud Southern family is making sure their shameful secrets stay buried…along with anyone who tries to dig them up.",
