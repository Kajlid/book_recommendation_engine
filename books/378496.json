  "description": "Suzanne never believed that she was the type of woman who would allow herself to be dominated by a man, even if he was as strong-willed and intense as she was herself. So as she dangled naked in a dimly-lit room and stared into the eyes of the man who was tasked with breaking her will at any cost, she was quietly confident that he could not win.But as Sasha slowly stripped away her defenses and drew her into his world of passion, pain and intense pleasure, Suzanne found that she needed to choose between the job she was duty-bound to complete, and the dark side of her nature that Sasha had so easily awakened.",
