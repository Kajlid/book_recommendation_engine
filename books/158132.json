  "description": "Elizabeth Lancaster has changed, but her true being remains in the shadows, waiting to be revealed. Lizzie continues to muddle through life in her human world, but the Night World feels her growing power, and there are those who will do anything to stop her, and obtain that power for themselves. While Lizzie concentrates on her human life and the new addition to her family, Cain Atchley and others around her become increasingly vigilant in trying to keep Lizzie safe, alive, and out of the clutches of the Seekers from the Night World. But an impossible traitor, someone she has known all her life, manages to breach the wall of trust Lizzie has with her friends, bringing her face to face with her enemies. The traitor wants Lizzie to know about the true nature of the world that surrounds her. This shakes Lizzieâ€™s faith in her friends, and alters the boundaries that keep her safe, placing her in mortal danger.",
