Now all hell is breaking loose and lines are being drawn in the coven. Did they just blow the perfect alliance the three species had? And if that can be fixed how will they ever make up what they did to Bevin? Did fate give Bevin two perfect mates, or two mates too many? This book is written in first-person point of view. There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
