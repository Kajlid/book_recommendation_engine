These Three Remain traces Darcy�s painful journey of self-discovery in his quest to become the man he always hoped be would be. A chance meeting with Elizabeth at his Derbyshire estate offers Darcy a new opportunity, but the activities of his nemesis, George Wickham, interfere once more in a way that may ruin everyone�s hopes for happiness.",
