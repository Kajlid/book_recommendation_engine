  "description": "In \"CHIMERA\" John Barth injects his signature wit into the tales of Scheherezade of the Thousand and One Nights, Perseus, the slayer of Medusa, and Bellerophon, who tamed the winged horse Pegasus. In a book that the Washington Post called \"stylishly maned, tragically songful, and serpentinely elegant,\" Barth retells these tales from varying perspectives, examining the myths\" relationship to reality and their resonance with the contemporary world. A winner of the National Book Award, this feisty, witty, sometimes bawdy book provoked Playboy to comment, \"There's every chance in the world that John Barth is a genius.\"",
