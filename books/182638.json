  "description": "For many people the trigger to bake is a particular occasionâ€”a family gathering, a traditional celebration, a local festival, or even a change of season. The Year in Cakes & Bakes, which accompanies the new series of Great British Bake Off, is a collection of recipes for every occasion to bake throughout the year. Divided into \"Cakes,\" \"Biscuits,\" \"Breads,\" \"Pies,\" and \"Desserts,\" each chapter will follow a loose narrative journey through the year, starting with January and finishing with Christmas. Looking at the UK's long and rich baking heritage, The Year in Cakes & Bakes includes over 100 delicious recipes, from a Hogmanay Whisky Fruit and Nut Cake to a Bonfire Night Toffee Apple Pie, and from Lemon Easter Sugar Biscuits to a Spiced Figgy Sponge Pudding. With recipes from the contestants, traditional favorites, and new creations reflecting the way we bake today, as well as Mary and Paul's Showstoppers, Signature Bakes, and Technical Challenges, the book is for anyone who likes to celebrate a special occasion by serving something homemade with love.",
