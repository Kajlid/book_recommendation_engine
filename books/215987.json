And when he swept her into his arms, it hardly seemed to matter that he was a smuggler by trade...until the day he drew his sword in a duel that went tragically awry. Suddenly the bold privateer Gabrielle desired was a man on the run with a price on his head. Now it will take a miracle to bring them together...or the courage of a woman who will risk everything to be with the man she loves.",
