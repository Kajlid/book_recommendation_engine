  "description": "A family of Quakers operates a station on the Underground Railroad spirits slaves from Ashtabula, Ohio, across Lake Erie to freedom. Victory Strawbridge believed in the Underground Railroad station her father ran but her twin sister Faith did not. Victory was proud of the fact that the secret cave on the Strawbridge place had sheltered hundreds of runaway slaves, but Faith hated the isolated way the family had to live in order to keep the secret. And the secret was becoming more difficult to keep. The constable was curious, and so was Skinhead Poke, a local redneck who always seemed to be around at the wrong time, and then there was the new doctor in town, who just might be helping the constable. The rewards offered for runaway slaves were big enough to tempt almost anyone.",
