  "description": "Ever since I can remember, I always liked the bad boys. The worst of the worst. The ones your parents warned you about. You know the ones I’m talking about. The ones that pushed other kids down and laughed at them, smoked cigarettes in middle school, and drank in the parking lot in high school. The ones that didn’t care about rules or limitations. The ones that would be voted most likely to spend their days in a jail cell. Yeah, there was something about that wicked gleam in their eye that got me every time.Some unknown need that revved up inside of me at the sight of it. I knew I could never escape it;I craved it like it was my own personal drug. Little did I know, it would turn me into a monster.",
