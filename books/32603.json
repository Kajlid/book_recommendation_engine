  "description": "Vivians struggles to cope with the arrival of a large number of girls from a school which has recently closed down. The inevitable feud develops, splitting the school, much to the teachersâ€™ dismay. The ingenious ways some girls use to fight it are far from predictable and its resolution is both thought-provoking and plausible. In another strand of the story, Eva Mihaly, a young girl who has escaped from her native Hungary, settles into school life and offers a startling new perspective on freedom which helps some of the girls come to their senses.",
