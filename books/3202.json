  "description": "Okay. This is it. I am going to kill myself ... After a suicide attempt which comes complete with an online suicide note goes hilariously awry Abigail Carter PhD candidate and owner of a gorgeous little kitten named Cedric finds herself blogging about her everyday life; phone calls from the future mother-in-law from hell, visiting a murderous aunt in prison, being stalked by her ex-boyfriend turned cop and the reappearance of Chastity MacKenzie, the girl responsible for her expulsion from boarding school many years before. And when Chastity makes a play for Samuel, Abigail's fiance of five years, Abigail realises that it is going to take a lot more than keeping a blog to sort this mess out... Dark and occasionally laugh out loud funny, Being Abigail features a truly unforgettable heroine and a reminder that sometimes the best things in life happen when you're on your way somewhere else.",
