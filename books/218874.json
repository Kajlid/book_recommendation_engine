Building cabins, leading trail rides and enticing tourists means she hasn’t much time for distractions—and that includes romance.

Not only can she use the extra money, but it means she will see a lot more of Josie. Felix finds Josie fits in well into her life, and for the solitary Felix there’s finally the possibility of romance. But there’s something suspicious about Flame, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a valuable stolen racehorse. Felix knows she is falling hard for Josie, but is Josie all she seems, or is she mixed up in shady dealings?The third book in the \"Girl Meets Girl\" series -- standalone novels with interconnecting characters.",
