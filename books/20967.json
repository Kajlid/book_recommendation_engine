  "description": "Why did Rosamund Townsend feel an aura of evil around the house she had just rented -- and the man who owned it?There seemed to be no reason to fear either the man or the house, yet the memory of her own tragic past crept through the mists of time. But even as she brushed away her fears Rosamund knew her life was in danger, and the specter of death was waiting to enfold her in its cold, grasping arms.",
