  "description": "Callie Harding longs to be like every other twenty-something, not a socially inept kitchen store clerk. However, she accepts her dismal existence until the day she encounters Kyle Townsend, the kind, charismatic marketing executive who notices Callie one night while she’s working. And Callie hasn’t been noticed in such a long time.After a few serendipitous chance meetings, Callie develops a harmless crush, stirring old tendencies from her past that are better left buried.But what happens when the perfect opportunity is dropped in her lap? Her actions could potentially cause a domino effect in several people’s lives - even if she thinks she’s doing the right thing. Sometimes the right thing bites you in the ass. Sometimes it doesn’t. **Intended for 18 yrs of age and older due to language and sexual situations**",
