  "title": "Dying to Religion and Empire: Giving up Our Religious Rites and Legal Rights",
  "description": "Can Christianity exist without religious rites or legal rights? Are baptism and communion required for the church to exist? What about the freedom of religion and the right to assemble? Building on what he has written in other volumes of the “Close Your Church for Good” series, Jeremy Myers argues that our traditions of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and our dependence on the legal rights from the government, have actually hindered the growth and development of the church. Dying to Religion and Empire is a call to leave behind the comfortable religion we know and follow Jesus into the uncertain and wild ways of radical discipleship. To rise and live in the reality of God’s Kingdom, we must first die to religion and empire. This revised and updated book now includes discussion questions, perfect for a small group setting.
