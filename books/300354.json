  "description": "The weirdest thing about my life isn’t the fact my cat started talking to me.I had it all. Awesome, blossoming business. A cute boyfriend who gave me butterflies. My kids living at home and reconnecting with me. Plus, I was a witch. There, I said it out loud. I’m a sorceress who can do magic.Not bad for a woman my age. I should have known better to get so cocky.The other shoe dropped, bounced, and hit me in the face, then bounced again and whacked me in the shin. It proceeded to ricochet once more and—What should have been the most amazing night turns into a disaster. I’m crushed, in more ways than one.When I recover, it’s to find my reality has shifted. My cat can speak. Some of the townsfolk appear to be possessed by demons, and I’m supposed to be sacrificed to free magic.Seriously? I just wanted my damned happily ever after.And I will fight to get it.",
