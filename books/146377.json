  "description": "As a thirty-year-old single Virgo, Amy likes her life just the way it is, thank you very much. Juggling being an administrative assistant to a smelly, temper-tantrum-throwing ogre with a secret life writing paranormal romance novels and squeezing in her out-of-town werewolf boyfriend can be demanding but she manages to keep her red-headed temper in check â€“ most of the time.Amy is faced with her greatest challenge yet when her magical powers manifest at the same time as her boss is kidnapped. As a strong Earth witch, her temper can cause disastrous things to happen. Can she adapt to the changes in her life and get her boss back without killing herself (or anyone else) in the process?",
