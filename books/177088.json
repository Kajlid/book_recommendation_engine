  "title": "Excellence of Patience & Gratefulness",
  "description": "This book is an abridged translation of 'Uddat as-Sabirin wa dhakhirat ash-shakirin, a work which is well-known in the Arab world but which has been inaccessible to English-speaking Muslims until now. In this book, the author explains the Islamic concept of sabr (patience, fortitude) and its counterpart, shukr (gratitude), in a practical fashion which shows how these important spiritual values may be incorporated into everyday life. Although written over six centuries ago, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah's words are still relevant -- perhaps more so than ever -- today.",
