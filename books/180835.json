  "title": "PRETTY FIGHTINGIRLS",
  "description": "Pretty Fightingirls portrays an outfit of endurance by the chief character (Kathrine). Though tempted, she endured and gave room for her dearly beloved friend to change her ways, which yielded no positive result. Signs of pain and the torment by her friend are lamented in the book to show that there can be foes in the midst of friends and that not everyone has a good smile to the other peoples success. There is also a symbol of envy, jealousy, and bitterness brought by a masked friend in exchange for love, care, and trust, which was never appreciated no matter how much it tried. The product of strength, courage, and determination is portrayed by a daughter and anchored at revenging the wickedness of her mothers bosom friend who almost ruined a good family. Finally, justice prevailed as a collaboration of peace and determination won against wickedness and ingratitude.",
