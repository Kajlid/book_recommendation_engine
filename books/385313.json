  "description": "This is a fictionalised account of the life of the Princess Gwenllian, known as the 'Welsh Warrior Princess.' Born 30 years after the Norman invasion to the king of Gwynnedd, she is predicted by the bard Meilyr to become a great leader and trains with her brothers in the warrior arts. Against her father's wishes, Gwenllian elopes with the young Prince Gruffudd ap Rhys, who has returned from exile in Ireland to try to reclaim his family's lands in the province of Deheubarth. From this time, the path is set for the young couple to provide the greatest challenge to Norman rule ever mounted in Wales. Prince Gruff and Gwenllian embark on a life of hardship in the mountains where they raise a young family, and live out a life of extraordinary valour, courage and honour, as they raise an army against the devious King Henry 1st. They find both success and failure, and their military struggle is mirrored by their personal conflicts, with Gwenllian emerging as a true heroine of the Welsh, as they found the family line which produces the Lord Rhys, and 150 years later, Owain Glyndwr.",
