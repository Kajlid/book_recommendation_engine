  "description": "\"Would you do it again… would you give Maya the letter?\"Some who know what happened have asked that question, as if I could actually turn back time. Would I give her the letter, knowing it would push away the person who’d been my comfort through my dad’s alcoholism and parents’ divorce? Knowing that it would destroy a friendship I’d worked years to build, and that I’d have to endure lies and unkindness from someone I believed in more than any other?…knowing that the fallout would inspire me to attend my dream college; knowing I'd conquer homesickness and so many other fears there; knowing I'd make friends who'd become like family; knowing I'd find rewards I could have never imagined?\"And Then it Rained: Lessons for Life\" is the story of how I lost my most trusted confidant… and found myself.",
