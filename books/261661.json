  "description": "Cameron Turner is cursed. He’s lost almost everyone he’s ever loved, and he knows better than to try again. If the universe intends for him to be alone, then that’s exactly what he’ll do, keeping to himself in his quiet Kings Grove cabin.  Harper Lyles is getting out of Kings Grove ASAP. She was born in the tiny mountain town of Kings Grove, and she never planned to go back. But when her life is turned upside down and she has no choice, she vows to make the best of it. For six short months at least, and then she’s on to bigger and better things.  When Cameron rents the empty house next door to Harper, both their plans begin to change. Harper’s energy and tenacious happiness make Cameron wonder if he was really meant to be alone after all. And Cameron’s dark brooding appeal has Harper wondering if maybe Kings Grove isn’t so bad.  The fourth book in the Kings Grove series is a tale of redemption and hope, featuring edge-of-your-seat suspense, Stewart’s trademark humor, and…puppies.   This book can be read as a standalone.",
