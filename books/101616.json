  "description": "History of a Woman is a collection of vignettes and poetry that focuses on the aspects of \"His\"tory. Told from the female perspective, it challenges social and gender roles, relationships, political aspects, and love. This collection includes 13 pieces of poetry and prose. ----- - From \"I've Given Some Though to Traveling\" That being said, I’ll have to avoid Merryville, Missouri. Unless that is I intend to leave the corsets behind. I wouldn’t want to deny the men there the view of my unencumbered body; though Gods know the only curves I carry come out with the boning. Hell, had I know that Illinois was a BDSM community at the beginning of my trip, I’d have begun and probably ended there. There’s nothing as sweet as calling a man “Master”. I wonder if they hand out collars at the airport. Perhaps I’ll just pack my own. -----",
