  "description": "I’ve always believed that I would die young. I can’t really explain it. It's a deep feeling within that I’ve had from a very young age. I’m the exact age now as my mother was when she died, and this has been a pivotal point for me as I wrestle with my values and beliefs from my past and form new ones that will serve me far better into the future. Some people think I’m morbid talking about death openly like I do. Frankly, I don’t think we talk about it enough. In Death doesn’t have to be morbid , Michelle Cox shares her experiences about overcoming an enormous amount of death and loss at a young age. She shares intimate details about overcoming gut-wrenching grief and offers her suggestions on how you can better support others around you going through grief, instead of being too afraid to hurt them more by raising the topic.This is a book about death, dying and grief. It’s about overcoming fears of dying young and how you can use that energy to propel you forward in ways you didn’t realise were possible. It’s also a book about resilience – about overcoming the odds and bad genes, and still living the best life possible.",
