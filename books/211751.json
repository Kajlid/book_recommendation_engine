  "description": "Max and his sidekick, Gordy, try various get-rich-quick schemes only to be outdone each time by smart-aleck Austin Healy. Peppy dialogue and a fast-moving plot make this easy chapter book a reassuring choice for newly independent readers.\"The characters are likable, the plot moves along smoothly, and there's enough dialogue to draw readers into the story. Smith's humorous line drawings, with washes of gray watercolor, punctuate the text nicely.\" - School Library Journal",
