  "description": "Mother Moon is looking for her child. As she calls for him, her tears turn into stars that fall into the sea and are rescued, along with her little one, by a lot of otters. These playful animals cavort and rollick in the starlight until Mother Moon looks down and sees them--and her child, safe and sound. Barbara Helen Berger 's poetic words and luminous illustrations are beautifully fused in this dreamlike tale that is just perfect for bedtime.\"Toddlers are sure to delight in the mischievous antics of all those whiskery otters.\" -- School Library Journal , starred review",
