Together, the amulets—Life, Death, Dark, and Light—keep the world in balance. To take back the shell that is Death’s amulet, Evie has to learn to trust her Healer instincts and understand that love never dies.In this spellbinding fantasy, Sandra Waugh continues the beautifully written series begun with Lark Rising.",
