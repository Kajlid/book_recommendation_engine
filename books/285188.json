  "description": "Did you know that flannel can be deceivingly sexy?  I’m Charlotte, and if blogging and devoting my life to fashion has taught me anything, it’s that flannel was never a good choice.  Turns out, I was wrong. So very wrong.  The first time I met Elijah he told me I was insane and I called him a lunatic. Good times.  Then when he came to my rescue, like a knight dressed in flannel, I had to eat my words. Apparently, not all country folk are serial killers’ intent on feeding you to their pigs. I know right, I was shocked too!  Never in a million years did I imagine myself lusting after a dead sexy, flannel-clad, llama farmer. There’s no way it would ever happen. But he’s determined to change my mind.  And I think, I might just let him.   **For lovers of all things romantic comedy. If you're a fan of Julia Kent, Pippa Grant and Emma Hart, you will adore JB's Awkward ladies.",
