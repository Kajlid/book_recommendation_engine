  "title": "Guessing at Normal: A Rockstar Romance",
  "description": "Is life with a rock star ever normal?  Small town girl Jill Griffin has mastered the art of being invisible, so when she falls in love with sexy rocker James Sheridan, at first she is content to live in his larger than life shadow. Building a life together under the glare of the media is challenging, and further complicated by constant touring, James’ partying and the mixed signals she gets from James’ twin brother Alex.  When her poems and journal ramblings become songs on James’ best-selling album, Jill has to step out of her comfort zone and figure out how to live her life in a spotlight all her own. As her professional success as a songwriter threatens her relationship with James, Jill begins to wonder if she can write love songs without the love of her life.",
