  "description": "Swept off her feetâ€¦History professor Letty Conroy has led a quiet, scandal-free life--until she found out that her fiance Xavier Augustine had had her investigated and deemed her perfect wife material. Then Letty sets out to prove him wrong. She has some wild and naughty plans that impudent Augustine might not approve of .. . .Xavier's nickname might be \"Saint\" Augustine, but there was nothing saintly about him or his troubled past. He'd come up the hard way, and he wasn't about to let Letty ruin his reputation--or hers. He would have to rescue her from the wild celebrations of the annual university medieval gathering--like the proverbial knight in shining armor. Little did he know that Letty wasn't exactly a damsel in distress!",
