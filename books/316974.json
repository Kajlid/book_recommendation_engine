  "description": "Casting necromancy without ever learning how isn't supposed to be possible. A starving orphan girl named Vita is somehow managing it anyway, and she's not sure if this is going to be the solution to her life's problems or a horrifying, spiraling mess into problems she can't even conceive.Experience the adventure of this fantasy novel by Natalie \"Thundamoo\" Maher, uncovering the secrets of a massive world of floating islands and the dangerous entity known as the Mistwatcher that rests beneath them. Vigor Mortis pairs adorable charm with deadly seriousness, an incongruous mix that pushes triumphantly forward despite the horror bearing down on all sides.",
