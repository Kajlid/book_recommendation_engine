  "title": "Thirty Years of Treason: Excerpts from Hearings Before the House Committee on Un-American Activities 1938-1968",
  "description": "The testimony that the author has gleaned for this book from the thirty-year record of the House Un-American Activities Committee focuses on HUAC’s treatment of artists, intellectuals, and performers. This highly readable and absorbing collection of significant excerpts from the hearings shows with painful clarity how HUAC grew from a panel that investigated possible subversive activities in a “dignified” manner to a huge, unrelenting accusatory finger from which almost no one was safe. This book serves as a warning for the future and creates living history from the documentary record. “The basic document with which all future studies of the [House Un-American Activities] Committee will have to begin.” —Dalton Trumbo “...what he has done is give us HUAC as spectacle, and the perspective is shattering.”—Victor Navasky, The New York Times",
