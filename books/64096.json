  "description": "Jerry W. McKinney's writing captures his readers' attention from the initial sentence to the very last word. Nightsound, McKinney's first full-length book of short stories, offers a terrifying smorgasbord of horror, suspense, love, loss of innocence, and eeriness. This haunting collection of dark tales elicits feelings of dread, hatred, fear, loss, sadness, and sympathy that will resonate with you long after you've finished reading it. So immerse yourself in a terrifying coming-of-age, and thirst for a taste of blood. Witness the rhythmic sways of a young girl to restrain a curse, and an unholy mass held by the dead. Try to dodge a rain of unspeakable horror, and then there is the madness of serial killers to keep you tucked in tonight. So check under your bed. Yeah ... twice would be better.",
