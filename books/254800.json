  "description": "The companion piece to Mike and Phile and All the World in all its +1,000 page glory.This is a book. It is written by Barry Lyga. Yes, we know it's a very long book. We tried to get him to cut it, but he wouldn't. So there was nothing we could do about it. We understand if the length turns you off. A long book like this one represents a commitment, and if it isn't good, you'll feel like you've wasted your time and your money. Still, we published it because we think it's a good book. Could it be shorter? Maybe. That's a very difficult call. Each person will have his or her own opinion. Some will read it and think, \"It could have been shorter.\" Others will think, \"It was just right.\" And maybe some people will wish it was longer. Isn't that the highest compliment you can pay a book, to wish it would never end?Usually, this text here (it's called \"flap copy\") is sexy marketing-talk, designed to get you to buy the book. Did you know that most people look at the cover, then the back cover, then the flap copy, and only then do they bother even to flip to a page in the book? So you probably haven't even read any part of the book yet, but you might decide to buy or not buy it anyway. Without having read a word of it.So, we'll just say this: This book is a love story. We hope you'll give it a shot.",
