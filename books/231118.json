  "description": "THE MARKED SAGA, BOOK 3 The end came at me jagged and skewed like puzzle pieces to a game I didnâ€™t know I was playing. There was a distinct method to the madness, every move propagated to force my hand, to lure me out of hiding with the sweet promise of finality. I took solace in knowing that something better waited for me on the other side, something as pure and deep as the ocean itself. But there was no end in sight.No peace to be found.The end was only the beginning.",
