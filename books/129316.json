  "description": "They say that size doesn't matter, but for some, size is all that matters. If that's you, Take It Like A Man has got you covered! We're ready to stretch you to the limit with big boys and big toys galore. In \"Just What the Doctor Ordered\" from Lorne Rodman, doctor Gregg has a prescription for Sam to cure what ails him. Dylan Mackenzie leads a secret double life, but an unexpected encounter at the private BDSM club he frequents is about to change everything in Mychael Black's \"Just a Little Bit More.\" In \"Too Good\" by T. Strange, Josh is thrilled when a hot guy goes home with him, but he's not sure that Roy is telling him everything.  Casey is resigned to playing piano in swanky hotels and bars, until his ex, Derek, turns up in BA Tortuga's \"Monkey Suit.\" In Lily G. Blunt's \"The Perfect Size for You\", the well-endowed Ty takes on an inexperienced client and breaks the first rule of rent boys: don't get attached. And Hammer Club fans will be thrilled to see Marcus and Jim joining Billy and Tanny in Sean Michael's \"The Games We Play.\"",
