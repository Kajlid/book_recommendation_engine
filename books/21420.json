  "title": "Finders Keepers",
  "description": "A spine-tingling, edge-of-your-seat thriller about an alarming killing spree in southwest England from the CWA Gold Dagger Award–winning author.   The eight-year-old boy had vanished from the car and—as if by slick, sick magic—had been replaced by a note on the steering wheel: “You don’t love him.” At the height of summer a dark shadow falls across Exmoor, as children begin to disappear, with each disappearance marked only by a terse, accusatory note. There are no explanations, no ransom demands, and no hope. Policeman Jonas Holly (a character returning from Bauer’s first two novels) faces a precarious journey into the warped mind of the kidnapper if he’s to stand any chance of catching him. But—still reeling from a personal tragedy—is Jonas really up to the task? There are some who would say that, when it comes to being the first line of defense, Jonas Holly may be the last man to trust.   “Finders Keepers has an enjoyably creepy premise . . . Bauer’s villain, incidentally, is one of the oddest in detective fiction: what he does with his victims is utterly weird.” —The Guardian",
