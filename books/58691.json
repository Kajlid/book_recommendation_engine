  "title": "And Eternity",
  "description": "After an overwhelming succession of tragedies, life has finally, mercifully ended for Orlene, once-mortal daughter of Gaea. Joined in Afterlife by Jolie -- her protector and the sometime consort of Satan himself -- together they seek out a Vita, a very contemporary mortal with troubles, attractions, and an unsettling moral code uniquely her own. An extraordinary triumvirate, they embark on a great quest to reawaken the Incarnation of Good in a world where evil reigns -- facing challenges that will test the very fiber of their beings with trials as numerous, as mysterious, and as devastating as the Incarnations themselves.",
