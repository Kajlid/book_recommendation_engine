He's not into this holiday--like at all. He doesn't do presents, or family dinners, or parties, or church.He does pets. And he's got one lined up for Christmas Eve. In fact, it's the highlight of his day. And if he can get through drop-in visits, nosy twelve year olds, an inappropriate conversation with his best friend's girlfriend, dinner with a family that's not his, and a party at his mother's house--well, he might just get home in time to enjoy himself with a stranger and make it all OK.TAUTFord Aston is known for many things. Being an emotionless, messed up bastard, a freakishly smart social outcast, and a cold, domineering master who keeps \"pets\" instead of girlfriends.And after Rook broke his heart, he plans to keep it that way.Ashleigh is known for nothing, and that's exactly what she's got going for her.
