  "description": "Easy-going tomboy Charley Forest, a girl with the fortunate Gift of communicating with magical animals, is looking forward to a quiet final year at Fernleigh Manor boarding school. Her peace is short-lived, however, when she's burdened with the unwelcome responsibilities of Game Captainship and finds herself caught up in a deadly rivalry with a new girl...a girl with a devastatingly charming Gift.A secret rule-breaking scheme, an unforeseen second magical talent, and a budding romance only add to the turmoil. Charley soon discovers that a quiet last year is the last thing she's going to get.Set in an alternative mid twentieth century England full of fabled beasts and humans with magical abilities, Pegasi and Prefects is the first in a series of traditional school stories spiced with a dash of magic and a sweet dollop of romance.",
