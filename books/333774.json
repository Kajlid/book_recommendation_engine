  "description": "He's a hot football star and a sexy-as-sin single dad. Zac Ledger is everything I never knew I wanted.A prince on a white horse swooping in to save the day...Isn't that every girl's dream? Maybe for some, but I've never expected to find my own happily ever after.I've made one bad dating choice after another, and it doesn't help that my only example of marriage is my dad leaving my mother before I was even born.I'll never be a believer in fairy tales.So, imagine my surprise when I meet Zac Ledger at my sister's wedding.He is the total opposite of my usual type: gorgeous, confident, and genuine.He's also athletic, and I am so not.They call him the GOAT in the NFL...and I didn't even know what either acronym meant until my sister told me.But there's something about him.One drink.One dance.And I'm ready to believe that there are actually good guys out there.That is, until I overhear him on the phone and I realize he's just like every other jerk I've dated.When he hires me as his interior designer to come work on his new house, I resist, but he's persistent.My goal is to finish the job and keep him at a distance.But I'm not prepared for the real Zac Ledger or the way he dotes on his adorable little girl.And when the renovation dust begins to settle, I realize there is more to Zac than his NFL accolades, and maybe, just maybe, he will prove to be the one man in my life that chooses to stick around.",
