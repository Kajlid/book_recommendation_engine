  "title": "Brian's Return",
  "description": "Brian Robeson learned how to survive in the wilderness, not by conquering the wild forest but by learning to be a part of its rhythms and cycles. Then he went back to civilization, and tried to be a part of human society: high school, city life, family, friends. In this book, Brian discovers that he just can't fit in. He has spent too many years in a life-and-death struggle, has too much of the forest in him, to understand the games that ordinary teenagers play. Brian finds himself in counseling, struggling to make himself be the person everyone thinks he should be. But finally Brian discovers that he must return to the wilderness.",
