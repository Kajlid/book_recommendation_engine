  "description": "He kills his victims with shocking brutality, leaving behind a macabre a mysterious quote from Edgar Allan Poe carved into their flesh. Veteran Chicagoland detective Bob Fajardo is known as a \"supercop\" who always gets his man - or woman. But with no evidence or witnesses, what will he and his team have to do, how far will they have to go, to catch the ingenious serial killer that the media have dubbed \"Edgar\": the psychopath who calls himself \"Israfel\"? This gripping novel of suspense contains adult language, graphic violence, sexual situations and inappropriate humor, and is recommended for adult readers only. This novel features the debut of detective Emmaline Sullivan, a sassy, clever Welsh redhead whose potty mouth and dirty jokes conceal the sharp, penetrating mind of a master sleuth. Readers can expect to cheer her again in Gans's forthcoming thrillers.",
