  "title": "Wow! City!",
  "description": "Everyone dreams of visiting the big city, with its bright lights, tall buildings, and millions and millions of people. One lucky girl named Izzy climbs in her stroller and rides through all the hustle and bustle, impressed by the sheer magnitude of everything she sees. Wow! City! is based on Izzy's real-life escapade, as page after page she is quoted verbatim. (Izzy was just learning to speak at the time.) Every illustration captures the grandeur, energy, and exuberance of Izzy's great adventure with her dad, in a book children will quickly learn by heart and ask to read over and over and over.",
