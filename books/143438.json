  "description": "\"Oh MY GOSH this book was not amazing, it wasn't great it wasn't good, it was mind blowingly insanely, awesome...\" ~ B.E. Love, Goodreads Looking back, I should have seen it coming. Paige didn't like that I went so far away to university. But it was going to only be for two years. She'd join me after she did her two years at community college. I thought we could swing that no problem. We were solid. But she hated the distance. She hated not seeing me every day. She complained that I didn't come home enough. She hated that for months on end, texting and phone calls were our only form of communication. It wasn't enough. She'd ask about the girls on campus. She'd gotten it into her head that girls were always making a play for me. I laughed and told her, even if that were true, I'd never cheat on her. She didn't seem completely reassured by that. The bottom line is, Paige thought she was losing me. She wanted me home with her. But I could never imagine the level she'd sink to--the trap she'd set to make that happen. And like an idiot I walked right into it. And it's a mistake I'm going to have to pay for the rest of my life.
