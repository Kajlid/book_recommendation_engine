  "description": "Book 4 in The Vampire Awakenings Series. With only one month left in college, Ian is busy enjoying what time he has left with his friends. Since reaching maturity, his life hasn’t been as carefree as it used to be, but he’s found a way to fight his growing destructive urges by losing himself in women. That is until Paige enters his life and falls half dead into his arms. Looking only to keep her safe, Ian flees with her.  Paige has spent the past four years of her life training to fight and kill vampires. Her desire for revenge is the only thing that’s kept her going, so when she’s forced into hiding with Ian she’s determined to believe he’s nothing but another monster in need of beheading. The more time they spend together, the more she begins to question what she’s always believed about vampires. Unfortunately, if she lets him in, she’ll have to admit that what she’s fought so hard for may be nothing but a lie.  Ian is determined to make her see him for what he truly he is, and not what she believes him to be. He can only hope he’ll be able to do so before she returns to her old life, and the certain death awaiting her. Amazon: Coming Soon! Apple iBooks: https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/...
