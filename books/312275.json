  "description": "Act With Me is a part of Kristen Proby’s With Me in Seattle UniverseJamesI get into one little fight at a Broadway play and suddenly my long list of awards doesn’t matter. So, here I am, doing a community theater play to help clean up my image. And then she walks in. She’s sweet, curvy perfection with deep brown eyes and a cute little blush to top it all off. She’s skittish, that much is clear, but I can’t let her walk away. Not until I figure out her secrets and why I feel the need to protect her.ShayI made the mistake of telling my best friend I wanted to step outside of my comfort zone after years of being afraid of my own shadow. I was thinking something along the lines of trying a caramel latte instead of a vanilla one, but my BFF convinced me to try out for the community theater play. When I show up I see… James Cooper Haze? What is a movie star like him doing here? And why is he looking at me like that? Can I push past my insecurities and trust the bad boy of Hollywood with my fragile heart?",
