  "title": "Wasteland Rules: Kill or Be Killed",
  "description": "The world as we know it was destroyed in a series of apocalyptic and cataclysmic events known respectively as the Collapse and the Aftermath. Civilization is broken and fragmented. Factions fight for supremacy in the remnants. Raiders, mutants, and worse plague the wasteland. The earth itself is mostly dead and ruined. This is the World After. To survive you must follow the Rules. Five years after the end of the Aftermath, one man has been hired to retrieve a device in return for a payoff that will allow him to leave the wasteland and retire in luxury. But he is not the only one seeking the device. Powerful forces are rising across the wasteland to seize the device for themselves and change the course of history. He must battle his way across the wasteland and kill or evade the hordes of enemies in his way. Some also seek the device, but others just want blood. Can he survive the dangers of the World After and complete his mission? This is an 87,000 word action/adventure novel in the style of the old pulp fiction novels. It is designed to be a fast and fun read, an escape from the daily grind.",
