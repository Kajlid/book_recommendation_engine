  "description": "A reckless bet, a lousy hand, and Charlotte Randall's life changes forever. For the next month, her body belongs to the devilishly handsome Byron Nolan - a man with more money than god and an ego to match. Ruthless and unyielding, he claims his prize with skillful pleasure, breaking down her defenses until she learns to crave every touch, every kiss, every shameful, depraved act he forces on her. But even as Byron masters her body, Charlotte is determined not to gamble the one prize she can still claim as her own - her heart. Because she's in house, playing by his rules... and the house always wins.",
