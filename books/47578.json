  "title": "The Three-Day Affair",
  "description": "A gripping debut novel about three longtime friends who make one mistake, forcing a chain of decisions that will haunt them forever. Will, Jeffrey, and Nolan have been friends since their undergrad days at Princeton. Now, nine years after graduation, Will is a failed musician still reeling from the death of a bandmate. Jeffrey got lucky and then rich from the dot-com boom, and Nolan is a state senator with national aspirations. Their friendships have bent without breaking for years, until one shocking event changes everything. One night on a drive, they make a routine stop at a convenience store. Moments after entering the store, a manic Jeffrey emerges, dragging a young woman with him. He shoves her into Will's car and shouts a single word: \"Drive!\" Shaken and confused, Will obeys.  Suddenly these three men find themselves completely out of their element, holding a frightened young girl hostage without the slightest idea of what to do next. They're already guilty of kidnapping and robbery; it's only a matter of time before they find out what else they might be guilty of. For these three friends, three days will decide their fate--between freedom and prison, innocence and guilt . . . and life and death.  The Three-Day Affair marks the emergence of an electrifying new voice in crime fiction.",
