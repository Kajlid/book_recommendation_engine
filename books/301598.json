  "description": "An age-gap, spicy romance about power, obsession, and finding true love in a nontraditional fairy taleWhere do I begin?Oh. Yeah.Once upon a time.Isn't that how all good fairy tales start?And Maximo and I, we were definitely a fairy tale.Not the cleaned-up, sanitized ones where life's problems were solved with a smile and a song. We were the old-school kind. The tales packed with greed, violence, and tragic beginnings.Okay, so maybe we weren't a traditional fairy tale. After all, Maximo was more villain than prince. He was scarily sexy. Devilishly charming. Controlling, possessive, and dangerous.He gave me the world. In exchange, I gave him what he wanted most.Me. All of me.I was his little dove.And heaven help anyone who tried to free me from my gilded cage.",
