  "description": "Nice guys finish last. Words I live by. In my world, it pays to be the bad guy…and I’m very good at being bad./I have a thriving business built on blood, sweat and tears—literally. Underground fights are my bread and butter, and no one interferes with that if they know what’s good for them.Not even some expensive-looking blonde, with dark blue eyes and a mouth that doesn’t know when to stop.Babysitting Lela Morgan starts out as a favour to a “friend,” but the longer I’m forced to look out for her, the harder it is to keep my hands to myself.And the more I want her, the crueller my words become. But in my dangerous world I cannot afford to be seen to be going soft.For the first time in my life, I’m close to losing control. The harder I push her away, the harder she pushes my buttons.But she’s tougher than she looks, and she’s not going down without a fight.Could it be that enemies make the best lovers?",
