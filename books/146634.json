  "description": "\"Lose yourself to find yourself.\"What begins as a creative journey - one musician, one photographer, and six months in India - quickly unravels into something far greater. When their original plans fall apart, Michael and Nikki abandon expectations and surrender to the unpredictable rhythm of India.From the chaos of Mumbai’s railway stations to the serenity of hidden ashrams, from encounters with wandering mystics to the absurdities of Indian bureaucracy, this raw and honest travelogue captures the beauty, intensity, and contradictions of life on the road.Told with sharp humour, deep reflection, and an unfiltered lens, What Is Your Good Name? is more than just a travel book - it’s a personal odyssey through the highs and lows of adventure, spirituality, and self-discovery.If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping the ordinary, embracing the unknown, or simply seeing India through fresh eyes, this book is your passport.",
