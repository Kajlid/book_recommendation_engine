  "description": "What the duke wants…. Is not three young ladies for wards.Nor is the responsibility for finding them a governess.Thankfully that is delegated to his housekeeper, who he might add is blind as a bat.That really could be the only excuse she has for hiring Carlotta. Because Carlotta is far too beautiful to be a governess.Temptress, yes. Unable to restrain himself—because restraint is not one of his virtues, his reputation is testament of that fact—he finds the young governess far more spirited, opinionated and tempting than he is able to resist.And of course, because he’s an idiot. He falls in love.Never questioning whether she’d be a willing participant.Of course life isn’t that easy, not even when you’re a bloody duke. And after one meddling Lady Southridge, Leads to two fiascos, Three wards decide to take matters into their own hands.Because what the duke wants…is simply to fall in love (preferably with the young woman in mind, falling in love too.)",
