Plus there’s a bunch of bonus stuff too, if you’ve already been keeping up-to-date with OJST’s weekly update online. Erika shares some brand new comics made exclusively for Volume one, as well as shares some behind-the-scenes information on OJST.If you hate funhappy depictions of sex and gut-punchingly bad jokes, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. You will 100% hate it.",
