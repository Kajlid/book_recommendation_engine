  "description": "Rob Lasseter is the great grandson of a legendary explorer. His prized possession is an old parchment, which is thought to be a map showing the location of the fabulous reef of gold. Unfortunately, however, there are no points of external reference on the map. The only words are ‘You are here’, next to an X, but Lasseter doesn’t know where X is – he doesn’t know where to start looking. Inspired by the strange disappearance of the White Haired girl, and the receipt of a letter addressed in his own handwriting from a place he had never been, Lasseter (with his friend Miles, who claims to be dead) embarks upon an odyssey into the centre of Australia and has some very strange adventures. Lasseter thinks he is looking for gold, but instead he finds something far more interesting. An Australian story of pan-cosmic enormity.About Adrian Adrian Deans has been writing seriously for nearly 20 years. His first published novel was Mr Cleansheets (Vulgar Press, 2010) which has proved amazingly popular and continues to sell in both hard copy and ebook form. Adrian’s new novel, the one you are about to read, has been in development for over ten years and takes the reader down strange new paths. Those who enjoyed Mr Cleansheets may find THEM a little more challenging but will recognise the style. Adrian continues to write novels, but he also dabbles in numerous other forms which can be further explored at www.adriandeans.com. Feel free to contact him if you wish to discuss his work.",
