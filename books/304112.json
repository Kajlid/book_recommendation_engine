  "description": "‘I told him,’ he says softly.‘Told him what?’ I whisper so that God won’t hear us.‘Everything.’‘What do you mean “everything”?’ My voice is shrill now, cutting through the March air like a butcher’s knife.His voice is quiet, but it makes the most important decisions for me, unasked: ‘How we were together for two years, how we used to meet up. How you were in love with me. I told him I am taking you away. Forever.’\n\n\nShe saved him, and he took her to his world.\n\nWhat comes after the happily ever after? When the breathtakingly gorgeous former lover is now a husband and the stubborn, prudish heroine his wife? When his friends think she’s neither good enough for him nor deserves him?\n\n\n\nLera\nHis ring is on my finger, and I’m living in his house in a country on another continent, in a world filled with his friends, yachts, parties, money. We are avoiding each other, we are sleeping in different bedrooms, we don`t even talk. Is this my life now?Do I really need a place for myself in his world, when all I hear is: “You’re not a fit here. Look at the beauties he dated before you! Do you realize how ugly you are? How many are waiting to replace you?”\n\n\nAlex\nHow do I prove that she is my soul mate, my one and only, when everything in my past screams the opposite? How can I cleanse myself? How can I protect her?\n\n\nAlex and Valeria’s emotional story continues in the hugely anticipated Monogamy Book Two. Husband.",
