  "description": "These Are The Unbridled Desires Of Women Without Men... When Their Same-Sex Passion Explodes, Will The Stables Ever Be Safe Again? You've read about them, these sisters under the skin, vulnerable to the temptations of Sappho... Passion-starved twilight girls crossing over into a man's world of high withers, rippling hindquarters and glossy coats... Meet women like Pauline in \"Miss Barnard's Unit\"--the country girl bereft of feminine influence who comes of age in World War I, and comes undone in the arms of a worldly debutante... Terry in \"Snake Eyes for Silky, \" a jockey from the school of hard knocks who falls hard for a whip-wielding gangster's moll, and finds that she must choose between her heart and her horse... Innocents like Lena and Lily in \"The Chosen Horse, \" who bond over the sad fate of a cart horse, and their unspoken need to tread the waters of Lesbos... A world-class jumper like Julie in \"Lady Snow, \" a champion tempted by the irresistible rhythms of the bisexual Euro-beat... A young girl like Oreola in \"Pastures of Passion, \" who follows a lost foal to a curious farm girl--and her own destiny... These Are The Women Of The Big Book Of Lesbian Horse Stories. The Paddock Gates Are Open--Come Inside And Join The Fun! With an inspired sense of nostalgia, sensation, and wry humor, Alisa Surkis and Monica Nolan invite readers back into the curves of third-sex pulp fiction where odd-girls-out now ride as free as a filly with their Bohemian desires--side-saddle be damned. But this time, from coy flirtation to requited lust, there's nary a man in sight to set them on the straight-and-narrow.",
