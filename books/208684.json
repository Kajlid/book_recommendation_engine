Sutherland spends a small fortune on a horse with a wild reputation, and is forced to sacrifice her position at her family’s stables to keep him. She plans to ride the magnificent stallion in the biggest event of the show jumping season—and she knows she can win. But without the backing of Sutherland Stables, A. J. must rely on a stranger to help a man who makes her heart pound, her head spin . . . and who just happens to be a legend in equestrian circles.When Devlin McCloud’s career was cut short by a tragic accident, he never expected to get back in the ring.

J. learn that even in a sport full of hazards, sometimes the most dangerous thing to risk is one’s heart. . . .",
