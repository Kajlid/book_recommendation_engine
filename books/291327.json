Not my toes.I don’t need a man. I most definitely don’t need Nash Reynolds. He might’ve come along at a time when I could use a distraction, but the answer is still no.My ex taught me plenty of lessons. The most important one: never count on any man to treat me right.I’m smart woman, and I learn from my mistakes, so I’m not about to fall for Nash. Not his Southern charm, not his way-too-hot for my eyes good, not his touch … Just no.Okay, maybe he does make my toes curl and make me wonder about things a girl shouldn’t be wondering about. Maybe he helps me out at a time when I really need it. Maybe, just maybe, he shows me he might be worth it.",
