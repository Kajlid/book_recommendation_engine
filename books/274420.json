It seems killing me woke something deep inside, something so dark and buried so deep I never knew it was there.  I don’t know what I am, I don’t really care. All I can think about is revenge, even as the monsters in the dark start to surround me. Their horns and black eyes, mouths filled with fangs claiming I am theirs.  My monsters will have to wait, he will regret the day he crossed me.  Are you scared of the dark? You should be.  *18+ Reverse Harem Romance. Warning this book contains scenes and references of abuse/assault that some readers may find triggering. Along with graphic sex scenes and violence. This is a dark book*",
