  "description": "Jessica:\nLucifer Morningstar isn’t your typical billionaire playboy with a Bentley and a bad attitude. He’s sinfully handsome, sex on a stick, sell your soul gorgeous. Oh yeah, and he’s the literal devil.I have a hard rule about letting Satan in my pants. But when he makes a deal I can’t refuse, I find out he’s my fated mate, and apparently, he’s claimed me before, although I have no memory of it. What ensues is a walk through memory lane as we travel the nine circles of hell, retracing one fucked-up love affair for the ages.\nLucifer:\nThe moment her perfect ass struts into my club, I know she’s the one I’ve been looking for, my reincarnated queen, my mate. I can’t let my brother steal her from me again. Not when there is so much at stake.I’ll do anything to keep her safe, even if it means forcing her to the Underworld to see all that we had built together. I need her to remember the life we shared, all the shit we’ve been through and above all, she needs to remember that she has and always will be mine.",
