  "description": "While traveling the California coast visiting historical missions, Connor Hawthorne and her partner, Laura Nez, are thrust into the middle of an age-old conflict as they investigate what may be terrorist threats against nuclear power stations. But is Rick Bell a terrorist? Or a religious zealot who interprets Biblical prophesy to suit his own brand of madness? Or merely a sociopath who murders those who disappoint him? The two women quickly become neck deep in mystery that not only leads them to hidden truths that someone in the Vatican will do anything to suppress, but also puts them squarely in the middle of a centuries-old battle between two secret societies. One is a ruthless organization whose members are sworn to search out and silence heretics; the other a band of mystics whose supernatural abilities and unswerving loyalty to the Holy Mother are their only weapons in preserving a sacred relic that could rewrite history. Returning in Death by Prophecy is the rich cast of unforgettable characters from the first two Connor Hawthorne mysteries, including Connor's grandmother, Gwendolyn, who continues to provide guidance from somewhere beyond the grave.",
