  "description": "A history rendered as tragedy, Frei Luís de Sousa is a classic drama of Portuguese Romanticism. Drawing on the nostalgia for the time of Portugal's 16th King, D. Sebastian (1544-1578), current in his time, Garrett tells the story of Manuel de Sousa Coutinho, a highly-regarded noble who is married to the widow of a noble thought to have died with D. Sebastian in battle. But then, after more than twenty years, the husband returns, rendering the couple's marriage, and daughter, illegitimate.",
