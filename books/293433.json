  "title": "Because Sometimes Something Extraordinary Happens",
  "description": "Seventeen short stories by Debz Hobbs-Wyatt from over a decade of competition wins and shortlistings. Featuring \"Learning to Fly\", winner of the inaugural Bath Short Story Award; \"Chutney\", shortlisted in the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, and \"Pushcart\" nominated, The Theory of Circles.  Meet a mixture of beguiling narrators, from seven-year-old Leonardo Renoir Hope trying to change the past so his dad doesn’t die, and George and his carrot-growing friends on an east London allotment waiting for the world to end, to Amy Fisher who realises that her husband, after his sudden death, is not who she thinks he is… but who is the other Mrs Fisher? This one adds a touch of medical horror to the mix.  All of the stories are about ordinary people when extraordinary things happen to them.",
