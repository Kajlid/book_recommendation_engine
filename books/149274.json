  "description": "Book one in The Pericolo Series. They call me the Femme Fatale. But only because they don’t know me. My job - seduce men only to deliver their death sentence. I work for my father’s business. I’m his secret weapon. I’m the one that gets away with murder. For years, I’ve given in to my father’s demands, lived the life of a mob princess, fell into this merciless realm where he presents me with a man and one goal – to kill. When it’s to keep the Abbiati name from ruins, I’ll run with the wolves and protect it fiercely. However, when he brings a new name to the table, I know my newest mission could well be the one that breaks me - don’t feel, don’t deviate, kill Zane Maverick. It should be simple, but how am I supposed to choose between the man who raised me to be this seemingly heartless and strong female and the man I could only ever love to death? ***Warning: 18+, due to scenes of graphic murder, sex and a high use of swearing***",
