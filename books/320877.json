  "description": "I had a new life.One that I fought for.One that I lied for.One that I would do anything to protect.No one knew about the secrets that kept me awake at night.I fought tooth and nail to keep everyone at arm’s length.Until a woman I hadn’t seen since childhood showed up on my doorstep.Keeley Fox wanted answers, but all that I could give her were lies.Lies that would shield her from the nastiness of my past. A past that collided with hers and could destroy the pretty world that she lived in. One push from her became too much and I savored her downfall, except she took me down with her.Now I was exposed to all of Wellington University and that reputation I had built was a pile of bricks at my feet.The greatest lie of all was that love was worth the fight.",
