  "description": "Nothing is more awkward than waking up next to a woman whose name you canâ€™t remember... Navy SEAL Trick Novak knows he needs to find a better way to deal with his chronic insomnia, but a warm body and a ready smile work just fine. Until he meets Gaby Ellis, and discovers she's roommates with last night's hook-up--and thoroughly disgusted with his player ways. Except maybe falling in love with one who'd rather not know yours.",
