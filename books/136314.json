  "description": "\"Scary, freaky, and original. Get this book!\" —Nancy Holder Lifeless. Slow-moving. Brain-dead. Welcome To Zomburbia.My name is Courtney Hart, and I'm here to tell you about things that suck. Being born in a podunk town like Salem, Oregon, for one. Living in a world infested with zombies? That, too. And the meat heads I go to school with? I think I'd actually take the undead over them most days. But I have a plan to get out of here and move to New York. I just have to keep selling Vitamin Z along with your fries at The Bully Burger. The secret ingredient? Zombie brains. I've noticed things are getting even worse lately, if that's even possible. The zombies seem to be getting smarter and faster. If I can avoid being arrested, eaten by shufflers, or catching the eye of some stupid boy, I should be able to make it through finals week still breathing. . . \"Gallardo's world-building is innovative and fascinating, sick and twisted and unexpectedly touching. You'll want to check that your zombie apocalypse closet is well stocked.\" —Molly Harper White\"Readers are guaranteed plenty of mayhem and romance, laughter and heartbreak.\" —James Patrick Kelly",
