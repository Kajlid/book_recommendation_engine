  "description": "What do you do when your whole life is a lie? Go to college...  I just found out that I’m a supernatural and now I’m attending Redwood Supernatural University. With its magic and mix of beings from myth and legend, I’m definitely not in the human world anymore.  But not everything is picture perfect. I have the Bitch Crew that are determined to get rid of me, a guy that’s hell-bent on teaching me a lesson, and my past haunting me in my dreams.  It’s not all bad though; I have my quirky roommate Sadie and six guys who seem intent on keeping me around.  I got this...hopefully.  Book 1 of the Best Wishes Series  The Best Wishes Series is a WhyChoose/Reverse Harem saga featuring MMFMMMM meaning there is M/M content, and the female main character doesn't have to choose between her love interests.  This series contains references involving PTSD, sexual assault recollections, domestic violence, and other themes that some readers may find triggering.",
