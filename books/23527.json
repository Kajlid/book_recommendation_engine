  "description": "\"A wonderful, fresh, and striking collection\" (Eavan Boland) from the winner of the 2001 Gerald Cable Book Award. At the heart of this collection is an intense rendering of a young boy's murder and the lives of those who endured it. Reminiscent of the work of B. H. Fairchild and Larry Levis, Miscreants investigates memory, family, violence, and the transition from boyhood to adolescence in the decaying, working-class towns of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.",
