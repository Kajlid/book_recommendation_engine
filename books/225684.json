  "description": "Alice I shot him with my paintball gun. It was instant lust, the moment I caught sight of his tattoos, well-muscled body, and cocky grin. However, it was ass over tea kettle love the minute that sexy bastard brought me coffee and a bacon wrapped donut. I fell hard, and I loved every minute of it. I was lucky enough to grow up in Spartan, but I’d been contemplating a move to somewhere more populated. Lucky for me, Luke moved here and showed me how awesome it is to meet someone who’s crazy matches your own. It’s not all unicorns and rainbows, when an unwanted blast from my past blows into town, and tries knocking me off my pedestal of awesomeness.  Luke She didn’t shoot me. She missed by a good ten feet. I fell in love with her the minute I caught sight of her cute little ass in a big pair of flowered granny panties. I tell her it was her pretty eyes, and gorgeous red hair, but really, it was the underwear. Moving to Spartan was the best decision I’d ever made. I never thought I would meet the love of my life when I moved to this small town. The people who live here take a bit of getting used to. They sometimes forget what appropriate clothing is, and will use any excuse to party. I wish I could say that everything followed the fairy tale path, but people intrude, and bring the devil with them.  Embrace your crazy, and enjoy your time in our comical, but absurd little town. Welcome to Spartan!",
