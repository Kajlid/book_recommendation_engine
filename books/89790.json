They live among us, their presence clear to those who have eyes to see... High Crag on Cornwall's desolate storm-lashed coast is a terrible place with dark secrets. Here the Grigori are preparing for world dominance as the new millennium approaches. Deep beneath the cliffs an ancient power sleeps that holds the secrets of the past, waiting to be rediscovered. Into this mix comes Peverel Othman, the fallen angel Shemyaza, escaping the destruction that he cause in Little Moor. With him are Daniel, now a seer, and the twins Owen and Lily Winter. Has Peverel arrived to help his fellow Grigori, or to side with his followers on the side of humans, or has he got his own plans to use them both to once again become Shemyaza, an avenging angel of awesome power?",
