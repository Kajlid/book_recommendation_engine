  "description": "There are rumors going around about my twin stepbrothers.  HUGE rumors.  I try to ignore gossip, but it’s easier said than done when it involves crazy sex stuff and verified reports about the size of things that a stepsister should know nothing about.  Ethan and Nathan are the identically gorgeous hunks of man flesh that have just moved into my house. I could barely look at them before the rumors, with their ridiculously twinkly blue eyes, and smiles that turn me into a mindless puddle of goo.  We’re supposed to be family and I’m trying my hardest to be a welcoming stepsister. But then I overhear them talking about things I am definitely not supposed to know, and suddenly I realize I’m in double trouble.  HUGE X2 is the story of a girl’s realization that the best things in life come in extra-large, twin packs. HEA guaranteed!  Also features BONUS BOOK, Escape - A Stepbrother Romance, for a limited time only.",
