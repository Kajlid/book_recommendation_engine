At 48, he’s at the peak of his career, recently widowed, and losing interest in life. His future immediately is transformed when he meets Britney Young, a beautiful and brilliant PhD, who rekindles passions he thought were only in his past. Money, power, and violence are being wielded by a Central American drug cartel intent on raiding MemOne's innovations, gaining access to its high-tech biological meds. If successful, the bold move would revolutionize the underground drug world.Under the veil of an undisclosed U.S. corporation, the cartel prepares for a hostile takeover of MemOne. Britney becomes their target as they seek vital information. With her life threatened and a former colleague brutally murdered, Britney reluctantly confides in Sam, exposing him to the looming danger she’s facing. To protect his new love and to shield MemOne from an enemy it’s unaware even exists, Sam knows he must stop whoever is behind the Corrupt Connection. Britney and Sam are self-effacing yet competent, vulnerable yet courageous, as they draw the reader into their tale of love, fear, pain, and hope.",
