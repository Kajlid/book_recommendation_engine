  "description": "Clay is eighteen and enjoying his first summer on his own, working as a busboy with his friends David, James, and the enigmatic but undeniably charismatic Peter. When Peter suggests that they all endure a test of courage at a long-abandoned house, Clay has no idea what sick and slippery secrets are in store for them. Peter has found something in that little island house, something old and hungry with many arms, and he intends to feed Clay to it, Body and soul.Warning: This 3,000 word erotic short contains themes of dubious consent, tentacle sex, voyeurism, orgasm denial, and moderately graphic sounding play. Every character is 18 or older, especially the ancient eldrich horrors.",
