  "description": "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still And this same flower that smiles to-day To-morrow will be dying. [Herrick] \"The Language of Flowers\" - the biggest book of the year. The most talked-about debut acquisition of 2010 will be the publishing event of 2011. The Victorian language of flowers was used to express honeysuckle for devotion, azaleas for passion, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it has been more useful in communicating feelings like grief, mistrust and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings. Now eighteen, Victoria has nowhere to go, and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. When her talent is discovered by a local florist, she discovers her gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But it takes meeting a mysterious vendor at the flower market for her to realise what's been missing in her own life, and as she starts to fall for him, she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, and decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness. \"The Language of Flowers\" is a heartbreaking and redemptive novel about the meaning of flowers, the meaning of family, and the meaning of love.",
