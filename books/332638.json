  "description": "Britain's west coast is home to only one pod of orca, and they're heading rapidly towards extinction.  In 2014, Dr Natalie Sanders joined the crew of the HV Silurian to seek out the West Coast Community of Orca and study them before we lose them forever. In The Last Sunset in the West, she discusses them as individuals while also exploring the many issues surrounding their lives.  Her captivating account takes the reader from the Western Isles of Scotland to Vancouver Island and around the world, deep into the history of our relations with these beautiful and sentient creatures.",
