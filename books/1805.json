New discovery MELISSA LYONS is the most powerful new voice in suspense since Dean Koontz with her story, \"Snow.\" Editor BEN PARRIS adds two stories of his own edited by Fantasy & Science Fiction contributor KEN ALTABEF. In \"Murder in Songjiang\": All Brian wanted to do was teach English in China. All the U.S. State Department wanted of the CIA was a quiet investigation of how Brian got killed there. Espionage trainee Mike Spoto stood in the middle and cared about his training case too much for his own good. ROBERT HORSEMAN presents \"Déjà vu\": There are two kinds of déjà The kind where you remember things that never happened, and the kind Daniel has; BRAD POST gives us \"The Trees\": Sharon had second thoughts about her new husband Johnny. Her father detested the man, and the trees didn't like either of them Those tales and more by new discoveries SUSAN DAVID, CATHY DOUGLAS, KATE LARKINDALE, MICHELLE D KEYES, and GERALD VINCENT.
