  "description": "Before the mid-1800s, much of the American West was a vastexpanse of open plains. Native tribes followed buffalo herdsunimpeded for hundreds of miles, cowboys ran cattle whereverwater and grass led them, and the cattleman s Law of the OpenRange ruled. All this changed when settlers pouring into the Westunder the Homestead Act of 1862 brought with them the Easternfarmer s concept of fencing in farms. With the invention and massproduction of barbed wire in the 1870s, it soon became possiblefor homesteaders to fence off millions of acres of what was onceopen range. But barbed wire threatened the livelihood of thecattlemen who depended on unfenced grasslands, and a clash ofcultures was inevitable.In a style that will capture the interest of adult and teen readers,Barbed Wire: The Fence That Changed the West reveals the surprisinglycritical role the invention of barbed wire played in the settling ofAmerica. From the legal battles over barbed wire patents to thebrutal fencing wars that erupted on the frontier and the ultimateend of the open range, author Joanne Liu tells the fascinating storyof how a simple twist of wire transformed a country s landscapeand ushered in a new way of life.",
