  "description": "Somehow, Luther Kite has found them. At long last, the third installment in the Andrew Z. Thomas series. Following the events of DESERT PLACES and LOCKED DOORS, Andy Thomas and Violet King are hiding out in the wilds of northern Canada, where Violet has a four-month-old son and a burgeoning romance with Andy. On a cold, rainy night at their cabin in the woods, the promise of an idyllic life that seems just around the corner is shattered when a man from their past, a monster of pure malevolence, returns. What he has in store for them will challenge their understanding of evil and stretch the fibers of their love to the breaking point.This ebook, a 20,000-word novella, is both the sequel to Desert Places and Locked Doors and the bridge between Locked Doors and Stirred, coming this year from Crouch and J.A. Konrath. It isn't necessary for you to read either Desert Places or Locked Doors to fully understand and be terrified by Break You. Additional material includes a foreword, afterword, bonus interview with Blake and J.A. Konrath, excerpts from DESERT PLACES and LOCKED DOORS by Crouch, and SHAKEN by Konrath.",
