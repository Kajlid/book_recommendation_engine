  "description": "My new alpha did the impossible. He freed my hobbled wolf.And though I've craved a pack and an alpha since I was a rejected kid, I rebel against being anything less than his equal--even as my wolf worships the very ground he walks on. It makes for an interesting dynamic.Flung headfirst into the supernaturals' world, I am no longer a lonely, agonized outcast running from the moon. My power is growing, I have amazing people around me, and the grateful mayor has set me up with an office and a legitimate job.For a minute, everything is quiet. Too quiet. Even the demon seems to have disappeared. And all that peace is just a little unsettling.But then a human hires me to go after the vampires--specifically the county master--and my world explodes into chaos.Good thing I like chaos.But when the demon returns with a vengeance, the council makes me an offer I don't want to refuse, and an infamous and scary as hell hunter blows into my life, the peace and quiet starts looking pretty damn good...",
