  "description": "Horse and rider are one. Theirs is a relationship of trust, harmony, and respect born of a way of life that is all but lost. One man puts it within our grasp again. In this book, GaWaNi Pony Boy illustrates the traditional training methods - methods that are steeped in common sense and age-old wisdom - of his ancestors, America's first great horsemen. The full-color photographs and simple eloquence takes us back to the days when horse training was not merely about getting results but about creating a bond for life. An inspiration for riders and a feast for horse and Native American culture enthusiasts, Horse, Follow Closely: Native American Horsemanship forges a relationship with readers that few books can ever hope to achieve.",
