  "title": "Scales of Justice",
  "description": "Of all the books in the Alleyn series, Scales of Justice is most powerfully reminiscent of Agatha Christie, with its setting in an almost unspeakably charming little English village, and its cast of inbred aristocrats. When one of the aristos turns up dead next to the local trout-stream – with, in fact, a trout at his side – everyone is dreadfully upset, of course, but really, just a tad irritated as well: Murder is so awfully messy. Thank gawd that nice Inspector Alleyn – not really one of us, you know, but not terribly wide of the mark – is on hand to clear things up. Though one could wish that he didn’t feel compelled to ask quite so many questions.",
