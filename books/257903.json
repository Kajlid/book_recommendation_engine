When he’s assigned to guard his boss’ daughter, there’s nothing more he wants than to do his job. Day after day, he watches her; little by little, he discovers that she’s unlike any other he’s ever met. While nursing her heart from a recent heartbreak, Hannah Collins believes relation-ships aren’t meant for her and vowed to never get involved with a man again. However, their lives suddenly turned on its head when a tragedy forces them on a road trip, and as the odds stack up against Hannah, she has no choice but to ride through the series of events that end up breaking her heart once again. While on the run, Hannah is determined to fight the growing attraction she feels for her bodyguard; Nathan goes all out to keep her safe, even letting his guard down. But he can’t seem to deny the effect she has on his troubled soul. And she can’t seem to keep the distance between them when her life is constantly at risk. But just how long is Hannah able to ignore the attractive man who is willing to risk it all, even his heart, to keep her safe? Forbidden kisses. Gunfights. Family drama. Secret lovers.",
