Aligned with the resurgence of feminism in pop culture, Broad Strokes offers an entertaining corrective to that omission. Art historian Bridget Quinn delves into the lives and careers of 15 brilliant female artists in text that's smart, feisty, educational, and an enjoyable read. Replete with beautiful reproductions of the artists' works and contemporary portraits of each artist by renowned illustrator Lisa Congdon, this is art history from 1600 to the present day for the modern art lover, reader, and feminist.Artemisia GentileschiJudith LeysterAdélaïd Labille-GuiardMarie Denise VillersRosa BonheurEdmonia LewisPaula Modersohn-BeckerVanessa BellAlice NeelLee KrasnerLouise BourgeoisRuth AsawaAna MendietaKara WalkerSusan O'Malley",
