  "title": "The Reckoning: An Extreme Horror Novel",
  "description": "This is book five in the A Glimpse into Hell series. Seth brings back Missy, Wyatt, Barry and Kenneth to help with a special assignment; to travel the State of Texas and inflict the most horrifying and demented acts of vengeance against our society’s most ruthless criminals. The Reckoning is filled with dark humor, distasteful content, sadistic torture and nonstop acts of carnage. It also has a new level of disgustingness that the previous books lacked. But it’s not all gore—there is also a great deal of interaction between Seth and his friends ranging from comradery, banter and animosity.WARNING: This book is extreme and contains filthy, grotesque and brutal torture scenes. It contains GRAPHIC CONTENT, ADULT LANGUAGE & POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS, may be disturbing to sensitive readers, and should only be read by the seasoned extreme-horror reader.",
