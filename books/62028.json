  "description": "Sarah Colter heads home to Cottonwood, to settle the estate of her parents who were killed in a head on collision several months ago. An old college friend, Sam Jordane is from the firm her parents used to take care of their wills years ago. Sam reads the will and gives Sarah a beautifully decorated wooden box and key. He explains how wealthy she is now. Her Aunt and Cousin also inherited sizable amounts.Sarah told Sam of her napping and waking with a portion of her clothing torn off, and some of her packing boxes were scratched and torn. Sarah opened the wooden box for him and asked him to look at it's contents, which included very valuable jewelry and a stack of letters. He read one in particular that he said his parents needed to see immediately.Sam and Sarah drove to his parents home in the Cottonwood hills. They read several of the letters and were astounded to learn that Sarah's Dad was not her Father. That her Father's parents live in Italy. The reason Sam wanted them to see the letter was that they were close friends of Sam's parents and had lost track of them.",
