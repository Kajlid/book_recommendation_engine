  "description": "Wrenna Sunden lives in the utopian world of Avalon, under the care and protection of Sophia, a personal, synthetically intelligent being that governs everything, creating harmony and peace. Since she was a child, Wrenna was without want, getting all her heart desired, but her lavish lifestyle is stripped away when Sophia institutes the Exodus Act, a relocation program to a new, better utopia enacted by mechanized retrieval units. Wrenna puts her trust in Sophia, but when her father isnâ€™t convinced the Exodus Act is what Sophia says, he wants Wrenna to escape. Wrenna must choose between her father and Sophia. On one surprising day, she is thrust into a decision that will change her fate forever and send her down spiraling into a world of survival. Wrenna must come to grips with her new reality, fight to survive, and somehow find out what happened on that fateful day.",
