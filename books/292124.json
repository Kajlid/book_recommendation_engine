  "description": "Men are good for two things: orgasms and reaching the wine glasses on the top shelf.ARI: I’ve always said boyfriends are like martinis; they’re lots of fun at first, but the longer you hang out the bigger headache they’ll give you. The last thing I need is the messy complications of love when I’ve got so many balls in the air and so many goals yet to accomplish. Jax Crosby thinks he can tempt me to take a walk on the scary side and he’s using his daughter to reel me in. But he doesn’t realize that giving yourself to someone else means losing the one and only thing that belongs to just you. JAX: I like to stay two steps ahead; that way, I’m never surprised. But even I didn’t see this one coming. Congratulations to me—I’m a freakin’ dad. Now I’ve got a teenage daughter who hates me, an ex who wants to cut things off my body I’m not ready to part with, and an attraction to a curvy songbird that couldn’t have come at a worse time. But I’ve never met a situation I couldn’t handle, and I’ve never let a female get the best of me. So why do I have the feeling Ari Amante might be one more thing I never saw coming?",
