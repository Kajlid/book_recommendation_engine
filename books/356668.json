  "description": "The third book in NewSouth's series bringing back into print all of Koning's fiction, A Walk with Love and Death is the story of Heron, a student in France, who decides to journey on foot to England during the plague year of 1358. His journey symbolizes freedom, as he turns his back on both the ruling oligarchy and the peasant armies forming all over Europe. He travels through a chaotic wasteland, where strange armies clash for unknown reasons, where the barren countryside is plagued by robbers and warlords. He meets death, destruction, and famine before finally finding Claudia, the daughter of a medieval lord. Heron's quest for freedom, stemming from a desire to create an ideal world out of the violently cruel one, leads him through despair and danger, before delivering him to love.",
