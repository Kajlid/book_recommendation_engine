  "description": "A steamy friends to lovers romance that breaks the bro-code…big time!Gio is blessed with a big family and lots of friends. Unfortunately, there’s an unspoken code amongst his buddies…one where sisters are off-limits. That wouldn’t be a problem if he and his best friend, Rafe, could stop thinking about Kayden’s vivacious, fun-loving little sister, Keeley. They have always been stand-up guys, but Keeley is so tempting, so sexy, that they’re in danger of breaking all the rules.Keeley’s not exactly batting a thousand when it comes to life. She just lost her job and her only true talent seems to be picking the worst guys on the planet from online dating sites. However, her uneventful life takes a turn for the steamy after Rafe hires her to work for him and he and Gio start crashing all her bad dates. When one kiss lead to a second and then to something much, much more, the lovers are left to decide if they’re engaging in a fun fling or embarking on forever.",
