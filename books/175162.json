  "title": "A Rose for Emily",
  "description": "Miss Emily Grierson is a newly departed spinster who led a mysterious life in relative isolation. Although regarded as a touch eccentric, it is only after her death, when a decidedly shocking discovery is found in her house, that the people of Jefferson, Yoknapatawapha County realize just how strange Emily’s truly life was.Although primarily known for his novels, William Faulkner wrote in a variety of formats, including plays, poetry, essays, screenplays, and short stories, many of which are highly acclaimed and anthologized. Like his novels, many of Faulkner’s short stories are set in fictional Yoknapatawapha County, a setting inspired by Lafayette County, where Faulkner spent most of his life. His first short story collection, These 13 (1931), includes many of his most frequently anthologized stories, including \"A Rose for Emily\", \"Red Leaves\" and \"That Evening Sun.\"HarperCollins brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
