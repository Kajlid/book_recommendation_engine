  "description": "Leila Murry is young, married, and working in a motel as a receptionist - and then as a prostitute. The seemingly random abuses and perils of her adult life parallel those Leila suffered as a child, and in reliving them she is uncertain whether she will survive them this time, or indeed, if she wishes to. This \"extremely powerful debut\" tells a story that is at once \"profoundly disturbing but also resonant with hope and rebirth\" -Los Angeles Times.",
