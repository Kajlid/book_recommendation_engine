When a mysterious elf from her past stirs up long-suppressed passion, Cinderella begins to wonder if there really is love beneath the spell that captured her husband’s heart. But undoing magic can be harder than casting the initial spell, and the results are even less predictable. Cinders is part of the three-novella collection, Bonded by Michelle Davidson Argyle.",
