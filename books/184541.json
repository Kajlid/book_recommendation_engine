  "description": "Harris Cain, billionaire shifter and heir to the largest pack on the west coast, needs an heir of his own to cement his claim as the pack's true alpha.  But in a society where female shifters are sterile, Harris has to rely on a special kind of male to carry his pup: An omega.  There's only one problem... Harris is unquestionably straight.  After interviewing several candidates, he settles on Cameron Barnes--the young omega his wolf is strangely drawn to. The omega he's now imagining in his bed, submitting to his every demand...  Cam was just looking for a little fast cash. Stuck at his parents' house after a nasty breakup, he needed the huge payout offered by Cain Enterprises. Even if it meant being mated by a devastatingly handsome--and devastatingly straight--alpha.  Even if it meant losing his heart in the process.  As Harris and Cameron find themselves drawn together by a powerful, undeniable attraction, a threat looms in the shadows that could destroy their family before it's even started.  The Omega Contract is a standalone novella with a HEA ending and NO CLIFFHANGERS!  Content Warning: This book is a first time gay for you romance. It contains explicit, unprotected love scenes and male pregnancy, or Mpreg. Adults only shifter romance!",
