  "description": "The Twelve Gods are exiled but someone is scheming to rule in their place...  Theo is a very special boy, in fact he is more than just a boy; he is a demigod with amazing powers. After returning home one evening, he finds two strangers talking to his parents: “The boy is our only hope” the man in black said “he is the only one who can summon the Twelve and save the world of the mortals from enslavement and destruction”. Theo sets off in a quest to restore order and stop the evil Daemon gods from taking over the world of men. In his journey he must overcome the dangers and difficulties with bravery and wisdom, if he wishes to complete the Three Trials successfully and become a Champion of the Gods. Thankfully he is not alone; his brave young Guardians accompany him in a search of six Divine Keys that have the power to unlock the Seals that keep the Twelve Gods exiled in another dimension. Adventure, magic, friendship and mystery are some of the elements of this great read that can only be compared to the magnitude of the Harry Potter series and the originality of Percy Jackson.",
