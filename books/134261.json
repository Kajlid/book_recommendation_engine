  "title": "A Childhood in Scotland",
  "description": "In this perceptive but unpretentious autobiography, Christian Miller recalls her privileged yet simultaneously deprived 1920s upper-class childhood in a castle in the Scottish highlands, giving readers an insight into the last relics of feudal life. A Childhood in Scotland describes a youth in a world where shooting came second only to religion, where questions were frowned upon, and reading seen as a waste of time.",
