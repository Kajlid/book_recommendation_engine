She knows nothing about what waits for her, save for one simple truth: death to all that pass into the beast’s lair. Only, she’s not planning on dying.  And the beast’s not planning on letting her go.The Complex Book Series. A Lone Planet. One Complex. Unlimited Chaos. *** This is a 20,000 word novella. ***",
