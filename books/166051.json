  "description": "文学的な版大学院生と天才の利益のためにSure, the Irish took over politics in Orange County, Southern California, long ago. We all know that--and inside politics--the winning and losing--it still goes on. So, if there is another Finnegan--another wake--that should come as no surprise.My fellow Irishmen and Irishwomen—sure, we all speak in hushed and reverent words about that expatriate, James Joyce. We hold him dear, do we not?Yes, for we all can say—my book, my novel—is a model of clarity besides Ulysses, and Finnegan’s Wake.Ah, yes. What a service he did for our green, green continent, and scattered people worldwide.When they say what you have written is incoherent, inscrutable, meaningless nonsense—you can point to those two lovely tomes in your library—right next to the keg, and say—it doesn’t matter if you cannot be understood.",
