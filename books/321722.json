  "description": "There’s nothing wrong with having everything you want and finally enjoying life. Unfortunately, in the case of Isabelle and Stacy, this doesn’t ring true. Returning to their life in Florida, they leave Isabelle’s daughter Hope in North Carolina to run their popular B&B. Their dream of having a home in Nantucket was so close to happening. They seem to have the perfect life, sound business ventures, and a harmonious blended family. But that all changes the night tragedy strikes with a fire that takes more than just Violet’s ranch. Not knowing what else to do to try and hold the family together while steeped in grief, Stacy and Isabelle split ways, but hopefully only temporarily. Stacy goes to their Florida home and Isabelle heads back to North Carolina to run the B&B that is booked solid for the next year. But when a guest has a tempting offer, Isabelle questions her loyalty to Stacy. While in Florida they discover evil lives right next-door, wreaking havoc on an already fragile family. In the tradition of the first novel, this sequel, “The Only Man,” continues to show how one can overcome life’s challenges while discovering what you’re made of. Does true love really exist? And if true love really does exist, can it survive unprecedented grief, long distance and adulterous temptation",
