  "title": "Sisters in Arms: British Army Nurses Tell Their Story",
  "description": "The amazing experiences of the Queen Alexandra nurses during World War II form one of the greatest adventure stories of modern times, yet until now theyâ€™ve remained largely untold. Thousands of middle-class girls, barely out of school, were plucked from sheltered backgrounds, subjected to unimaginably tough training regimes, and sent out to experience the harshest conditions of the fighting services. They saw it the beaches of Dunkirk, Singapore, and D-Day. Dozens won medals for gallantry. Hundreds of nurses torpedoed in hospital ships, bombed in field hospitals, or murdered in Japanese prison camps.",
