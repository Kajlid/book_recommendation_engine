  "description": "In 9 INCARNATE Egypt’s great gods and goddesses arrive by comet bringing hope of unity and secrets of the pyramids. However, the beloved Isis isn't among the Arrivals and preternatural investigator Caitlin Diggs begins hearing the goddess in her head. Could Diggs’s previous exposure to a crystal artifact substantiate the belief that Isis has stored her essence on Earth and consequently now shares her human body? Perplexed, Diggs turns to a scientist to explain the Arrivals, not to mention the weirdness which includes a coinciding mass disappearance and assassination of the president. Diggs surmises the deities may be preparing a new Egypt until a lethal threat of global warming emerges. More perplexing, is her co-alignment with Isis an alliance or hindrance? Diggs may have to make the ultimate sacrifice if she is to keep Egypt’s past from ending Earth’s future, and all the while maintain her integrity.",
