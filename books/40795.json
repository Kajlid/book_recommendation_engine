This latest novel, \"The Surgeon's Blade\" is chilling, tense and is described as a 'real corker of a read'. Nursing sister, Libby Hunter wakes up in hospital with amnesia after a traumatic sailing accident. The stranger she finds sitting by her bedside claims to be her fiancé. As she cannot remember ever being engaged, she finds excuses to put him off until she is completely sure of her true feelings. Returning home, Libby finds herself in great danger when her house is broken into. Who is the intruder and what does he want? Is this connected in any way to a series of attacks on nurses in London and Southampton? Will Libby be the latest targeted victim? Distressed Libby turns to helicopter pilot, Robert for help and understanding, but is he as respectable and kind as he appears to be? Is her so-called fiancé, Nigel trustworthy? The night time intrusion into Libby's house sets in motion a downwards spiral of cataclysmic and terrifying events, culminating in our favourite sleuth, Diana Rivers stepping in to help solve the case in this chilling mystery",
