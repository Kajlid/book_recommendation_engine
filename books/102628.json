  "description": "On the run and under fire…Providing medical relief in a war-torn region helps Alex Peters forget his past and focus on the job—delivering babies. Less easy to overlook is his blonde comrade-at-arms, who knows nothing of the trouble he's running from. Katie McCloud makes the assignment bearable, although her perky innocence proves to be an arousing distraction. Then, as combat explodes around them, their only option is flight. A kindergarten teacher seeking adventure, Katie hoped this humanitarian mission—and the mysterious, sexy doctor sharing it—would push her out of her comfort zone. With Alex, she starts taking tantalizing risks and becoming the survivor she knew she could be. But back on U.S. soil, Alex and Katie face a new threat, and this time they're the target. Forced into close confines, neither can believe the other isn't the intended mark. With only each other to depend on—and suspect—Alex and Katie can't avoid the simmering attraction between them. But to stay alive, they'll have to trust more deeply than ever before…",
