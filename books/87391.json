  "description": "The folks in Dogwood are abuzz with excitement when a new parson comes to lead their congregation. The whole town gets busy preparing a pounding -- where everyone brings \"a pound o' this and a pound o' that\" to make Brother Harper feel more at home. Jory Timmons wants so badly to give the perfect gift to Brother Harper. But it seems that he is too small to do anything right! He can't light a stove to bake a pie like Mama, and he isn't strong enough to carry a sack of corn like his older brother, Thomas. But in this lively tale, loaded with country charm, Jory Timmons learns that the best gifts are given when he is simply being himself.",
