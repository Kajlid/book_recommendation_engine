  "description": "If power can collar the fae, can love free them? Or will they be forever trapped in the Monster Garden?  May James expects to graduate, even if it means eating ramen seven days a week and flipping burgers. She’s prepared to do anything to succeed – anything except feed three beautiful fae with her touch alone. May is a Brightened, one of the few gifted humans who have abilities that can influence the gorgeous and intimidating fae who walk the earth. But when the enigmatic Vilmor Van Grier offers her sixty-thousand dollars to feed the eight high fae he’s collared with his own Brightness, May must contend with the magical reality of Vilmor’s estate – the Monster Garden, her own powers, and the infuriating-but-volcanically-irresistible fae named Dane.   ***This book is an Urban Fantasy New Adult hate-to-love story that contains language and situations which may be inappropriate for minors below the age of 18.
