  "title": "Hela's Story: Events After Ragnarok According to Loki's Daughter",
  "description": "Hela, daughter of Loki, tells the reality of the Norse myths and how events unfolded after Ragnarok. With a touch of her father's \"trickster\" humor, Hela takes on the serious task of clearing up modern misconceptions while providing new perspectives and healing as she rebuilds Hel her way and visits the other gods. During her quest, Hela runs into problems that threaten the Norse world and the entire Universe. She must come to terms with her true nature, accept her Shadow, and learn when not to act while maintaining awareness of the dire situation the mortals of Midgard face should she fail. Featuring our heroine, Hela, her two brothers, the most innocent goddess in existence, a god who says he's quitting, the Scrooge of the Norse pantheon, that guy with eyes like a hawk, and the loveliest twins in the Universe. Hela also meets with the warrior god among a pantheon of warriors, a prophesying trio, Jesus' spirit brother, the simple-minded yet helpful goddess, the motherly goddess, and a retired All-Father. Complete with special appearances from the most hated but loveable god ever!",
