  "description": "Who was Kindrie's father? What triggered the massacre of the Knorth women? What happened the night Jame was driven out by Ganth? Jamethiel Priest's-Bane first entered our lives when she walked out of the Haunted Lands on the opening page of God Stalk in 1982 with the haunts on her trail, searching for her ten-year older twin brother Tori to give him their father's sword and ring. But what was she doing in the Haunted Lands in the first place? What happened that caused her to leave her home? For the past 20 years, this has been one of the biggest mysteries of Jame's background. The answers to those questions-and others-are found in the pages of this collection. The original edition of Blood and Ivory first appeared in 1994, and included four short stories featuring Hodgell's signature character, Jame. This new edition, Blood and A Tapestry is far more than just a reprint. Our edition includes not only the four original stories, but four new ones as well, written specifically for this Three featuring Jame and the fourth one an original Sherlock Holmes tale. Pat has also written brand new introductions for each story, so the reader gets a fuller picture of Jame's life. These stories explore different facets of Jame's life and background and weave a lush and complex picture of this enigmatic figure. Blood and A Tapestry also features a gallery section of artwork by P. C. Hodgell, much of it never published before.",
