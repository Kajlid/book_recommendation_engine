  "description": "They thought I would do my job. They thought I would kill her. They thought wrong.    I’m a dangerous man.  It only takes one panty-dropping, mouth-watering look to know it. You may be fooled by my good looks and charm. But my eyes give it away.  I’m the hitman for the Valetti familia, and I’m f*cking good at it. They want men to talk, and I make them talk. They want men gone--bang, it’s done. It’s as simple as that. Until her. She’s on my list, but I f*cking want her. On her knees and submitting to my every command. I'll give her a simple choice — die, or be mine. I’ve always wanted this. Now that I have the chance, I’m taking it.   I can fulfill those fantasies I know she has. I’m going to make her beg for it.     This is a standalone, full-length mafia romance with a filthy-mouthed, possessive bad boy. Dark mafia themes throughout. Guaranteed HEA.  For a Limited Time Bad Girl: Valetti Crime Family (A Bad Boy Mafia Romance) is included at the end for your reading pleasure. Enjoy!",
