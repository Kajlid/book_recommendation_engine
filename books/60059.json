  "description": "PATIENT NAME: Peter Hunt WelchSEX: MADMIT DATE: 10/18/2000DOB: 02/28/1980HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: The patient was a fairly poor historian, appearing unable to provide coherent description of the events preceding his current hospitalization. In a rather vague and disorganized manner, he acknowledged the presence of persecutory concerns. He reported unusual experiences like having seen the earth and the bottom of the sea. In the emergency room, he reported concerns that he might have killed a buddy of his and that he could take a friend's soul from his body. He also reported his ability to be in contact with God. Initially he denied any alcohol or drug use. Later on, he admitted having had LSD on several occasions. He described his trips as traveling the world and touching things. He also acknowledged the use of heroin, crack cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, and speed, but he was not able to provide more details.This is the story of why somebody typed that.",
