  "title": "The King's English",
  "description": "In this classic reference book the Fowler brothers illustrate by example all the commonly-made blunders of English usage and guide the reader to improved expression and style. If Dickens had owned a copy of The King's English for example, he would not have written \"your great ability andtrustfulness;\" he would have recognized the malapropism and realized that the context demanded trustworthiness.Written with the good sense and liveliness that is characteristic of the Fowlers, this work has given generations of students, scholars, and professional writers the solutions to problems of grammar and style.In print since its publication in 1906, this book is still an essential guide to written English and an ideal companion to Fowler's Modern English Usage .",
