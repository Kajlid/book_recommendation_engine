  "description": "Patty and David Monroe have flown to Moscow to repair a business deal which has gone bad—when it suddenly turns nightmarish.  Shooting David and kidnapping Patty, their Russian business partners drive her to a ramshackle dacha twenty miles east of Moscow.  There, her captors—along with brutal Islamic terrorists—will attempt to ransom her.  Patty will face the most frightening ordeal imaginable.For the first time in history, FBI agents must work with Russian security forces.  In an atmosphere of violent mistrust and political hatred, only their burning desire to rescue Patty Monroe will hold the operation together.Burned is inspired by the horrifying ordeal of Yvonne Bornstein.  Kidnapped in Russia in the 1990s by Islamic terrorists, Yvonne and her husband were held for ransom.  During her captivity she was tortured, starved, and abused. Her captors were affiliated with early al Qaeda partisans. While this book is fiction, Burned captures the spirit of Yvonne’s resistance and ultimate triumph. Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition with this ISBN here.",
