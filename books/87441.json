  "description": "The Greek island of Leros was for 20 years and more the site of the world's most notorious and brutal asylum for the insane. The Magnum photographer Alex Majoli has chronicled its inmates and their return to a sane world and integration into society, the work of the famed Italian psychiatrist Franco Basaglia. Leros raises a number of questions. How could such a regime have existed? And how could anyone have survived it? This book was given the Judges' Special Recognition in the best books category of the International Pictures of the Year Awards 2003 and included in the PDN Photography Annual 2003 in the best books category.",
