  "title": "Yvonne: A Courtesan's Compulsion",
  "description": "Yvonne is a courtesan, submissive to one Master and prepared to perform almost any act of submission for his pleasure. Almost any act. She is intelligent, well educated, elegant and refined, and knows what she wants. She is sure she is everything a proper courtesan should be, and very, very different from the common whores of Paris.So it is something of a shock to find herself dressed much like a street prostitute and on a train to Marseille, following brief instructions she received from her Master down a crackling telephone line.Or were the instructions from her Master? Suddenly, she is no longer certain, and her doubts increase as she is used and abused on her journey, and clearly those who abuse her know everything about her, as if someone had planned every step of it. Surely her Master would never use her like that? Surely he would not allow strangers to treat her in ways that had always been reserved exclusively for his pleasure? Surely, if it were her Master who was behind all this, then at least he would be there to witness her suffering?And then it gets worse.",
