  "description": "The years from ten to fourteen are undeniably trying and turbulent years for parents and children alike. Adolescents develop by leaps and bounds during these years, and often find themselves uncomfortable with who they are and what they’re feeling. Parents, too, don’t know what to expect from the adolescent child who is at one moment hostile and glum, at the next carefree and happy. Your Ten- to Fourteen-Year-Old was written by renowned child-care experts Louise Bates Ames, Frances Ilg, and Sidney Baker to help prepare parents for the incredible changes their children will be going through. Included in this • Boy-girl relationships and sexual curiosity• Clubs, hobbies, activities, sports• Trouble at school• Family life and relationships with siblings• Physical development—the awkward adolescent• Summer jobs and independence• Money matters• Personal hygiene• Moodiness, loneliness• Smoking, drinking, drug use “Louise Bates Ames and her colleagues synthesize a lifetime of observation of children, consultation, and discussion with parents. These books will help parents to better understand their children and will guide them through the fascinating and sometimes trying experiences of modern parenthood.”—Donald J. Cohen, M.D., Director, Yale Child Study Center, Irving B. Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and Psychology, Yale School of Medicine",
