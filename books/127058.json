  "description": "Man, oh man, was he in trouble...If the girl-next-door-had an unpredictable, feisty twin sister, this woman would be her. Though she'd doused it quickly, a sizzling, ultra-feminine awareness had flared in her eyes in that brief moment they'd met his, along with a sweet blush she'd fought with adorably, stubborn defiance. Damn, she was cute. And intriguing. With that quiet, kitten gaze of hers still mulishly refusing to look his way again, she was drawing him in, hook, line, and sinker.Holy Hefeweizen...It was bad enough that the faint scent of one of her dark ales was lingering on his lips in that sexier-than-sin sort of way, but candying it atop steamy eyes and a gentlemanly sweet center to boot was just plain unfair. He was cowboy-in-the-city sexy with a laughing smile and all sorts of promised temptations radiating from him. And he always smelled like chocolate. With his scorching hot gaze, he was completely lethal to everything that kept her tame.The night Luke and Dani met, they really should have gotten each other's last names. More importantly? Each other's occupations.See how the chocolate vs. beer throwdown between chocolatier Luke Bradford and beer brewing beauty Dani Dobson gets started in this prequel novella to LOVE, CHOCOLATE, AND BEER.*****NOTE FROM AUTHOR: THIS PREQUEL IS NOW TOGETHER WITH BOOK #1: LOVE, CHOCOLATE, AND BEER AS A NON-SEPARATE FREE PREQUEL (meaning when you download Book 1, the free prequel will be at the start of it).
