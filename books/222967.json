  "description": "From the former Secretary of State and bestselling author - a sweeping, definitive look at the birth, life and struggle of global democracy. From the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union to the ongoing struggle for human rights in the Middle East, Condoleezza Rice has been on the front lines of history. She was a child when her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama became the epicenter of the Civil Rights Movement. In DEMOCRACY, Rice explains what these epochal events teach us about democracy; how no two transitions to democracy are the same and, in the absence of perfect circumstances, how to move forward under difficult ones. At a time when people around the world are wondering whether democracy is in decline, Rice shares insights from her experiences as a policymaker, scholar, and citizen, in order to put democracy's challenges into perspective.Runtime: 12 hours, 55 minutes",
