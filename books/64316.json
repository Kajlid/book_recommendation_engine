But all that changes the morning she meets Max Stoddart, her new colleague at the Daily Vanguard. With his upscale suit, Hugh Grant hair, and obscenely sexy good looks, he’s a single woman’s dream come true. Finally, her grandmother can stop surfing the Net for eligible Jewish males. But is Max the catch of the decade - or just a major babe magnet?Meanwhile, Rebecca’s old high school nemesis has resurfaced, a former blonde bombshell called Lipstick who is now engaged to Rebecca’s widowed dad. And it’s goodbye to articles on toe cleavage when a hot tip sweeps Rebecca to the centre of the Paris cosmetics world, where a miracle anti-wrinkle cream is about to be launched. That is, until she blows the whistle on a scandal that could set the beauty business - and the future of world peace - reeling. Will Rebecca win the recognition, not to mention the Pulitzer, she yearns for... and get the man of her dreams? Stay tuned.",
