Although he never seemed to have a job, and borrowed money from her, she is utterly devoted to himâ€”and can't understand why he suddenly has disappeared . . .As this novel gets under way, it is not immediately apparent how the lives of these women might be connected, or how they may figure into a series of vicious stabbing deaths that have shocked and terrified the citizens of London.
