  "title": "Foundation for the Lost",
  "description": "This urban magic fantasy starts like a hard-boiled detective novel and continues with non-stop action. Aaron Walker has devoted the last hundred years of his life to his Foundation, a charity that helps widows, orphans, and the stranger in the land. It doesn't get much stranger than the male witches who don't have parents to train them in the arts. When someone tries to kill him, he hops from one hidden enclave of cultural magic to another, hoping to survive long enough to contact the witches of New Salem for answers. In addition to the many people heâ€™s helped over the years, he is \"aided\" by the demon Merodak. What Aaron uncovers will force him to reexamine his faith and the foundations of Kabbalah magic. Fans of Dresden Files, Chronicles of Nick, and the Amber series will enjoy this supernatural adventure.",
