  "description": "From Tony Award-winning composer-lyricist-star Lin-Manuel Miranda comes a backstage pass to his groundbreaking, hit musical Hamilton.\n\nHamilton has it all-romance, drama, violence, patriotism, adventure, and more-combine that with the foundational story of our nation, and you've got a book that's bound to be an American classic. \"One of the most exhilarating experiences I've had in a theater.\" said David Brooks. \"This show will be talked about in years to come as a benchmark experience,\" said Peter Marks, theater critic for the Washington Post. Audience members leave Hamilton wanting more--more details about the many dramatic episodes in Alexander Hamilton's life and further analysis of the musical's lyrics and their meaning. This book will include behind-the-scenes photos of the show and evokes the spirit of the musical, giving readers the same enthralling mix of history, personality, and inspiration that Miranda has achieved on stage.",
