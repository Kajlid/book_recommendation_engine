  "description": "SOMETIMES LIFE IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... David left Colorado to pursue his ambitions in the sun-kissed playground of West Hollywood, only for them to become his worst nightmare. As a rising star in L.A.'s movie industry he has it all; fast career, fast cars and fast women. But when David witnesses a brutal murder and becomes the chief person of interest in the police investigation, he quickly realises the city's cult of celebrity is a fragile dream, one that can shatter in the blink of an eye.    The true killer is a disfigured maniac with a body as twisted as his mind. But Davidâ€™s entanglement with his grisly handiwork is no case of mistaken identity. Someone is trying to frame him and protect the killer. But who? And why?    As the body count rises, this desperate witness realises the only way to prove his innocence is to do the unthinkable - track the killer down himself. The manhunt not only leads David into the darkest recesses of the homicidal mind and the terrible agenda it serves, but to discover some fates are simply inescapable.",
