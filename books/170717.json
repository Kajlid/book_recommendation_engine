  "description": "Marcus LaGrange was bone weary. He had been in the beautiful city of New Orleans much longer than he had wanted. But, he was trying to track down a rogue Vampire that was a threat to those he loved, yet wanted nothing more than to go home. \tHe never expected to be knocked to his knees by the lovely Elizabeth Chase. And, if it wasn’t bad enough that she made his body ache with a need that he hadn’t felt in centuries… she was a mortal! He had absolutely no time for distractions…and this lovely human was just that! And, in the most tempting way – bringing back his past with a vengeance and making him question everything that he had ever believed.\tElizabeth Chase was in New Orleans to do a job. She hadn’t planned on running into the gorgeous Marcus LaGrange at the Inn where she was staying. Men were permanently off of her menu. She only wanted to get done what she had been sent to do, and to go back home to her solitary existence. So; why then, when the man touched her did her skin tremble and burn with a fire that seared her to her very soul? Why did he cause every damn thing that she had programmed herself to believe and feel to go straight out of the window? She had baggage - and she definitely wasn’t looking to pick up more.\tCan these two fight the attraction that pops and sizzles around them? Or, will they give in to a desire that cannot be ignored? They both have secrets…and it could spell disaster for everyone that they care about – including each other.\tJoin the journey to discover if they can find forgiveness and redemption before the evil out there destroys them all.\tWill love be enough? Marcus’ Mortal Embrace…Book 3 of The Supernatural Desire Series.",
