  "description": "How many times, when things go wrong, have you said to yourself ‘Why me’? Some people seem to have more than their fair share of bad luck, and Kate Parker is one of them. So when Kate and her ten-year-old son Jack move to Oxford to start a new life, Kate is determined that events of the past will not come back to haunt them. Despite the suffocating support she receives from her overbearing in-laws, she starts to feel threatened. Somehow her comfortable family home doesn’t feel quite safe – it’s almost as though someone is watching them. But then a chance meeting with a charming Oxford professor helps to convince her that she can overcome her fears, and that she and Jack can start to live a normal life once again. But just when she feels happier than she’s felt in years, a shocking revelation blows all of their lives apart.",
