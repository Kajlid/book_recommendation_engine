Bison Books issued a trade paperback edition in 2006.The stories for this volume were selected by the author and were considered by him to be his best fantasy and horror stories to date. The collection contains stories from Smith's major story cycles of Averoigne, Hyperborea, Poseidonis, and Zothique. Smith had wanted to call the collection \"The End of the Story and Other Stories\", but acceded to Derleth's suggestion, an allusion to Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\".",
