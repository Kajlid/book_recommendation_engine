  "description": "Reporter Daria Zane stumbles across a situation that could get her killed while investigating a story about hundreds of missing women. Pursued by the men and the aliens who've been abducting the women and releasing a new drug, ZL3, onto the streets of Earth there's only one place she can hide—Zarronia. If she can make it to Ambassador Eirikson she just might have a chance to survive.  Thorn Valanson has spent several months on Earth handling warrior business for his father. He's also managed to avoid the free-spirited Earth females as bonding with one of them is the last thing on his mind. In fact, his personal history has given him a distrust of females and a hatred of spies, especially female spies. When he captures Daria on his starship he knows there's only one reason she's there—to spy on his people and discover their most closely guarded secrets.  Daria can't risk her life by telling Thorn the truth as she can't be sure he's not part of the corruption. Thorn knows she's lying and that raises his suspicions. What happens when a warrior with a mating fever meets a female he lusts after but can't trust? It's a long journey to Zarronia.",
