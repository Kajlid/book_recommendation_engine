  "description": "A much-needed reminder about what it means to be truly human in a world where people feel increasingly disconnected from each other and from God, by the popular author of Enter Wild .“Carlos has created an antidote to what ails us.”— New York Times bestselling author Jon AcuffThese are crazy times, people. We are more agitated than ever. We’re fighting. Wrestling with big issues. Less connected than ever to one another and to God. It’s a perfect debilitating anxiety, crashing relationships, and forgetting what it feels like to, well, be human .In How to Human, author, speaker, and social-media personality Carlos Whittaker offers a fresh vision for becoming the best versions of ourselves. We can refuse to let disagreements define us. We can say no to becoming upset, rage-filled humans and say yes to fuller, happier lives. It begins as we make the shift from “me” to “we” to “everybody” in a three-part journey to be human, see fellow humans, and free those around us.You’ll think, laugh, and be inspired by this practical guide, which reveals how to help others, how to hope fiercely, and how to experience the thrill of being fully human. Carlos describes a radical path of love—one that requires us to become builders rather than demolitionists. One that gets personal. One that moves toward others in faith rather than away in fear. One that, when times get crazy, is willing to get crazier (in a good way). One that understands the big joy of how to human.",
