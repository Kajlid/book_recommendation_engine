  "description": "The battle for Tallarn rages between the traitor Iron Warriors and the Imperial Army. A carpet of armour covers the surface of the toxic planet: Dreadnoughts versus tanks versus Titans. But what secret purpose drives the Iron Warriors onwards to war?This is the biggest armoured conflict in galactic history – there’s a million tanks! However, no one can leave the safety of their claustrophobic war machines for fear of melting into a toxic puddle. While this story supplies plenty of action, what brings the entire might of the Iron Warriors to battle is much more intriguing.Tallarn: Ironclad is presented as a luxurious hardback in a glossy wrap-around jacket. The cover is beautifully embossed with Slaaneshi daemonettes. Included in the pages are unique before-and-after schematics of the doomed world of Tallarn. This edition is signed by the author John French and is individually numbered from a print run of 3,000. It’s a must-have for any Horus Heresy fan.",
