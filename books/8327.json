  "description": "Where there's a will...Danika Hilliard's eccentric old benefactor, Morris Feldman, carried his healthy sense of humor to the grave ... and beyond, apparently. He left his opulent Florida villa to the pretty, if prissy, schoolteacher and aspiring author--but only if she can finish a novel there within six months... and only if she shares the luxurious space with another would- be-writer, Silas Northrop.The problem is Silas is motor oil to Danika's rose water--a cocky, good-looking ex-marine who listening to loud music and flaunting his assets in tight-fitting denims. And with ghosts, tropical storms, psychic phenomena, and a mysterious hidden treasure thrown into the mix, it may be almost impossible for Dani to get any work done at all--especially with tantalizing, infuriating Silas nearby, the one distraction she is finding increasingly more difficult to resist.",
