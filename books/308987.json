  "description": "JackThey say I'm a troubled kid, labeled a bad-boy jock for my rebel attitude.You'd think at St. Paul University that label would put me at the top of the watch list for expulsion, or at least be a death sentence to my social life.But no.In truth, I should be a pariah, but I'm not.I'm the BMOC because I'm the starting quarterback of the prized football team. After last season's bowl game victory, I could be Voldemort and I'd still get the champagne treatment.But who cares? Because the one girl on this campus I want doesn't give a sh*t about football. She thinks bad boys are, well, bad.Worst of all, she's my nemesis from back home.It's messed up that I'm stuck on Joni, because she's the biggest threat to my goal of winning the Heisman Trophy. It kills me that she's also a hot tamale as my grandpa would say. If he were still alive.Losing grandpa started my trouble.Being with Joni could ruin me. Or it could save me.All I need to do is convince her she's not my enemy...",
