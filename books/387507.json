  "description": "She makes him feel more alive than he has since he died...Chivalry is far from undead...Matthew Halkett, Earl of Blodswell, is one of the few men in the ton who can claim to be a knight in shining armor—because that's precisely what he was before being turned into a vampyre. When he spies a damsel in distress in the midst of a storm in Hyde Park, his natural instinct is to rush to her aid...But not every woman needs to be rescued...Weather-controlling witch Rhiannon Sinclair isn't caught in a storm— she's the cause of it. She's mortified to have been caught making trouble by the imposing earl, but she doesn't need any man—never has, and is sure she never will...But when Rhiannon encounters Matthew again, her powers go awry and his supernatural abilities run amok. Between the two of them, the ton is thrown into an uproar. There's never been a more tempestuous scandal...",
