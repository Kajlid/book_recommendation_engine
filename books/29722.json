  "description": "“O, to what malevolent, festering power will I attribute the terrible wrath that has been incurred against me? To which god of the earth, sea, or sky, to which calculating, demonic power of nature - to which enduring creature's scorn should I give thanks for the dark procession of statues that now encircles me like lions stalking the gladiator of Rome, for this monstrous tribunal of angels that stands now not far away? I can see nothing good, nothing whole. Everything is broken and silent. Stone and grey is my world, and yet I can still remember a place long ago that was not this dark.”Such are the thoughts of David Berkowitz, an old and broken man living in an old and broken world who has finally decided – at the last possible moment – to try and face his past with whatever strength he has left.His is a story of love, loss, and betrayal – and of never quite moving on. It also a story of one human being's struggle against drugs and insanity. Set almost completely in his college days, we experience with David the passion and folly of youth, of freshness and discovery, and the bitter taste of condemnation.Will he finally be able to set the past aside and meet his own death with the peace he was always yearning for?",
