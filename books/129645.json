  "description": "The 14th Ward of Wire City has become a mecca of sin and excess ever since a depression virus tore its way through the denizens of the slumsphere. Only one man, Lester Proctor--having buried his family who succumbed to the disease--is determined to find the mythic ‘Cure’ and restore some semblance of order to his city. On the way, he’ll encounter androids in search of forbidden love, stalkers, pimps, teeth salesmen, evil dwarves, slumlords, knife-gangs, and the few lucky escapologists who uploaded their minds to the Hollow Earth simulation.Chris Kelso’s cult tale of nihilism and anarchy is back in print. There is no escape in the pursuit of hope.",
