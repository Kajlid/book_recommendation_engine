  "description": "A down-to-earth carpenter. A Prada loving personal shopper.  A Habitat for Humanity project that erects more than walls…... The word “nail” has so many meanings:  Ainsley’s manicured nails belong in the Museum of Modern Art. The fashionista hammers nails at Habitat for Humanity. She desperately wants to nail Owen Phillips. Unfortunately, she mistakenly thinks he’s gay. Owen needs to shed his hellish last few years. Yearning for the simpler things in life, like working with his hands, the finance mogul joins a Habitat build. Turns out he also wants to work over Ainsley Hall…but the confusing bombshell flirts blatantly with other men. When Ainsley discovers Owen’s true sexuality, their mutual attraction ignites, but he hasn’t shared details about his past. If Ainsley gets wind of the lies chasing him, it will take more than hammers and nails (and nailing studs) to keep their walls from caving in.  OFF-LIMITS CRUSH is a full-length, standalone, hot romantic comedy, previously titled STUD. One-click your copy today!",
