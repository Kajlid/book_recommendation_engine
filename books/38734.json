  "description": "Jacket description from the original hardcover edition:Hardheaded, hard-hitting, written with gusto, sardonic humor, and the utmost seriousness, Hard Rain Falling is a picaresque novel, absorbing as narrative, devastating as a study of freedom--and imprisonment--in contemporary society.Jack Levitt, a white foundling, and Billy Lancing, a Negro drifter, are seventeen and sixteen when they first briefly encounter each other in Portland, Oregon--one a formidable, tough-looking fugitive from an orphan asylum, the other already a brilliantly accomplished pool-hall hustler. Years later they meet again, in San Quentin, where Jack has landed on a charge of statutory rape, Billy for forgery. In the interim, Billy has married, begotten a son, taken a mistress, gone to college; Jack has boxed, bucked logs, worked in a cannery, robbed gas stations, rolled drunks, and spent time in reform school and county jails. What happens in San Quentin is crucial to both men, and helps to shape the ironic conclusion of the story in San Francisco.Let the gentle reader be warned that there is rough talk in this book, as well as rough action. Let the tough-minded reader rejoice in its vigorous style, acute characterization, originality, honesty, and high intelligence. Don Carpenter is an exciting discovery, and he has written a strong and memorable first novel.",
