  "description": "This paranormal reverse harem romance book has been professionally edited. If you have previously bought this book an update should be available soon. My apologies for any inconvenience. Your comments are appreciated and definitely noted. Thanks for reading Dark Hearts!. If you enjoy it please take a few minutes to rate it.  A few months ago, I’d never heard of Dark Hearts, an organization dedicated to the destruction of the entire human race. As far as the Order goes, they’re supposedly the good guys although I question some of their tactics. The name stands for nothing more than their goal, which is trying to maintain order among the planets and keep the inhabitants safe.  A few months ago, my life was the simple existence of a normal teenage girl. I’d never heard of either of those organizations. I had a mother that loved me and a roof over my head.  A few months ago, my biggest problem was not having a boyfriend. Now I have six or is that seven...even that has become complicated because you see they're all gorgeous males that would do anything for me, however they aren't human.  You say how can a normal teenage girl fall in love so quickly with a gargoyle, two wendigoes, a sun seraph, a warlock and a shape-shifter? I don't know. I only know that I do love them all and possibly an ancient vampire. My mother is missing and an ice storm is brewing. Could my life get any more complicated...  This is a paranormal reverse harem romance. It contains sexual situations and some bold language. It is not recommended for children.",
