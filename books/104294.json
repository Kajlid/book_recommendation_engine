  "title": "First Ladies",
  "description": "Here are brief biographies of \"first ladies\" of America, from Mrs. George Washington to Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower, written in a pleasantly intimate style.In reading of their childhood and education, and their different ways of helping their distinguished husbands, one is fascinated by their variety of background and character, and also by the pictures of changing ways in America.Some were brilliant hostesses, some reticent, some studious, a few ambitious, a few clever politically, but all stood beside or Presidents and shared their responsibilities.The short, graphic biographical sketches of these famous women are a fine reminder of the important role played by the wife of the President of the United States, as she helps and influences her husband's career.",
