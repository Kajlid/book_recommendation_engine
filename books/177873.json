  "description": "Steep Tea is Singapore-born Jee Leong Koh's fifth collection and the first to be published in the UK. Koh's poems share many of the harsh and enriching circumstances of a postcolonial queer writer. They speak in a voice both colloquial and musical, aware of the infusion of various traditions and histories. Taking leaves from other poet--Elizabeth Bishop, Eavan Boland and Lee Tzu Pheng, amongst others--Koh's writing is forged in the known pleasures of reading, its cultures and communities.\"Jee Leong Koh is a poet whose breadth of ambition is matched by an acute sensitivity to detail. In Steep Tea, he responds to his readings of women poets from Eastern and Western traditions with his own very personal poems, a sheaf of work in various forms, which convince one that reading is not just a hobby or even an education, but an essential component of human alertness.\" -Gregory Woods\"Here are short, deft narratives that map the mismatched patterns of male and female desire grounded in partial understandings of love. The author's native Singapore sounds out sharply, often ironically, in counterpoint to the intimate domestic interiors that help to constitute what will surely be recognised as some of contemporary poetry's classic love poems.\" -David Kinloch",
