  "description": "?A fluid, poised, quick-witted dance through the poetic and political career of one of the most elusive, glittering figures of Tudor England.OCO HILARY MANTEL ?These bloody days have broken my heart.OCO Thomas Wyatt Learned divines despised it, sober heads ignored it, but for Henry, the beau ideal of chivalry, poetry made things happen. It affected his wars, his diplomacy and his many marriages. It was at the root of his fatal attraction to Anne Boleyn, the source of her power and it was the means of her destruction. In this witty, intriguing, accessible account, Nicola Shulman interweaves the bloody events of HenryOCOs reign with the story of English love poetry and the life of its first master, HenryOCOs most glamorous and enigmatic subject: Sir Thomas Wyatt. Courtier, spy, wit, diplomat, assassin, lover of Anne Boleyn, and favourite both of Henry and his sinister minister Thomas Cromwell, the brilliant Wyatt was admired and envied in equal measure. His love poetry began as an elite and risqu(r) entertainment for the group of ambitious men and women at the slippery top of the court. But when the axe began to fall among this group, and HenryOCOs laws made his subjects fall silent in terror, WyattOCOs poetic skills became a way to survive. He saw that a love poem was a place where secrets could hide. \"",
