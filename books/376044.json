  "description": "Excerpt from Chronicles of the Schonberg-Cotta Family: By Two of Themselves She looked on me with a cold, grave pity, and murmured, Poor little one, she is like her mother 3 the heart learns to idolize early. She has much to unlearn. God's hand is against all idols. That is many years ago 3 but I remember as if it were yester day, how the fair convent garden seemed to me all at once to grow dull and cheerless at her words and her grave looks, and I felt it damp and cold like a church-yard 3 and the owers looked like made owers 3 and the walls seemed to rise like the walls of a cave, and I scarcely breathed until I was outside again, and had hold of F ritz's hand. For I am not at all religious. I am afraid I do not even wish to be. All the religious men and women I have ever seen do not seem to me half so sweet as my poor dear mother; nor as kind, clever, and cheerful as my father; nor half as noble and good as Fritz. And the Lives of the Saints puzzle me exceedingly, because it seems to me that if every one were to follow the ex ample of St. Catherine, and even our own St. Elizabeth of Hun gary, and disobey their parents, and leave their little children, it would make everything so very wrong and confused. I wonder if any one else ever felt the same, because these are thoughts I have never even told to Fritz 3 for he is religious, and I am afraid it would pain him.",
