  "description": "A unique biography of one of the most influential rock bands of the last three decades. R.E.M. formed in the early 80s and sold almost no records for the first ten years of their existence, yet the media portrayal of them has been unquestioning. They shot to fame in the 1990s with their singles Out of Time and Automatic for the People selling over 25 million copies between them. They were heralded as the saviors of US rock. David Buckley reanalyzes this accepted view of them, taking a close look at their music and public persona and providing a compelling must-read for all rock fans. Definitive, informed reanalysis of the R.E.M. myth, drawing on interviews with many of the band's closest associates and friends By the author of the critically acclaimed David Strange Fascination Includes previously unseen early photographs.",
