Now that her ruse has been discovered, Verity is forced to return to a loveless marriage.Hawkeswell strikes a bargain with Verity: In return for three kisses a day, he will not insist on his conjugal rights. But Verity discovers there are kisses ... and then there are kisses ... as she begins to learn the true meaning of seduction at the hands of a master.",
