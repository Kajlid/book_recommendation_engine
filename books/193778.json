Some of them have theories, others don't seem to care. Then the girl herself disappears and the guy goes looking for her.It might be April, but it might also be June. The missing girl might be in Ojai, or she might be in Merced. She might have brown hair, or she might not. Things disappear because there is nothing to hold them in place.Kanley Stubrick is about the things in the world that we don’t know, and Mike Kleine gives us permission to not be afraid of what we don’t know.",
