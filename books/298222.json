  "title": "Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How It Distorts the Truth",
  "description": "In Big Lies , Joe Conason rips through the ten most damaging lies perpetrated by the right wing propaganda machine. This scathing, fact-filled analysis debunks it all:- The myth that Republicans are fiscal geniuses and champions of free enterprise.- The right's self-proclaimed monopoly on \"family values.\"- The conservative smearing of liberals as unpatriotic and anti-American.- And of course, the \"compassionate conservatism\" of George W. Bush. (It depends on the meaning of “compassionate.”)Big Lies confronts right-wing slander and bias with a long-awaited, badly-needed counterpunch to the deceptions that have plagued American politics for a generation.",
