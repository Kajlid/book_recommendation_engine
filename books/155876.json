  "description": "In this sequel to The Courtship of Julian St. Albans, Julian – once a member of the pampered elite and Courted by the cream of society – is now an Apprentice and the still-pampered boyfriend of consulting mage Alex Benedict.  He arrives one bright August morning at the plant nursery where he's working through his apprenticeship, only to find a dead body among the lucky clover. This is the first in a series of strange murders that keep getting closer and closer to home, to Julian's wonderful new life and all the magic threading through it, including the new magic that's blossomed inside him.  Alex Benedict is left working against an unknown threat to solve the murders and keep his lover alive, and it seems like all of his magic won't be enough. With opposition from inside the Agency and out, and only Alex's wards for refuge, Julian has to learn to use his own powers fast enough to keep from becoming another casualty.",
