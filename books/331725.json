  "description": "Easy Rian has been lead singer for Blinding Light since the band was formed. Through the years many things have changed. Not all of them good. When the lead guitarist leaves mid-tour, the rest of the band is left waiting to see if they’ll continue on to Rocktoberfest, or if this is where their tour ends.Liam Tarrant has been playing guitar for as long as he can remember. When he gets the chance to audition for Blinding Light, he jumps at the chance. Meeting the band is surreal, especially the lead singer, Easy. Liam has always had a crush on Easy, but he never thought he’d get the chance to meet him, let alone spend time alone with him.Easy is drawn to Liam, no matter how much he wants to deny it. When the two are thrown together over practice and planning the upcoming tour, attraction grows between the two of them that neither can deny. But falling in love on tour could be what finally ends Blinding Light, and both of them will need to choose what’s more important to them. Love or music, can they have it all? #Rockstar #mmromance #grumpysunshine #friendstolovers",
