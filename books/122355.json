  "description": "A runaway wife, a surprise baby, and a dark secret.MONTE CARLO, 1982 The odds of a man like Marco de Noli falling for a girl like me were a million to one. He’s old money, classic European jet set, a master of the universe. When we met, I was a shy girl from Oklahoma, pretty enough, but nowhere near his league.One year later, after he stands me up on our first anniversary, I have to face facts. Our marriage was a mistake. My in-laws think I’m a gold digger, Marco lives at the office, and nights of passion aren’t enough. There’s nothing keeping me in Monte Carlo.But when I run, I don’t realize that I’m taking the de Noli heir with me—Or that our love wasn’t what I thought it was at all.",
