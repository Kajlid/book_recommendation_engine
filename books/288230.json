Instead, he has to seek help from the alpha he thought he’d never see again.Asher Martingale hasn’t spoken to anyone in his birth pack since he left them eight years ago with orders to never return. The last thing he expects is for one of them to show up in his backyard with a woman and child asking for asylum, but he would never turn them away.The Martingales aren’t willing to let their best cook go so easily, and worse, Ash’s ex is the pack member they send to retrieve him. With two omegas' lives on the line, can they weather the storm of Ash’s turbulent past and Graham’s dawning understanding that there’s a whole world beyond it?",
