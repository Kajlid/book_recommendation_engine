Anounced in the Redneck Romeo Release Party tour.****The Wild West Boys series has been suspended for several years, due to my deadlines for the Rough Riders series, as well as the Blacktop Cowboys series, the mystery side of my career as Lori Armstrong, and now the Mastered Series.So this series is on hold indefinitely. At some point I will finish the Chet and Remy and Doc Monroe novella, as well as Ramona's story, but don't look for either installment before 2017.",
