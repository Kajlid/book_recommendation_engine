Moreover, it represents one of the first efforts by a Negro writer to examine that relationship and certainly one of the most exhaustive by any... Blues People is American musical history; it is also American cultural, economic and even emotional history. It traces not only the development of the Negro music which affected white America but also the Negro values which affected white America.\" - Library Journal",
