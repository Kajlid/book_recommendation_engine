  "description": "CALL IT COURAGEMafatu's name means \"Stout Heart,\" but his people call him a coward. Ever since the sea took his mother's life and spared his own, he has lived with deep fear. And even though his father is the Great Chief of Hikueru -- an island whose seafaring people worship courage -- he is terrified, and so scorned.By the time he is fifteen years old, Mafatu can bear it no longer. He must conquer his fear alone...even if it means certain death.This classic tale of a young boy's hidden strength has been a favorite of readers of all ages since its 1940 publication -- and this handsome new edition preserves its original illustrations in all their beauty.",
