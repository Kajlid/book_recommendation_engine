  "description": "Disgraceful Victoria Price doesn't recognize the tall, jaw-droppingly handsome man in the sharp suit who walks up to her on the second day of her receptionist temp job in Manhattan, but he definitely knows her. When he shows her a compromising picture of herself on his phone that she has no memory of taking it unleashes a chain of events that will send her world spinning wildly out of control.  Deplorable A misdirected email containing topless European vacation pictures, a billionaire known for his exotic tastes, a woman lost and looking for an identity in a big city. Get ready to have your panties melted clean right off as smoldering alpha male hero Evan Daniels relentlessly pursues and closes in on Janet Watson, the woman of his deplorable desires.  Totally Unacceptable Louise Parker is determined to expose the dirty dealings of the Romanovic Corporation. As a human rights activist she will stop at nothing in her crusade for justice, but when she comes up against young, super-hot, ultra rich corporate barracuda and all around bad-boy Stephen Romanovic the rule book goes out the window and suddenly the idea of sleeping with the enemy takes on a whole new meaning.",
