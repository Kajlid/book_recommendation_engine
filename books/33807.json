  "description": "Never believe that life in a tiny Spanish mountain village is predictable. Vicky and Joe have finished fixing up their house and look forward to peaceful days enjoying their retirement. Then the fish van arrives, and instead of delivering fresh fish, disgorges the Ufarte family. The peace of El Hoyo is shattered.In this, the second of the ‘Two Old Fools’ series, Vicky and Joe are catapulted (and ‘cat’ is the operative word) into more bizarre situations and scrapes. Surrounded by the same cast of eccentric characters introduced in 'Chickens, Mules and Two Old Fools', the two old fools muddle through until they are forced into making a life-changing decision.Packed with badly behaved humans and animals, irreverent humour and sunshine, 'Two Old Fools - Olé!' will make you laugh out loud, while the mouth-watering Spanish recipes will have you reaching for your saucepan.“Andalucía as it’s never been done before - a very quirky, funny and enjoyable tale - loved the subtle humour, Olé!”Karen Wheeler, author of 'Tout Sweet: Hanging Up My Heels For A New Life In France.'\"I absolutely loved it! Funny, honest and impossible to put down.\" Justin Aldridge, Eye on Spain",
