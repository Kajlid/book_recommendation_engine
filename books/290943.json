  "title": "Unconditional Life: Discovering the Power to Fulfill Your Dreams",
  "description": "Deepak Chopra, M.D., has emerged as one of the most powerful leaders in the revolutionary field of mind/body medicine. His extraordinary bestseller Quantum Healing explored the mind's connection to seemingly miraculous cures for cancer and other serious illnesses. Now, in Unconditional Life , he undertakes an even greater challenge: to explain how consciousness can lead the way to total freedom and perfect health. Unconditional Life brings together disciplines ranging from modern physics and neuroscience to the ancient traditions of Indian wisdom to show how our perceptions create our reality for good or ill--and how the outside world can be shaped by altering the world within. In a book filled with hope and inspiration, Dr. Chopra offers compelling proof of the power of consciousness and a daring new vision of our own unlimited potential.",
