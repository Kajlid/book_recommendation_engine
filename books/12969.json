  "title": "Night at the Opera",
  "description": "What a night it would be! The small German city of Waltherrott is inaugurating its upgraded transit system. In honour of this great event, the b&uumlaut;rgermeister and other dignitaries are attending a performance of Carl Maria von Stumpf's masterpiece, Der Hosenkavalier . This poignant and bittersweet comedy perfectly expresses the spirit, the humour, the gaiety of the city. A Night at the Opera is a tour-de-force of the unexpected, the bizarre. It is a delightful cavalcade of fools and knaves, grouches and maniacs, heroes and clowns. And through it all drifts the captivating music of Carl Maria von Stumpf, the most brilliant, yet most shamefully neglected composer of that most preposterous of art forms -- the opera.",
