  "description": "Adrift, inexperienced, loveless, and unemployed, recent college grad Jerome Segundo remedies all these deficiencies simultaneously upon landing a job and striking up a romance with a coworker. His consort, slightly older chronologically but infinitely more sophisticated and experienced, exposes him to the delights of cuisine, culture, and coitus (occasionally in tandem). Their relationship blossoms and his world opens upâ€”until a sexual assault charge brings it crashing down.",
