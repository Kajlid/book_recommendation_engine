  "description": "\"We are the silent guardians, those born of the need to protect humankind, acting as their unseen shield against a dark world to which they are blind.\" 21-year-old Charlotte wants a way out of small-town Colorado, not a life trapped on the family ranch feigning affection for the awkward man who pesters her for a commitment she can never give. Then the enigmatic Dr. Randolf Fuerst arrives to reclaim Dervyshire Park, the old mansion looking down upon Charlotte's world from the wild foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Working to perfect the antivenin that neutralizes the bite of even the fiercest lycanthrope, the dark-haired stranger sees something in Charlotte, and knows his life might well be transformed by her simple touch. Pursuing desire and passion is never easy, though, and Charlotte will find her dreams dashed by the dark forces and savage creatures that descend upon Westcliffe and the people she loves. How can a young lady, a mere human, stand to lose what she had nearly given up hope of ever finding? Is there a place safe enough for two forbidden lovers to discover their destiny? Might the truth lurk up that country lane, past the overgrown hedges, behind the imposing doors of a mysterious mansion called Dervyshire Park?",
