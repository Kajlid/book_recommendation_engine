  "title": "Lighten Up: Seven Ways to Kick the Suffering Habit",
  "description": "If you ask yourself “When if the last time I felt joyful?” and the answer is not today, Lighten Up could open a new door in your life. Lighten Up is not a book for sissies. It takes courage to acknowledge the sadness and losses in our lives, let them go, and reclaim our joy. According to author, Deborah Duda, suffering is the least recognized, most widespread, most pernicious addiction of our time. Part memoir, expose, and guide book, Lighten Up shares practical options and exercises for changing the ideas and behaviors that prevent us from living more lightheartedly. The book focuses on re-owning the often deeply hidden energy in us all -joy. Because the greatest gift we can give ourselves, our families, our communities, and our world, is to be a profoundly contented person who feels a kinship with all of life, lightening up is the major challenge of a lifetime. Duda is also author of the award-winning, groundbreaking guide book, Coming Home, a Practical and Compassionate Guide to Caring for a Dying Loved One, first published in 1981, now it its fourth revised and updated edition.",
