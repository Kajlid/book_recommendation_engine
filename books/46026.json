  "description": "DON'T LET IT IN. The first victim has no natural wounds. No prints left behind. No evidence at all. But the life has been gruesomely drained from the corpse, and a broken cross is now imprinted inside the skin. Left for dead a year ago by his former partner, reckless and medicated Detective Jude Foster now endures mindless therapy sessions in order to be given another chance at his life. When the chief of police discovers the first victim strangely killed in this sadistic fashion, Jude enters a dark world all-too-familiar. He's seen this method of murder before, but he never caught the killer. Could this be a copycat, or is it the one that got away? Forced to take on a new partner for the case, Jude must come to terms with the fractured memories of his past, attempt to keep his younger brother safe, and chase down a ghost killer who is collecting human souls for an unfathomable endgame. But time is against him. How many more victims will there be before the killer is satisfied? And will Jude Foster be able to survive this new hell or in the chaos, will he risk becoming something else entirely?",
