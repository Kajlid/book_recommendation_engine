  "description": "Amidst the unspeakable horrors of Hitler's Concentration Camps, a young German-Jewish girl finds beauty and love for a man that will span a lifetime. This is the true account of Inge Katz; the striking daughter of a successful businessman who meets and falls in love with a handsome fellow inmate. But when she gets shipped \"out east\" to a death camp, she goes years not knowing if he is alive or dead. Her love for this man endures against all odds - from Nazi rifles, to starvation, to disease, to assaults of allied fire. But as time passes without word or confirmation of his survival, should she remain loyal, or, as everyone suggests, move on with another? In Roses in a Forbidden Garden, Elise Garibaldi reveals her grandmother's most intimate feelings during those terrible times.",
