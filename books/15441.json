  "description": "Some secrets should be kept close; some are best carved in stone... In the year 1288, Amiens Cathedral is still a hive of construction. Philippe works as a painter, cheerfully decorating the stone carvings. Lamed in the crusades, alone in the world, he feels he has found the perfect life, with a safe place to sleep and work he loves. He tells himself he is content, that is, until the night he spies a handsome man in a scarlet cloak, kneeling in the sanctuary and clearly distraught. For Philippe, the world will be forever changed. Lord Ã‰tienne Michelant has fallen far and fast. Once the beloved youngest son of a powerful family, he now has nothing and, unbeknownst to church officials, he lives atop the cathedralâ€™s unfinished tower. In Philippe, Ã‰tienne finds everything he ever wanted in a man, and he curses fate that they met now. Tangled in dangerous secrets and arcane enchantments, Ã‰tienne knows any hope of love is futile. Philippeâ€™s interest in Ã‰tienne quickly evolves into something personal. But Ã‰tienne talks to statues of gargoyles and refuses to leave his tower refuge. Is Philippeâ€™s new love interest merely mad, or does he hide dangerous secrets? It will be up to Phillipe to try to prove Ã‰tienne wrong and to navigate his way through the maze of enigmas surrounding him...  Gay / Historical / Fantasy / Witchcraft / Magic",
