  "description": "I can’t get her out of my head. I tried to forget about her. I tried to move on. But the longer we’re apart the more I realize forgetting Evelyn is just not an option for me. What we shared—the passion, the connection—it still burns inside my soul, and no amount of time or distance can extinguish that. I want her back. I want her by my side, and I don’t give a shit about the risks or consequences. I’m going to find her, and I’m going to make her realize that there’s just one place in this entire goddamn world she needs to be…and that’s with me.",
