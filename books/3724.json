  "description": "Orphaned at a young age and sent to live with selfish relatives, Margaret Gray has no dowry and no chance of ever marrying. When her aunt invites Jordan Prescott for a visit, hoping to entice him into offering for Margaret's spoiled cousin, the dashing war hero instead tempts Margaret into a truly decadent decision. If Margaret cannot have a husband, perhaps she dares, just once, to taste the pleasures of the flesh? Now that she's awakened to her own desires and sensations, she is drawn body and soul into a rapturous clandestine liaison.Since his dissolute father squandered the family fortune, Jordan is required to marry an heiress in order to provide for his half-siblings. Yet no woman has ever aroused him as much as Margaret. Her sedate exterior belies a bold, curious spirit and tantalizing sexuality. A single illicit tryst becomes a month-long journey in carnal abandon, but with Jordan's visit drawing to a close, can their passion survive the dangerous scheming that threatens to keep them apart?",
