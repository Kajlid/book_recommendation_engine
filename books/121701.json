  "title": "The Third Millennium: A History of the World AD 2000-3000",
  "description": "Two scientists forecast, on the basis of present scientific knowledge as well as an understanding of historical, social, and political trends, the \"history\" of the next millenium, written as if looking back from the year 3000 These English scientists and science fiction writers use a past-tense narrative to confront the reader with computerized infantrymen, Jack Spratt grass chops, artificial pets, moon settlements, the volcanic destruction of Japan, and many more future \"happenings.\" The periods of crisis, recovery, transformation, and creation of a new world perplex stimulate and provoke the reader into accepting a new concept of science fiction. The holographic nautilus shell on the cover and the creative photography accompanying the text create a different meaning of deja vu as the writers extend their trained imaginations back into the future.
