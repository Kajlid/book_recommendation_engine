  "description": "'My words will become a fire in your mouth that you cannot contain. They will burn until you have warned my Bride. Warn her before it is too late!' So begins a dramatic journey into holiness, as newlyweds Brandon and Sarah Martus accept the call to become Revelation's two prophets. This is not another end-times thriller, but one of the most intense and thought-provoking pieces of Christian fiction to come along in years. As the couple prepare for the final showdown against Satan himself, they must live and proclaim the truths Christ has given his end-times church. From America, to archaeological ruins dating back to Bible times, to the Himalayas, and finally to Jerusalem, Brandon and Sarah battle the forces of man and hell while learning the true cost of following Christ . . . and experiencing a Love far deeper than either could have imagined. Author Bill Myers says, 'Writing this book has changed my life.' Reading it could very well change yours.",
