  "description": "Jesus has forgiven me. Three times I hurt him, and he took the hurt, and he went down to death with it. When he rose from the dead, the hurt was gone. And when I was so sorry for what I did, he came and loved me three times back again -- and now I have so much of his love that I can love you just like Jesus! Forgiveness! We are both forgiven! With simple, poignant prose, renowned storyteller Walter Wangerin Jr. shows us the wonder of God's forgiveness through Peter's earthly relationship with Jesus. Beautifully illustrated by Timothy Ladwig's luminous paintings, this companion volume to the best-selling Mary's First Christmas is ideal for parents and grandparents to read aloud to the children they love. Peter's First Easter brings the true meaning of the Crucifixion and Resurrection vibrantly alive -- and builds a family tradition with everlasting significance.",
