  "description": "‘ The Doctrine of Repentance is probably one of the most needed books, not only for us as ministers, but for our people, because repentance is so trivialized today. [This book] stresses the need for ongoing repentance, a daily repentance, a lifestyle of repentance. Like Luther said, “God will have his people repenting all life long.” Watson shows you how to do that.’ — JOEL BEEKE A good case could be made out for believing that ‘repentance’ is one of the least used words in the Christian church today. Few better guides have existed in this or any other area of spiritual experience than Thomas Watson. He was a master of both Scripture and the human heart, and wrote with a simplicity and directness that keeps his work fresh and powerful for the twenty-first century.",
