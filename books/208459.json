  "description": "Mallory Reynolds is the unknown persona behind Sterling University’s most popular blog, The EveryGirl’s Guide to (Almost) Every Cock on Campus. She provides her classmates with in depth reviews of the men available to them, complete with all of the dirty details. It’s a good thing no one knows who she is though, because not every cock on campus knows what it’s doing.Everything’s going just fine until an unreliable source feeds her some bad intel, and the subject of one of her blog entries tracks her down. Cash Manning knows that he and Mallory have never hooked up, but the more they argue, and talk, and flirt, the more into the idea he becomes. It’s too bad for him that he and Mallory already know each other—a fact he doesn’t seem to recall.The more he pushes, the more she pulls away. It’s a pride thing, alright?",
