In the city where ravens roam the streets, trusting wrong people can cost you your status. Or your head.City of Beasts is first and foremost a story about a city through the eyes of a rotten, power-hungry man. But it is also an exploration of a mutually toxic relationship, a story in which the Beast and the Beauty entangle each other in lies and games until there is no way back.",
