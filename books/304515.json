Falling for a guy who stands for everything you and three generations before you have fought against? Unthinkable.

Hate. War. It’s all I know. Until Tiana Williams enters my life and my heart. Now, I’m done riding the fence between good and evil. I will fight my demons and I will get the girl. Even if it kills me.   Conversion is a standalone BWWM romance that tackles mature themes. It's sexy. It's gritty. It's emotional.",
