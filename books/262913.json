  "description": "Falling for your surly boss is a rotten idea. Letting him saw you in half is even worse…\"If life gives Beatrice Baker lemons, she makes lemon meringue pie. Or, as per last night’s fiasco, she gets drunk and keys the wrong man’s car. Now she works for Huxley Marlow of the Marvelous Marlow Boys, getting lit on fire as an on-stage magician assistant. A cool job for some, but Bea’s been coerced into the role to pay her debt, and she suffers from a tiny (colossal) case of stage fright.When the tall, enigmatic Huxley kisses those fears away, she hopes her luck is about to change, but there’s the pesky problem of a loan shark threatening to cleave her fingers, and Huxley has more in common with her gambling-addict father than she’d like.She shouldn’t fall in love with her card-playing crush, or send him embarrassing auto-corrected texts, but life isn’t always Bea’s friend. Finding herself staring at the barrel of a gun while her worlds collide? Not what she expected when she moved to New Orleans.Praise for NEW ORLEANS RUSH“The romance in New Orleans Rush will leave you smiling and filled with optimism.” ~ USA Today bestselling author Helen Hoang“New Orleans Rush is full of humor, explosive chemistry, the fun backdrop of New Orleans, and a couple I truly rooted for.
