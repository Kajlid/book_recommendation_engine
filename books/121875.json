Yet, he still sits in the shadow of his older high school teammate, Ed, who is the star pitcher of a neighboring town team. The two young men face off on the baseball field for the city title. Their battle reconvenes in the river bottoms only a month later when their paths cross again on November 11th, 1940, during the historic Armistice Day blizzard. Can they work together to survive?",
