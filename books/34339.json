The evil necromantic council is aligned against the Ardellens, and they must go through the darkness before reaching the epic conclusion in the fourth and final novel of the Cathexis Series. This third book sees the young sorcerer unlocking his full aura power, and leaving his school on a rescue mission that can change the course of a world war. He only has his aura skills and the support of his small group of friends against enemies of vast power and resources. An evil has been working in secret for hundreds of years, and this band of heroes must walk through the fire and dark halls of history to save the lives of two women, one kidnapped by necromancers, one frozen by evil priests. In Sorcererâ€™s Ring many of the secrets previously only foreshadowed are fully revealed. The Gordian knot is tightening, but all will be resolved in the grand climax.

Wars, magic battles, ancient evil, alternate planes of existence, horrid creatures and dark plots all tangled in a battle for control of the world. This is high fantasy with the darkest of evil against the purest of good. Love, sacrifice, friendship, revenge, betrayal, and triumph all wrapped up in one massive tale. Come join the Ardellens and experience the world of Cathexis as the story continues to unfold in book three, Sorcerer's Ring.",
