  "description": "The Opera House, Ankh-Morpork...... a huge, rambling building, where masked figures and hooded shadows do wicked deeds in the wings...... where dying the death on stage is a little bit more than just a metaphor...... where innocent young sopranos are lured to their destiny by an evil mastermind in a hideously deformed evening dress..Where...... there's a couple of old ladies in pointy hats eating peanuts in the gods and looking up at the big chandelier and saying things like: \"There's an accident waiting to happen if I ever saw one.\"Yes... Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, the Discworld's greatest witches, are back for an innocent night out at the opera.So there's going to be trouble (but nevertheless a good evening's entertainment with murders you can really hum...)",
