  "description": "When the battered woman wakes on the frosted grass, the only thing she remembers is the blood-thirsty cult offering her as a sacrifice in a ceremony gone serendipitously wrong.She has no name, no past, and seemingly no future as her swollen eyes slide shut for what she hopes is the last time. Glenn Elambil, a handsome elf, rescues her, bringing her from the brink of death into a life she never could have imagined. She finds herself on a different planet, a world where magic is as natural as drawing breath. It’s not all wizards and wonder, though. The War Lord, the god of the cult that tried to kill her, is coming. Those on the side of evil hunt her with dark magic and darker intent. The good powers of the world need her to do some favors for them, and to top it off she’s got a growing, complicated infatuation with Glenn. The key to her future lies in her past, which might be easier to find if her mind hadn't been shattered and reprogrammed by the cult. She must face it all and dive head first into her own psyche to find what is lost if she has any chance of survival.Shattered, book one in The Legends of Rune trilogy, is a contemporary fantasy unlike any other.",
