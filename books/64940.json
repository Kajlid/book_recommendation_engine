  "description": "Who knew that BDSM would become the biggest trend in book publishing? Rachel Kramer Bussel did and has emerged as one of the top writers, editors and experts on the subject. Serving Him pays homage to those irresistible men who control their partners with a glance, a pair of handcuffs, or a firm smack on the bottom. As true tops, the bossy hunks in these stories understand that erotic BDSM is about exulting in power that is freely yielded. Rachel and her coterie of contributors cover the full range of the male domâ€™s brand of sensual sadism, from spanking and bondage to public sex and power exchange.",
