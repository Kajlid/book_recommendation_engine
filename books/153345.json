Ronald Zhao, a retired Hong Kong police commissioner, drops into her life just when she needs someone, and her husband is gone on one of his covert meetings.Internet treachery slithers between the Chinese authorities she calls The Dage and the American woman, through the spaces in communications between her and her husband. Corruption crosses international borders and threatens sovereign nations. It feeds on trafficking and abduction, murder and loyalty.Running away from her problems at home in California seems foolish, especially since it attracts the attention of North Korean agents trying to capture her husband, but not as foolish as hoping for love to appear. But she and Ron want to feel something again, and the spirit of tan [desire] whispers to them in the dark, promising something sweet.“Why can’t you break it off?”“Because I’m the only one who gives a damn about him. If I let go, he’s going to fall into the abyss of Homeland Security.”“Have you ever considered that’s what he wants?”ShaLi is a pseudonym to protect the identities of people who inspired characters in this fast paced and gorgeously patterned international spy thriller. Names have been changed.ShaLi says, “Don't be tricked by the verisimilitude into forgetting this is fiction!”",
