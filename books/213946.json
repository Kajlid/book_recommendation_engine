But nothing prepares him for what he’ll uncover while pursuing 14-year-old Christopher Pesner, a suspect in the brutal rage-killing of his own mother. While news reports focus on Chris’s odd obsession with the violent, blasphemous heavy metal band, Rehoboam, Hursel suspects a deeper motive — a hunch that is confirmed when Chris’s second victim is discovered. Racing to piece together the identity of Chris’s next target, Hursel unearths the shocking link between an embattled politician, a controversial evangelist and a shadowy underworld where human traffickers ply the wealthy and powerful with unseemly indulgences.[This is an alternate cover edition of 978-0-9911066-2-2]",
