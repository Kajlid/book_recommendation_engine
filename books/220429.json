  "title": "Spin: A Fairy Tale Retelling",
  "description": "The international bestselling book that brings a dark and steamy look at the tale of Rumpelstiltskin. A necklace, a ring, a child...There is always a price one is willing to pay. Laila sees her impending death in the mountains of straw waiting to be spun into gold. Faced with the impossible, she makes the impossible decision to survive, no matter what the cost. A shadowy stranger sees an opportunity for vengeance. Born to a nightmarish destiny that crushed and embittered his faith in humanity, he devotes himself to dealing in dark desires and desperate souls, and Laila's is ripe for the trade. When the stranger asks his price, Laila is bound by blood and magic to pay. His own heart was never supposed to be part of the deal, but when honor drives Laila to break their bargain, he ends up tangled in his own web of deceit and destruction in a desperate attempt to save her life. In the black of night, there are no fairytales, only choices. One choice makes a queen. One choice consumes a soul. It's a roll of the dice in a game where love is everyone's undoing. Spin, Genevieve Raas' debut fantasy novel, is a twisted, sexy retelling of one of Grimm's classic tales and the first book in the Spindlewind Trilogy.",
