  "description": "How do you bring a million dollars in gold down a mountain? First you have to find it, and that's mighty hard when you're tracking a trail that is twenty years old. But the Sackett brothers were determined to find the treasure and to discover if their father, who blazed the trail long ago, was still alive. They just hoped they were smarter than those New Orleans folks who also wanted the goldâ€”and were willing to kill for it.",
