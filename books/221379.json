  "description": "Alessia and Danteâ€™s love has blossomed. Their Sequence of Hearts is sturdier than ever, but the shield that protects Tuscania is weakening and an invasion is imminent. Everyone knows Alessia's new-found power is the key--especially Alessia. Unfortunately, the energy inside her is unstable and expediting her training could have devastating consequences. But that's exactly what must be done.Whisked away to a secluded training facility, Alessia is forced to put aside all distractions, including Dante, to fully focus on the Sequence of Peace.But power always comes at a price. When Dante falls deathly ill, Alessia abandons her training to go to him, but she never makes it. Instead, she's kidnapped and dragged outside the shield where she's more helpless than she was back on Earth. As the captive of a vengeful madman, Alessia has only her wits and her will to save herself and the world she's come to cherish.",
