Humanity was defeated by the hostile Niss millennia ago and humanity had scattered across the galaxy. Roan had been raised by aliens, but he knew that he was human and nothing was going to stop him from finding his lost homeworld, not even the space fleets of the Niss.Sibyl Sue Blue by Rosel George Brown is the story of cigar-smoking Sergeant Sibyl Sue Blue, one of the toughest cops that the criminals on a future Earth hope never to meet. But she's not after burglars, muggers or drug pushers now. Her husband has disappeared on a mission to the planet Radix and she's going to get him back, one way, or another, and any unfriendly aliens had better get out of her way, if they know what's good for them. . Plus, for the first time in one volume, all of Keith Laumer's other stories of the alien Niss, as well as a generous assortment of stories by Rosel George Brown, who was a master of pointedly humorous adventure. Science fiction adventure, ranging from the grim to the wildly comical in a generous volume by two masters of the form.",
