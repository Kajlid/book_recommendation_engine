  "title": "The Mirrored Ocean: A Short Story",
  "description": "The Mirrored Ocean tells the tale of a philosophical sperm whale, who believes that the night sky is an inversion of his own deep-sea world, and that the stars are luminous creatures such as those found in the depths of the ocean.  The story is an exploration of the subconscious and conscious mind, with the ocean and sky representing these distinct, but connected, realms.",
