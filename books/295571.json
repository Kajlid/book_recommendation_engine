  "description": "They were three ripped, gorgeous studs. Drawn together by a common goal, and a willingness to share absolutely everything... including me.  I never expected to end up in Scotland, renovating a castle of all things! But fate landed me here, just as it brought me two sizzling construction workers and a breathtaking, tattooed stonemason. Three fellow Americans hellbent on helping me keep the property from going back up for auction.  But something sinister has been showing up at night, out near the woods. And when outside forces start aligning against me, my three amazing saviors propose a very unorthodox, unconventional arrangement... involving the three of them, and me.  First Julian, broad-shouldered and gargantuan, deliciously tattooed and alpha beyond my wildest dreams. Noah, the Brooklyn-raised transplant, shredded and beautiful yet harboring a mysterious past. Finally, Chase - Green-eyed and gorgeous, with model good looks. The jawline of a Greek god, and a smile that would set off an explosion of butterflies in any girl's stomach.  Together we're an unstoppable team; an insatiable maelstrom of dripping hot chemistry, with me lost in a sea of rock-hard abs and rippling muscle.  But Castle Westgate also hides its own forbidden secret. One so incredible, that if finally revealed, could intertwine all four of our lives forever...  UNCONVENTIONAL is a sizzling, stand-alone reverse harem love story filled with humor, suspense, and molten hot action, in single and multiple partner scenes, hot enough to melt your kindle. HEA guaranteed!",
