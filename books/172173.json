  "title": "Relax, It's Just God: How and Why to Talk to Your Kids About Religion When You're Not Religious",
  "description": "For nonreligious parents looking to raise critically thinking, religiously literate, and highly tolerant children capable of making up their own minds about what to believe, \"Relax, It’s Just God: How and Why To Talk to Your Kids About Religion When You’re Not Religious\" is the secular equivalent of a godsend.With a thoughtful voice infused with humor, author Wendy Thomas Russell seamlessly merges scientific thought, scholarly research, and everyday experience in a book that gives nonreligious parents a toolkit to assist with their unique and complex issues. Among other things, \"Relax, It's Just God\" teaches parents how to avoid indoctrination; communicate openly but kindly with religious relatives; confront and manage “religious baggage” so as to not hand it on to the next generation; talk about death without the familiar comforts of religious imagery; give kids a broad overview of various world religions; and show children how to practice true religious tolerance while also vaccinating them against the intolerance of others.A rapidly growing demographic cohort in America, first-generation nonreligious parents are at the forefront of a major and unprecedented cultural shift. Unable or unwilling to fall back on what they were taught as children, secular parents often find themselves at a loss for how to approach religion with their young children—so they don’t. But, as \"Relax, It’s Just God\" shows us, silence is not the answer.",
