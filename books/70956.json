  "description": "HATTIE begins with the end—the end of a woman’s life. In a spare and powerful narrative, this soulful novel takes us on an intimate journey through the meaning of Hattie’s life and life in general, delving fearlessly into the complexity of our human relationships, our yearning for the divine, and the ways in which these paths cross throughout our lives. For Hattie, love and loss are so intertwined it is hard to separate the two. By sharing her stories, Hattie reconnects with parts of her lost life and loves and finds the courage to tell the whole truths of her life—in death she discovers her voice. HATTIE is a mystical, spiritual, and very human experience.HATTIE is an excellent choice for book clubs and includes a CONVERSATION GUIDE with questions for discussion.",
