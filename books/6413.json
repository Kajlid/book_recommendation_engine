  "title": "The Female Quixote",
  "description": "A young woman is caught up in her ideas about romance and valor in this celebrated eighteenth-century parody of Don QuixoteWritten in 1752 and admired by Henry Fielding, Samuel Richardson, and Dr. Johnson, The Female Quixote relates the comic misadventures of Arabella, a hapless aristocrat whose life becomes hopelessly confused with the romantic fiction she so adores. Charlotte Lennox parodies the style of Cervantes throughout, creating a high-spirited send-up of upper- class mores and literary convention. Timeless in its irreverent observations, this is a treasure of eighteenth-century English literature.",
