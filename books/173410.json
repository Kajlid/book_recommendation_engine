  "title": "Descent",
  "description": "The path of truth lies hidden deep,  To find the light the climb is steep.  But in despair resolve is sound,  What once was lost will now be found.    All is lost and the prophecy seems null and void. Samantha is dead to the living world, and Marcus and Nicolas completely destroyed, but things aren’t always as they seem. To save the one they love, the boys will have to traverse the Descent, a darkness that all will enter and few will ever leave. The interference of gods and goddesses on the chessboard of blood has left the door open for a new player to enter the scene, and she holds the most powerful gift of all—sacrificial love.  Will the exit clause be invoked, dissolving of the chain that binds the trio together?  Will the Descent be the final setting for their love story or will they rise again?  As the curtain draws closed on this tale of old, who will rise and who will fall?  And what if their choice is no choice at all?",
