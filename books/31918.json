  "description": "Once a generation the carnival rolls into Cobalt City. With faded canvas and chips in the garish paint of the attractions, it could be like any other struggling traveling circus.But it isn’t. The Carnival de Pomme D’or has been around for centuries. And when it comes through Cobalt City bad things happen: vanishings, murders, inexplicable robberies, a rash of murder/suicides, and a mounting sense of urgency and danger.The heroes of the city have been unable to destroy the carnival before, but those who have witnessed its coming in previous generations can not deny its power. Before the big top rolls out of town, heroes will fall, villains will rise, and Cobalt City will be changed, perhaps forever!",
