  "description": "Andrew Anders, a paranoid man (and developer of overtly phallic mobile games) was having a bad month. First, the strangeness began next door and then the two investigators showed up. And if the boxes arriving in the dead of night for his mystery neighbor weren't concerning enough, the sounds that accompanied them - screeches, pounding and sometimesâ€¦human screams - were much worse.What Anders originally thought to be just a short-term inconvenience to his sleep schedule begins to unravel into something terrifying. In this quick read and fast-paced story that takes place in our own supposed non-dystopian world filled with paranoia, lack of privacy and overreach, what Anders becomes involved with could destroy everything.",
