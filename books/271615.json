  "description": "Emily Hall has not seen Michael Hamilton since the day she told him she'd decided to marry another man. Ryan Hall's membership in the Church was enough to make Emily's decision clear, and she married Ryan in the temple. A decade and three children later, she finds herself enduring marriage to an inactive and insensitive husband. She relies on the Spirit to help her cope, but life is not easy. Then Michael--a handsome, wealthy, nonmember Australian, reappears in her life and creates a maelstrom of emotion that she can't ignore. Michael has never married or joined the Church, and he is still in love with Emily. He begs her to leave Ryan and join him in Australia, and her deep feelings for him add fuel to her torment. Will her temple marriage prevail, or will the promise of happiness with Michael sweep her into his arms? With several unexpected twists and turns, this is a story that will hold your rapt attention to its last word. First Love and Forever is romantic fiction at its best, written especially for Latter-day Saints who enjoy a great love story that is believable, thought-provoking, and uplifting.",
