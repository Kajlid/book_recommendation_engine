  "description": "Virginia's entire life needed a renovation, but it took inheriting her aunt's island cottage to realize it.Crafting gourmet donuts, hanging out with her sister, and maintaining her slightly off-kilter relationship have become the epicenter of Virginia's life. But when she looks in the mirror, she knows better than anyone that her self-esteem is shot. So when she inherits her beloved Aunt's house in the quaint neighboring island town of Sweetwater, she's elated. That is, until her longtime boyfriend Jason convinces her to sell it so that they can pocket the money. The catch is, there are substantial fixes that need to be made before that can happen. On a recommendation, she hires Tristan, a cute, funny, church-going contractor with a good heart and a dark secret. As Virginia puts more and more time into fixing up the old house, she rekindles her love of art and interior design, reflects on all the wonderful times she had in the house growing up, and spends time getting to re-know herself ... and her new friend Tristan.Will Virginia be able to fix the cottage, along with her relationship with Jason? Or will one of the two end up being beyond a fixer-upper worth investing in? And if Virginia and Tristan combine their strengths, can they renovate the old home into something beautiful and new?If you like a good fixer-upper, fresh donuts, and fun storytelling, jump on the ferry and make your way over to Sweetwater Island!",
