Layla The moment I saw Camden on stage, something inside me came to life.His tragic song of unrequited love was a confession that had me questioning everything.Five years might’ve changed who we are—he’s a rock star and I’m a single mom—but my feelings for him are as strong as ever.His lyrics make falling in love seem easy.
