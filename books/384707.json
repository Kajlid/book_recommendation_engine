  "description": "Described as a filthy Gothic fantasy, Aishling Morgan again demonstrates that erotica can be something better than tab A fits into slot B. Morgan writes the fantastic - but the bulk of erotica is about the fantastic, about sex and lots of it in the strangest and most unexpected situations. Morgan creates a fantasy world of slaves and gladiators and sexual domination. Pure escapism - switch off for a few hours and enjoy your sex tongue in cheek",
