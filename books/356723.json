  "description": "Cemeteries come alive for amateur sleuth/reluctant medium Pepper Martin.  Cleveland's Garden View Cemetery is hosting a James A. Garfield commemoration. For tour guide and reluctant medium Pepper Martin this means that's she'll surely be hearing from the dead president himself. And when she's assigned to help plan the event with know-it-all volunteer and Garfield fanatic Marjorie Klinker, she'll wish Marjorie were dead... too bad someone beats Pepper to it.",
