  "description": "There are just some men you canâ€™t send from the house at midnight with a live rat in a trap and expect them not to somehow get the police involved. Granted, it sounds like an exaggeration, but Silas was more panicked about leaving the house than even the rat. Neither wanted to go. One had a family, the other had social anxiety.  Before sunrise, one was going to be freed in a field, the other from custody.  One would see worlds he could never dream, the other would have all his worst fears confirmed.  Night of the Rat tells the dark and comedic lengths one couple will go to rid their neighborhood of unwanted guests.",
