  "description": "Another thrilling installment in the classic D&D-inspired Legend of Drizzt While assassin Artemis Entreri wrestles with his past, dark elf Jarlaxle continues to fight for his place in the surface world.Ilnezhara and Tazmikella are ancient dragons of great power, accustomed to easily manipulating the humans around them. But not all humans are so easily led. When they pushed Entreri and Jarlaxle into the heart of the Bloodstone Lands, not even they could have imagined the strength of the human assassin’s resolve, or the limitless expanse of the drow mercenary’s ambition.Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri have begun to make a home for themselves in the rugged Bloodstone Lands, though not everyone is ready to trust a man who's spent his life killing for coin—much less a member of a race of subterranean elves known for their fanatical devotion to a demon goddess. If they want to make it out of the Bloodstone Lands alive, they'll have to learn to trust their enemies, and be suspicious of their friends.Road of the Patriarch is the third book in the Sellswords trilogy and the sixteenth book in the Legend of Drizzt series.",
