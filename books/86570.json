  "description": "In 1966, Mary Margaret Butler (MM) knows she's in trouble when Aunt Lutie leaves her the Blue Moon Cafe in Harts Corner, Texas. Even in death, Aunt Lutie refuses to let MM have her own way and pushes her toward a romance with Miguel Kinkaid, the new deputy sheriff. As MM delves into the newly burgeoning world of drugs, she discovers two half-buried bodies in the river bank. As she questions people she's known all her life, she realizes Harts Corner has more secrets than Texas has cows. MM must put aside everything she thought she knew about her home town and find the killer in their midst, before her own death becomes another one of those small town secrets. Aunt Lutie's Blue Moon Cafe, embellished with humor, murder, and townsfolk readers will find hard to forget.",
