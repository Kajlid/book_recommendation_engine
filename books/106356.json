  "description": "The best chef wins…but their hearts could lose the prize. \n\nClose to the Heat, Book 2\nChef Lee Solomon is so going down. How dare he call a tow truck on Chef Ginger Danielle’s customers just because they might have been parked in front of his restaurant while dining at hers? So what if he’s gorgeous, successful, and a master of gourmet cuisine, it doesn’t mean he can do as he pleases. When he suggests they settle their differences with an underground cooking competition, Ginger is all in. Her feel-good comfort food against his fancy fare? Game on! Lee has tried to ignore how badly he wants to see Ginger in his bed, but he’s finished fighting it. Their antagonism—and their mutual lust—is at an all-time high; when it comes to this particular battle, he has no intention of losing. He’s set on seducing the petite chef, no matter what the cost to his profession. But when it comes right down to it, his pride whispers that there can only be one winner. Does he give up the competition… or give up the girl?  Features a dirty talking chef, thousand-calorie recipes, and a very private menu of delicious seductions.",
