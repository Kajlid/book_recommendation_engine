  "description": "No commitments. No expectations. No way this could possibly go wrong…right? Former special-ops soldier Sam Brand is used to getting what he wants. What he wants is to unbutton the buttoned-down, sweet, and shy Dahlia McGregor. He’s hot to find her wild side. She’s eager to let him explore it. So he makes his proposition―no strings, no hurt feelings, and no promises―save for she’ll have the time of her life. After a broken engagement, Lia’s looking to someday find the right man and settle down. That’s some day . Now it’s all about the night. A hot, meaningless fling with a magnificently weathered blue-eyed stud like Sam couldn’t he’s sexy, and sure he’s arrogant, but best of all, he’s here . In other words, he’s perfect…for now. But when Sam is wounded in the line of duty and left in Lia’s tender loving care, all bets are off. Because the more time they spend together, the more it becomes this “one night” deal is getting steamier and lasting longer than they counted on. It started as a fun little game. Is it possible they could be playing for keeps?",
