  "description": "The line between life and death is sometimes blurred... Barrack and Brogan have memories of their death--and it isn't a pleasant one. When the Goddess Aikaterina gives them a second chance at life--and at finding their true mate--they are willing to do whatever it takes to change their destiny. What they don't expect is that it would be so difficult! It turns out that their true mate is a human, a species they have limited knowledge about, from a planet they have never visited. With time running out, it doesn't take them long to realize that this may be one battle that will take all of their skills to win.  Delilah Rosewater is haunted by dreams of her death. She doesn't understand why the dreams feel so real, or why she knows with growing certainty that time is running out for her. Her feelings of frustration strengthen as she searches for the one person she feels could understand her increasing panic - Sara Wilson. She is shocked when instead of finding Sara, she comes face-to-face with two irritating men who claim to be from another world!  Caught in an unexpected snowstorm in the Appalachian Mountains, Delilah doesn't know what to think of the two men and their wild claims of a powerful Goddess, alien worlds, and new destinies. Will Delilah open her heart to the twin dragons and accept the second chance that the Goddess has given them before time runs out for all of them?",
