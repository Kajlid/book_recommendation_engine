  "description": "The dragon on her hoard. The horror in its void. The word-spanning AI. The demon reaping souls. Too often fiction portrays the non-human as Other; as a threat to be destroyed, to be conquered... or to be \"saved\", assimilated back into the teeming throngs of humanity.Not this time. This time, it's the non-humans' turn. What is life like, to be imperfect. To observe humanity from without? What does it mean to be seen as horrific, to be rejected... and to overcome that? Or embrace it? To embrace it or reject it? And what does our love of these stories tell us can we, as human readers, learn from that about ourselves?Unnatural Order is an anthology for strange days and grotesque beauty, as the monstrous seeps out from the dark, and makes the light its own.",
