  "title": "Julie: Part of the Plan",
  "description": "Julie Henderson was a rising star in the New York legal profession and, like so many in that pressure cooker, she had no personal life, no close friends, no one she had time to be intimate with. Intelligent, beautiful, and ambitious, she had no idea she had been conditioned, trained, and steered into her life by hidden forces who had plans for her, quite different plans than she could have imagined. Her climb to the top of her profession had been guided by her mother, her teachers, and her superiors, all following the guidance of those unseen forces who needed her molded to fit their plan. Her life has never been hers to control, but the otherâ€™s control was always subtle, covert. The next step in their plans is jarringly different. All personal freedom is stripped from Julie and her suppressed emotions freed.",
