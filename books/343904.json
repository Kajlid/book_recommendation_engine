  "title": "Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning",
  "description": "Starting in the early 1940s, Anne—now a successful, middle-aged writer—has returned to Prince Edward Island for an extended visit. On a whim, she’s agreed to write a play for part of the White Sands Hotel’s summer stock season, but Anne is forced to admit that the play is nothing more than a way to take her mind off the troublesome recent events in her life. When a long-hidden secret is discovered under the floorboards at Green Gables, it provides a distraction of its own. As Anne struggles to complete the play, she delves into long-buried memories, reliving the troubled years before she arrived as an orphan at the Cuthberts’ farmhouse. Over the course of one remarkable summer, Anne Shirley discovers the truth about her parents, the origins of her quest for “kindred spirits,” and the roots of her brilliant, magical imagination.",
