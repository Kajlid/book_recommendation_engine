  "title": "Danats",
  "description": "In the year 2047, overpopulation and pollution have become a serious problem on Earth. Humans are finding ways to cope, namely by colonizing with a mysterious breed of gnats, giving their host some genetically superior traits, along with eliminating infectious and chronic diseases. Anallis Darrish refuses to go along with this plan. She is a purist, a Danat, shunned by society and treated differently based on this choice. As she struggles to find her way, she falls in love with two very different men, offering her completely opposite lifestyles. Tryst, a smooth talking ladies-man with no ambition or focus in life, is also a Danat, and her ex-boyfriend. Jash, the all-American boy next door with a steady career and unfailing gentlemanly manners has been her close friend for years and is colonized. How will she choose when they both mean so much to her? Will she give in and go the easy route with Jash? Or will she stay true to her ideals and succumb to Trystâ€™s salacious ways when he broke her heart before?",
