  "description": "Poetry. Simply one of the most admired and imitated poets of her generation, Lisa Jarnot's third volume of poetry does what only Jarnot can do. Decidedly lyrical, always reliant on repetition and rhythm, what emergies in this book is a catalog of loves and laments: \"Just the eldergrass and him, the fog, unpoliced and safe inside the train, the thoughts of rain, Apollo, and the sun...\" As Stan Brackage has said of Jarnot, \" H]er words are never severed from the means that engendered them; and the consequent meanings are never detached from the meditative drama of each whole poem.\"",
