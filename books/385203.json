  "title": "Sheep: The Remarkable Story of the Humble Animal that Built the Modern World",
  "description": "Despite everyday beliefs, civilization as we know it couldn't have existed without the humble sheep. The sheep's importance in providing meat, milk and wool, the basis of our food and clothing for millennia, has never been appreciated. Twenty years ago, Alan Butler set out on a period of research to redress this balance; Sheep is the consequence of that work. His book marries religion, economics, history and cultural studies and demonstrates the remarkable fact that without sheep we may not have spread around the world in the way we have. A fascinating study of the world's single most crucial domestic animal that is an eye opener and a pleasure to read.",
