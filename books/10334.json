  "description": "Trapped between two horny vampires and one lusty werewolf on a cruise ship with several hundred other weirdos that thought that they were vampires, Scarlett seriously considered jumping ship. Unfortunately, she hadn't discovered the truth about her fellow passengers until the ship was somewhere in the middle of the ocean. She decided she wouldn't have much success talking her way out of the sharks taking a bite out of her, but she would soon realize she wouldn't have much luck where the men were concerned either.",
