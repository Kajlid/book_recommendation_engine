  "title": "Joyful Transformation: 22 Keys to Reclaiming Your Authenticity",
  "description": "Emptiness. Guilt. Shame. Disillusionment. These painful feelings have become all too common in our world--familiar companions--suffered by millions as they unwittingly accept the silent obligation to lead an unfulfilling life. Speaking about them has somehow become taboo, and changing them even more so. Transformation has been relegated to the realm of religious fanaticism and new age fluff. So much so that the ordinary physical, mental and emotional transformations we all experience have somehow been separated from \"greater than me\" events and reduced in importance to the point that they become lost in the flurry of everyday living before we ever get the chance to incorporate them into our lives permanently. This highly practical guide offers readers a candid examination of all aspects of transformation -- mundane and spiritual. In it, the authors offer a straightforward workbook for all forms of change -- conscious, measurable, lasting change that improves various aspects of life, reduces the burdens we carry (willingly or otherwise), and frees us to live the best life we can -- a life worth living. The book is structured to focus on one transformation at a time. Each chapter limits itself in this way, allowing you to learn, practice and master key techniques to focus your thoughts and shift your actions toward a new design for living; drawing reality into alignment with your deepest desires and expanding your horizons in a limitless way.",
