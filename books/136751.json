  "title": "The Fenian Sacrifice: Summer of the God",
  "description": "Grief-stricken Sarah Crowley moved to the bucolic lakeside town of Wyanet in upstate New York to recover from the sudden suicide of her husband. Living closer to her sister and niece and working as the town’s museum curator is balm for her heartsick soul.  In preparation for the town’s tricentennial celebration, Sarah discovers evidence of something much more sinister going on beneath the surface of the quiet town. For nearly three centuries, the elite of Wyanet have formed an Irish brotherhood whose sole purpose is to resurrect the ancient Celtic god, Crom Dubh. When her niece’s boyfriend is found murdered, Sarah is plunged into a horrific underworld of child sacrifice and a vengeful battle of good versus evil.  With the help of Rowen Bradley, a carnival worker falsely accused of the murder, and Dr. John Penderton, an expert in Irish history, Sarah must trace a three hundred year old trail of missing children. Suddenly, it is a race against time to stop the Brotherhood and prevent the final sacrifice.",
