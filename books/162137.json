  "description": "Shepherd’s Cross - an isolated, remote moorland village, renowned for being the last place in England to have executed a woman for witchcraft. Three hundred years later, the locals remain superstitious: aside from a handful of wealthy newcomers, modern society has passed by largely unnoticed….until the unexpected arrival of two mysterious strangers to nearby Fellside Hall; a derelict mansion that has stood empty for eighty years.  One by one, a series of harrowing events descends on the village, prompting Sergeant Brian Jennings and PC Cara Jones to investigate; a task made almost impossible by the relentless onslaught of winter. When prolonged snowfall isolates Shepherd’s Cross from the outside world, the superstitions of the old-timers clash with the rational minds of the newcomers; challenging the community’s strength and testing its resolve to rally together against an ancient horror unfolding around them...a horror that is intent on returning forever.  Fast-paced and utterly compelling, Shepherd’s Cross is a supernatural thriller that will appeal to readers who enjoy the work of authors such as Stephen King, James Herbert and Graham Masterton.",
