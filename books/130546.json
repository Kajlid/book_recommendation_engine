Starla: There are two types of people in this world; the kind that run and the kind that stay and fight. When the shit gets deep, you find out just who people really are. I don’t have anything against people who run, their minds are set on self-preservation. But since the day I was born, I’ve always been a fighter. There’s a long enough moment of calm when shit hits the fan, for you to make the decision of what kind of person you’re gonna be; and in the world I live in, only the fighters survive.",
