For example Tony speaks to us of unrequited love Disgruntled“I came away from someone that I thought I knew. And if her eyes were any measure then my life would be through.I’d felt so out of place and I didn’t know why.It seemed she didn’t recognize me or was I being just too shy?”And as a broken hearted child when faced with the missing bond between parent and child A Father's Eyes“I remember standing at the door, peeking out the window, never seeing either of my parents depending on how their career goes.Those promises that were never kept at a time that would soon be gone.You sit inside your room and wonder how long must it go on!Holding one truth within your heart \"I will never do this to my son…”Each piece is a simple reminder that while life can be difficult and even debilitating it is better shared together with love and understanding.",
