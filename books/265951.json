  "description": "The Fourth Horseman Death and destruction are threatening the Texas borderlands. After Texas won its independence, the Mexican people left stranded on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande continue to live as they have for centuries. Not even the Civil War and Reconstruction have changed their way of life. Politics and greed are about to put an end to all that, even if it means murder. Outraged at being treated like second class citizens, the Mexican people have a different outcome in mind. They outnumber the Anglo population by ten to one. If they are to be treated like dogs, it's time for the dogs to bite. As blood flows on both sides of the conflict, an undercover Texas Ranger is sent into El Paso County to investigate. In a region where life is cheap and crime and corruption are as common as dirt, can one man find a just solution and prevent a war, or will death and hell ride into the borderlands on a pale horse? The Fourth Horseman is another great book for fans of Dan Arnold’s Historical Fiction. The story is based on one of the worst chapters in the history of Texas, the San Elizario Salt War. Fans of Louis L’ Amour will love this Western which may also remind them of Robert B. Parker or Elmore Leonard, with a touch of Cormac McCarthy for good measure.",
