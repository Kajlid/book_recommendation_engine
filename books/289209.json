  "description": "Martin Wild, failed soldier, failed policeman, finds success as a security consultant. Following the murder of his lover, policewoman Eileen Padget, he steps into the world of nightclubs and illegal drugs to trace the killers. Skills learnt in his former military and police lives are put to use and the evidence provided ensures the arrest of those responsible. Subsequent errors by the police and the CPS in preparing the case result in the gang being freed and Wild now becomes a target himself. Driven by grief and anger he adopts the maxim ‘an eye for an eye’, setting out on a second mission, but this time with deadly intent. His trail of vengeance shatters the quiet of a Scottish isle, the peace of a Dorset bay and the civilised routines of a French Department.\tThe author's training in Scene of Crime investigations at New Scotland Yard followed by years combating drug misuse in the nightclub world ensure that events and dialogue enjoy a realism not always encountered in crime novels.",
