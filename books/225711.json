  "description": "I slapped him hard—and by mistake.I was in the bar with my friend when I spotted him across the room. I mistook him for someone else, the guy who cheated on my friend and made her cry, so I marched over there to give him a piece of my mind—with my palm. The anger got the best of me and I slapped him over and over—and he didn’t stop me. In fact, he smirked like he actually enjoyed it. Then his masculine words snapped me out of my rage. “You’ve got the wrong guy, sweetheart.”Turns out, he’s Calloway Owens, rich-as-sin, built like a brickhouse, and he spends his millions in the sexiest way possible…as a philanthropist. He deserves my slap the least, but he takes it like a man. He’s already out of my league and he should hate me for what I’ve done…but then he asks me out.He’s the kind of guy that doesn’t say much, but his eyes say everything. Every time he looks at me, he makes me feel buck-naked. He says I’m not his usual type, but doesn’t explain what that means. I try to keep myself grounded, not to get too caught up with this dream hunk, but almost instantly I’m falling so hard…Not knowing he has a secret that could tear us apart…",
