  "title": "Pendulum",
  "description": "The place is England 1970, its traditions crumbling under the assault of The New Hedonism—pop singers, student rebellions, teenage motorcycle gangs, permissive morality...When a devastating financial crisis overwhelms the country, the thin veneer of civilization is stripped off—power passes into the hands of the young, and England becomes a country ruled by feudal gangs of teenagers imposing their own lynch law and terrorizing the adult population. Against this background of national collapse, the characters of Pendulum seek to rebuild their shattered lives, to go on living. Their predicament is terrifying but entirely believable, and its resolution—as the inevitable revolt of age and order against youth and anarchy takes shape—is a masterpiece of convincing horror.",
