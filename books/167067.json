  "description": "In 1967, nine-year-old AJ wins a trip to Ireland to spend Christmas in a medieval castle. There's only one drawback; she has to bring her big Italian family along. It doesn't take long for AJ to drive her Prom Queen sister crazy with her newly acquired Irish accent, or to take revenge on her brother with her Spooky Suzu doll hanging above his bed at night. Hop on the Blarney bus with The Degulio's , a group of tap dancers, and a family of yodelers for a rip roaring ride around Ireland. You may learn some interesting history amid the chaos in this comical coming of age adventure seen through the eyes of quirky AJ. You will never see Ireland the same again. A feel good read for ages 8 to adult",
