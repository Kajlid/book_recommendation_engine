There are now 5031 distinctive member civilizations calling themselves members of the Union. The United Stars Space fleet protects this mega civilization against external threats.Eric Olafson, born on a cold world called Nilfeheim raised under harsh conditions of a very traditional inward looking society of Neo Vikings left his planet to fulfill his dream to become a Starship captain. He managed to get accepted into the fleet academy and reach the third and senior year, along his way he made many friends and also powerful enemies.Eric has a very clear sense of honor and hates unfair situations. Even though he doesn't like to admit it, he carries the same short temper of his father and is more often than not ready to face a challenge with his fists or weapons. This and a secret desire he tries so hard to suppress, get him in more trouble than the average guy. He is still oblivious to the fact that he is destined to play a central role in an ancient conflict of cosmic proportions.",
