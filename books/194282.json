Ellie’s family gives her the best present ever, the opportunity to choose the dog she’s been dreaming about all on her own. She brings home her new dog expecting the rest of the family to be as excited as she is. Ellie’s Dad however, is less then impressed with her choice and refuses to accept her new dog into the family. Ellie knows she made the right choice and she can’t imagine why her Dad is so against it. Will Ellie be able to convince her Dad that her new dog really does belong?",
