War protests in the US are filtering into the US Navy’s 7th Fleet stationed off the coast of Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin at Yankee Station. Accidents are mounting on board the aircraft carrier USS Ranger, accidents that are appearing all too frequently for the ship’s captain. LTJG John Harmon has just been assigned to the USS Ranger with orders from Admiral Zumwalt to stop the ‘accidents’ and find the culprit before operation Linebacker II begins.LTJG John Harmon is a third generation US Naval Officer. His father served with Admiral Zumwalt before joining ONI and helped to steer John toward the newly formed NIS. John must go undercover as an engineering officer aboard the aircraft carrier as it returns to duty after a suspected act of sabotage to one of her main engines. John’s mission is time critical as the carrier heads back to Yankee Station. Along the way, John finds friendship, romance, conflict and mystery as he tries to unravel this case of seemingly serial sabotage from Washington, D.C. to the Philippines to the Gulf of Tonkin.",
