  "title": "The Moments That Make Us",
  "description": "The world we live in is fast paced, cutthroat, and incredibly confusing. We are often forced to make choices we truly aren’t sure about, or weren’t ready to make. We spend our time saying “What if?” or “I shouldn’t have.” We often look out instead of in as we try to find the root of what makes us tick, placing blame on everyone and everything other than ourselves along the way.  Pete Evick, professional musician, award-winning producer, songwriter, and father, shares his personal stories about the unique moments in his life, in hopes that they will convince you, the readers, to dig a little deeper into your own moments and evoke the mental archaeologist lying dormant in all of us.",
