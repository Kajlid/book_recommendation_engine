Who knew?\"Russel Middlebrook is twenty-three years old, gay, and living in trendy Seattle, but life isn't keeping up with the hype. Most of his friends have a direction in lifeâ€”either ruthlessly pursuing their careers or passionately embracing their own aimlessness. But Russel is stuck in place.

What does everyone else know that he doesn't?Enter Kevin, Russel's perfect high school boyfriend. Could rekindling an old flame be the thing Russel needs to get his life back on track? Or maybe the answer lies in a new friend, an eccentric screenwriter named Vernie Rose, who seems plenty wise. Or what the hell? Maybe Russel will find some answers by joining his best friend Gunnar's crazy search for the legendary Bigfoot!One way or another, Russel is determined to learn the all-important secret to life, even if it's a thing he doesn't even know he doesn't know.",
