A harrowing loss drove him from his home, and he hasn’t stopped moving since. Grim and sardonic, he’s never found anything worth sticking around for—until now. Rosa Cortez runs Valle de Bravo, a haven of civilization amid the chaos of the Change.

He evokes a delicious new longing, but she won’t submit to any man. Tension rises as bloodthirsty raiders strike again and again, bent on possessing Valle and its resources.
