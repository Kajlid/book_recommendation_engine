  "description": "~Editor's Pick~  When your imaginary friend turns out to be real, there's only one thing you can doâ€”have the best sex of your life.  When she is attacked on her way home from work, Macie Johann's ordered world is thrown into chaos. And the muscle bound hunk that comes to her rescue would appear to be naked? Okay then, maybe she has hit her head a bit too hard? But then again, no one else seems to notice him, and there is something very familiar about this guy. He reminds her of her imaginary childhood playmate, Kaylom.  Blind from birth, Macie has learned to trust her senses, and they all scream at her to grab her chance of true happiness with the man who makes her body and soul sing. Never mind the small fact of his not being human.  When their actions get Kaylom yanked back into his dimension to stand trial, Macie follows, determined to fight for her man.",
