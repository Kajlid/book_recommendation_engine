  "description": "WHO GOT LIZ GARDNER, by Elizabeth Allen, is a coming-of-age novel about the (mis)adventures of a dysfunctional, self-centered but essentially good-hearted aspiring actress growing up during the hedonistic 80s and 90s. A first-person narrative, the story is mostly set in New York City and later Los Angeles, as Liz pursues her twin goals of finding A) a career in acting, and B) a decent man (The One). Both of these goals prove elusive, though not from any lack of trying on Liz's part.The daughter of a five-time drama queen divorcee and a thoroughly despicable wealthy philandering shrink, Liz starts out with more psychological baggage than most people collect in a lifetime. It's no surprise that she soon seeks out male companionship to fill her emotional void, or that the assorted men she beds invariably prove to be disposable ciphers. But instead of caving in and becoming a basket case, Liz summons up her inner moxie and sets out on her quest to find a good life and someone with whom to share it.Who Got Liz Gardner is a complete meal with flavors, textures and ingredients reminiscent of \"50 Shades of Grey\", and \"Sex and the City\" combined with a dash of \"Fear of Flying\". Readers who enjoy feasts of this caliber will want to indulge in this extraordinary repast and encourage others to take a taste! However, be warned - while some like it hot, this meal hits the top of the Scoville scale. Muy caliente!(edited by author)",
