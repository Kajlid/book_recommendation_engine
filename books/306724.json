  "description": "Death…it’s the only guarantee in this rollercoaster ride called life. My dad always used to say “It’s what you do while you’re alive that matters.” But he’s gone now, and me…I’m spiraling out of control and on the verge of losing everything my dad worked so hard for.Until Mateo Reyes makes me an offer I can’t refuse: he wants to purchase my dad’s shop. The payday would be monumental, but can I really sell all I have left of my dad?Eventually, I give in. With a single caveat—he hires me to run it.The tatted-up mechanic turns out to be as strict as he is handsome.When I agreed to help my late friend’s daughter, I had no idea the kind of trouble I was inviting into my life. Seraphine’s young, reckless, impulsive, and drowning in her grief. The absolute last person I should allow around my teenage daughter.I’ve made it my personal mission to show her life does in fact go on after loss. After the death of my wife—I’d know.Before I know it, I find myself thinking about things I have no business thinking of—like if her skin’s as soft as it looks and how her lips taste.Turns out, she’s every bit as interested as I am, and while she might be my damnation, I’m willing to fight for her, come what may.",
