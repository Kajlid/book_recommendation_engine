  "description": "It took Harvey months to work up the courage to let his friends set him up on a date with Fitz—a dominant he’d been admiring from afar ever since he set foot in the local kinky clubs. But, when their first scene ended in disaster before it even got started, he was very quick to retreat.  Forget going back to the club where he made a fool of himself. Harvey’s determined never to leave the house again. Facing Fitz is out of the question.  Fitz, however, has other ideas. Intrigued by what he saw on that first date he’s determined to do a real scene with Harvey. Dominant to the core, Fitz has no intention of walking away from a boy he’s genuinely interested in without a fight.  Harvey is going to have to get over his embarrassment and face Fitz sooner or later and, with the help of a few friends, Fitz is determined he’ll do that tonight.",
