  "title": "The Human Condition",
  "description": "David Moody presents the final book in the acclaimed AUTUMN series. The human race is finished. Mankind is all but dead and only a handful of frightened individuals remain. These people have survived through chance, not skill, and they are a desperate bunch: cheating lovers, workshy civil servants, permanently drunk publicans, teenage rebels, obsessive accountants, failed husbands, first-time cross-dressers, disrobed priests and more... Experience the end of the world as seen from almost fifty different perspectives. Part-companion, part-guidebook and part-sequel, AUTUMN: THE HUMAN CONDITION follows the individual stories of these desperate survivors through their final dark days. 'The best survival horror since Richard Matheson's I am Legend' - Wayne Simmons, author of Flu and Plastic Jesus 'Moody is as imaginative as Barker, as compulsory as King, and as addictive as Palahniuk' - Scream the horror magazine 'Takes the genre in a fascinating new direction. If John Wyndham was alive and writing zombie novels, they'd read like this' - Jonathan Maberry, best-selling author of Patient Zero and Rot & Ruin",
