Especially after his band hit the big time. But when the talent she hired for her resort’s annual Huckleberry Festival bails on her, she’s desperate to find a replacement act--and her rock star crush is just the answer she's looking for.As they work together, a crush deepens into so much more, but who falls in love in two weeks?
