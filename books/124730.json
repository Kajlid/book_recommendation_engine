  "description": "From the author of the internationally Bestselling Books - Red Herrings & White Elephants, What Caesar did for My Salad, Shaggy Dogs, Pop Goes the Weasel, They Laughed at Galileo & 9/11 ConspiracyOriginally written in 2014 the story chillingly predicting many of the great events between 2016 & 2019, such as the election of Donald Trump, the Islamic suicide attacks in Europe and the dreaded VIRUS that was used to restrict movements of people and restore order. Imagine a world with no countries, no religion and no democracy. Imagine the fall of the Great Western Empire. Historically, most Empires created by man have risen and fallen during a period of around 500 years. The Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, the Moors and the Ottomans all, in their turn, reigned supreme until apathy, arrogance and, laziness led to their downfall. However, Mankind would never become extinct as new societies inevitably replace existing social structures sooner or later. By 2022 AD the great and so called democratic Western Empire, which began with the Age of Discovery during the 15th century, was tired, corrupt and had run out of ways of oppressing, cheating and taxing the societies it was supposed to represent, democratically. Western values and the religion of Islam were non-compatible and the conflict became so intense that the system of democracy would fail.Other ethnic tensions increased; violence and disorder followed mass migration and people longed for a return to their own traditional values. Chaos requires strong leadership. Men of authority. Men like Julius Caesar who could restore the natural order. Bring in a New Order. If the West is to survive then Democracy must be sacrificed.The question is 'what happened next?'",
