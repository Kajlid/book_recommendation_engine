  "description": "Robert Berkus’s steady academic life seemed to be an open road until the day he took a detour... right into Officer Miguel Rodriguez’s path. When Miguel helps the sexy professor change a flat tire, Robert is absolutely oblivious to Miguel's interest. That suits Miguel just fine, though. He’s used to being the aggressor although it sure would be nice to get this sweet and staid college professor to make the first move.When Robert gets his act in gear, the results prove explosive. Miguel wants Robert in his bed and in his life permanently, and Robert enthusiastically agrees - but they've already learned that life makes detours. Sometimes it takes love a little courage to arrive at its chosen destination.",
