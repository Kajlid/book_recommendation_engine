  "description": "It's 1999, and Eira Hart and Ru Tattersall are set up to co-host The Lonely Harts Club, a new late-night radio show to help New Yorkers find love. It's a last chance attempt for both Eira, expert in Celtic mythology and amateur Welsh matchmaker, and Ru, once-hot-shot Aussie DJ, to achieve their New York dreams.The thing is, you either click with a co-host, or you don’t. It’s a bit like falling in love. There’s co-host chemistry, or there isn’t.With the countdown to a new millennium, it feels like the world as they know it is about to end.Radio is becoming commercialized and superficial. Lower Manhattan is gentrifying. The Lonely Harts Club feels like the last chance to hold on to something real. As confessions pour out over the late-night airwaves and their show gathers an impressive following of happily-matched couples, can The Lonely Harts Club make one last true match?",
