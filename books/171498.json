  "description": "Cara Cavanaugh is not your average girl. She lacks any sense of self-preservation and defies all authority. She hunts the monsters that most people are afraid to even acknowledge exist. But her tough girl act is a front. It's the only way she can cope with the endless torment and pain of an unspeakable horror she witnessed as a child. Now, driven by a fierce rage and nearly uncontainable grief, Cara's sole mission in life is to find and murder the vampire that stole her childhood and father away from her. She will do anything to have her vengeance, including die for it. Aiden is not your average vampire. As the Prince of Darkness, he's set to inherit the vampire throne and has a reputation for being every bit as ruthless as he is lethal. Aiden tracks Cara down with every intention of killing her. Her death is the only way to stop a looming threat to his people. However, the beautiful hunter proves that she is no easy prey. As the two engage in a titillating game of cat and mouse, lines and motives become blurred.",
