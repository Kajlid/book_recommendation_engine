  "description": "Translated into and performed in several Indian and foreign languages, Shantata! Court Chalu Ahe is one of the best known works of Vijay Tendulkar. In some ways typical, in others uncharacteristic, this play was written for a Rangayan performance in 1968. Drafted mere days before its staging, it has since been broadcast by the BBC in English and made into a film by Satyadev Dubey. This edition of the play, titled Silence! The Court is in Session and translated by Priya Adarkar, also features an introduction by Kumud Mehta.",
