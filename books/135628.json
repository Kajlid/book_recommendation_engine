  "description": "Before you read this book, please be ready to delve into a dark and taboo world of demons and angels who can and will do as they please. This series, especially the first novel, will immerse you in a world filled with dark places and even darker beings. They are not human, and do not act the way you and I act, or think the way you and I think, so please be ready for some controversial themes and for me to push the boundaries! Please be aware that this novel depicts explicit sexual relationships between consenting adults, including romantic suspense, and may not be suitable for those under the age of 18.Young Cate Rose's seemingly normal life is shattered by the revelation that her father is the Devil. She then leaves her old, human life on Earth behind and goes to Hell, where the Dark Princess must then discover her own path while embracing her darkness and finding the right balance for both her humanity and her dark prowess. Her strange world is turned upside-down even further as she is emotionally exploited and scarred by further events that sweep her in different directions, and into the arms of very different lovers, all of them powerful beings that dominate both her and the world around her. The Dark Princess's tumultuous existence has many twists and turns in store before she eventually takes control of her life and follows her own path at last, but which one will she choose, and to whom will it lead?",
