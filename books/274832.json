Diagnosed with a rare, incurable disease, the little girl’s only hope of survival lies on a distant planet and Cirrus plans to get it. Even if it means knocking down a smoking-hot bad guy who makes her panties wet and knees weak.  Sent to infiltrate a rogue faction, Guardian Defender Gavin Sagestar is so deep undercover even he has trouble remembering which side he’s on. Then he sees Cirrus. Law, duty, and order take a backseat to want, need, and...damn, is that love? Smart, beautiful, and curvy, Cirrus is his and anyone who thinks otherwise can fuck right off. Even the rogue military leader who wants her for his mate.  To have the sexy-as-hell housekeeper, Sagestar has to get Cirrus away from the bloodthirsty tyrant eager to kill. Time's running out. Two lives hang in the balance. Sagestar is determined to save both mother and daughter, no matter what. Even if it costs him his life.",
