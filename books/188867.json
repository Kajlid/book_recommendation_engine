  "description": "All's Fair is the story of Ben Coulter, a thirty-something drama professor dealing with the death of his wife. Although ruled accidental, Ben is convinced that her death was suicide provoked by the theft of her business by Taylor Duckworth, a ruthless businessman who operates at the edge of the law. With the help of Allison Merryweather, whose family's business was stolen by the same thief, the professor puts his theatrical skills to work with a con of his own to get even with the crook. Allison uses Duckworth's penchant for seducing young women, to set up the con. She becomes the old lecher's social companion, playing his kinky games. During a yacht trip to Bermuda with Duckworth, a major unexpected element converts the con game into a desperate race against time. Drug smuggling pirates board Duckworth's yacht. He offers them enormous sums of money to spare his life. They agree, but take Allison as collateral, thinking that she is his young wife. Duckworth has a week to get the cash together. Now it's up to Ben Coulter and his best friend, Curt Donovan, to find Allison and save her life.",
