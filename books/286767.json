  "description": "There’s a rule in Crowne Hall: never look a Crowne in the eyes. It protects us more than them. I broke it once, the night Grayson Crowne mistook me for his true love and stole my first kiss. I’ve regretted it every day since. He hates me. He torments me. He won’t let me go, because that night he whispered a secret against my lips not meant for me. Grayson Crowne, heir to the Crowne empire and notorious playboy prince is… a virgin. I signed a contract in my heart’s blood as much as ink: help him get back his love, repair what I broke. Give him my body, my soul, my heart, let him use all of me, so when the time comes to marry her, he won’t need me. I shouldn’t need him. But he’s my stolen soulmate, and I’m at his mercy.",
