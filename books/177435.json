  "title": "East in Eden",
  "description": "Surviving New Zealand in characteristic Eastern European style, while helplessly falling in love with the 'Land of the Thousand Rainbows', the 'Most Beautiful Rainy Hell', the 'Land of Relentless Biscuit Eaters' - Aotearoa, the 'Last Eden on Earth'. I never perceived our life in New Zealand as exile and emigration as martyrdom, as it is the custom (and pretty much a patriotic obligation) in the Bulgarian cultural and literary tradition. Our life in Aotearoa was a challenge and a lifetime adventure, a love affair and a hilarious comedy (with just the tiny bit of drama) in a land, regarded by the rest of the world as the last Eden on Earth. This book is my humble attempt to tell the story of our hardship and joy, suffering and fun, the mundane and the extraordinary, the adventurous and the banal, that we faced during our six years in New Zealand. It is about the friends we found. The clichés we wrestled. The wonders we witnessed. The people we met. The lessons we learned. The country we reluctantly, but helplessly fell in love with. About Aotearoa - The Land Of The Long White Cloud. About New Zealand - at the end of the world.",
