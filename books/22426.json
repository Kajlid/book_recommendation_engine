  "title": "Sex and Stupidity: A collection of Short Stories",
  "description": "A collection of short stories about women, mostly written in tragic satire.From a young woman marginalized in the workplace, to a strong woman's destructive forays, a woman's dedication to a husband driving her to insanity with his loss, and another woman's quest to make a man love her, these short stories portray the ways that women are put upon in today's society. Marginalized, abused, and sometimes driven into madness. A show that the job of feminism is no where near done yet.",
