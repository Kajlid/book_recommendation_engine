  "title": "All I Want for Christmas",
  "description": "Santa is young, hot, and thin. Not what she was expecting. It's Saylor Bates' first Christmas alone since her divorce. While killing time window shopping at the mall, Saylor manages to catch the mall Santa Claus and pleads with him to reassure her small, worried son via FaceTime he'll find him at his dad's for Christmas. What Saylor doesn't expect is for Santa to set a match to her blood. He's young, dazzle-eyed, and drop-dead gorgeous beneath that fur-trimmed hat and fluffy white beard. When Cole Osteen is snagged by Saylor under his guise as Santa on Christmas Eve, he can't help but seek her out. Soon their romance ignites, sparking and gleaming brighter than a light display. Cole asks Saylor what she wants for Christmas, and of course she says her son's happiness. Divorce can be hard for a little boy. Cole's kissing definitely keeps Saylor warm, and soon her Christmas wishes begin to turn inward as well, making her hope for a future with him. But with Cole's ex interfering at every turn, this Christmas it might be too much to ask for happiness of her own. With instant chemistry, quirky banter, and a happily ever after, you'll adore this clean Christmas romance by Catelyn Meadows! This book was previously titled Second Chance Christmas.
