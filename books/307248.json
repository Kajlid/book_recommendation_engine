  "description": "It's 1978. Two sons of the Rising Sun reignite their fathers’ World War Two diabolical disdain for women, secreting it to Chicago’s shores. The first - the mastermind - a professor of nuclear physics, is readying an ingenious new weapon that if released, will have a catastrophic effect on every human being across the North American continent for decades to come. The second, a butchering psychopath, is loose in the streets, diverting local authorities with an ever-escalating, body count of his young female victims. Recalling a childhood riddle, the FBI’s first authorized, gun-toting, female agent Michaelene Westgate, rushes as the clock ticks, to decipher and crush the professor’s barbaric scheme. Author Kenneth James Moore has traveled the globe to research a little known holocaust that has remained a closely guarded secret of Japan and US allies alike, for over 80 years. A battle plan like any other, drawn during WWII by the Imperial Japanese Army’s general staff, it aimed at destroying the women of the countries they planned to occupy. This international crime thriller wraps such historical events with edge of your seat adventure and heroism. Today, for the millions of women who mercilessly fell at the hands of Imperial Japan, their story needs to be told as a way for modern day feminists in western culture to expand their values to ones that are more intersectional. Pieces of Wood does just that. From the east coast of the United States to its mid-west, to Japan, the Mariana Archipelago, Malaysia, China, London, the former Soviet Union, to the underground remnants of 1816’s Fort Dearborn along the Chicago River, this epic, historically accurate, crime thriller is set to electrify readers, worldwide.",
