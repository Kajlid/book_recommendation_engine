It is a safe haven from the radiation, and a place where there is plant life, electricity, protection; things never seen or felt in the lawless, savage greywastes.In Skyfall lives a teenager named Jade, born and raised in the 'slum district' Moros by an insane mother. He steals and cheats in any way he can to keep him and his boyfriend alive for another winter, all while longing for a better life, some place warm beyond the slums.Then a chance encounter brings Jade into the sights of the most important and most feared chimera in Skyfall, Elish Dekker. A man of statuesque elegance, cold beauty, and a reputation for being the most heartless and cruel chimera in existence. And though Elish may not understand why, he does know one thing for sure... the boy will be his pet.Note: This is a companion book to Book 1 of The Fallocaust Series, it is extremely urged that you read Fallocaust Book 1 before reading Breaking Jade, since this book does contain plot spoilers for the series.",
