  "description": "Teejay Bishop, cancer survivor, is still trying to put a life back together in the California coastal town of Monarch Beach. Things that were odd last month just got worse - there's a cow in the front yard, goats in the road, and someone broke into the hardware store. The college kids working for the summer are the first suspects, but when Kelly's diner comes under investigation, it's anyone's guess. Tee and her friends will have to figure this one out on their own, with a little help from the irrepressible Tim.",
