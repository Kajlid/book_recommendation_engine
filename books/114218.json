  "title": "The Killing Trial",
  "description": "When seemingly innocent children are pitted against each other, they discover where loyalties lie, and what it really means to be a soldier in wartime. The year is 2028 and yet another \"graduating\" class of young teenagers raised together in Area 51 are ready to compete in a deadly game for a chance to be one of four child soldiers to fight in world war three. Split into four groups, they face the possibility of being forced against friends and, in some cases, their own twin. Innocence, idealism, faith, and life all come to end for these children as they begin to develop into the terrible soldiers that ordinary people never wanted to, or could become.",
