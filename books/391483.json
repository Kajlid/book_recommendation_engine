  "title": "A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future",
  "description": "The future belongs to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind: artists, inventors, storytellers-creative and holistic \"right-brain\" thinkers whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn't.Drawing on research from around the world, Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) outlines the six fundamentally human abilities that are absolute essentials for professional success and personal fulfillment--and reveals how to master them. A Whole New Mind takes readers to a daring new place, and a provocative and necessary new way of thinking about a future that's already here.",
