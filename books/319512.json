Poor Logan never did recover from that incident.Who are these people? Are they really connected to his ex-girlfriend's death? Logan's life is on a timer. He's best to find some answers.Praise for the first edition of Seed Me:\"Konn Lavery has obvious talent, and his Seed Me book belongs on the shelf next to King and Koontz. Great creep factor, awesome pace, refreshing bad guys, and the ability to stay with you after you're done. Do Consume Seed Me \"- scifiandscary.com\"This gives Lavery his own edge in the industry and a new voice that could make people think differently about storylines.\"- Renee Spicuzza, Goodreads Reviewer",
