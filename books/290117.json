  "description": "'Yarooh!', 'You beast!', 'I say, you fellows', 'Oh scissors', 'Oh Crikey', are some of the utterances you can hear from fiction's most famous school boy, William George Bunter or Billy Bunter. In the 1930s the Bunter stories in the Magnet became so popular that parcels of 'tuck' would arrive at the magazine's offices for the ever hungry 'fat owl of the Remove'. In the 1950s, a very successful TV series with Gerald Campion revived Bunter's popularity again.",
