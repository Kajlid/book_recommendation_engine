  "description": "The sequel to worldwide bestseller Angela's Ashes, Frnak McCourt's second volume of memoirs tells the story of his American journey. It follows his progress from impoverished immigrant with rotten teeth, infected eyes and no formal education to brilliant raconteur and schoolteacher (a profession for which his two years spent training attack dogs in Germany during the Korean War was invaluable preparation). Exploited, helped and even saved by a cast of New York eccentrics, Frank McCourt continues his vivid, hilarious and harrowing tale of survival. Yet again, it is through the power of storytelling that Frank finds a life for himself.",
