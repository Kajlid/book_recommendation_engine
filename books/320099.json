  "title": "The Ubiqitous Masquerade",
  "description": "A collection of short stories exploring the themes of alienation, the search for personal-authenticity and the ultimate nature of humankind. The tales frequently give the impression of supernatural events unfolding, using them as a metaphor for wider significances. With their supernatural imagery, brooding melancholy and bursts of grotesque, wry humour, one might describe them as a collection of fairy tales for the modern age.",
