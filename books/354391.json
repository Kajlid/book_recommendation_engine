  "description": "Every woman who has longed to share a perfect Christmas with her grown-up children will find a special wisdom in this delightful story.For the best of plans can go awry. All three Greaves children came home for the holidays. Each brought a new triumph, but each triumph presented a frustrating problem, and the problems outlasted a festivity which had in some way lost something of its radiance. When everyone had left, Margaret Greaves turned for comfort to the carefully treasured Christmas trappings of the past - the 'baubles' as her elder daughter disdainfully called them - Cecily's angel, Penny's favourite golden peach, Hank's silver trumpet. Another tree rose in the living-room. And as Mrs. Greaves lovingly recreated the happy past, its magic reached out to another generation, and each found his own second chance in the celebration of Twelfth Night's 'Little Christmas.'",
