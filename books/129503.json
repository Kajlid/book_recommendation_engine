  "description": "An introspective, at times somber look at the concept of adventure and the state of America. In the early months of 2005, our narrator realizes he's done a lot of traveling, but has never had a true adventure. After running into an acquaintance he hasn't seen since high school, he decides to take off on a road trip across the country that will challenge him and examine a new generation of young adults who are living the best way that they know how - a way that is unlike anything their parents and grandparents tried.",
