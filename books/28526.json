  "title": "I Wish You Didn't Know My Name: The Story of Michele Launders and Her Daughter Lisa",
  "description": "A candid look at a teenage romance that ended in unimaginable tragedy, I Wish You Didn't Know My Name also tells the tale of Michele's legal battle to bury her daughter with dignity and love - and of the stunning conviction that ultimately put Joel Steinberg behind bars. But the story doesn't end there. For through Michele Launder's decision to go public with her grief, she won the greatest victory of all: heightened national awareness of child abuse, increased understanding of mothers' rights... and the comforting sense that Lisa's tragic death was not in vain.",
