  "description": "Tetsuya Kuroko doesn't stand out much. In fact, he's so plain that people hardly ever notice when he's around. Though he's just as unremarkable on the basketball court, that's where his plainness gives him an unexpected edge—one that lets him execute awesome moves without others noticing! When incoming first-year Taiga Kagami joins the Seirin High basketball team, he meets Tetsuya Kuroko, a mysterious boy who’s plain beyond words. But Kagami's in for the shock of his life when he learns that the practically invisible Kuroko was once a member of \"the Miracle Generation”—the undefeated legendary team—and he wants Kagami's help taking down each of his old teammates!",
