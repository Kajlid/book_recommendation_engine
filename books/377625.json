  "description": "Imagine that you were the lowest of the low – a drunkard, a brawler, a fornicator, a desperate hulk of a man…Imagine that the mark of the divine suddenly appeared etched in your flesh, and that your life spiraled into unending horror as a consequence…Imagine that you managed to find a respite from this Hell… and imagine that this respite was short-lived.Legendary cartoonist Lorenzo Mattotti (Fires, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) applies his virtuosic pen to novelist and screenwriter Claudio Piersanti’s gripping fable of good, evil, sacrifice and ultimate redemption.",
