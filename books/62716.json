Throughout the night, the group struggles to stay alive, using their individual talents to evade deadly mind-links and to piece together the day of the murder.One by one, they are systematically shut down, until finally, with all hope of survival vanishing, Janice and Adrian are jolted into one last time slip where, second by second, history begins to repeat itself—but this time, with an unexpected, romantic twist.",
