  "description": "In The Making of the President 1968, the 3rd volume of the groundbreaking series that revolutionized American political journalism, Theodore H. White offers a compelling account of one of the most turbulent presidential campaigns in history: the 1968 election that put Richard M. Nixon in the White House. Viewing the electoral process from an insider's perspective--capturing both the vast scope & the intimate, behind-the-scenes details--White chronicles a campaign that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. & presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, was marked by protest & violence in the streets of Chicago, & that came down to a neck-&-neck finish between the tenacious but ill-starred Hubert H. Humphrey & the most fascinating politician of the modern age: the finally, unexpectedly, victorious Richard Nixon.",
