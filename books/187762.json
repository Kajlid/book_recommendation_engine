  "description": "Spy Pond Poetry by Ed Meek Praise for Spy Pond \"In this rich collection, Ed Meek \"pull[s] us back from the edge\" (as in his poem, On Edge). Compelling and diverse, whether his subject is the Boston Marathon bombing, addressing Robert Frost, considering silence, love, loss, or the Iraqi war-he manages to pull me in and then set me back down again with deeper knowledge, contemplation, and perspective.\"Cynthia Brackett-Vincent, publisher of the Aurorean poetry journal; author, Questions About Home \"Ed Meek's poems give a slap to the reader's complacency. Whether it is a wild coyote stalking its domestic prey on the broad and manicured lawns of the suburbs, or his contemplation of our inevitable decline, he is a poet who constantly explores what is beneath the scrim, the facade, the theatrical props, the smoke and mirrors we allow ourselves to be blinded by.\"Doug Holder, Publisher Ibbetson Street Press, author of Eating Grief at 3 AM. (Muddy River Books 2013). \"This volume of poetry is brilliant. Meek stuns us with his honesty, so direct and so mature. Meek is as precise about things as he is about his feelings. His extraordinary talent and compassion shine through and permeate each line. This is indeed good news, news that can never be discounted.\"James Wm. Chichetto, The Dream of Norumbega, an Epic Poem on The United States of America Volumes I, II, III. \"Ed Meek, in this wondrously varied collection, explores the hard topics with a deft hand, perceptive eye, and generous insight. All with startling language. This is a collection worth reading and rereading. There is much, much here to discover, contemplate, and thoroughly savor. And I do.\"Phillip X Levine (Chronogram Magazine Poetry Editor).",
