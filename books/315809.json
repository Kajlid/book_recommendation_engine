  "description": "Contains adult humour.If my words won’t rhyme I shall not dream, And if I cannot dream Then there’s no hope– No sense and no feelings. And without feelings, there’s no love And without love I am nothing. And if I am nothing Then my words won’t rhyme And I’ll have no life And without life, there’s only death Yet come my death With my very last breath– I’ll rhyme.",
