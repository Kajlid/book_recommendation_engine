  "description": "If only I hadn't had that last drink...It might be the toughest night of the year for Micah O'Shea, but one tequila too many and suddenly she's seeing the world--and her best friend firefighter Josh Taylor--in a new light! Surely a bit of Dutch courage is all she needs to see if he tastes as good as he looks?Why did no one tell her that the morning after is way more awkward when you're friends with the man you threw yourself at? And that it gets more awkward when you start having X-rated dreams about him? Perhaps Micah should stop saying \"If only...\" and start asking \"What if...?\"Winner of Harlequin's So You Think You Can Write contest 2013!",
