  "description": "During the 1968 Vietnamese New Year Offensive, a U.S. Navy pier is attacked. American forces bomb enemy locations. Later, they bring in enemy bodies and dump them on a helicopter pad across the road from the pier. The number of bodies increase throughout the very hot day. A security policeman comes over from the pier to inspect the bodies. It's a story about what the Navy security guards went through the night when they were fired upon and the next day when the bodies begin to pile up across the road from their posts.",
