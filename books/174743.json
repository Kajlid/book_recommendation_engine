  "description": "Honor Rochester has one purpose: decimate the UDK society and every tainted imprint of its hand upon her life. Superior Maximus August stands between her and this insurmountable taskâ€”every time she moves forward, he pushes her back. But the monster can only push so far, can only manipulate and destroy so much, until another monster is created. She will win, but she has doubts that she will be redeemable afterward.",
