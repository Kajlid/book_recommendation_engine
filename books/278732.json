  "description": "For nearly two thousand years, the animosity between Sir Lancelot and King Arthur remains unsettled as they slumber restlessly in the dream dimension of the Morpheum, where sleeping beings remain bound to the earth by people's dreams and wishful fantasies.When they reemerge in the twenty-first century, King Arthur seeks justice for his betrayal while Sir Lancelot seeks vengeance for the persecution of Guinevere. Thus, the Roundtable Knights of Camelot are divided into civil war set against the backdrop of Baltimore, Maryland. One by one, the nobility of King Arthur's court \"awaken\" for the final judgment resulting from the love affair between the ordained protector of the Holy Grail Sir Lancelot, and Her Royal Highness Queen Guinevere.But in the midst of this volatile situation comes a dire message of great urgency from Queen Vivian, sovereign of mystic Avalon, that will forever change the course of Arthurian history.",
