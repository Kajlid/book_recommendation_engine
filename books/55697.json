She had the mark of the vampire that she had hidden for years and was slotted to be a mate to one of the savage species of blood drinkers. Mage and vampires did not mix…so she kept the secret to herself and avoided a mating until she meets her mate, Nathan Hale…a vampire that saves her life. Nathan squashes every myth she has ever heard about vampires and she soon finds herself drawn to the very vampire she had fought so hard to avoid.Nathan Hale never planned on finding his mate. At the age of 600 years, he had thought his time for finding his mate had passed him by. He’s shocked when he rescues Sasha only to find out that she is his chosen mate.
