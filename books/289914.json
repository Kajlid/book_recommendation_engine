  "description": "She was always the one.Or so I thought.Turns out my instincts were dead wrong.Years ago I was faced with the choice between two women. Both were perfect in opposite ways. One was carefree and against commitment. The other was a woman you’d bring home to mom.I was young, naïve and stupid. I’m sure you can guess who I chose.Now, I’m older, wiser and know what the hell I want.So, when the same two women pop back into my life it’s my chance for a do-over. But they flipped the script. Just like me, they want different things now. Leaving me with one choice—convince the woman I want that she wants me too.",
