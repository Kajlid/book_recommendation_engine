  "description": "From being a cult figure of the early feminist movement, Anais Nin later rose to international prominence with her writing. Characterised by the use of powerful, and at times, disquieting imagery, her work reveals great sensitivity and perception. These thirteen stories are no expection, and with a 'touch as light as a cobweb and colouring made of mirages' she penetrates the emotional depths of the individual in a world where illusion is the key to reality...Often considered Anais Nin's finest work of fiction, this collection of short stories was self-published by Nin with an old-fashioned hand press in 1944. Among the titles are \"Houseboat,\" \"The Mouse,\" \"The Labyrinth,\" and \"Birth.\"",
