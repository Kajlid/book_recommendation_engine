  "description": "It takes well laid plans to build a lasting relationship. Jameson (J.D.) Reid has years of experience designing tall buildings and even restoring majestic structures. She's worked to lay a solid foundation to her burgeoning relationship with Senator Candace Fletcher. But, love and architecture require different materials and tools. The landscape of Washington politics coupled with the opinions and intrusions of family are proving to be a bit rockier than most of the ground Jameson has had to navigate in the past. Can Jameson draft the right plans? Will the senator she has fallen so deeply in love with help her build on their still tentative foundation? Love is the main ingredient, but Jameson and Candace are finding their relationship is still UNDER CONSTRUCTION.",
