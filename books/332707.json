  "title": "Bells: Music, Art, Culture, and Politics from Around the World",
  "description": "We live in a world of bells yet seldom notice them. But bells have existed in all cultures since earliest times, often playing powerful roles in history. They have been the “voice” of the Buddha in the East and the “voice” of God in the West. They have been talismans for early monastics, sources of glorious music, and parts of many sacred rituals. And they have been the clocks, school bells, and fire bells of everyday life. From the recently discovered chimes of ancient China to the music of carillons and the surprising bell on the International Space Station, Bells brings together seventeen stories that explore the magic and mysticism of bells, their political and religious power, and their wide-ranging musicality. Inspired by her great-grandmother’s trip around the world to collect bells and informed by her own world travels, Jaan Whitehead brings these stories to life in all their rich diversity. Illustrated with more than one hundred photographs, this beautiful book creates a living portrait of one of history’s more remarkable artifacts.",
