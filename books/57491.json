  "description": "In a near-future New York running out of everything, a Homeland Security agent tasked with keeping the city alive falls for a woman determined to protect its most vulnerable creatures.Shavir knows she would be charged as a terrorist should she ever get caught, but she thinks of herself as a part-time barista, a community farmer, and an underground animal activist fighting for the forgotten and discarded. The last thing she needs in her life is a Homeland Security guy. Jake works for Homeland because he is brilliant at obtaining critical medical drugs at all costs to keep New York City’s hospitals running. He is a sensitive man with too much amphetamine in his blood who can't afford to care for anyone, least of all a woman who is keeping secrets from him. Jake’s view of whose lives must be saved and who can be sacrificed gets challenged when Shavir takes him across the East River to the ravaged communities in Brooklyn he was ordered to ignore. Soon, they both start to question the fragile truths they have built their lives upon.A gripping speculative thriller, a thought-provoking look into our precarious future, and an unflinching examination of our deep need for love and connection in times of social and environmental upheaval, Fragile is perfect for fans of Emily St. John Mandel and Alison Stine.",
