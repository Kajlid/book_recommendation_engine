  "description": "French Cajun Aviatrix. A-4 Skyhawk pilot. Vietnam. Nora Broussard dares to earn her wings gaining liberty. Despite the heroics, her heart remains unrequited and broken. When she finds out her star-crossed lover is now free, yet thousands of miles away from New Orleans flying bombing missions in Vietnam, nothing will keep her away. The U.S. government won’t let her fly combat in a war zone, so she uses her next best assets – her vamp and her voice. Traveling with Bob Hope as a torch singing USO girl, she is thrust into the perils of the 1968 Tet Offensive. As mortar attacks and napalm shake her to the core, she quickly realizes the short-sightedness of her decision to stay and manage a USO club. The shocking realities of a senseless war catapult her values into place. But is it too late? When Steve is shot down over Laos and listed MIA, Nora is forced to accept one of life’s greatest lessons.",
