  "title": "Where Books Fall Open: A Reader's Anthology of Wit & Passion",
  "description": "This is a book about books, about the pleasures, passions, and rewards of reading, about authors dedicated to writing and readers who delight in words in the right order. It contains a rich selection devoted to this seductive subject, from Calvino's meditation on selecting a title in a bookstore to Woolf's essays on the joys of \"the common reader,\" from Schwartz's \"Ruined by Reading\" to Eco's \"How to Organize a Public Library.\" The book is illuminated by sixteen full-color paintings by Bascove, who here serves as editor, illustrator, and primum mobile. Produced to the highest standards, it is not only a gift for the literary, but also an inducement to the diffident.",
