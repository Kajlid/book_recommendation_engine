  "description": "Lydia McCarthy doesn't want any man in her life, much less an incorrigible old flirt like Morrison Fox. Widowed in her forties, she likes being single and independent. She has carefully created a life that suites her. She truly can't see any sane reason to risk her peaceful life for someone who says he wants to make wine out of her one minute and then embarrasses her with innuendo the next. Does it matter at her age that Morrie might be her last chance to find true love?",
