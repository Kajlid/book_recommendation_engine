  "description": "Kaitlyn Stone is the name on my birth certificate, but I couldn’t tell you who I really am. I’ve never had a family tree, or a house you’d call a home. And the small, fragile identity I somehow scraped together was taken in a moment that still steals my breath and leaves me shaking. When a box arrives on my doorstep, its contents hold the keys to my past. But that’s not all. A quaint little town beckons with new opportunities and perhaps even a home, if I want it. Waiting there is a man who walks through fire to save lives and protect his town. Kendrew Batten is a bona fide super hero—he’s even featured in the local fireman’s calendar as February, the month of lust. But behind his handsome façade are scars that can’t be seen, and a heart that beats for duty, not love.He might have been the hero to save me, too, if he didn’t destroy me first.",
