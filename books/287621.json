  "description": "Hazel Ross had no idea what she’d stepped into that night at my 18th birthday party. I’d waited years for the right moment, and there she was, forcing me to show my cards before it was time. Now she wasn’t only a pawn for our enemies, she had a target on her back.  I don’t regret it, even though I should. I could never regret making Hazel mine again. She gave me something real to fight for.  It was too late for her to back out now. She was one of us again. And she was about to find out what that meant.",
