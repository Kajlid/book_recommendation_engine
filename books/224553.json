When Kate arrives at Swan’s office in London she has a harrowing tale. James had been excited to work on the Rapier, a cutting edge top secret warplane dubbed by the press as the Silver Angel , being designed by Brinton Aviation. He talked about it with her father, until one day stopped speaking of it. Kate sensed something was wrong, but was not prepared for the call she received from James, saying to her that he has seen the spectres and now they are after him. Swan is puzzled, and starts to poke around. He learns that a US Government backed company has taken over part of Brinton Aviation to develop their own reconnaissance drone, the Python Hawk. The program is all hush hush, but why is there an armed guard outside their door? And what are the Spectres that James saw?It is only after further related incidents that Swan realises that he’s onto something big and before he’s done, will uncover a secret society that dates back to the time of George Washington and the Revolutionary War.On their agenda, is murder, espionage and a plan that could destroy the British aviation industry forever.
