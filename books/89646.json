  "title": "After Birth: Unconventional Writings from the Mommylands",
  "description": "Welcome to the Mommylands, where all mothers go in the years beyond the birthing suite. In this eclectic collection of essays, 2007 Pushcart Prize Special Mention honoree Jenny Fiore shares her hilarious and poignant experiences as a freshly minted mother in today’s world of how-to manuals and helicopter parenting. Like a would-be shaman with dried spit-up on her yoga pants, she navigates her children through everything from death to tampons. Follow her from droopy-boob-fixes to brushes with booger-eating, and from a parent’s fears in a terrorized world to her everyday brushes with the divine. Fiore is also the voice behind the Momplex Blog and is a 2014 featured storyteller in the popular Listen to Your Mother show, which has been described as the Vagina Monologues of Motherhood.",
