  "title": "Crime Interrupted: A Buck Taylor Novel",
  "description": "When a Mexican drug cartel sets up shop in a small mountain community, Agent Buck Taylor of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, and his team must put their lives on the line to protect this little piece of heaven.Buck, using his peripheral vision while keeping an eye on the two shooters, looked for cover. Not seeing any, he dropped to a crouch just as the first bullet flew over his head, pretty much where his chest had been just a nanosecond before. Now, instinct and training kicked in as Buck drew his pistol, firing just as the weapon cleared his holster. Then firing twice more as he brought the gun up to his shooting position. Two of his rounds found their mark, and he could see a big splash of red blossom across the chest of the shooter on the right. More bullets flew past him as he turned his sights on the other shooter. At that instant, he could hear a volley of explosions from behind him, and the other shooterâ€™s gun flew up in the air, and he smashed into the car behind him, slid down the door and sat there not moving. Buck spun around with his gun up and quickly saw Jess Gonzales standing about fifteen feet away, leaning over the hood of a car with her gun positioned in front of her.",
