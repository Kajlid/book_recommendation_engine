  "description": "When United States Marine Tyler Collins is injured in the line of duty and sent home, the first thing he does is to go see the girl he left behind. He wants peace and to escape from the memories of violence and war. Instead, what he finds might change his life forever.  Their time together was supposed to be a fun summer fling, but in the three years since Tyler's been gone, he's never far from Pam Foster's thoughts or heart, even though the last thing she did before he left was lie to him. She has to right the wrong, but can a man with such integrity and honor forgive her? Especially when she hasnâ€™t forgiven herself.  Is rekindled love enough, or will the secrets of the past ruin any hope of a future together?",
