  "description": "When Gabriel Clarke makes a deal with the Devil, he believes that his wish has finally been granted. He is given the ability to live forever. This deal, however, comes with three simple rules: don’t tell anyone, don’t get “killed,” and don’t fall in love. As time passes, Gabriel realizes that these rules are harder to follow than he thought, and the consequences are greater than he could have ever imagined.",
