  "description": "A cartoon book about Marx? Are you sure it's Karl, not Groucho? How can you summarize the work of Karl Marx in cartoons? It took Rius to do it. He's put it all the origins of Marxist philosophy, history, economics; of capital, labor, the class struggle, socialism. And there's a biography of \"Charlie\" Marx besides.Like the companion volumes in the series, Marx for Beginners is accurate, understandable, and very, very funny.",
