  "description": "Having been given a sneak peek into Joe’s world, it only seems right to Scott that he should return the favour. Perhaps he didn’t do so many interesting and kinky things with it, but he did have a life before he met Joe. It’s time to invite Joe in. For once, Scott’s going to be the one surrounded by the familiar, not Joe. But, does that mean the power balance is about to shift?Please Note: The stories in this series won't make any sense if you try to read them out of order or as stand alone stories!",
