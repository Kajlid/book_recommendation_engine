  "title": "Taking Work Home",
  "description": "It was just an office affair, with wonderful sex. Young scientist Mark Paulson liked older men, especially tall, dark, and very handsome men like his new boss. Self-made millionaire Steven Frost had no trouble finding sex, but what he needed was a friend who shared his interests; someone like the young assistant he'd just hired. What started as simply great sex between friends has become much, much more, and now they're engaged. Life's never that simple, of course. Other people have an interest in Steven's welfare and Steven's money, and they're not about to let the pretty little PA half his age take control of either. There's a reason why Steven was still single at the age of forty-four, and some of his family are intent on ensuring that Mark finds out about it the hard way. But Mark already knowsâ€”true love is about more than champagne and roses. Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable; anal play/intercourse, male/male sexual practices.",
