Melissa Checker tells the story of one such neighborhood, Hyde Park, in Augusta, Georgia, and the tenacious activism of its two hundred African American families. This community, at one time surrounded by nine polluting industries, is struggling to make their voices heard and their community safe again.Polluted Promises shows that even in the post-civil rights era, race and class are still key factors in determining the politics of pollution.",
