  "description": "The Wars of the Roses - a colourful age, full of fury and passion.Richard III - a shadowy, charismatic figure, portrayed by Shakespeare and by history as England's most malign, ruthless and infamous king...hacked to death on Bosworth Field in a just ending, unmourned.But history is written by the victors. Other realities reveal a different Richard; one who was loved and remembered in the North as their best ruler; a man who, good or evil, can never be forgotten.To Lady Katherine, he is a dark angel; to his faithful knight Raphael, a creature of light; to others, a complex and seductive mystery. Through their eyes we see Richard grow in a strange world - like ours yet unlike, where a Mother Goddess is still revered alongside a patriarchal God. As the struggle between old and new religions is mirrored in that between York and Lancaster, a chance meeting binds Katherine and Richard reluctantly together, and Raphael becomes haunted by nightmare visions of the future. From their youth, Freda Warrington traces their story along with that of England during one of the most fascinating times of its history.",
