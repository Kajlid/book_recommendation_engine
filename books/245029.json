  "description": "If John Grisham were a doctor, and The Firm a medical thriller, it would read like Blood Moon. When a ghastly incident makes Dr. Benjamin Snow the target of a vicious media blitz, he finds his once-promising career derailed. With no other prospects, he accepts a temporary position with a pediatric practice in an obscure town on the South Texas Border. But as he tries to restore his reputation, he becomes ensnared in a dark web of corruption involving the town’s remarkably lucrative hospital and the enigmatic boss of a local drug cartel. As one doctor after another is brutally murdered, Benjamin Snow is forced to battle demons from his past to discover his life’s true purpose and stay alive. “Palmieri (The Art of Forgetting, 2013) displays an impressive breadth of literary talents in this medical thriller … The author packs the story with all the right artfully crafted suspense, a morally complex protagonist, and a generous portion of action skillfully described.” (Kirkus Review)",
