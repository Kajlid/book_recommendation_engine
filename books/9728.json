  "description": "Good People is set in South Boston, the blue-collar neighborhood where Lindsay-Abaire himself grew up: Margie Walsh, let go from yet another job and facing eviction, decides to appeal to an old flame who has made good and left his Southie past behind. Lindsay-Abaire offers us both his \"quiet three-dimensional depth\" (\"Los Angeles Times\") and his carefully observed humor in this exploration of life in America when you're on your last dollar.",
