Before she can, she's captured by a group of criminally-minded werewolves who want to use her fae-abilities to commit crimes. Poisoned and left for dead, she used the last of her strength to cast the spell for her truemate, hoping that he would find her before it was too late.The last thing Logan Anderson wanted to do with his Saturday evening was watch over the young male wolves in his pack while they attended a dance in hopes of finding their mates. As the night wore on, he began to feel compelled to leave, and his instincts led him to race into the woods at the side of the highway. In the darkness of the woods, he finds a woman near death, who begs him to protect her. Now, nothing is more important than helping her get well. He'll deal with those who hurt her... later. This story contains a male werewolf with a dark past, a fairy who can't wait to find her truemate, and the betrayal that brings them together. Features hot werewolf-fairy loving, mythical creatures, full moon madness, and lots of neck biting.",
