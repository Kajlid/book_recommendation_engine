When the chance comes to steal a flying saucer, they aren't sure what to do with it, or even if they should steal it.Meeting the alien it belongs to only complicates matters as he tries to explain empathy to the two young women. When he volunteers to let them kidnap him along with his ship, their suspicions run high.It all ends in a scene of grisly violence as victims of their earlier thefts seek them out. Will Felix, the alien, aid his earthling friends?This is a fast paced, dialogue-heavy story where the jokes will fire into your brain like the bullets from a machine gun.",
