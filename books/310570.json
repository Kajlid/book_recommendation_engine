  "description": "I had no idea how much I wanted to take Purgatory's throne and rule Hell with the Seven Sinners. Too bad the most notorious devil would prefer to rule alone.If only that was the worst of it. My soulmate’s health declines, and I must kill him to guide his soul to Hell and help him take his throne. How can I murder the one who is responsible for my angel-kissed soul? I don’t have a choice, though. If I fail to do it, Hell will never rise, and someone needs to put Lucian in his place before he destroys everything. Kase, Dante, Micah, and Andre claim it needs to be me. I guess if I can break some angels, a devil shouldn’t be a problem, right? At least, that’s what I keep telling myself.As my tasks change and I have to rearrange my priorities, I need to find out what’s worth fighting for in life and if in the end, I can handle whatever Heaven and Hell throw at me. If I don’t, my soul will never belong to me again.",
