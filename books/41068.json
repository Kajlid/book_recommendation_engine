Suddenly she is top of the class in every subject. Feeling at odds with the world and being bullied by the 'coven' at school, Alice can't take much more. Only when she collapses and experiences a life-changing transformation does she learn why she is different. But with this new identity comes responsibility and Alice isn't convinced she can rise to the challenge. She just wants to be normal! The fact is she's anything but. Forgotten tales of a magical society are catapulted into the daily life of strong, memorable female characters who readers will grow to love. An intriguing blend of realism, suspense and fantasy, a must-read for girls of 7+.",
