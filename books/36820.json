  "title": "Saxon Math K Homeschool Teacher's Manual 1st Edition",
  "description": "Saxon math programs produce confident students who are not only able to correctly compute, but also to apply concepts to new situations. These materials gently develop concepts, and the practice of those concepts is extended over a considerable period of time. This is called \"incremental development and continual review.\" Material is introduced in easily understandable pieces (increments), allowing students to grasp one facet of a concept before the next one is introduced. Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. The teacher's manual employs a unique instructional format. It contains daily lessons, each of which includes pre-class preparation instructions, a list of materials, and the entire scripted lesson. Scripted lessons provide the parent with questioning strategies and language designed to help children understand mathematical concepts. Since the teacher's manual is nonconsumable, it can be used in successive years with the purchase of new student workbooks and meeting books. This first edition Teacher's Manual is for Grade K.",
