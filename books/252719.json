  "description": "Catch a Lucky Little Leprechaun™ on Saint Patrick’s Day…if you can! Every year at the beginning of March, Saint Patrick sends out his Lucky Little Leprechauns to spread laughter and luck throughout the world. You must always watch your leprechaun. If you don’t watch your leprechaun, he can vanish and reappear in different places. Your mischievous leprechaun might play tricks or turn things GREEN! Now you can follow the instructions on an ancient scroll found within a stone wall of a medieval Irish castle to help you build your own leprechaun trap to catch him. Your leprechaun trap can be a creative craft, a simple machine, or a more complex machine for a fun and educational STEM or STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) activity. On the night before Saint Patrick's Day, set the leprechaun trap. In the morning the children can look to see if they have caught a Lucky Little Leprechaun™. He will give gold coins or other surprises for his freedom on Saint Patrick’s Day! Fun, classic limericks along with unique, artistic illustrations tell the secrets to catch a leprechaun for a pot of gold, in hopes that children will create their own leprechaun traps at home and school. Celebrate the holiday by making this your own family tradition! Copyright © 2017 Lucky Little Leprechaun Brand LLC All rights reserved.
