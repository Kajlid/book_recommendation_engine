  "description": "Sylvie Fox writing as Aime Austin presents this Casey Cort legal thriller.Losing the most high profile case of her career ironically made Casey Cort a winner. Well-heeled clients now knock on her door, and Tom Brody, her rich ex-boyfriend, wants her back. But entry into the upper echelon comes at a price.The newest assistant United States attorney, Miles Siegel, has set his sights on nailing a public figure he believes to be corrupt: Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Eamon Brody. But Brody’s brothers, one the presiding judge of the county, the other the state attorney general, aren’t about to let that happen.When Casey gets retained by single mom Claire Henshaw, to wrest custody from her son’s irresponsible father, Casey handles her first case before the controversial judge . . . and learns something that will force her to make the hardest decision of her life. In this continuation of the Casey Cort series, Aime Austin—a former trial lawyer in Cleveland—weaves a tale that blends the best of today’s top legal thrillers with the heart and soul of women’s fiction, in a story ripped from real-world headlines.",
