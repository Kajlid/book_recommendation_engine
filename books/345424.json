  "description": "Ruby Lee has never downloaded an iTune, heard of Facebook, nor seen a video on YouTube. Raised in rural Kansas with her mom as her best friend, she's cozy and content. But everything changes when she and her mom move to Florida to care for her grandmother, Nana Dottie. Ruby quickly realizes she's definitely not in Kansas anymore, the kids in her huge school are totally different; but her new life is not so bad. What is bad is the fifteen-year-feud between Ruby's mother and grandmother that shows no signs of ending. Will Ruby have to choose between her mom and her new life, which isn't looking so awful after all?",
