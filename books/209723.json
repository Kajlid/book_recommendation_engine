  "description": "New school, new hockey season, new feelings...   Fresh ice...  First-year university student Braydon just wants to get a good start on his new hockey team. Cheered on by his fellow rookie, Curtis, he's pretty sure they can crush the competition.  Perfect passing...  For Curtis, a little fooling around with his teammate would be the perfect cherry on this sundae of sports success. Flirting with Braydon seems to be going well, and things only get hotter from there.  But the score's a mess...  When Curtis gets booted from the team for a couple of weeks for failing a test, and practically disappears into the library, Braydon has some feelings he's got to confront head on. Something's been betrayed here, but is it the team, or is it their burgeoning relationship? Can Braydon be honest enough with himself to tell Curtis his truth, or is this experiment in love going nowhere?  ***Try-Outs For Love is a standalone 20k word Gay College Romance with a HEA and no cliffhanger.***",
