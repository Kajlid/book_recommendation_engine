  "description": "Edited by acclaimed anthologist John Joseph Adams, WASTELANDS 2: MORE STORIES OF THE APOCALYPSE is the star-studded follow-up to the 2008 bestselling anthology Wastelands. The first book traced the 21st century resurgence of post-apocalyptic fiction, and while it is considered the definitive collection of its kind, dozens of new stories have been written since it was released. Five of the stories are from the 20th Century, but the remaining twenty-six were all published from the year 2000 onward, and nineteen of those originally appeared in the years since volume one came out.
