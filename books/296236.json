  "description": "Love was a lie. After living in darkness for so long, I’d despaired of ever being blessed by its grace. Until I met him. The man who showed me hatred doesn’t always win. The man who made me his boy. My Daddy, for now and forever…For Seth, life no longer means endless pain.Joy greets Seth everyday as his bond with Daddy deepens. They’ve built a world together that represents safety and comfort, and he knows that Daddy will keep him for always. Seth’s trust in him has also left him feeling strangely curious. To his surprise, he discovers he’s eager to explore new kinks.Malcolm now knows Seth was meant for him.The curse of being alone has lifted, and Malcolm is thankful every day that he once again has love in his life. But Seth is more than just another boy. Seth is the other part of Malcolm he hadn’t realized was missing. In addition, his boy is becoming more open and adventurous in all ways. How could he be more fortunate?Then unexpected tragedy strikes, and both men must face that forever sometimes means starting over…Note: Now and Forever is the final book in Malcolm and Seth's journey of love, healing and redemption in the Father series trilogy. The first two books, In the Name of the Father and For the Love of a Boy should be read prior to this one. However, you can be assured that none of the books in the Father series end on a cliffhanger and that this age gap, Daddy/boy series with lots of hurt/comfort contains a sweet forever after.Father Series reading order:In the Name of the FatherFor the Love of a BoyNow and Forever",
