  "description": "Renowned artist Pamela Silin-Palmer brings her stunning paintings of animals in clothes to the classic fairytale of Beauty and the Beast. The story is retold with a bunny rabbit as Beauty, and a bullterrier as the beast who is destined to become a handsome bunny prince. The text includes touches of humor to match the witty, beautiful paintings. Kids will love finding the funny froggy troubadour on each spread, who reacts melodramatically to each step of the story.",
