  "title": "Born of the Night: The Gothic Fantasy Artwork of Joseph Vargo",
  "description": "The powerful and captivating artwork of Joseph Vargo opens a gateway to the darkside and dares the viewer to venture within. While his work is dominated by an immense and memorable array of ominous and often nightmarish entities, his timeless images are also permeated with tremendous beauty, grace and symmetry. His art has achieved a resonance and popularity partially because of this ability to shed light on the inner demons that lurk in the shadows of the mind, while also not forgetting the sometimes majestic grandeur that resides there as well.       This extensive collection features over 100 of Vargo's most popular works of gothic fantasy, as well as some rare paintings, drawings and sketches published here for the first time. With an introduction and text by Joseph Iorillo, and additional commentaries by the artist, this volume offers comprehensive insights into Vargo's gothic domain. Enter the world of this modern master of the macabre. (184 pages; 100 color plates; 40 b/w insets )",
