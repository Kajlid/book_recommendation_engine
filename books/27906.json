  "title": "The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge: A Novel",
  "description": "A masterly new translation of one of the first great modernist novels In the only novel by one of the German language?s greatest poets, a young man named Malte Laurids Brigge lives in a cheap room in Paris while his belongings rot in storage. Every person he sees seems to carry their death with them, and with little but a library card to distinguish him from the city?s untouchables, he thinks of the deaths, and ghosts, of his aristocratic family, of which he is the sole living descendant. Suffused with passages of lyrical brilliance, Rilke?s semi-autobiographical novel is a moving and powerful coming-of-age story.",
