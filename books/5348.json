  "title": "When Love Keeps Growing: A midlife sharing love romance",
  "description": "After twenty-eight years of marriage and three children, I was finally able to be me...if only I knew who that was.“Brenda, were you a virgin on your wedding night?”That question, from one of my best friends, came out of nowhere. Well not really. It had been mounting all afternoon. Ever since my group of married female friends lusted over the hot, sexy stranger that came out of the store.If that was their response—to question my virginity or lack thereof—how would they have responded if they’d known that their object of attention had flirted with me in the store, filling my head with naughty thoughts? For so long I’d been just a mom and wife. Never someone that was considered attractive. And it felt good to be viewed that way. Although now that his actions were the cause of my current discomfort, I wasn’t sure it had been worth it.The answer to the question should have been simple, allowing me to move on without another thought. Instead it opened up a Pandora’s Box of self examination. One that threatened everything I knew.When all is said and done, would my marriage survive or would I be starting anew?They always say that the teenage years are the toughest, but no one talks about midlife.This midlife/later-in-life, sharing love book introduces the ladies of the Yarns & Brew Crew in Voyageur Bay. A group of ladies who discover that love and friendship doesn't just end because you've reached midlife.",
