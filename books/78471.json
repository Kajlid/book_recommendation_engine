  "description": "So begins the blue boy's quest for color. After travels though lands so full of yellow, packed with purple, riddled with nothing but red, Blue comes to a place different from the others. A big, beautiful city where every color lives in harmony-every color but blue that is! Feeling very much alone, Blue hides in his room until he has an idea, a blue idea that he shares with the city. Then Blue gathers his courage and steps out into a world more colorful than ever before.Reviews\"The metaphor's plainly doing the driving here, but it's clear enough to be understood by young readers too, and broad enough to be interpreted in either a personal or cultural way.\"-Kirkus Reviews\"The simple story will appeal to preschoolers, who will also be caught up by the colorful images, impressively outlined in black and drenched in pure color. Somewhat older children will catch the theme of inclusion that suffuses the book, making it a good choice to share with children, singly or in groups.\"-Booklist\"The youngster's change of palette colorfully reflects the story's underlying message. . . this allegorical offering will work well as an introduction to multicultural discussions as well as lessons on courage.\"-School Library Journal",
