  "description": "Five hundred years ago, these pink-hided devils descended to our world and created us from their own flesh and blood. They made us, they taught us, then left us to rule ourselves. So it came as a surprise today when, after keeping their politicians and soldiers here on a \"good-will\" mission, they decided to rain Hell upon us. I peek out of the window to see human soldiers banded together, kicking in doors and shooting down entire families. Our race could easily be destroyed right now. We have a military force, bordering on the laughable compared to the humans'.Our planet is the size of one of their continents, and most of our supplies come from them, anyway. Why are they attacking us? What did we do to deserve it? We ARE them! We share the same DNA --- We are the same! We speak the same language, have the same nature. Like them, we're greedy and ruthless, vengeful and hateful. We kill our own kind, lie to our people, and steal. We do drugs, and whore ourselves out. We're the same, the humans and us. The only differences are strictly physical . . .",
