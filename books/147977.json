  "description": "Rose Reynolds is a hardworking young woman with no time to play games. She can't afford to, being the supporter of family for her siblings, filling in for their less than desirable mother. When bills come due, she is left with only one option—more work. Rose goes to the men who own half the city—and carry the worst reputation. Men who have filled her fantasies for years and are not only the owners of both places she currently works, but the founding members of the Devil Savages MC. A Native American club notorious for their rough reputation, and their wild, wicked ways. Tony \"Tonto\" Walkingstick and Blake \"Sandman\" Tenkiller hope they haven't made a mistake when they hire Rose to work at the Devil Savages private holdings. Instead, they get a glance at how strong the little waitress is, and reevaluate their initial impressions of the delicate little rose. They've had their eye on her for awhile, but never thought she’d be open to their rough preferences and colorful sexual exploitations. The Devil Savages realize there is a traitor amongst them, giving the Diablos information on their clubs activities and helping the Latino gang bring drugs onto the Savages' turf. When all roads lead back to Rose, she leaves unable to put up with the accusations against her. Tonto and Sandman want answers, but what are they willing to sacrifice to receive them—a life of someone they love? Can a broken relationship with a rival gang be patched to combat against a common problem, the Diablos? And will two harden men who never apologize for how they live their lives be able to hold on to the Rose as the thorns cut deep?",
