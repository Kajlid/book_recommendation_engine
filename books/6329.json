  "description": "In just one night, the world is taken by fire.The story unfolds through the eyes of John Cotard, a science teacher who drugs his life away after a car accident turns him onto prescription painkillers. He allows first his job then his marriage to crumble, lost in a haze of chemicals.When a mysterious fire sweeps over the Earth, wiping out human-kind and leaving behind zombie-like burn victims, he carries on by breaking into houses and stealing drugs. For John the end of the world makes sense- it's the next logical step in his self-destruction.One-by-one he meets the few remaining survivors, including a woman starving herself thin, a combat-obsessed survivalist and a dangerous face from his past. As the group travels across the country seeking safety, they face not only the dangers of the dead world around them but of each other, discovering the strange connections they share along the way.A Chemical Fire is a minimalist, noir vision of the apocalypse.",
