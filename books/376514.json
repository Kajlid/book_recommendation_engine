  "description": "Proclaimed \"girl-pervert\" Oriana Small, AKA Ashley Blue, a veritable artist at heart, weaves through the intricacies of a decade in and out of the adult film industry, love, drugs, and her own firebrand of what it means to live ecstatically. From accolades to agony, GIRLVERT illuminates the surreality of a life lived beyond all comprehension.\"If Hemingway had been a porn star, this is how he would have written.\" -- The Nervous Breakdown \"Oriana Small has pushed herself to the outermost extremes of what the body and mind are capable of--all before turning thirty years old--and now she's made it an authentic read for the rest of us to marvel at, elevating the depravity and denial inherent in the pornographic arts to a singular literary experience.\" -- James Frey",
