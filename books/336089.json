  "description": "Thousands of women think Nate Jones is the biggest jerk in Vancouver.Can he prove them wrong? Nate Jones is on top of the world. He’s a hot prospect on the Vancouver Vice hockey team, and his love life is even hotter. Then—boom—disaster strikes. When a big group of women boo and jeer him during a game, he’s blindsided. The bad publicity leads to him being scratched from the team, and now he’s desperate to find out which ex-girlfriend started the “I Nate Hate” campaign and get her to stop. But he’s clueless about how to find his ex because there are so many. Enter Camille Salang, the closest thing he has to a female friend—only because she refuses to go out with him. Camille can’t stand Nate—he’s an egotistical bro who dates only Asian women. However she owes him for rescuing her from a messy breakup and an even messier job firing. And she does love solving mysteries.  As they work together to find the mystery woman, familiarity breeds…attraction. When Nate evolves from a clueless hockey hunk to someone sweeter and more enlightened, Camille can’t resist him. Nate’s always been into Camille, but now he appreciates her drive and intelligence too. Yet as they grow closer, will her reluctance to commit and his messy past pull them apart?",
