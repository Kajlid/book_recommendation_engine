  "description": "Pam Conrad's treasure of a book is lavishly reillustrated by the incomparable Brian Selznick for a new generation of readers.Pam Conrad takes us into the lives of six kids in six different decades and celebrates the commonality of all our lives. Originally published in 1995, Our House was hailed by critics in starred reviews as \"remarkable,\" \"rich,\" and \"comic and poignant.\" This 10th Anniversary Edition, re-illustrated with stirring and beautiful black-and-white drawings that evoke the intimacy of a family photo album, is a gorgeous tribute to story, place, and memory--and to Pam Conrad herself, a writer who deserves to be memorialized for all time.",
