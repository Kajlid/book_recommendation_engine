  "description": "\"Knowing which archetypes are stirring and strong in you will help you to come into your own third phase with additional consciousness,\" says Jean Shinoda Bolen. When Bolen's earlier book Goddesses in Everywoman was first published, it became a surprise bestseller and an unexpected star in the womens' spirituality movement. Bolen viewed archetypal patterns from a Jungian-feminist point of view as they affected the first two phases of a woman's life. Now she has devoted an entire book to the third phase of a woman's life, that of a \"green and juicy crone.\" Here again, the goddesses (Demeter, Artemis, Persephone etc,) as they would age are invoked as role models as well as some non-Western goddesses. All can add perspective and wisdom to any woman's Act III.",
