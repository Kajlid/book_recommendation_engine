  "description": "BlakeAt 43 I’m supposed to have everything figured out, and if you’d asked me six months ago I’d have said I did: head of my own tech company, beautiful fiancée, amazing future all planned out...life was perfect. Or, at least, I thought it was… So now I’m in New York after selling my company and fleeing San Jose, and for the first time in as long as I can remember I have nothing to fill my day—no meetings, no reports, no tests, no launch parties—and that’s how I manage to get hooked on Warpath 4 and somehow find myself sexting with a guy almost twenty years younger than me.\nSay what?\n\nOkay, here’s the thing: it didn’t start out dirty. It was all completely tame. Mild. Conversational. But then conversation turned to flirting, and flirting turned to dirty talk. And, well…let’s just say things escalated from there…But it’s just a bit of fun. Right? It’s not like anything would ever work in real life. I’m too old, he’s still closeted. And let’s not get started on how I’m supposedly straight. It’s just way too messy. Definitely best if we never actually meet each other...\nBut what if we already have?\n\nTurns out my virtual f*ck buddy is actually Owen Kelly, my best friend’s kid brother. Which leaves me pretty much screwed…Warning: This book is not appropriate for anyone who doesn’t like laughing, anyone who doesn’t like the word ‘daddy’, or anyone who doesn’t like when hot older guys and gorgeous younger guys have a hella lot of super-steamy sex.*Happily Ever After included",
