  "description": "When Licinius Murena, wealthy fish-farm owner, is found dead, not many tears are shed. Certainly not by Trebbio, who had just been booted out of his cottage by the landowner, nor by his widow, daugher, or farm manager. With friends like these, who needs enemies? Marcus Corvinus is the man to find out, with the help, of course, of his clever wife, Perilla.",
