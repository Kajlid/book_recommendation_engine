  "description": "Left reeling from the sudden death of his best friend, anxious diabetic Ollie Hedley jumps at the chance to renovate a derelict family home in the country where he plans to map out an uncertain future and grieve in peace for the young man he was unable to say goodbye to.While at first the solitude of rural England is a welcome change from the emotional chaos left behind, a chance encounter in the woods leads Ollie down a dark and twisted path into the occult, and the hunt for a fabled mushroom necessary for resurrection.But he is not alone in this pursuit, nor is unbalancing the natural order without consequence, and as the laws of nature are subverted, so is its ability to hold at bay a malevolent presence eager to return from beyond the grave.",
