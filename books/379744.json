  "description": "Painstakingly assembled and rigorously organized by that master of clutter, Matt Groening, this is not another mini-jumbo, hard-to-read, abbreviated compendium in that seemingly endless series of discourses on hell but a gargantuan historical extravaganza of ten years' worth of the everpopular \"Life in Hell \"RM\" \" cartoon strip, which still mysteriously appears weekly in several hundred newspapers tricoastally. Read the whole story of \"Life in Hell \"RM\" ,\" from early prehistory to late last night.",
