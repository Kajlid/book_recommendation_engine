  "description": "Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereWhen a young graduate returns home he is accompanied, much to his father and uncle's discomfort, by a strange friend \"who doesn't acknowledge any authorities, who doesn't accept a single principle on faith.\" Turgenev's masterpiece of generational conflict shocked Russian society when it was published in 1862 and continues today to seem as fresh and outspoken as it did to those who first encountered its nihilistic hero.",
