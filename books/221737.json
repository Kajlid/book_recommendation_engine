  "description": "Ash LaGoryen was the second son, born of nobility into the Ushum bloodline - House of the Dragon in the year 776. Every generation a child of royal blood was bestowed on the four elemental houses possessing “The Gift” - an ability to manipulate their chosen element. Ash was this child, and fire was his gift. However, possessing such a skill was a dangerous thing, and fate had other plans for the boy of only seven summers. Present day… Ash has spent the last twelve hundred years staying under the radar of the monster that ransacked his homelands as a child and later, after years of torture, turned him into the thing he hated most. A Vampire... Vastly different from the immortal that escaped the pits of Hell all those years ago, Ash has zero interest of returning to the station of his royal birth. But, when an ancient prophecy comes to light he finds himself dragged right back into the world of his ancestral bloodline. Complicating matters furthermore is the foretold \"Chosen One\", a beautiful mortal with the power to unite the realms. Ash is faced with an entirely new set of challenges as an impending war looms, and his affections for the young mortal grows. He will have to weigh his choices carefully as the demons of his past rise up to threaten his future.",
