  "description": "Jade Daniels is an outcast—half-Indian, with an abusive father, an absent mother—in Proofrock, a town that wants nothing to do with her. Now, one class away from dropping out of school, she is pouring her life and soul into her last assignment—a personal history of horror films.But Proofrock doesn’t rest easy; as blood spills in the lake and violent stories refuse to stay buried, Jade’s encyclopaedic knowledge of horror cinema begins to make sense of everything happening in the rapidly gentrifying rural lake town. And with the arrival of the Final Girl, Letha Mondragon, she’s convinced an irreversible sequence of events has been set into motion.As Jade dives deep into the history of her hometown—the missing tourists, the drowned church in Indian Lake, the tragic deaths at camp years ago—the town strives to keep her trapped. But outcasts still laugh and fight and cry and love fiercely, and even as the terror descends, and the blood flows, they never, ever give up.",
