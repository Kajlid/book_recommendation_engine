  "description": "White picket fence and a family? Not my style.     Killian  I live life on my own terms. That means alone. I like my solitude, and that's not going to change.    A woman like Lily Grant? Yeah, right. She talks too much and has too many opinions. And that kid of hers might be more of a smart-mouth than she is.    If I were a better man, I’d walk away. But once I taste her sweet lips, I want to possess every inch of her.    The woman is mine. Even if she doesn’t know it.   Lily  Killian Saint is wild and untamed, gruff and solitary, an arrogant loner from a family that people in West Bend say is no good.    I should know better. A man like Killian should have no part of my life, not with a kid to raise and a bakery to run.    Not even if the way his hands feel, rough against my skin, sets every part of my body on fire. Not even if the dirty things he whispers into my ear leave me so on edge I can’t think about anything but his lips on mine.     Everything about Killian is wrong.  The problem is, nothing has ever felt so right.   This is the LAST BOOK in the West Bend Saints Series! It can be read as a standalone but does refer to things that happen in earlier books, so it's best if read after the first three books. So...I've included copies of the first three books in the series with your copy of Killian for a limited time! This new release edition of Killian ALSO contains bonus epilogues for all of the other books in the series, so you can catch up with Elias and River, Silas and Tempest, and Luke and Autumn years later! Enjoy!",
