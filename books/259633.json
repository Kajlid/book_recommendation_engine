  "description": "Despite her city’s best efforts to accomplish otherwise, Meg Sawyer is still alive.And hey, when you’re a powerless, practically-homeless, seventeen-year-old civilian living in a city protected by superheroes, that’s no easy feat.For the last twelve years, Meg has had one goal: don’t become collateral damage in the near-daily battles of the aforementioned Supers. And for twelve years, she’s managed to do just that. Sure, her minimum-wage job at the local coffee shop isn’t great, she can’t even leave her apartment without loading herself up with protective gear, and her car was just hijacked to throw at a supervillain (again), but she’s not dead yet.But when Meg accidentally finds one of the city's perfect, invincible protectors murdered under extremely suspicious circumstances, her whole “innocent bystander” strategy falls apart. After being coerced by his determined girlfriend into a mission to help prevent the deaths of the remaining Supers, Meg finds herself forced into the foreground of a story she never wanted to be part of—one that challenges everything she thought she knew about both her city and herself.",
