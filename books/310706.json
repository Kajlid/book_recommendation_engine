  "description": "Martin R. Kennedy is a 68-year-old resident of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Before self-publishing this book, he has never publicly (and only privately to a select small group of individuals) indicated the truth regarding his arrest and incarceration in 1981. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree (History, Political Science) from Dalhousie University, Halifax in 1973 and then a Bachelor of Law Degree from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University, Toronto in 1976. He articled in Hamilton for a year, articled in Sydney for six months, starting practising law in Glace Bay in 1978 and then was disbarred and sent to prison on November 10, 1981. He took full blame for the trust account violations even though he now claims that his law partner was equally guilty. He was released in May 1982 and spent two months sleeping at a Halfway House in Sydney. He got married in December 1983 and then started working for Frontier College's Prison Literacy Initiative in early 1984 which had him bringing volunteers into the same prison that he had spent most of his incarceration. After a few years, he found a new career as an adult educator primarily helping Cape Bretoners acquire a GED Grade 12 Diploma. Most of the hundreds of students he helped were coal miners, steelworkers and cod fishers as well as their spouses. Their jobs had disappeared when their industries shut down. He is now retired and living in Sydney, NS.",
