And then there are her university friends Anthony and Cissy, who shared with Rachel her taste for literature and for the illicit.As he delves further into the mystery surrounding her death, Alex discovers in Rachel’s wake a tangled web of sex and jealousy, of would-be lovers and spiteful friends, of the poetry of Robert Browning, and of blackmail.
