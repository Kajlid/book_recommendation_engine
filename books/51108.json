  "title": "Doing Research That Matters: Shaping the Future of Management",
  "description": "In an era when the impact of management research and education could be argued is in decline, this book helps readers who want to have a real impact through their management practice and/or research and allows them to truly stand on the shoulders of giants. Doing Research That Matters reveals the ways that exceptional scholars and practitioners have sparked research, done it well, and spread it to others, in the process shaping the way we live and manage. It presents a collection of views and experiences of Nobel Laureates and top management gurus such as Robert Kaplan, Philip Kotler, Howard Gardner, Costas Markides, specifically related to the concepts of research excellence, research process and research outcome. These interviews reveal how their transformative research came about, what drives it, who drives it, how it happens, and why the people who do it feel so passionate about getting the word out. Taking the reader through their life stories it highlights common patterns in the way these people identify a problem worth researching, generate an outcome worth spreading, and generally conduct a worthy professional life.",
