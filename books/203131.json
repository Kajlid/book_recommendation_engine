On his way he . . .. . . flattens a stuffed otter (with a three-holed brick). . . messes with a dog called The Beast (who bites kids' willies off)and feeds biscuits to blue Louis (who puts the 'poo' into poodle).But however far or fast he goes, Danny can't outrun the memories that have chased him ever since his identical twin brother died. Where can Danny hide when every day his own face reminds him of Finn? And where can Danny go when everywhere the shadows of his past stretch to forever?The poignant story of a bereaved boy who embarks on an emotional journey - and ultimately finds his way home.",
