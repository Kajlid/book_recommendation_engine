  "description": "When Shannon Duffy came to Northbridge, Montana, to meet her newfound brother, she didn't expect to also find the man of her dreams—wearing a Santa suit no less! But though Dag McKendrick was irresistible, the newly disengaged Shannon had to at least try to resist him. She'd learned the dangers of falling fast….For Dag, courting Shannon was an obvious no-no—especially since the ex-pro hockey player had been burned in the romantic rink before. Would he cave in to the temptation of finding out if Shannon was naughty or nice—just in time for Christmas?",
