  "title": "Aaron's Energy: An Unexpected Journey Through Grief and the Afterlife With My Brilliant Son",
  "description": "Just days after the tragic loss of her son, Camille began to hear him speak to her from beyond the veil. Aaron told her in great detail about his transition to the afterlife and his experience on the other side. He taught her about how universal energy works, how to tap into the collective unconscious, and how to maintain her connection with him across dimensions. Camille kept a journal of Aaron's transcendent messages within which she wove an account of her own journey through profound grief. Aaron's Energy is the inspiring true story of Camille's unexpected journey through traumatic grief, her discovery of proof of the afterlife and spirit connection, her understanding of possibilities and the infinite nature of existence. In the Second Edition you will read an update of Camille's recent journal entry with Aaron's miraculous messages. Plus, Camille has added to her list of recommended reading.
