From proud Scottish stock, Blackthornes never lose. But, one by one, the seven sexy men in this family are about to risk everything when they fall for strong and beautiful women who test their mettle in life…and love.

Coming home to Maine finds him dealing with not only family surprises, but the shock of finding the caretaker’s daughter all grown up.  Piper’s dream is to design her own games, not play them. And Logan Blackthorne is the ultimate player. It’s one thing to hang out with Logan as a friend, but he’s far too charming for her own good.  Logan promises hours of pleasure, but should she settle for less than happily ever after?  Don't miss these sexy, heartwarming, emotion-filled books by bestselling authors: Barbara Freethy, Julia London, Lynn Raye Harris, Cristin Harber, Roxanne St. Claire, Christie Ridgway and Samantha Chase.",
