The irony is when blood’s shed, those who hold you dear come rushing in. It’s when Delilah came back, even when I thought she was done with me, even after I fucked everything up.She came to my bedside and it made me realize there’s a sliver of hope. If she didn’t care, she wouldn’t have come, and if all hope was gone, she wouldn’t have shown up.I destroyed what we had, but now I’m doing everything within my power to make it better than ever. I made a grave mistake when I lost her and now I’ll win her back, no matter what it takes.",
