  "description": "THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERHis television appearances have made millions of people believe in the afterlife—and in his ability to reach it. Now psychic medium John Edward's legion of fans can read his remarkable true story.With a fresh, honest—and at times even skeptical—approach, John discusses how he first discovered, then gradually developed, his psychic ability to foretell events and communicate with the deceased. He also provides accounts of his most compelling readings, how they helped heal the scars of grief and gave way to more fulfilling lives for the living—lives where loved ones never cease to love you, and never really die... In an all-new chapter, written especially for this paperback edition, he also empowers readers to tune in to their own psychic abilities—and read and understand signs of spiritual contact they may be experiencing every day without even knowing it.",
