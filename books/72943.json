  "title": "White Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812",
  "description": "The Englishmen in Jamestown who greeted the first \"twenty Negars\" who arrived in 1619 had already acquired an attitude toward the Negroâ€“from tradition, from religion, from earlier European contacts with Africans. And as the Englishman became the colonial, and then the revolutionary patriot, and finally the citizen of a new nation, seeking to find his identity in a new land, he created chattel slavery and was in turn confronted by it.White Over Black is Winthrop D. Jordan's masterly study of that process, from the 16th century through the early years of the Republic.",
