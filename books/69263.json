  "description": "(Book 2 of the Spy Games Series) Secret Agent Jake Anderson would rather have the measles than love his best friend's wife. So when she gives him a mission--to find his own woman to love--he knows just the woman to target. Exotic beauty Tia Richards--his new partner--is wild, twisted, and has no limits when it comes to adventure, in bed and out. She's perfect for him. Now he just has to get Tia and his heart to agree. Sexy spy Tia Richards has a problem, and the solution is Jake. The last time they hooked up, he left her bound and begging, unfulfilled, so close to finally getting the fireworks she deserves. But Jake loves his former partner, and Tia refuses to be second best. Will she listen to the ache in her heart that whispers she has what it takes to be first in Jake's life, or will lethal limits separate them forever? Explicit language, really hot sex that tries to be vanilla and goes kinky, role play, anal sex, very light BDSM, light bondage, horses, a card shark spy hero, and his twisted and wild heroine.",
