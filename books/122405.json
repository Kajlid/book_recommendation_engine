  "description": "Highway Zero is a road trip novel through the heart of America that follows Jack Tortis from north to south and east to west as he struggles to find direction in his life. Jack has moved on from his troubles in the old town, but now he stands at a crossroads with an uncertain vision of his future and an urge to leave behind everything he's ever known. Join Jack in the final years of the 20th century, where gas is 99 cents a gallon, cassette tapes have given way to CDs, and the internet is just warming up. From New York to Florida to California to Oregon, Jack circles the country searching for love and home. Along the way are friends and foes; brushes with rock stars of the past, present, and future; and events that change the course of history. Jack finds salvation in the most unexpected places, between music and highways, where the old road ends and the new one begins. But can he hold on to it?",
