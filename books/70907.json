  "description": "In the all-too-near future, Britain has been transformed into a number of gated cities run by the almighty Clearskies Corporation. Together with his trigger-happy ‘security’ team, Taylor patrols the streets of the crumbling Old-Town, making sure the desperate souls who mass on its edges do not infiltrate Hope City; the shining beacon of civilisation.  Taylor’s plans of quitting his job are put at risk, when on the eve of the wall’s completion, he is given information about The Shepherd, a revolutionary who may just have the power to bring down Hope City. Not since anarchist punk rocker Billy Nothing led the ill-fated Uprisings a decade before, have ClearSkies’ powers been challenged in this way. When events take a deadly turn, Taylor is forced into a brutal fight with the city he has sworn to defend.",
