Dynasty came roaring into my life, bringing four of the most incredibly delicious men I’ve ever laid my eyes on, but along with it came a life that I was never expecting. This world is filled with corruption. There are secrets and lies around every corner. My parents were murdered by the very men who vowed their loyalty, and now those same men are after me and will stop at nothing. But the tables have turned. Dynasty is all mine and I’m going to burn this f*cker down. Forgive me, father, for I am about to sin.",
