  "description": "When the bodies of murdered prostitutes start piling up in Whitechapel, Lilly knows it’s a fellow reaper gone rogue—a man the living call Jack the Ripper. *** Lilly Gordon delivers death to unsuspecting souls, Fate’s decisions carried out with a simple touch. But when a woman is found brutally slain before her destined time to die, Jack, Lilly’s ex-lover and a fellow reaper, is fingered for the crime, the evidence undeniable.  As the only one who’s been close to Jack, Lilly finds herself dragged into the investigation by Lord Mason Archer, chancellor to the reapers. But Lilly and Mason have a past of their own, and the long hours spent in Mason’s company leave Lilly falling for the difficult man who not only infuriates her, but makes her heart race. With the latest victim mutilated beyond recognition, it seems the killings cannot get any more heinous—but there’s more than one force at work, and Lilly soon realizes there are things far worse than death and dismemberment when dealing with Jack the Ripper.***Author’s Some scenes may not be appropriate for readers under the age of eighteen.***",
