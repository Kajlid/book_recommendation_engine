But his parents have finally reached their breaking point, and finally make good on their threats to send him to a summer camp for troubled youths. The facility they have chosen for him bears the name of Judgment Cove. There are immediate signs that something is deeply wrong with this place, the counsellors aren't who they seem. Steve has exhausted his options, making Judgment Cove his home for the summer......or longer. He soon realizes that this will be a summer like no other, as he will either become a man.......or remain a child forever.",
