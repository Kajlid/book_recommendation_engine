  "description": "She’s been running, but the truth is bent on finding her… Once a teenage runaway, Kate Jennings is finally getting her life together. She’s moving to picturesque Shaw Island, Washington to marry the man of her dreams—billionaire Chase Cole. Chase is everything she could want in a man. He’s handsome, smart, and funny…so what if he’s thirty years her senior? The only trouble is, the media won’t put to rest the disappearance of his previous wife. For Kate, the rumor that he might have had something to do with it pales in comparison to the dangerous past she’s on the run from. With Chase’s financial resources, she can stay safe. And alive. Josh Collins thought he was visiting Shaw Island for a relaxing weekend with friends. Until he met beautiful, mysterious Kate, the unlikely fiancée of a notorious billionaire who’s old enough to be her father. Josh feels drawn to protect this woman from the loveless marriage she’s careening toward and the deadly secret she’s refusing to reveal. Will real love find them in time to save her?
