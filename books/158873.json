  "description": "The Stratford Zoo looks like a normal zoo . . . until the gates shut at night. That's when the animals come out of their cages to stage elaborate performances of Shakespeare's greatest works. They might not be the most accomplished thespians, but they've got what heart. Also fangs, feathers, scales, and tails.Ian Lendler's hilarious tale of after-hours animal stagecraft is perfectly paired with the adorable, accessible artwork of Zack Giallongo ( Broxo , Ewoks ) in this side-splitting companion to their graphic novel The Stratford Zoo Midnight Revue Presents Macbeth .",
