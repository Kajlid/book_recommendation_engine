My name is Gabriel, I'm a (really mean) lawyer and I don't do relationships! (or do I?).The short, cute and sexy (did I really write this?) guy beside me is my little brother's best friend Shane, he owns a Harley, a little bar at the beach and claims to be a Top.You can ignore the prompt and surprise me :) but... please give them a \"real-live\" story and a HEA, no Comic or BDSMPhoto Description: Two men in rainbow body paint hang out behind the staging area for a fair.Author Note: The photo contributor gave a lovely prompt, but when I saw this picture, the word \"courage\" immediately popped into my head. The contributor graciously allowed the freedom to ignore her prompt. The boys and I are entirely grateful (though they have completely changed the story from what I initially envisioned).*note: the author has taken literary license to create a small beach town west of highway 75 in Southern California. For those who are interested in these things, it is approximately 15 miles north of the Mexican border and southwest of the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Read the story here or find it in Love Is Always Write: Volume 2.__________Genre: contemporaryTags: accountant, surfer, humorous, hurt/comfortWarnings: noneWords count: 11,070",
