  "title": "The Value of Your Soul: Rumi Verse for Life's Annoying Moments",
  "description": "A collection of 38 unique short tales, this little book of wisdom draws from American S.A. Snyder's memoir of living at a spiritual retreat in Scotland. The \"annoyances\" of the subtitle call forward those ages-old bugaboos of life--fear, resentment, disappointment, isolation, vulnerability, expectation, impatience, and control. With the help of select verses from the Persian poet Jalalad-Din Rumi, Snyder teases out some lessons learned from her funny experiences and offers a soupçon of homespun guidance for coping with people, situations, and life. Her witty style makes this an enjoyable, light read with a reminder not to take yourself too seriously. Using self-effacing humor, her tales recommend what she calls flipping the script; that is, learning how see your circumstances from a different perspective. If you enjoy chicken soup stories, you'll enjoy this thought-provoking guide to contentment. Think of it as lamb stew for the annoyed soul!",
