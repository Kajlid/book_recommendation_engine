  "description": "Kate  He killed my brother. He didn’t wield the rock that destroyed a promising life, the life of a future doctor, but he killed him just the same. He should have been there that night, should have protected Joshua from the wrath of bullies that he’d pulled down on us all. But he wasn’t. And Joshua died.  Now my dad expects me to sit back and let this man protect me? Was he insane? I don’t care how wonderful Gray Wolf Security is. I wasn’t about to give up my freedom, my privacy, and allow Donovan Pritchard to follow me around for the unforeseeable future. I don’t care how determined the criminal who is after me is. I can’t even remember what happened the night Joe died.  Besides, I’d rather take my chances than spend even a minute with Donovan.  Donovan  When I was assigned to protect a new client, I never imagined I’d be protecting the one person who told me to get out of her life and stay out…Kate Thompson. Seeing her took my breath away. She was even more beautiful than I remembered. Unfortunately, she was less than thrilled to learn that I’d be the one protecting her and that we’d be together twenty-four seven.  I’ve worked hard to move beyond the past…but sometimes the past catches up with you.   Note: This standalone novel includes three other novels for a limited time only! Enjoy :)",
