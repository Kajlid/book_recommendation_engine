  "description": "Tillie Winchester’s past is about to come back to haunt her, and what she sees as fun and games someone else sees as a recipe for murder. When a local woman is poisoned at Hemlock Cove’s senior center, Aunt Tillie is the prime suspect. Bay, Thistle and Clove don’t believe their great-aunt is guilty – although Thistle is fine if the police want to haul her away for a long weekend. Everyone in town is suspicious, but things spiral out of control when FBI Agent Landon Michaels’ boss believes he can’t be objective where his girlfriend’s family is concerned and sends another agent to lead the investigation. The new agent is gung-ho, headstrong and making witchy enemies at every turn. When the investigation turns to the past instead of the present, Aunt Tillie refuses to talk and a long held Hemlock Cove secret risks being exposed. Bodies start piling up as old grudges overlap with new clues and the Winchesters are caught in the crossfire. Bay is determined to clear her great-aunt’s name but even she has her doubts when the victim’s ghost points a finger … directly at Aunt Tillie. It’s all hands on deck for an explosive showdown that proves some secrets are best left buried. Bay just hopes she won’t end up buried, too.",
