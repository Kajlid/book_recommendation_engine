  "title": "The Art of Aging: Celebrating the Authentic Aging Self",
  "description": "In this beautiful book, painter and sculptor Alice and Richard Matzkin explore the experience of aging through their art, finding inspiration rather than despair. Both in their sixties, they use their paintings and sculptures and personal narrative to examine aspects of growing older-the progression of physical changes, sensuality and relationships, aging parents, spirituality, and death. They feature well-known people such as feminist Betty Friedan and potter Beatrice Wood, as well as friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. They both explore the older nude body in some of their work. Drawing on their own experiences and the wisdom of older mentors, they demonstrate that the elder years can be a time of growth and wisdom rather than stagnation and loss. This wonderfully illustrated book is a feast for the eyes as well as nurturing to the spirit, and is a useful aid to learning the art of aging. It leads the Barbarato a greater appreciation of the miracle and blessing of life.",
