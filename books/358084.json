  "description": "Jack has more problems than you can shake a wand at. He’s the son of the usurper to the throne, an untrained wizard with a powerful gift,a gay dragon rider, and a cryptozoologist in a world full of mythical creatures. Now he’s going to school where one of his teachers is a biker turned dragonrider. Men are treated as second-class citizens in Honalee, so this is his one chance to be something other than a stud wizard for the local sorceresses. If that wasn’t bad enough, some mythical object called the Dragon’s Stone has been stolen. How much do they expect of a reluctant heir to the throne, anyway?",
