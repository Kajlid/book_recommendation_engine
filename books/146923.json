  "title": "Jared, the Subway Guy: Winning Through Losing: 13 Lessons for Turning Your Life Around",
  "description": "Jared Fogel was, is, and will continue to be America's weight loss icon. As an obese college student in Indiana he lost 245 pounds on a self-devised diet of Subway sandwiches. Since 2000, he has appeared thousands of times on national television as the spokesperson for Subway's Eat healthy Platform; and he's slated to continue in this role indefinitely. In fact, Subway worried that he might be getting overexposed and decided to discontinue him. Sales fell off. Jared was quickly rehired. But to keep him from being overexposed, Subway's program runs Jared for six or eight weeks every three months. His book is not so much a diet book (his diet was pretty simple to grasp - eat Subway sandwiches) but it's more a motivational, self-help book which offers hope to people who want to change their lives. Jared has also appeared on Oprah, Larry King Live, the Today Show, Good Morning America, the Jane Pauly Show and has made hundreds of speaking appearances and public appearances at sports and civic events.
