  "description": "D.M. Davis' COWBOY is an angsty, heart twisting, second chance, contemporary, sports romance and Book Four in the Black Ops MMA series. I was young and naïve when I met my other half.I was a good guy, full of hopes and dreams.Falling head over heels for my Songbird.She stole my breath.Rocked my world. Then she trampled my heart the day she disappeared, ghosted me.Her absence haunted me, tainted my future, destroyed my dreams, left me fighting for steady ground. Years later, she shows up where I least expect, belonging to those who can make or break my MMA career, or worse, get me disowned from my family by choice.She acts like I don’t exist, like she doesn’t know me, like she doesn’t remember the love we shared.I’m good with that.I have every intention of leaving her in my past where she belongs.And yet… I can’t stop the wanting, the craving, the claiming. Nothing could have prepared me for the truth of why she left, what happened afterwards, or the shattering journey that brought her back to me. Some secrets are worse than the perceived truth. The Black Ops MMA books are integrated standalones with subplots that carry through from book 1 to book 4. For maximum enjoyment, I suggest the Black Ops MMA Series be read in order to fully experience the world and the characters who inhabit it, beginning with NO MERCY. Intended for mature audiences. Some scenes may contain triggers. Content warning: sexual assault, stalking Black Ops MMA Series:NO MERCY ~ ROWDY ~ CAPTAIN ~ COWBOY ~ MUSTANG",
