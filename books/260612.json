  "description": "From award-winning author LJ Evans comes an emotionally charged, standalone romance between a sexy bassist and a small-town nurse who can’t walk away from each other when the chips fall down…\n“I always saw relationships as a burden instead of a gift...until Wynn showed me the way.”\nLonnie Brennan may be the comic relief in the chart-topping band, Watery Reflection, but he’s also the one silently protecting it from behind the scenes. Which is how he ended up living in Tennessee and falling in love… with the Southern charm and sweet-tea lifestyle of the small town. When a sexy, redhead enters into the mix, he isn’t sure he’ll ever escape again.Wynn Nichols has always been the stable friend guiding the way for others until her world crumbles, and she slinks home with disappointment and failure following her. With divorce papers in hand, she isn't looking to start a new relationship. Certainly not one with a sexy musician who treats life like a series of jokes.When Lonnie finds himself suddenly in charge of his tiny niece, Wynn swoops in to help, and they form an unlikely friendship that gets them through the darkest days of their lives.But can they risk the relationship they need for a chance at a very unlikely happily ever after?Inspired by Chris Janson’s “Drunk Girl,” My Life as a Mixtape is the fourth heart-searing, slow-burn standalone in the My Life as an Album series. If you like unforgettable connections, emotional journeys, and beautiful prose, then you just might adore this series.",
