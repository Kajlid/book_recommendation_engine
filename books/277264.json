  "description": "Part one of the finale. Too large of a page count to be one book. Keep in mind at the end of this book, you're at the middle of the storyline for one book that ended up being 1200 pages in print. War has finally come to Faery.Everything I thought I knew was wrong.Truths have become lies, and they have all begun to unravel around us. I can no longer trust my instincts. Ryder has changed, but so have I. We’re evolving, but into what? I’m not sure, but I do know that it isn’t what I wanted to become. I don’t know if I will survive this war.One of us is holding back, while the other continually moves forward toward the mages who endlessly slaughter the fae.I think it’s me. I think I have to lose it all, to gain what is missing inside of me. How do you eradicate self, when self is what you’ve been fighting for?Throw everything you think you know about the fae away. Nothing is sacred, and no one is safe from the monsters we’re about to become.",
