  "title": "Walking Through the Valley of the Shadow of Death",
  "description": "Walking through the Valley of the Shadow of Death is a book about one of the most uncomfortable subjects that people will face - death. Written from a Christian perspective, it relates to the anatomy of grief, bereavement and what people around those who have tasted the death of a loved one may be looking for from their friends. Delving into what the Bible says about grief and what friends of survivors can do to effectively minister to those grieving, the book's practical guidelines will help both grievers and those trying to help their bereaved friends and family overcome their loss. Kimberly Rose Carolan resides in Washington with her husband, Joseph. She and Joseph are involved at their church and they volunteer at the Salvation Army. When not writing, Kimberly enjoys playing music and being outdoors in the Pacific Northwest hiking, camping, kayaking, and gardening.",
