  "description": "I came to this mountain to move on. I’ve been through enough, and so have my six kids. They deserve a Christmas with new memories. When I find a rental house that’s big enough for my brood, that comes with a live in cook, it feels too good to be true. It’s an undertaking, but the owner Virginia doesn’t flinch. She’s a beautiful woman who has seen hard times. With a gentle ease about her and a depth I long to reach — I know I’ve found more than my equal. I’ve found my Christmas miracle. But when my oldest daughter takes her teenage rebellion one step too far, it threatens an avalanche on this mountain. Dear Reader, No need to put on your mittens and parka. We’re not hiking up the snow-capped peaks this Christmas. Just open that kindle and let the newest man on Miracle Mountain decide if you’ve been naughty or nice. xo, frankie",
