  "description": "JULIUS V ~ Warrior Pope is an action adventure and a romantic comedy set ever so slightly in the future. It pits the Vatican’s popular, fun loving and charismatic “warrior pope” against the Vatican’s greatest enemy.  After Pope Julius V’s prized possession is stolen, he is forced to abandon his carefree papal existence. With an unlikely group of ex-Vatican Guards, Julius takes on the demented criminal mastermind and his group of martial artist nuns, and chases them across countries and oceans. But the closer Julius gets to recovering his treasure, the closer he gets to his past. Either can unravel everything, including the papacy and the Catholic Church. Failure could mean creating earth in heaven, which may be worse than hell on earth.",
