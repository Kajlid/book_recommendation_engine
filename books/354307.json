  "description": "The Secret Lives of Children, Picano's memoir of suburban 1950s childhood, forever altered how we remember childhood and how we think of it today. So scandalous at the time that the book's first shipment to Great Britain was seized and burned on the London docks, Ambidextrous has become a much-prized classic.",
