The only thing is, he's dead set against being a father—and Isi Lopez has twin four-year-old boys. When he finds himself roped into babysitting for them, life starts getting complicated! Kids or no, Conway soon discovers he and Isi make a great couple. And hanging around with her kids isn't so bad—that is, until they beg him to be their new daddy.
