  "description": "Eva-Marie Kröller's comprehensive introduction to major writers, genres and topics in Canadian literature takes into consideration relevant social, political and economic developments. Broad surveys of fiction, drama, and poetry are complemented by chapters on Aboriginal writing, francophone writing, autobiography, literary criticism, writing by women, and the emergence of urban writing in a country traditionally defined by its regions. Nature-writing, exploration- and travel-writing, and short fiction are also covered. Eva-Marie Kroller is Professor at University of British Columbia and editor of the journal Canadian Literature. Her previous books include Canadian Travellers in Europe, 1851-1900 (UBC Press, 1987), George Bowering (Talonbooks, 1992) and Pacific Encounters (with A. Smith, J. Mostow, R. Kramer) (Institute of Asian Research, UBC, 1997).",
