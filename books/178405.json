  "title": "Swinging in Paradise: The Story of Jazz in Montreal, 2nd Edition",
  "description": "For almost half a century, more jazz was made in Montreal than anywhere else in Canada. Swinging in Paradise tells the story of jazz and nightlife in Montreal - from the arrival of the first black musicians from the United States; through the heady days of swing, show biz, big bands, and bebop; to the tumultuous 1960s and Montreal's unique experiments in free jazz and fusion.This is more than music history; it's a rich social history of Montreal after dark.John Gilmore spent seven years tracking down veterans of Montreal's jazz community and weaving their memories into this fascinating history. He reveals why musicians from all over North America migrated to Montreal, and how they lived, worked, and created in the midst of organized crime, corruption, union battles, racism, and a nightclub industry hungry for music. \"A hallelujah of a book\" (Books in Canada). \"A masterly performance\" (Jazz Journal, UK). Here, at last, is the long-awaited reprint of the classic first edition, with a new afterword by the author.Illustrated with more than 70 vintage photographs.",
