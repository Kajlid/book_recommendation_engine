  "description": "If you want to get to Heaven, you’ve got to raise a little Hell…Callie Penrose is struggling to find her special purpose in life. Rather than allying with any of the powerful supernatural groups begging to sign her up—the Vatican, the vampires, the shifters, or the Armies of both Heaven and Hell—Callie has been picking fights with all of them.But when she’s abducted by a Host of Angels, and a Greater Demon begins hunting her through the daytime streets of Kansas City, Callie learns that her past has come back to haunt her.Thanks to her actions in recent months, Solomon’s Temple has been opened, and the estate sale is on a first-come, first-served basis.To win her birthright, Callie is going to need Cain’s help. Even then, she’s going to have to cut some corners, cross some lines, to take a bite out of an apple…But they say every Saint was once a Sinner…",
