  "description": "John Constantine meets Chow Yun-Fat in this near-future occult thriller. Detective Inspector CHen is the Singapore Three police department’s snake agent—that is—the detective in charge of supernatural and mystical investigations.Chen has several problems: In addition to colleagues who don’t trust him and his mystical ways, a patron goddess whom he has offended, and a demonic wife who’s tired of staying home alone, he’s been paired with one of Hell’s own vice officers, Seneschal Zhu Irzh, to investigate the illegal trade in souls.Political pressures both Earthly and otherworldly seek to block their investigations at every turn. As a plot involving both Singapore Three’s industrial elite and Hell’s own Ministry of Epidemics is revealed, it becomes apparent that the stakes are higher than anyone had previously suspected.Liz Williams delivers the first of a series of near-future occult thrillers that feature an audaciously textured mix of magic and futuristic technology in a compelling and iconic Far Eastern setting.",
