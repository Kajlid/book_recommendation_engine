She dreams about a magical world, where winged creatures sculpt with light, dogs talk, and Scarlet is the guest of honor at a joyous party under a mighty oak tree.

When three beautiful, silver-voiced men break down the front door one night, Dakota leads the Hopewells in their escape—right into the world of Scarlet’s dreams. Scarlet and the Keepers of Light is a fantasy for all ages about the adventure of growing up, the power of the word, and finding the magic within.",
