  "description": "Commander Iskar Gar-Kurai isn't impressed by humans or their backwater planet. If he had his way, he'd be working closer to home, on a planet where it wasn't so infernally hot...  But orders are orders, especially when they come from the very top.  If he's going to be on Earth for the long term, Iskar needs to learn more about its strange inhabitants. That's why he's reluctantly agreed to hit the streets of Darkside. It's an observational visit, nothing more.  So why has this blue-haired temptress targeted him of all people, and what is he going to do about it?  Criminals must be punished, and Iskar has always done things by the book.  A Darkside Interlude is a novella set after the Dark Planet Warriors series. It can be read as a standalone, but it'll probably make more sense if you read the original series first.",
