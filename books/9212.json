  "description": "The interior of the Beardsley Manor was a shambles, clothes strewn everywhere, shards of glass scattered along the floor and passageways. There were no busted windows, so it was speculated that the debris possibly came from bottles or wineglasses. Elizabeth Beardsley's body, a lifeless mangled heap lay on the floor of the study. There had been a struggle all right, but it seemed one-sided. Struck on the head from behind with an axe, which lay across the room where it had been tossed; she lay face down, her right arm flung out toward the fireplace and the poker was just out of reach. Joseph Beardsley, of course, was nowhere to be found, and no one cared to look. Perhaps they were too fearful of their own safety to confront the man they felt did it. Where had he gone, no one knew or cared to know. Just so long as he never crossed through that town again. Something happened at the Beardsley Manor in the 1940's. Something that changed the house and the town of Crooked Creek. Betty Pearson was about to find out, 40 years later, uncovering a secret that would change her life forever. If you've ever visited a haunted house before, this is one you won't want to miss!",
