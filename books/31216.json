As of August 2009, nine novels in the series have been published leaving only the final volume forthcoming. Erikson's series is complex with a wide scope, and presents the narratives of a large cast of characters. In 2005, Esslemont began publishing his own series of five novels set in the same world, beginning with Night of Knives. Although Esslemont's books are published under a different series title - Novels of the Malazan Empire - Esslemont and Erikson collaborated on the storyline for the entire fifteen-book project and Esslemont's novels are considered as canonical and integral to the series as Erikson's own.",
