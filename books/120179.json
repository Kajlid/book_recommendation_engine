  "description": "When Trudy goes to her estranged brother's wedding, deep in the rural English countryside, she looks forward to making up with him, catching up and closing the distance that has grown between them since he moved away from the US. The last thing she expects is one of those a handsome stranger, their eyes meeting across a crowded room... a tempting, but all too dangerous stranger. Her brother is marrying into the wealthy aristocracy, but this man in his rumpled tuxedo and days-old stubble doesn't seem to fit. Determined to find out more, Trudy discovers his identity, and that there are dark secrets that bind him to her brother; she also learns that he's the kind of man who always gets what he wants, and what he wants right now is Trudy. “Is there anything you don’t have?” I asked softly. He shrugged, spread his hands wide. “We have everything,” he said, simply. “We’re a wealthy family.”",
