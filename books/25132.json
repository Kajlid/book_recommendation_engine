  "description": "When Dave's boss and lover sends him to build bookcases for an old friend, Dave gets a lot more than he expected. Mr. Chase is lean and sharp and clearly thinks Dave is something he's not -- submissive. After the initial confusion is cleared away, though, Dave finds himself intrigued by this intelligent man and Mr. Chaseâ€™s live-in partner, Wyatt.Dave's partner, Archie, is intrigued as well, and wants nothing but happiness for Dave and himself. If happy means having two open relationships expand to mix and mingle into one big poly, mostly kinky partner swap, that's all right by him. Just how entangled can the four of them become, while still keeping the essentials clear and special?Originally released as the Chaser series Used, Rare and Limited Editions.",
