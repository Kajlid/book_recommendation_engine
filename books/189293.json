  "description": "Bear Apparent (Stone Claw Clan, #1)  Dahlia Pinski has been chasing monsters since she was rescued by one as a little girl. Bigfoot blogger by day, creature catcher by night, she always seems to be one step behind the beasts of legend she knows exists. Following the recent report of a monster sighting in the Washakie Woods of Wyoming, she dashes off to prove she isn't crazy. But she gets more than she bargained for when she finds herself in the middle of a fight between two giant, monstrous bears.  When a rival challenges Garrett, heir to the Stone Claw clan, for his territory, Garrett must decide to stay and fight or run. Without the strength a mating-bond provides, Garrett knows he is no match for the stronger, mated bear, and is forced to flee his home. But when a nosy female gets tangled in their dispute, he stands up to the bear, and is left seriously injured.  Dahlia takes Garrett home, and nurses him back to health, sure he can provide the answers she's been looking forâ€”if she can keep her attention on anything other than the naked man on her couch. After witnessing his father suffer through his mother's death, Garrett promised himself he'd never fall in love. But his attraction to the deliciously curvy, and endlessly curious Dahlia is too tempting to ignore. Garrett must decide if he is willing to risk his heart for happiness. Having been reunited with his clan, Garrett is willing to leave his home behind, and make a new one with Dahlia... but his rival is a ruthless killer that wants to make an example out of Garrett who he is willing to exploit their people's laws to force Garrett into a duel. Can Garrett rise up to protect his clan and Dahlia, or will she share his fate?  ****This book includes material that is appropriate for an adult audience only!****",
