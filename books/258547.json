  "description": "HOPEThe cycle of life; of livesThe cycle of truths; of liesThe cycle of greed; the cycle of needThe cycle of living, of dying and rottingMistakes repeated; lessons forgottenHope is a constant,A thread running throughYou can claw for its promise,Claw till you’re oldBut only the special ones keep to its hold***Pete Harding isn’t yet thirty, but he’s made a name for himself in the Scottish Borders. Pete has worked hard, his mission to build cabins around the loch – his loch – his skills as a builder, a planner, a master of all trades, second to none.Working so hard, and single-handedly, has left Pete ripped to the nines, a body any girl would pant for. But Pete isn’t interested in girls or sex of any kind. Pete is asexual and proud of it. That is until he uncovers the old pit and its secrets whisper sweet nothings in his ear.Waking from a profound dream and experiencing a sexual epiphany of sorts, he begins to see the female residents of his cabins in a whole new inviting light, and a fresh mission presents itself.Pete can’t fail; never has and never will, and now with fire in his belly and need in his balls, Pete sets off on his greatest conquest yet.He’ll take them all, every last one of them – or maybe not everyone – because some have hope.HOPE. . . because that’s all there ever is.",
