  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling Author Joy Nash\nWhen a girl with no family meets a guy with too much... \nFor Tori Morgan, family's a blessing the universe hasn't sent her way. Her parents are long gone, and her chance of having a baby is slipping away. For Nick Santangelo, family's more like a curse. His nonna is a closet kleptomaniac, his mom's a menopausal time bomb, and his motherless daughter is headed for serious boy trouble. But summer on the Jersey shore can be an enchanted season, when love can bring together the most unlikely prospects. A hard-headed contractor and a lonely reader of Tarot cards? All it takes is... A Little Light Magic",
