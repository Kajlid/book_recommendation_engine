  "description": "The Irony of American History is Reinhold Niebuhr's greatest work as a public intellectual. Deeply involved in the politics of the early Cold War period, Niebuhr wrote the book to highlight the challenges and opportunities of American democracy. He argues that the U.S. does not possess any original and special virtue as a nation, that its policies derive from its perceived national interests rather than moral convictions. Americaâ€™s real achievement, Niebuhr believes, derives from its capacity for self-correction, for realizing that its democratic ideals often provide the best path to pursue its self-interests.",
