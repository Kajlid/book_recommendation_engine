  "title": "Do Over",
  "description": "Have you ever dreamed of the chance to go back in time and change the decisions of the past? Have you ever wondered what would happen if you’d done one little thing differently? Davey Jones drifted through life, never achieving anything major, until he took part in a mad experiment. Like most of us, Davey Jones loved science fiction, so he should have known better than to trust a mad scientist…now he must live his own life over again, but should he, or can he, change anything?(NOTE: This story is not currently available. The author states he intends to to revise it and release it as an ebook).",
