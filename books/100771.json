  "title": "The Berkeley Square Affair",
  "description": "November-December 1817 An alternate version of Hamlet may hold more than literary secrets…  Ensconced in the comfort of their elegant home in Berkeley Square, Malcolm and Suzanne Rannoch have seemingly escaped the perilous life of intrigue that they led during the Napoleonic Wars. Malcolm, once an intelligence agent, is now a member of Parliament, and Suzanne is one of the city's most sought-after hostesses. But when playwright Simon Tanner climbs through their library window late one night, rain-soaked and bloody, the Rannochs are lured back into the dangerous world they thought they had left behind…  Simon had in his possession a manuscript that may be a lost version of Hamlet, and the thieves who attacked him were prepared to kill for it. But the Rannochs suspect there's more at stake than a literary gem. The script may conceal the identity of a Bonapartist spy—along with secrets that could force Malcolm and Suzanne to abandon their newfound peace and confront their own tortured past. . .",
