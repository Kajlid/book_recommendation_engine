  "description": "Everything with Jade began at Club Temptation, so it makes sense fate would bring us back together here. She looks so incredibly beautiful it takes my breath. So insanely sexy. And from the look in her eyes…she still hates me. I thought leaving Jade behind six years ago was my only option. I didn’t want to admit how much she meant to me, and I definitely didn’t want to face her brother, my best friend—the man who would have killed me if he found out I was sleeping with his little sister. But leaving was the worst mistake I ever made. Yet I’ve returned, and behind all the hatred she claims to have for me, I can see the same desire she had all those years ago. And I plan to use that to my advantage. She has no idea what I have in store—the ways I plan to tempt her. Oh, this is going to be fun.",
