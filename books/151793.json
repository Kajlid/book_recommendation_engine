  "description": "You've seen the glamorous depictions of Wall Street life: penthouse apartments, champagne, and parties galore. But the journey to success in the infamous financial district isn't all it's cracked up to be, and Jung-Sook Camilla Lee knows that better than most.From her first junior position on the trading floor, Lee learns that getting ahead means dealing with greedy colleagues, treacherous bosses, and more-in an ultra-competitive \"macho\" industry that already considers her an underdog by virtue of being a woman.Through instinct, hard work, and sheer tenacity, she eventually finds herself achieving her dream by rising to the top of her field. But when the high cost of success begins to take a toll on her physical health, Lee turns to the Christian faith and makes an important choice that could change her life for the better-if she can overcome her fear of uncertainty and redefine personal success.When first published in Asia, \"Fire & Ice\" became an instant bestseller. Inspiring and candidly honest, this personal memoir is the true story of a woman who gave up at nothing to achieve her dreams, and the unexpected spiritual renewal that later led her to build a new life halfway across the world.",
