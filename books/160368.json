  "description": "When would be the right time to come clean about a secret you've kept from everyone you love? At your best friend's wedding? In your first best seller? Or when the daughter you privately gave up for adoption finds you, and wants to meet \"mom and dad\"?Grace Parker’s first novel is strongly based on her own complicated romance with Ben Turner, whom she hasn’t seen since he walked out on her – for the second time – 13 years ago. When he discovers her book and realizes that the characters and story are their real-life romance, he sets out to find her, hoping to right a wrong. He learns through her novel a few secrets Grace had kept from him, but nothing could prepare him for the truth that was too big for fiction. Now Ben and Grace must decide if they will forgive one another, and if having a past together is enough to give their future another chance.Minus Me and You is a love story – twenty years in the making – about honesty, forgiveness, and third chances.",
