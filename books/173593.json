  "description": "Luci Cunningham had a heart-wrenching affair with her high school chemistry teacher. Beautiful Torment told the story, ending with Luci, now a college senior home on winter break, bringing her sister a paper she forgot at home. Walking through the doors of her old high school is jarring, especially now that she's only finally starting to overcome her broken heart. The last thing she told Josh Harrington was to never speak to her again, so when she runs into him in the hallway, she's caught off guard. Sparks fly, but it's probably just old feelings resurfacing. Luci is still furious with his past lies and deceit, but he surprisingly asks her out on a date - the one thing she wanted throughout her senior year of high school. She's someone new, and the pain Josh inflicted remains in the forefront of her mind. However, Mr. Harrington doesn't take no for an answer, and we soon learn he is dead set on winning her back, no matter the cost. But, can Luci forgive? Find out what happens in Beautiful Dream, which picks up the day after Beautiful Torment ends. This book is part of a series, therefore, you should read Beautiful Torment (which is the first book), prior to reading this one. Warning: This book contains explicit language, sex scenes, and is intended for ages 18 and up.",
