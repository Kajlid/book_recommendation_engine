  "description": "Voices of Rondo: Oral Histories of Saint Paul's Historic Black Community includes thirty-three individual short stories that share the varied aspects of the Black culture in this dynamic, diverse community. Voices of Rondo encapsulates the experience of Blacks living in northern cities throughout the United States. These stories celebrate the community and the culture of those who lived and worked in the vibrant Rondo neighborhood during the first half of the Twentieth Century. We glimpse the challenges of racism and poverty, and share the victories of a community that educated its children to become strong, to find personal pride, and to become the next generation of leaders in Saint Paul and beyond.",
