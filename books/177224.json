  "title": "In the Fury with the Footman",
  "description": "What, exactly, is a footman to do when he glances through an open door and sees the daughter of the Earl of Astonbury naked, pleasuring herself? Stephen Alistair chooses the path of gentlemanly retreat, but it's too late. The Lady Isobel has seen him. There's no denying the fire she ignites within his body, but he rebuffs her flirtations. He's sworn he will never again be some rich woman's plaything.Lady Isobel Rochester, unwed and unhappy, languishes in boredom and loneliness at her family's estate in Northumberland. A few youthful indiscretions have edged her out of most of high society, at least as far as marriage is concerned, and the only suitable candidate her father has found who is willing to overlook her reputation is a man she despises. Isobel amuses herself by flirting with utterly unsuitable men, most recently the handsome new footman. She sees the burning desire in his eyes when he catches her pleasuring herself, but, shockingly, he refuses her invitation to come to her bed.When Stephen and Isobel are stranded in a storm, the barriers between mistress and servant begin to break down. Alone, isolated from the strictures of the society in which they live, Stephen and Isobel are free to cast off their inhibitions and be who they truly want to be. Need takes hold, and in the fury of the storm, they find exquisite passion in one another's arms. But what will happen when the light of day breaks and the real world makes itself known again?",
