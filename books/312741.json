  "description": "Robert Hayward is an extremely pious young man. He is determined to live a life of devotion, obedience, and self-denial, devoid of all passions and pleasures. His ambition is to become a clergyman. His mission in life is to atone for his mother’s sins. His plans are irrevocably ruined when Frederick Wainright returns to England. He disrupts his well-established routine, disturbs his peace of mind, provokes sensations Robert has never allowed himself to feel before, and gradually seduces him into his bed. Following his newly-awakened desires, Robert accompanies Frederick to London. However, he gets more than he bargained for when Frederick’s past affairs and a secret that he intends to keep from Robert at all costs threaten to tear them apart.",
