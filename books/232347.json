  "description": "It is an age of rebirth in the kingdoms of the north. Cedric, lord of Orford, a man plagued by dark dreams of omens, and the true heir of the long lost hero Adalgott, is thrown from his peaceful life and swept into a world of chaos. When a mysterious tome is stolen, Cedric sets out to avenge a fallen friend, and uncover the truth behind his visions. In the Kingdom of Lorine, Cedric learns of an ancient prophecy, and the return of Azrael, a wraith of corruption and decay. Cedric must find the blade, Geanlaecan, for only in its burning power can the dark tide of Azrael, the ancient enemy of man, be turned back. Cedric does not journey alone, lords, mercenaries, magi, and beasts of forests flock to the banner of the true king. In Midland, a kingdom to the north, Cedric meets with politicking lords, and the grizzled Vine King, ruler of Prav and master of Midland. Cedric must unite the squabbling lords of the north if there is to be any chance of survival.",
