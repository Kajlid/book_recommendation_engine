  "description": "My punishment at the hands of Theoden left me with wounds that scarred me to my core. That man has struck the fear of God into me and I don't know how to fight back. I don't know if I can. I feel like he's taking over who I was and making me into something he wants me to be. His slave and his disciple. I do know that I'm his property. His child, his blood runs through my veins and with it comes something so powerful that it consumes me in every way. He plans on teaching me what that means and I don't know who I'll be at the end of his lessons.

Mature Adult Content meant for readers looking for something dark, taboo, sexy, and unapologetic in their paranormal erotica. This is NOT a romance. This novelette is approximately 15100 words.",
