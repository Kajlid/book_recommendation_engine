  "description": "Previously published in the Twisted Christmas anthology! Coming in 2022, the expanded story of Gabrielle and James! Wrong. Sinful. Taboo. I know I shouldn't want him. I know I shouldn't touch myself in the middle of the night as thoughts of him run through my mind. Thoughts of his kiss, his touch, his love. I'd spent years obsessing over the man I thought I couldn't have. But as it turns out, he wants me too. And he wants me now.",
