Date beautiful women and write about it.But I want to take it to the next instead of writing about my experiences make it into an online reality show.But here is the catch. My boss wants me to share the show with a woman co-host. And he wants that woman to be my best friend and co-worker, Margo.I’ll date beautiful women and she’ll date hot men. Sounds fair enough.So now I have to watch her fake date hot men. I used to love going home with a different woman every night, but suddenly this isn’t as fun. Seeing Margo with anyone else is driving me crazy.And the more time I spend with her working on the show, the less I want to keep our relationship in the friends’ zone. And the harder it is to stop myself from imagining her bent over the copier.Things are about to get unprofessional.",
