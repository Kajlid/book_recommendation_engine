  "description": "A slow burn romance between rock stars in the 1980s.DARON is a young guitar player with a dream: to make it big like the guys he grew up idolizing—or at least to escape his homophobic family in new Jersey. He makes it to music school in Rhode Island, and the rock clubs of Boston beckon. But in 1986, in the era of AIDS, MTV, and \"Just Say No\" it's hard to succeed from the closet., especially when your lead singer is hell-bent on being outrageous.ZIGGY is an art-school dropout who knows he’s destined for something bigger and better in life. He craves the spotlight, and he doesn't care how many hearts he has to break to get to the top. When he sees Daron playing guitar one day, he thinks he’s found his ticket to stardom.He’s right.Winner of the Rose & Bay Award for Crowdfunded Fiction!\"For me, Daron is one of those rare fictional characters that I have a hard time believing does not actually exist on the physical plane. He is just too real. Part of it is that Daron is only a couple of years older than me and the way the 80s are brought to life here reminds me very much of my own coming of the musical references, the language, the AIDS scare, the technology, the hair... Most of all, though, it is the fact that Daron is an extremely well written character. He grows and changes and engages.\" —Reviews by Jessewave/Gay Book Reviews",
