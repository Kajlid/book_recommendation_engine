  "description": "\"Last name's Savage -- it means wild and uncontrolled,\" Jace, a party boy, yacht builder and skilled photographer with a quicksilver temper, tells the pretty waitress at Chica Rios. He's desperate to get laid, but there's something in the way of his driving, overactive libido and the girl standing before him - trouble...big trouble, and a whole lot of it, from the trustifarian prick who works by his side, to his messed up twin sister, to the secret hiding at his house.  He sets out to woo Zoé Dubois, keeping her away from his trouble at home, encouraging her to let go of her inhibitions and live \"Savage style,\" riding with him on the back of his motorcycle, exploring the great outdoors in a variety of oh, so delectable and naughty ways.  He ends up with way more than he bargained for. He uses his sexual experience to teach Zoé how to surrender, and his strong will and single minded focus to get his way with her. But it turns out she's the kind of woman who demands the truth...and that's just not the way he rolls. She leverages his love for her to get him to let her into his troubled world and tender heart - something he's stubbornly determined to protect. Their passionate, erotic, romantic connection keeps them bound together while the trouble he brings threatens to tear them apart at every turn.   Mature content for an audience of 18+",
