  "description": "Captain Marmaduke Mustard is angry. He used to be the most feared pirate on the whole of the Seven Seas, but now here he is, left behind on a desert island, with no treasure, no Cabin Boy and not even any parrot pie! He has been tricked at every turn, by that Smartypants Captain Bluebottle and his disgusting son. It's enough to make a grown pirate cry. \"I'm coming to get you, Captain Bluebottle!\" he shouted to the wind, as he and his smelly crew set out on their journey, to take back the treasure. \"Start shivering now, Bluebottle, because I'm coming to get you!\"",
