  "description": "Things aren't going any better for Sergeant Justin \"Hotten\" Hauten and his friend Specialist Sean \"Nebraska\" Walker. Justin meets Mary Lovecross, a powerful woman who seems to have several tricks and secrets up her sleeve.Justin and Nebraska are detained again, but this time they find themselves in more interesting places that has them learning a few new facts that changes everything that they thought they knew about their former company commander, crazy Julia, and Justin's love interest, Lieutenant Aaron Parris.From underground bunkers, a surprise marriage proposal, witty banter, the Texan Badlands, undercover agents, a fancy Governor's party, to a couple of fist fights, will Justin live long enough to fall in love in all of this craziness?Hungry For You is novella 2 in the Falling For Him Male/Male Military Love Series. It is approximately 95 pages long.______________________________Need some fine print?* This is an updated and new-and-improved version of a previous book called UNDONE. Same story, new cover, but edited. If you have already read UNDONE, first--Thank you, and second, the story is not different.* This is a love story between two men. On a scale of 1-5, 1 being \"vanilla\" and 5 being \"this is so hot, I'm dying\"; I would rate this one a 2.* This series has been published in \"Episodic Form\" aka, Installments. This means Novella #2 isn't the complete story. It stops at a good spot (cliffhanger), but not at the final conclusion. I know this bothers some folks, so I feel it is best to be upfront about it.***Other books in the FALLING FOR HIM Series:Falling For You, Book 1Ready For You, Book 3 (the final book)",
