  "description": "Aaron Burch, editor of Hobart says, \"There are elements in these stories we recognize-- the vacation story, the murder mystery, Godzilla, geometry-- and their brilliance is how Curtis Smith takes these expectations and plays with and against them, twisting, pulling, bringing us along wherever he goes. There are surprises, plot twists, playful language and form, shifts in emotion that catch you off guard. Most importantly, Smith infuses these stories with humor. He surprises you with it; he alleyoops comedic setups then grabs you and breaks your heart, leaving you wondering what just happened.\"",
