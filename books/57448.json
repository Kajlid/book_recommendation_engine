  "title": "The Making of the English Landscape",
  "description": "'No one before has ever brought out with quite the same vividness the historical background of the country all around us' - \"Guardian\" - a classic of English landscape history, reissued in its fiftieth anniversary year. First published in 1955 by Hodder, \"The Making Of The English Landscape\" is a classic of English history. It was the first book to study, literally, the history of the landscape, and also the first to explode the myth that the English landscape was 'formed by enclosures'. Instead W. G. Hoskins traces the beauty and oddities of the English landscape further back, from pre-Roman times to the seventeenth century and beyond. Hoskins explains the layers of history in the landscape by taking the reader with him along Devonshire lanes, past lost villages in Lincolnshire, and through the pastures of upland Northamptonshire. This is a delightful book, readable and scholarly, which has been much-loved by readers for the past fifty years.",
