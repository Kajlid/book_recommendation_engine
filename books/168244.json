  "description": "In a land of deadly magic, conflicting prophecies, and cold-blooded politics, Magda needs every friend she can get. But her sole allies are a stubborn Prince, a nymph with half a soul, a grumbling warrior, and a highly intelligent rat. So she considers it a good day when she only wants to kill her enemies. And protecting her companions proves an even greater challenge than saving herself when the assassins hunting them have wings and deadly venom. But with the Crown and the Throne at stake, no one is safe. Magda isn’t going to stand by while prophets dictate her destiny though. She’ll do whatever it takes to survive and help her friends, even if it means bargaining with a witch whose power once threatened the gods. This is the fourth installment in the serial novel Claiming the Prince.",
