  "description": "College graduates Renzo Herrera and Mario Daza have been a couple for two years when they decide to spend Christmas in Puerto Rico where Renzo's family is from. At first, Renzo is worried about losing Mario because of a religious vow Renzo made as a teen. As a demisexual virgin, he wants to wait until marriage to have sex. Mario is his first love and the only one he would ever be intimate with, so it's a big deal to him.Mario already has experience and doesn't feel the need to wait until marriage, but he also isn't religious. Renzo isn't against it for others since he doesn't judge anyone by their differences. It's just a personal choice that turned into a vow he refuses to break.Being tied to a vow doesn't mean it comes without challenges, though. After all, whatâ€™s supposed to be a fun Christmas vacation ends up feeling more like a marital test. Renzo and Mario must work out their sexual frustrations and find a way to compromise until marriage. For Renzo, it feels like choosing to be nice instead of naughty, so to speak.Will their love for one another stay powerful enough for them to abstain from going all the way? Or are they just not be as compatible as they think?",
