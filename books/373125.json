  "description": "Emma thought she had problems, but when she wakes in 1351 Scotland after a serious car crash, she realizes that her problems are just starting. The locket she wears is the key to the second chance she’s been given, and the people she meets believe that she is a fairy. She becomes the houseguest of a brooding yet magnetic Scotsman named Iain, and discovers in him a tenderness that she never expected. Iain is suspicious of this mysterious newcomer, but he cannot deny that something about her entrances him. He is haunted by dreams of her darker side, and his need to possess her becomes an increasing obsession. Is she an ordinary woman in extraordinary circumstances, or is she a real fairy as everyone else believes? Iain hopes to discover the reason for her sudden appearance—and a way to convince her to stay.",
