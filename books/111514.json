  "description": "This work gives a compelling account of the officer who waged the intelligence battle against Napoleon's army, a forerunner to the great code-breakers of the 20th century. The French army, during the Peninsular War, used a code of unrivalled complexity - the \"Great Paris Cipher\". Major George Scovell used a network of Spanish guerillas to capture coded French messages, and then set to work decrypting them.",
