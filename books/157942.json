  "description": "Emery wants to die. Good thing she just ran into a killer. \"They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but that's bullshit. What doesn't kill you leaves a scar. More than the eyesore down my torso, I was a scar, the jagged, fucked up remains of a tragedy.\" Scar's Nomad status gives him a chance to fulfill his one wish, but his lonely mission is interrupted when a possible one-night stand goes horribly wrong. \"They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but what if I can't live with myself anymore?\" Finding the blonde face down in a puddle of her own blood jeopardizes everything. Saving her and keeping her quiet could get Scar killed, but when Emery wakes up, her shocking proposal for him to kill her starts the ride of his life.* First published in the anthology, The Bad Boys of Romance.",
