  "title": "Broken Bones: A Novel",
  "description": "Broken Bones is the heartbreaking and ultimately inspiring tale of a young man’s battle with anorexia, of his fight with not only his own inner demons but with the inhumanity of the mental health system itself.  With shades of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Baker brings the reader into the cold concrete of an eating disorder ward, ferrying him through a month of constant observation, brutal rigidity, and rationed showers, of drug-clouded nights and mornings of cold eggs and watered-down coffee. In such an oppressive environment, an institution where those tasked with making the inpatients whole don’t even see them as people; small victories evolve into epic celebrations and minor setbacks become soul-crushing defeats.",
