  "title": "State of the World 2010: Transforming Cultures - From Consumerism to Sustainability",
  "description": "For society to thrive long into the future, we must move beyond our unsustainable consumer culture to one that respects environmental realities. In 'State of the World 2010', the Worldwatch Institute's award-winning research team reveals not only how human societies can make this shift but also how people around the world have already started to nurture a new culture of sustainability. Chapters present innovative solutions to global environmental problems, focusing on institutions that are the principal engineers of culture, such as governments, the media, and religious organizations. Written in clear, concise language, with easy-to-read charts and tables, 'State of the World' presents a view of our changing world that we, and our leaders, cannot afford to ignore.",
