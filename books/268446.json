  "description": "The dysfunctional relationship between a rising Manhattan gallery owner and her mother spirals out of control in a harrowing and unflinchingly honest short story of inheritance, sabotage, and the pressure to excel.Lauren is angry enough that her mother couldn’t find time to show up to the opening of her new art gallery. But when she gets home and discovers the gift her mother has sent instead, Lauren comes undone in the face of a temptation that will push her to the edge, closer to her demons and the bitter taste of a mother’s love.Lauren is part of The Fairer Sex, a collection of sexy, satirical, and sometimes harrowing short stories that explore the question: “What do women want?” The answer is different for every woman, but each can be read or listened to in a single sitting.",
