  "description": "Naz races to put the pieces of his life back together while D’s life hangs in the balance.   Naz has lost everyone that he loves. And while he may have found refuge and pause at International Academy, he has found no peace and certainly no answers. All that he knows calls to him from the streets of the Exclave and Union High School where he reunites with friends and mentors.  Naz struggles, unsuccessfully, to put the pieces of his shattered life back together again—until D comes into his world and changes everything. She helps him put things into perspective, see things he couldn’t see before and remember things he had all but forgotten.  But when D goes missing, it will take more than Naz’s newly found abilities to discover her whereabouts, rescue her, and bring her unlikely captor to justice. Will he reach her in time?*Alternate cover edition*",
