  "description": "Savage Man and Ferocious Beast. Deadly foes since the dawn of time. Where Man dares to tread, Beast has gone before. Where Beast has made its lair, Man brazenly stakes his claim. Domination is the prize. Most often in the bitter battles of bared steel and fang it is the valor of one warrior or a single powerful deed that rallies the day. Yet only the day, for another monstrous foe rises across that next ridge or in that dark night. The Beasts adopt many forms and Man comes to each in different mien: on bended knee to worship some as gods - or fear as slavering demons; upon the back of mighty steeds and waging war most divine - or defiant; in cautious companionship befriending some few - or learning to let live. Walk again the primal worlds of Lovecraft's ancient behemoths and Burroughs' untamed jungles; of London's wild North and Howard's dangerous creations. Only the brave should delve within these tales, should dare to follow close behind each warrior, for it is solely in the facing of our most awesome fears that heroes are truly made.",
