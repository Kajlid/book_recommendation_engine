  "description": "When a family secret is dramatically exposed, a young woman entering adulthood is introduced to a strange and unknown destiny. Having been raised to believe she was the only child of her rather meek and mild parents, Stella and Rocco, Max is told on her 18th birthday that her quiet, normal existence isn't at all what she's been taught to believe. Stella isn't Max's biological mother, but a loyal submissive to a powerful Dominatrix, Sumera, who was assigned to raise Max with Rocco, Sumera's husband, and #1 sub. Once the heavy truth is revealed, Max learns that the time has come for Rocco and Stella to bring her to meet her \"real\" mother, Sumera, and leave behind everything she knows in favor of moving into the family estate, which is also a private, discerning BDSM retreat. Max's natural reluctance to accept the truth and embrace a stranger as her mother leads to a dramatic situation as Sumera's well-crafted plan to reunite with her daughter is jeopardized by teen angst and rebellion. Will Max accept her her destined place in the kinky empire? Or, will her whirlwind of emotions cause insurmountable chaos?",
