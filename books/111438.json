  "description": "Sit back with a warm cup of herbal tea and sink into the relaxing pleasures of a story from an Amish community, virtually insulated from the fast pace of modern life. Meet Ruth Hostettler and discover how even a cocoon of tradition cannot protect the Hostettler family from unjust evil in the world. Watch as generations of faith struggle to stand firm and one woman's dreams are put to the test",
