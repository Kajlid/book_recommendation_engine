  "title": "Ten Kings: Dasarajna",
  "description": "Based on a portion of the Rig-Veda which is now regarded as historical fact by scholars, historians and archaeologists, this is the thrilling story of King Sudas and the impossible battle he was forced to fight against a far superior force led by Ten Kings (‘Dasarajna’ in Sanskrit) comprised of his neighbors and allies led by his friend Anu, instigated by Anu’s guru Vishwamitra, in a bid to wipe out Sudas and his ‘Shudra’ tribe and take control of the rich fertile lands they guarded on behalf of the ‘Bharata’ nation. The place where they fought later became the site of the city of Harappa, possibly the first modern urban center in history, and the nation that was established in that region later came to be called…Bharat. A battle epic that flags off the Itihasa Series retelling major landmarks in the history of the Indian sub-continent.",
