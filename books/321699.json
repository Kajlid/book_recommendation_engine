  "title": "Snippy the Crab — Caught on Camera!",
  "description": "Sprawling, he tumbled, head over heels,Adrift ’mongst the blob fish and candescent eels.Columns of gases red, green and blueRose in great clouds from a magical brew,Giving off vapours horribly hot.Would he be boiled alive in this witch’s stew pot?Another rip-roaring escapade for loveable Snippy – his biggest and bravest yet!When a famous visitor arrives at Cocklebed Bay to film an undersea mission for his new TV series, Snippy thinks he’s found the perfect place to watch the action unfold. Until…? Well, let’s just say Snippy will be lucky to get out of this one!Another beautifully illustrated narrative poem, inspired by much-loved works in this genre, such The Pied Piper of Hamelin, The Jumblies, Madeline, The Walrus and the Carpenter, The Owl and the Pussycat amongst others.",
