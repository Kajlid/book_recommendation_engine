  "description": "A full length novel, written in the form of a fictionalized memoir. It follows a young woman (Alyssa Lund) breaking into her modeling career. Through a series of seductions, she stumbles dangerously deeper into a taboo world of unbridled lust. Unfamiliar to her at first, she battles the scruples of her upbringing and discovers her true self is happiest in the role of the submissive.Contains pervasive, explicit, taboo, kinky erotica, and some very naughty people, so it's not for the squeamish. Psychological thriller that muddies the limits of acceptable behavior.I have this recurring sex dream about being with another woman. I consider myself barely bisexual, but this dream predates that discovery. She’s a queen with a crown and I am her loyal servant. We are both naked and I kneel before my queen. More about that dream later.I’m Alyssa, a full-time underwear model in my mid-twenties. I have my own place and provide for myself without the help of a man. I’ve walked the runways for high-end lingerie catalogs and appeared in numerous swimwear magazines. The story of my modeling began with mere aspirations and it wasn’t smooth sailing. Although I’ve made some mistakes and gotten into some pretty tight scrapes, I learned how to handle things and, most importantly, found myself.I almost didn’t finish college due to a preoccupation with sex. I’ve come to the realization that control does not always bring complete gratification. In fact, I like being told what to do in bed. I especially like guys who are a bit older than me, who see me as forbidden fruit. Being completely submissive is what does it for me. It took me a while to realize that, and this is the story of how I discovered the real me.",
