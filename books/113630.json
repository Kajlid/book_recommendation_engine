  "description": "As a new era dawns for humanity, finally breaking the bonds that left us tied to the Solar System, this giant leap is to be marred by greed and erupting violence. The new frontier, ripe for colonization and opportunity, is filled with the honest and ruthless alike. Two rival corporations have all but supplanted nation-states, keeping governments around only as a necessary fiction to pacify populations, as the realm of business now reaches into politics, military, religion, and all other aspects of human life. The frontier regions of space, barely able to keep from slipping into total anarchy, are filled with new homesteaders, miners, merchants, bandits, and scientific minds. When one company gains the edge and is the first to crack an engine to bring the Alcubierre formula into reality, and thus travel faster than the speed of light, the rivalry between the two multi-national conglomerates is taken to a dangerous new and martial level. The battle for profits in the market place is now being waged by armies and fleets in space. The Argos, adrift and crippled far from home, is the only hope for its remaining crew. These survivors of a mysterious attack struggle to hold their ship together and come to the rescue of homesteaders and compatriots relying on them. Contrasting with the dubious motivations of those in power, the crew of the Argos are people who crave adventure and are above the miasma of greed that sends them their orders. As the great battle breaks out at the moment that should have been humanity's greatest triumph, the gallant and the selfish alike are forced to face the best and worst of human civilization far from home and decide what they truly believe in.",
