  "title": "Anxious Gretchen: Space Archaeologist",
  "description": "Archaeologist Gretchen Borowicz is having a perfectly ordinary summer managing a dig. Until she notices a strange beam of green light on site and trips straight into it—and outer space.Now, she’s literally light years away from Earth on the planet Destyr, where the locals revere her for her crippling social anxiety. After an impassioned plea from the Destyrian queen, Gretchen finds herself an unwitting participant in an intergalactic archaeological mission, accompanied by an Earth-obsessed alien princess, her deadpan bodyguard, and their genius best friend. In order to get home, Gretchen must journey to a ruined planet to recover sacred, millennia-old artifacts. If she can get there before the mercenary out to snatch the same artifacts for a rival queen, she might just stop a planetary war.",
