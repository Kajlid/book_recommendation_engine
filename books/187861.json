  "description": "In the third Cross book, the immortal angel killer Cross faces his most dangerous enemy yet: Noah. For ages Noah has sailed the seas, seeking out all of God's mistakes and imprisoning them on his ark. Noah is not humanity's saviour but is instead God's jailer. But he has grown increasingly mad over the centuries, and now he is determined to end the world by raising the mysterious Sunken City. Only one person can stop him: Cross.The Apocalypse Ark is an epic chase around the world and through history and myth as Cross races to stop Noah from finding the Sunken City. He's joined by a few old friends, such as Alice from the Alice in Wonderland tales, and several new characters make memorable appearances as well: Captain Nemo and his crew of Atlanteans aboard the submarine the Nautilus; the sorcerous pirate Blackbeard, who has sworn revenge upon Cross; the devilish angel Sariel, whose sacred duty is to protect God's Bible; and the eerie and mysterious Ishmael, who may be the key to the world's salvationâ€”or its damnation. Cross must find a way to bring them all together to stop Noah or the world will drown in madness.Peter Roman is the pseudonym of Peter Darbyshire, who is known for Please, The Warhol Gang, and the Book of Cross series with The Mona Lisa Sacrifice and The Dead Hamlets.",
