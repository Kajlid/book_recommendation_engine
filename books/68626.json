  "description": "After being accused of stealing the princess’ heirloom ring and jewelry box, Volker finds himself cursed by a witch and trapped on the castle grounds for over 400 years with no glimmer of hope for his miserable ghostly condition to improve. When he realizes that the pox-covered, yet beautiful, peasant woman standing in the courtyard can see him, he knows that she’s the one that can set him free. The only trouble is that he’s falling head over heels in love with the one that he can never be with. Determined to start over after a disappointing long-term relationship, Andrea Morgan decides to sell all of her belongings in Atlanta and hop on a plane home to Germany. Life is good, until the fateful night of the annual Halloween ball at the Heidelberg castle, when out of nowhere, a muck-covered ring lands next to her foot in the courtyard. Attached to this antique ring appears to be a very handsome ghost. Good thing that she isn’t looking for love any time soon, because how ridiculous would it be of her to fall in love with a spirit?",
