  "description": "Segun is handsome, very handsome, but he is also twisted, dark and totally dominant. He swept me off my feet, and I fell hopelessly in love with him, submitting my innocent heart, body and soul to his every command. He demanded trust, and I gave him everything, willingly and blissfully surrendering to him in ways I could not even have imagined. But then he broke my heart, leaving me in a million shattered pieces and in worse pain than I had ever known. In just one night, through a series of dark and ugly events, I lost him and my life was never the same again. I never thought I would love again until I met Tayo, kind and compassionate Tayo, in whom I found love, support and happiness. Finally, I could truly heal and learn to love again…..or so I believed, till Segun came back into my life, things start to fall apart again and I’m struggling for control.",
