  "description": "Over twenty years have passed since the events of Warstrider: Symbionts. Contact with the DalRiss and Naga and their technology has radically altered human society, as has the constant struggle between the Hegemony and the rebel Confederation for control over the dozens of human-inhabited planets. But the Hegemony has a new technology that could suppress any resistance to Earthâ€™s rule, and meanwhile, Dev Cameron and the DalRiss have discovered a new threat emerging from deep space that could cause the extinction of all life it encounters. The fifth book in Ian Douglas's classic Warstrider military sci-fi series, originally published in 1995. The whole Warstrider series is being re-issued by War Planet Press.",
