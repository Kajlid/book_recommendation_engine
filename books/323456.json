Now he has an even bigger secret. In every shadow of the sprawling mansion he's recently inherited he can see her-tempting, ethereal, and untouchable. Hope Stillwater inhabited that mansion in 1906. Raw desire has formed a conduit between these two passionate souls who are separated by the barrier of time. Intoxicated by each other's presence, Ryan and Hope come close to crossing that inviting boundary between two worlds. But there is danger: Ryan's job has put him on the trail of a depraved criminal in an investigation that's risking Hope's eternal fate. Now he must do whatever it takes to change history, protect Hope from harm, and set his desires free.",
