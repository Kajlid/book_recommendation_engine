  "title": "Audra: Dying for Life",
  "description": "When Audra Knight's gynecologist says, \"I need to do a biopsy,\" it numbs her to the core of her being. She's young, single, and suddenly a potential cancer victim. It's really not the time to notice Dann Day, the handsome new band-orchestra teacher at Chandler's Grove Academy---and Audra's new co-worker. And why should he want anything to do with her? With her unresolved anger issues, the way she's strayed from God, and the fact that Heather Easton already seems to have claimed him for her own, getting involved would be stupid. Even if he was able to see past all of that, it could too easily end in heartbreak if she does end up having cancer. She doesn't want to put a man through that. But when Dann asks Audra's help on a school project, Heather's jealousy flares. It's the catalyst that amplifies Audra's anger, sending her back to God and church to find peace and the courage to truly live. However, there's on thing that can't be stopped---Audra's growing feelings for Dann. But how can she tell a man who wants a family that he might not be able to have one with her? As the pressure mounts, it becomes clear that the only one who can answer the question is God.",
