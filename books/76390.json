  "description": "Modern human hearts have become so hard that the Cupids' arrows can't even scratch them. When the divorce rate among Cupid matches is as high as people who didn't have angelic help, God decides to shut down the Cupid division unless their one last chance works out.Clint Mauser, an Army armorer who just died in Afghanistan, is tasked to replace the Cupidsâ€™ bows and arrows with guns. If humans are going to armor their hearts the Cupids will just have to switch to armor-piercing weapons.Clint works closely with Bethany, a beautiful but damaged angel who's in danger of Falling if the division closes down. As Clint develops the right guns to pierce the hardened shells around human hearts, he and Bethany find themselves drawn towards each other in a torrid affair as they find that they're actually a perfect match for each other.Sensitive religious types may wish to exercise discretion. This story contains very explicit angel-on-angel sexual action.",
