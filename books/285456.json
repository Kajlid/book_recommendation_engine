  "description": "If \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" got together and had a litter of puppies you'd get \"Dog Logic\", a duck-and-cover fable and love story. Funny, inflammatory, and weirdly propheticHertell Daggett is the divorced and damaged caretaker of a failing pet cemetery on the outskirts of Bakersfield, and he's just discovered a lost civilization. Well not lost so much as just, misinformed -- they've been living beneath the pet cemetery due to some bad information they got back in 1963 about the end of the world, and were completely unaware that the world had wobbled on without them. Hertell leads the duck-and-cover civilization into our world, our glorious, mystifying, and often dismaying world, and in the process, finds a love he never quite lost and a future he never quite imagined.Silver Winner Foreword INDIES Book Of The Year Award - Science FictionBronze Winner Readers' Favorite Award - Literary FictionFinalist National Indie Excellence Awards - Contemporary Novel",
