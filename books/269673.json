  "description": "Sometimes falling is the safest step to take.  Chloe Reardon has a problem, and his name is Gavin Wallace.  Okay, Gavin isn’t exactly a problem, unless you consider a highly attractive wind vampire with dubious intentions a problem. Especially if that vampire is your boss. With an affinity for kilts and excellent taste in music.  But none of that matters because Chloe Reardon has had enough of dangerous men. Danger is overrated. Danger is the opposite of sexy. So Gavin is the last man—or vampire—on earth she needs to let into her heart.  Except what if the most dangerous man you knew was also the one who made you feel the strongest?  The Devil and the Dancer is a paranormal romance novella in the Elemental Legacy series.",
