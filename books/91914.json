  "description": "They both have secrets...But whose past will catch up to them first? Shayna Gillan is on a mission: start fresh in a new state without the small town gossip that has haunted her since her bad girl days of high school. Carter MacPherson has long been the most together member of his crazy family—until now. With a secret threatening to crumble everything he's worked for, he wishes he could forget the recent past, too. The last thing Shayna and Carter are looking for is a relationship. It's best to be alone while they sort out their issues. Friends. That's all they can ever be. But even the best laid plans always have a flaw, and once Shayna and Carter cross the line between friendship and more, there's no turning back... The only question left is—whose past will catch up to them first?",
