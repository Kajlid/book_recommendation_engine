But when a goat dairy farmer is murdered, Angie must turn the tables on a bleating black sheep . . .   With three weeks until opening night for their restaurant, the County Seat, Angie and her best friend and business partner Felicia are scrambling to line up local vendors—from the farmer's market to the goat dairy farm of Old Man Moss. Fortunately, the cantankerous Moss takes a shine to Angie, as does his kid goat Precious.

One thing's for sure, there's no whey Angie's going to let some killer get her goat . . .",
