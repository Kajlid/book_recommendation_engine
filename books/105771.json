  "description": "Being single. To some it's a blessing; for others, a curse. Newly-dumped Anna-Kate can't imagine a life without Jared being anything but empty and hopeless. Following her passion for classic literature, she accepts a job at a local bookstore, where she can spend her days reading about independent heroines like Jane Eyre and Elizabeth Bennet: women who broke the conventions of their day, and inspire Anna-Kate to do the same.With a cast of colorful co-workers who offer plenty of unsolicited advice and can't take hints, the journey to self-sufficiency turns out to be wilder than Anna-Kate ever expected",
