Seeking escape from her criminal past, a woman agrees to enslave herself to a trio of men who own an antiquated Louisiana plantation.Known only as Lydia, she becomes controlled by three very different men – the malicious Preston, the inflexible Kruin, and the gentle Gabriel, all of whom introduce her to a world in which the lines between pleasure, pain and shame are irrevocably blurred. The plantation becomes both Lydia’s haven and her prison as she surrenders to the desires of her unholy trinity.Lydia’s submission is fraught with tension and hunger, but what happens when the outside world enters her dark, anonymous sanctuary?",
