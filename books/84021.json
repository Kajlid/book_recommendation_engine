  "description": "Assyrians invented the chariot and made wine eight thousand years ago. Who knew they still exist in the USA today?The multigenerational story of a Christian minority family in a Moslem land follows its survival though genocide of World War I, emigration to gangland Chicago of the 1920's, the sacrifices the family made for the education, and rise of its prodigal son, Sam. Sam's story begins with humble agrarian village origins and continues through engineering school in the capitol city and graduate school in London. He becomes founder of a major civil engineering firm in Tehran with several hundred employees only to collide with the Iranian revolution of 1979 and his family's subsequent emigration to California and a new beginning. It is a story of solidarity, family loyalty and a love of country and the rich Iranian culture. No matter how foreign a culture may be, even one we owe much of our own heritage, we all share common humanity. We all strive to live in peace and to make the world a better place for our children. Discover an ancient people's culture living fully today in Shamshone: Sun of Assyria.",
