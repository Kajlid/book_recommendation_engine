  "title": "The Crime of the Century",
  "description": "When a series of murders performed by a killer with a peculiarly thin blade take place in London, Detective Superintendent Bill Barry is recalled from retirement. Doctors, psychologists, lawyers and politicians join in the hunt, but the biggest crime is yet to come. First published as a six-part serial in \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper in 1975, readers were encouraged to send in their own solutions to the mystery after episode five. For the first time, the winning entry is published here in book form, together with Amis' own denouement. Kingsley Amis is also the author of \"Jake's Thing\", \"Stanley and the Woman\", \"The Old Devils\" and \"Difficulties with Girls\".",
