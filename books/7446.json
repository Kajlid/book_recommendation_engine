  "description": "As one of the stars of MTV's top-rated reality show Jersey Shore, Jenni \"Jwoww\" Farley has spent two summers dating, mating, and making mischief on the sandy beaches of Seaside Heights and Miami with her housemates. Famous for both her cleavage-baring tops and her tough-as-nails approach to life and love (I am like a praying mantis, after I have sex with a guy I will rip their heads off), JWoWW is impulsive and spontaneous. The ultimate party girl, wherever she goes, drama follows. But beneath that tough exterior is a mature, caring young woman who has become the series' resident big sister - the one they turn to for the honest advice they need. While Jwoww tells it like it is, she is also fiercely loyal to her friends and wants to see them happy. Infused with Jersey Shore attitude and never-before-shared anecdotes Jenni's guide to dating reveals what she has learned about men, sex, smackdowns, and standing her ground. Jenni shares some of her wildest moments on the show and talks about past relationships - the good, the bad, and the gorillas. She also gives modern girls the smackdown on how to handle the competition (I cut girls quicker than barbers do - you don't want to get in my business). As fans know, Jwoww knows how to get the guys - and now she shows other girls how to get them too.",
