  "description": "Ten real- life bone chilling stories from evil spirits, ghoulish figures to the paranormal, the supernatural, the unexplained, and things that do more than just go bump in the night.\"These are the sort of stories whispered round camp fires, and told in hushed voices, because they have their foundation in real life - they are true!\" - Midwest Book Review.\"Each of the stories is either a single supernatural encounter, very true to life in that it is never explained, or a real world story of karma and retribution.\" - Book Angel UK.NOTE: Not everyone appreciates this book. Please note the stories in this book are real. They were written as is. At times, it is philosophical.",
