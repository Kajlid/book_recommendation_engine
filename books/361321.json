  "description": "Separated from his parents who are deported to the camps by the Nazis, David struggles to survive, alone, hungry and scared, until he eventually finds his way to the city of Warsaw. There he learns from other Jewish boys how to work in the black market, dodging the police and the Gestapo and finding a few scraps to eat. The eventual day comes when the ghetto is cleared and everyone is herded into trains for the long trip to the camps, but David already knows what to expect there... Will David survive? Can he outwit them one more time? A beautifully written story based on the testimonies and diaries of young people who experienced the Holocaust.",
