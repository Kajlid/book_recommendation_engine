  "description": "In a future world a young girl named Mira lives in the town of Rust, which makes its living from scavenging the remains of the past. Discontent to remain there without having at least one great adventure in her life, she summons a Guardian from the Heavens to protect her on a journey to her nation's capital city. Guardians are spiritual companions that only come to those summon them with earnest hearts and can only be seen by those that believe in them. Mira is given Lazarus, a huge horned lion with dragon's wings. She and her new companion travel with her best friend, a boy named Noel, and his common wildcat Guardian. Along their way, they meet people who do not see what they see and learn that they could lose sight of even what they know in a world in which perception is everything.",
