For another, the nanites want to completely change his body... and in the process reveal her true self. Stuck (or perhaps blessed?) with a new form, she must find out what it means to live, to be loved for who she is rather than her work.Catnip is a space exploration novella about a trans woman's journey to find herself and what it means to be loved for who she is, with the help of her polycule and a lesbian AI.",
