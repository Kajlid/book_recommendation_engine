  "description": "In this official novel for the movie, War of the Worlds: Goliath, itâ€™s 1914, fifteen years after the first invasion from Mars. On the eve of World War I, the Martians stage a second attack, stronger and more powerful than before, to finish what they started. But this time, they meet a very different Earth, rebuilt using technologies left behind to create a wild and unsettling steampunk landscape. And this time, we fight back. With new scenes and character backgrounds not found in the action-packed film by Tripod Entertainment, this novel is the perfect companion piece for fans of both the movie and the original sci-fi classic.",
