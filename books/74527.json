But that was over ten years ago, and each is still trying to find that perfect someone . . . if perfect is even possible.In fact, Liz Carlson will settle for a normal man. A normal man with a job, that is. Married twice, then divorced twice, Liz had her rose-colored glasses fall off and shatter on the ground a long time ago. Her main focus now is raising her six-year-old daughter and surviving long days at work on her feet as a hairdresser. When Sloane Branden answers her call for help, quite literally, Liz doesn’t even give him a second glance. She has sworn off dating for as many years as it takes, and it seems that Sloane has done the same after his own tumultuous marriage. But when Liz discovers that Sloane defies every stereotypical deadbeat she has dated, she might just find room in her heart and discover the third time’s the charm.",
