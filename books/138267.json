  "title": "Forever and Always: Poetic Reflections on Life, Love, Laughter and Loss",
  "description": "Katherine has always lived in the South Wales Valleys, inspired by its contradictory barren and beautiful landscapes. She is happily married with two children, and two huge poodles. She has been published in Poetry Wales, and has also been published as part of a charity Poetry anthology. Her love of Poetry can be attributed to her inspirational and unforgettable English teacher Mr Alex McAleer who brought the world of words to life. She has ironically worked in the world of numbers and statistics for thirty years but has returned to her passion and love for verse and rhyme in more recent times. This is Katherineâ€™s first collection of published poetry.",
