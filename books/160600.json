  "description": "Michelle Boske releases her debut collection of poetry featuring 15 contemporary poems. The Dust of Us explore universal themes. She explores the lighter and playful side of love, such as intimacy and gratefulness, but also delves deeper, taking us into the darker side of love, of betrayal and regret. In the end, these poems are ultimately hopeful, reminding us of the beginnings and endings, big and small, which contain us all.",
