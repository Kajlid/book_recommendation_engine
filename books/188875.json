  "description": "Ramona Raven is determined to find redemption from a past wherein she allowed men to control her, with often disastrous results. When she dreams of a wild gray stallion, in keeping with her Cherokee beliefs, Ramona sees the dream as prophetic. She must find the horse. She realizes, however, that in order to do so, she will need help. Help arrives in the form of a has-been rodeo rider named Austin Cahill, a man who is desperately trying to escape his own past, one clouded by the death of his wife and child, as well as a mountain of gray hide, muscle, and bone that destroyed his ability to ride any horse breathing. Although burdened with Killian Russell, the learning-disabled teenage runaway he has been harboring from the law, Austin joins forces with Ramona, and the three of them embark upon a journey that will change their lives forever.",
