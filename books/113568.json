  "description": "Deepak Arora’s first collection of Hindi poems, “वक्त के होठों पर एक प्रेम गीत” is a long saga of love, reminiscences and longing - depicting every shade of life. The poet talks about love, yearns for the lovely moments that love bestows but at the same time, he is also aware about the pain and the loneliness that culminates in the journey of attachment. This futility of love and life which is synonymous for him reflects in these kind of lines - “साबुत पैदा हुए सब टूटते हैं अंततः”. These poems written in the mists of time captivate and mesmerize the readers and compel them to think about the journey of life. We are born in a crowd, spend every moment of our life in a crowd but it is true that we are doomed to be alone as long as we are alive. There may be real love in this world but only a fortunate few can claim of having experienced it. These kind of lines fill tears in our eyes when the poet says, “वह खड़ा था कुएं की जगत पर, हिचकिचाते हुये कहा उसने....प्रेम कुएं ने प्रतिध्वनि मे कहा वही शब्दशब्दों की जादूगरी, अर्थों की कशीदाकारी दोनों ने उस पल मे छोड़ दिया सम्मोहन,आह! कितना निरीह हो सकता है कोई केवल एक शब्द खोकर। “Written in free verse, this is the first and last collection of the poet who devoted his life to poetry, whose sole reason for existence was poetry but unfortunately life had other plans. Do read Deepak Arora to dive in the varied emotions of love and life.",
