  "description": "Most omegas dream of a happily ever after; I just want to survive.I’m on the run from a cruel alpha—leader of the gang I was sold to. For years he kept me like a trophy, and each heat left me with scars—ones that mark the last secret I have left to protect.Now, he’s found me, and my sanctuary—the High Roller club—is no longer safe. Just when I know I’m going to be dragged back to my worst nightmare, I stumble upon a pack I never thought I’d see again. A pack that’s haunted every dream since the day I met them. Kyan, Zed, and Knight are brutal boys of the streets, and they’re my mates, so falling into their arms for protection should be easy. But long dead are the days of stolen kisses and names scratched into notebooks amidst hearts.Because they hate me.When they got to their knees and offered me the world, I turned my back on them. I left them broken, rejected, and exiled from the only family they’d ever known.Placing myself at their feet is my last hope of survival, but I can never let them see the scars their enemy left across my skin.This is a stand alone in the shared High Roller Omegaverse which can be read in any order, and is a MMFM bully omegaverse with a HEA.",
