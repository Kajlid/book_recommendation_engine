  "description": "At the knowledge that Sean had broken up with her, it was like a firework had gone off inside his chest, crashing around in his ribcage and sparking off all sorts of emotions; fierce joy for him, sadness for her, hurt that she hadn’t told him, hope that this might finally be his time...all of them paled in comparison to the roaring of his internal Master that he had to protect what was his. And she was his. She just didn’t know it yet.*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***If you love someone, you set them free. That's how the proverb goes, right? Because if they love you, they'll come back. Well Blue is tired of waiting. He let Noelle walk away from him once and now that she's back on the market, he isn't making that mistake again.There's only one thing standing in the way of claiming her and that's his past, which is rearing its ugly head once more. When one of Red's subs is kidnapped and brutalised, Blue must confront all the secrets he buried all those years ago and break free of them once and for all.",
