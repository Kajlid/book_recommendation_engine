  "description": "Space heroes or cosmic rejects? Captain Glint Starcrost is not having the carefree, adventurous life the space academy brochures promised star pilots. Broke, with an unreliable star freighter and a bounty on his head, Glint is desperate enough to try anything. Even set out on a quest to find a fabled good luck charm, the Emerald Enigma. Now for a crew. A passive aggressive ship computer, a peaceable alien warrior, and time-traveling teen from the past aren’t what he had in mind. But they’ll have to do. The Emerald Enigma won’t wait forever and neither will the bounty hunter tracking him.",
