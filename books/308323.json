  "description": "Nothing is easy about life above the Arctic Circle. Except, perhaps, falling in love.Bryson Faulkner embraces the challenges that come with making a home in one of the most beautiful but unforgiving places on earth: the isolation of the endless wilderness, the harsh and unpredictable climate, the predators that lurk about her remote cabin. And even the most perilous dangers of all—those that await her when she takes to the skies as one of Alaska’s most daring bush pilots. The only thing missing is a special woman to share it all with, but she’s resigned herself to the fact that few people can thrive in such an extreme environment.Everything Karla Edwards thought she knew gets called into question when a series of events turns her comfortable and well-ordered life on its ear. Her partner leaves her, her mother dies, and Karla learns she has a sister in Alaska she never knew. She takes a leave of absence from her job as an ER nurse in Atlanta and heads to the far north, seeking answers and adventure. She finds all that and more when she crosses paths with a sexy bush pilot who opens her eyes to new possibilities. But can she open her heart as well and learn to trust again?",
