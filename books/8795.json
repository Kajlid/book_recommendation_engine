  "description": "Karma has it in for Moswen. Trouble follows him around like a demented, faithful dog. Moswen never means for things to happen the way they do. It just does. And while things may seem bad at first, everything eventually works out for the best even if the road to getting there is a less than a smooth ride.While fleeing his sister's wrath for an accident that was almost not his fault, Moswen stumbles upon the chance to crash what promises to be a fun party. Kijika is hopeful that the birthday bash for his grandfather, the current king, won't be the deadly boring event he's sure it will be and he'd much rather be pouring over ancient texts in his quest for knowledge. Moswen's karma swings into action and Moswen and Kijika cross paths at the party setting in motion a relationship that will give both men what they most desire.----------Status: COMPLETEApprox.
