  "description": "Adeline  It was completely unexpected. I’d never imagined he would come into my life. From the moment I met him, I knew there was no going back. He made me feel things I had never experienced before: Safety Love Happiness  I was floating on air. Nothing could touch me with him by my side. He became my everything.   Smiley  I’d never expected my life to change upon walking into the Devil Souls MC. At first glance, I almost fell on my ass, and I knew I had to have her. She was everything I never knew I wanted, and hell if that didn’t stir something in me. Adeline gave me something I had been missing my whole life: Passion Desire Contentment  I’m the retired president of the Grim Sinners MC but, in the end, you never really leave. The Devil Souls and The Grim Sinners were brought together to fight the biggest battle yet.  We had to protect our families at any cost.",
