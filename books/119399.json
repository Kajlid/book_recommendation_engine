  "description": "Christophe wants nothing more than to be a simple country priest. When he refuses to sleep with a corrupt Cardinal, he's forced to work in the same manor as the man who almost tempted him away from the cloth when they were younger. Alain was Christophe's true love, but Christophe chose to join the priesthood rather than be with him. Alain bitterly remembers Christophe's rejection. He accepts the Cardinal's assignment: destroy Christophe's career with a scandal. Will his cruel conviction hold once Alain learns how devastated Christophe was to have to deny his feelings for him?",
