  "description": "Picking up where the first Thank You Notes left off, Jimmy Fallon has many more people and things to thank. He addresses some 200 new subjects in need of his undying \"gratitude.\" Each page will feature one note and a photograph of its recipient.\"Thank you, gift bags, for saying \"I care enough to put your gift in a slightly fancier bag than the one I bought it in.\"\"Thank you, people whose Facebook profile picture is them as a baby, for basically saying, \"Here's the last time I wasn't ugly.\"\"Thank you, women who walk around with their yoga mats in slings, for either looking like an unemployed archer or a bazooka smuggler.\"HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE THEME TO PLAY? HERE IS HOW TO MASTER \"THE PINCH\"1. Put the tip of your left thumb on the \"Pinch Here\" black dot on the inside cover2. Put the tip of your index finger on the front cover, opposing your thumb tip3. USE FINGER TIPS ONLY, AND PINCH HARD4. If that doesn't work, try a few other places right around the black dot until you find the sensor5. PINCH AWAY!",
