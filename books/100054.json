  "description": "Miranda, a quirky, strong-minded and lovable young woman, splurges her inheritance on the old Miranda Bay Sanatorium in the sub-tropical Bay of Islands, New Zealand, simply because it bears her name.She knows little about running a business and depends heavily on loyal cousin Pansy's expertise.In her frantic drive for success Miranda hires a motley crew to get cracking on the property.Hamilton, her lascivious financial adviser, seizes the opportunity to undermine her.But now with paying guests expected, she must make some serious decisions.So the guests trickle in - hardly the sophisticates Miranda has envisaged.At the brink of despair, she experiences deepening depression and manic behavior.She contrives an outlandish economic solution to the problem.What follow is intrigue and terror, and an emotional and tender unfolding of events in the face of financial ruin.Witty and wicked, scandalous and scary, this is a story to make you laugh and cry.",
