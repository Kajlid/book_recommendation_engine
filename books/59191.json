  "title": "Restoring North America's Birds: Lessons from Landscape Ecology",
  "description": "This accessible book draws on recent research on bird species and their habitats to explain how basic principles of bird ecology and landscape ecology can help us create scientifically sound plans for protecting and restoring the rich diversity of North American birds. This edition includes an afterword that reviews noteworthy literature that has appeared since the first edition was completed in 1999. This new material—on such key issues as the importance of preserving large expanses of natural habitat, the importance of maintaining early successional habitats, and the habitat requirements of neotropical migrants—shows how the research on landscape ecology of birds has shaped conservation policy more rapidly than most would have predicted.Praise for the earlier edition:\"This book is first-rate—very broad in scope and appeal, readable, and truly integrative in its coverage of landscape ecology and its implications for avian conservation biology. . . . It will be of significant interest to researchers and students of conservation biology, ornithology and ecology; land managers; conservation agencies; and anyone with an interest in protecting the rich avian diversity of North America.\"—Trevor E. Pitcher, American Scientist\"This wonderful book . . . is especially relevant for conservation biologists from all walks of life.\"—Kathryn E. Sieving, Auk\"An enjoyable read for anyone, from the amateur birder to the professional scientist.\"—J. Michael Reed, Ecology",
