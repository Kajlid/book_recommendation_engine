  "title": "The Fifth Element",
  "description": "Every five thousand years, a door opens between the dimensions. In one dimension lies the universe and all of its multitude of varied life forms.  In another exists an element made not of earth, air, fire or water, but of an anti-energy, anti-life. This \"thing\", this darkness, waits patiently at the threshold of the universe for an opportunity to extinguish all life and all light. Every five thousand years, the universe needs a hero, and in New York City of the 23rd Century, a good hero is hard to find. The Fifth Element, a timeless story about love and survival, heroes and villains, good and evil, set in a strangely familiar yet intoxicatingly different 23rd Century. The film stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Milla Jovovich. The Fifth Element is written directed by Luc Besson, the visually innovative director of La Femme Nikita and The Professional.",
