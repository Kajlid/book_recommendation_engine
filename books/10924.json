  "description": "In a fractured land ruled by warring clans and a mysterious order of priests known as the Elds, a storm is brewing. One which threatens to change the face of the great island nation of Kelidon forever. In the eye of this storm rests a dark omen, Clan Darmah, and the Elds with their silent gods. Powerful magic holds the land in its brutal fist, while remnants of a broken clan fight to renew their standing among the peopleâ€”the outcome altogether uncertain. Once again, an ancient legend rides the wild winds of the world and its focus lies in the heart of this nation. It is known to a few as the Wild Power, The Hand of Skyfire, or Hammer of the Gree, but it is known by all as a Stormwalker. Nothing but destruction will follow in its wake and any mortal foolish enough to ally with its cause will be trapped by that destruction. Jorgan Darmah is such a mortal. Placing his hope and the future of Clan Darmah in the hands of this unwieldy being, he knowingly sets a course that may curse all of Kelidon to an abominable end.",
