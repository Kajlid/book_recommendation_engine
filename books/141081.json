  "title": "The Trial",
  "description": "Written in 1914, The Trial is one of the most important novels of the twentieth century. It is the terrifying tale of Josef K., a respectable bank officer who is arrested on a charge that is never identified or explained. Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism, Kafka's nightmare resonates with chilling truth. Newly designed and typeset in a modern 6-by-9-inch format by Waking Lion Press.",
