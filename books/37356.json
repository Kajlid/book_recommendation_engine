  "description": "Remembrance is the tale of a woman who has forgotten who she is, where she is and how she lost the love of her life. She wonders where she took the path that led her away from her dreams. She is living a life she doesn't remember or understand. She struggles to unravel her current life and let go of the one she left behind. She's continually re-living her past. The problem Viv faces is that she can't help but look back even though she has what every girl wants, a loving and devoted husband. But is that really enough or does she need the one from her dreams, the one she left in the past?",
