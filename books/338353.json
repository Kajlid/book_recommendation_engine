  "description": "Esmay Suiza had surprised everyone by becoming the youngest and lowest-ranking member of Fleet ever to win a major battle. She'd had no choice - it was do or die. And she'd risen to the challenge but instead of congratulations, her boldness reaps her as much trouble as reward. When a personal enemy is abducted, Esmay is suspected of collusion. She feels she can formulate a rescue plan - but will anyone in Fleet listen to her now?",
