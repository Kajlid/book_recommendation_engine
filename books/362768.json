As they travel endless lakes and rivers, the arduous expedition takes its toll.Yet the attraction between Simon and Christian, two men from vastly different worlds, grows ever stronger. Locked in a battle against the wilderness and elements, how long can they fight their desire for each other?Note: This gay historical romance from Keira Andrews features adventure in the wilderness, outdoor sex, and a happy ending.
