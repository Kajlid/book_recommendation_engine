  "description": "Dave Weinstein is angry. He is frustrated, confused, baffled, and quite frequently, very funny. He is also a general practitioner. These are his confessions. A woman troubled by pornographic dreams about Tom Jones. An 80 year-old man who can't remember why he's come to see the doctor. A woman with a common cold demanding (but not receiving) antibiotics. A man with a sore knee. A young woman who has been trying to conceive for a while but now finds herself pregnant and isn't sure she wants to go through with it. A 7-year-old boy with \"tummy aches\" that don't really exist. These are his patients. A witty insight into the life of a family doctor, this funny and moving account will change the way you look at yourÂ doctor next time you pop in with the sniffles.",
