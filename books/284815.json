  "description": "Dr. Watson is gazing out the window at 221B Baker Street on a snowy and cold winter morning and remarks to his friend Holmes that \"there is a madman coming along.\" He's about 50, portly, and running precariously on the slippery sidewalk. Of course we know he's coming to the home of the famous detective and bringing a perplexing problem. It turns out that he's a banker, and an attempt was made to steal an almost priceless crown entrusted to him. He urgently needs help. Sherlock Holmes is the brilliant detective who, with the help of his friend, Dr. Watson analyzes and solves each mystery he is asked to consult on. Holmes is noted for saying, \"It's elementary my dear Watson,\" as he reduces the clues coming to the only logical conclusion.
