  "description": "I had given up on finding my mate.There wasn't much to find at all on Drover's Creek farm except cattle and dry grass. But there was plenty of work for a dingo like me, herding over great distances in the harsh Australian sun. The alpha had strict rules. Especially stay away from the horses and their riders - easily spooked by our shifting canine scent. A rule I followed, until I was drawn to her. The new jillaroo. What was I supposed to do when getting close to my mate could be the very thing that puts her safety at risk?",
