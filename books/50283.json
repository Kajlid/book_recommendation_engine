  "description": "There are many different places you can go to after you die. One such place is PUNK LAND, the punk version of Heaven. It is an anarchist's utopia of independence and individuality, where the parties are wild and the music is fierce, where everyone is allowed to be whoever they want to be... or, at least, that's how it was in the beginning. Now, something is different about Punk Land. It doesn't seem to be the same place anymore. Perhaps it's the new punk handbook that everyone must follow, which explains what is punk and what isn't. Or maybe it's the introduction of the punk point system, where every citizen must retain a certain number of punk points or lose their citizenship. It could be the organization of the Punk Police, which enforces punk behavior and mohawk size. Or there might just be something wrong with the Punk Council, the new corporate government of Punk land. Either way, Punk Land just doesn't seem to be very punk anymore...The story follows Goblin, a deformed young hermit with a meat-mohawk who is perfectly happy haunting an abandoned gatehouse far outside of civilization with his pet dildo, Frog Strips, until two strangers named Nan and Mortician arrive at his doorstep with a crazy story that turns his quiet post-life existence upside-down. Goblin soon finds himself mixed up in a war between corporate punks and traditional punks that he really couldn't care less about. But without the help of Goblin, Mortician's sperm, and a blue-mohawked female assassin named Shark Girl, the utopian anarchy in Punk Land will surely be lost.",
