  "title": "I've Been Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart: The 100 Worst Songs Ever",
  "description": "Every day, in studios around the world, good songs are flushed down the toilet due to bad production, bad singing and, often, bad hair. But the truth is, some of those songs truly deserved it ...When it comes to music, what inspires euphoria in one person may induce nausea and vomiting in another. Pressing on regardless, the author of this small but opinionated book argues his case against the 100 worst songs ever written, songs that should have been flushed away with the remains of last night's vindaloo.I've Been Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart is a catastrophic catalogue of overblown pretension, bad rhymes, stupid lyrics and cynical, sick-making, syrupy pap. Whether you're a fan or foe of songs like 'Achy Breaky Heart' or 'I've Never Been to Me', you'll find something to take issue with in this disparaging, nit-picking and hilarious book.",
