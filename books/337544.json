  "description": "We all know of the fairy-tale,We thought we knew the end,But 20 years have come to passAnd Malice’s gone around the bend.Safe inside her padded cell,Her arms strapped up real tight,Only the spiders come to callAnd ask if she’s alright.Yet through her haze of anti-psychoticsAnd trauma-induced cackle,A pair of boys she’d never forgottenReturn to break her shackles.So if you really want to know the endThen you’d better come inside,To learn what happened to the delusional girlWho wish she could have died.Trigger Warning: Unlike the original, all characters in this spin-off retelling are very much adult. Expect steamy scenes, exaggerated episodes, ridiculous rhymes and apparently, alluring alliteration throughout.",
