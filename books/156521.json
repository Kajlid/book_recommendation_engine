  "title": "The Jesus Command: The Mark of Discipleship",
  "description": "When asked about discipleship what do we say to others... What do we tell ourselves... What answers do we give? The real answer, the only one that really carries any weight, and the one we all should seek an understanding for is found in this broader question. How did Jesus use the term, and... what did He intend for us to understand about it? This was the starting point of our study, a study which took the words spoken by Jesus to those who could clearly be identified as His closest Disciples, to try and form the answer. The key is in first being willing, and then obedient to the pattern that Jesus, Himself laid down. The New Testament is full of instruction of how we, as \"Christ Followers\", are to regard one another. Our study and discussions took these instructions as a guide. They formed the pattern of our attempt to better understand this \"The Jesus Command\" and the qualities necessary for Christ following.",
