  "description": "At nineteen, young Pharaoh Tutankhamun struggles to restore his country’s economy in the wake of the Exodus of the Hebrews while gaining control of the nation he rules and determining who to trust. With his sister-queen at his side and his cane in his hand, he faces the challenges of each day, doing his best to become the Pharaoh Egypt needs. If the gods loved Tut, why had they given him a twisted foot? Despite his youth, he finds himself thrust into the dangerous world of politics, playing a deadly game with courtiers who have been part of the royal court longer than he has. Meanwhile, Tut finds himself beginning to doubt in the Egyptian gods who never answer his prayers, the gods his own father had turned away from in his worship of the mysterious Aten. He remembers whispered stories of plague upon plague, stories of divine power that his courtiers don’t want to discuss. Through it all, Tutankhamun wonders how to establish his legacy as the strong Pharaoh he longs to become. And when his trusted Grand Vizier suggests he lead Egypt’s armies into battle, the young King has a decision to make, a decision that threatens his very survival.",
