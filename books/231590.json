  "title": "Grudge: Operation Highjump",
  "description": "In 1946 the United States Navy conducted Operation Highjump, an expedition to evaluate the effect of extreme Antarctic cold on US equipment. However, their true purpose remains shrouded in mystery. Were the reports of Nazi activity on the Southern Continent accurate? After engaging unknown forces in aerial combat, weather forced the Navy to abandon operations. Undeterred, the US returned every Antarctic summer until escalating tensions in Southeast Asia forced the government to secretly detonate three nuclear warheads over the continent in 1958. With the threat eliminated, the files were sealed and forgotten by all but the men who fought there. Now the enemy has returned with a genetically superior army, indoctrinated from birth to hate Americans for their savagery, and theyâ€™re intent on exacting revenge for the loss of their homeland and banishment to the icy wastes.",
