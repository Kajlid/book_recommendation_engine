  "description": "In Zane Grey's only Western told from the first person perspective, a U.S. Deputy Marshall helps legendary Texas Ranger Vaugn Steele to clean up the lawless town of Fairfield. Though the town's mayor is in cahoots with a band of outlaws, Steele falls in love with his daughter and the Marshall falls in love with his niece. An unusual psychological depth sets this tale apart from the majority of Westerns.This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.
