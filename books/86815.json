  "description": "Johnny has spent thirty-two years trying to do what’s expected of him. When he finds himself divorced, overweight, living with his parents again, and losing the job he’s had since leaving school, it’s the wake-up call he needs to start taking charge of his life. It's time to do what he wants -- if only he can figure out just what that is.Choosing to go looking for his brother Joey, who he hasn't seen or spoken to for eight years, he follows a postmark on a Christmas card to the seaside town of Anwell-by-Sea. Joey isn't that difficult to find and comes complete with boyfriend Dave, Dave's Uncle Ed, and a rather large and very bad tempered arsehole called Charlie.Johnny is happy to find Joey and enjoys meeting Dave and Uncle Ed; but he's pretty glad to see the back of Charlie. Despite Charlie being an unpleasant git, Johnny can't wait to get back to Anwell-by-Sea with his kids for an Easter break, and maybe he can make some progress on his to-do list by then, too.",
