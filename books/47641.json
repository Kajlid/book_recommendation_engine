Universal in its appeal, this story beautifully depicts a child's wonder at a new world, and the hope of capturing and keeping that wonder forever. This big, sturdy edition will bring even more young readers to the story of Peter and his adventures in the snow.Ezra Jack Keats was also the creator of such classics as Goggles , A Letter to Amy , Pet Show! , Peter’s Chair , and A Whistle for Willie . (This book is also available in Spanish, as Un dia de nieve. ) Praise for The Snowy Day :“Keats made Peter’s world so inviting that it beckons us. Perhaps the busyness of daily life in the 21st century makes us appreciate Peter even more—a kid who has the luxury of a whole day to just be outside, surrounded by snow that’s begging to be enjoyed.” — The Atlantic\"Ezra Jack Keats's classic The Snowy Day , winner of the 1963 Caldecott Medal, pays homage to the wonder and pure pleasure a child experiences when the world is blanketed in snow.\"— Publisher's Weekly",
