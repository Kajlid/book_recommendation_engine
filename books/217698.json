  "description": "*** THIS IS A RERELEASE OF A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED BOOK ***  Dr. Joyce Yards has never met anyone as sexy or as irresistible as 466. He refuses to discuss anything except getting her naked beneath him. Their therapy sessions are growing hotter, his raw hunger for her is becoming aggressive, and she is falling for him. Joy knows the dire consequences if she gives in to desire. It will break her heart but she must walk away.  Moon has been drugged. He is feral and dangerous to everyone. The NSO doctors turn to the only female Moon ever cared about—the one who left him in the desert two years ago.  Moon isn’t the same male Joy once knew but she is willing to put her life on the line for him. There are no rules now. If sex tames the wild beast and triggers his fractured memories, allowing him moments of lucidity, then Joy will give him her body and her soul. She’ll do whatever it takes to save him.",
