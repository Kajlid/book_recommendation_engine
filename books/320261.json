  "description": "One minute I’m running a cupcake café and the next someone is trying to kill me!Enter the attractive, but heavily conceited vampire who I once mistakenly went on a disastrous date with. He has a deal I can’t refuse. I can either a) fake date him and he can be my 24-hour bodyguard or b) I can probably die.It’s a tough choice given how much I detest him, but I plump for staying alive.So now Lawrie is a permanent fixture in Gnarly Fell and I’m in a race against time to find out who wants me dead. Because vampires live a hell of a long time, and this situation already sucks.Just like my fake boyfriend.Welcome to Gnarly Fell, where Death lingers just outside the village (with his girlfriend).",
