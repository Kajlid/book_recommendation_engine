  "description": "Domn Bestie was born in blood, raised by a group of the deadliest assassins in the world, and then thrown out into the world to fend for himself at the age of 12. He makes his way to the city of Grim Dudgeon in Otherworld in hopes of finding sanctuary, only to find more danger. A fearsome gang of kidnappers rule Grim Dudgeon, but when they try to kidnap Domn, things do not go as planned. 12 years of training under the harsh tutelage of the Sisterhood of Death, an overwhelming impulse to see justice done, and the iron will of a survivor have made the boy a force to be reckoned with.  Now hunted by the most feared gang in Grim Dudgeon, spell slingers, and demons, the young boy learns quickly that the only thing in Otherworld that is easy is dying. Welcome to Grim Dudgeon. Here there be monsters.",
