  "description": "Matthias has spent his whole life on the edge of a very small world. The bastard child of a fallen woman, his magical talents as still unseen, he's known nothing but judgment and hatred from the harsh, religious people of his enclave-except for Balthazar. The son and heir of the High Elder, Balthazar shows Matthias kindness, and love...and desire. When the High Elder discovers what his son has been doing, Matthias is arrested and sent to an isolated prison known simply as \"The School.\" There, and in the wastelands beyond, Matthias learns the secrets behind the hypocrisies of the Council of Elders, and discovers his true heritage, true power, and true love.",
