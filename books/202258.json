Now, with looters descending and violence erupting in the streets, Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Detective Dave Robicheaux combs the apocalyptic landscape for a quartet of criminals who hijacked a rescue boat from a drug-addicted ex-priest at the height of the storm, and then scooped up a gangster’s hidden fortune. In a world without order or sanctuary, revenge will come swift and easy . . . but only Robicheaux can infiltrate the shattered heart of the city he loves to forge his own kind of justice.",
