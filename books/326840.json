  "description": "She’s my cousin.A cousin through marriage, not blood, but the family won’t see it that way.And in my world, family means everything. At least...I always thought so. Being part of a large mafia family is my right, my duty, and my calling.Adopted at fifteen by my uncle, I became a Sabino.Everything I am is because of how they trained me.I’m a man with only one weakness…her.Now she’s in trouble because she’s spoiled, impulsive…intoxicating. When the situation gets out of hand, I know I have to help her. Which is a terrible idea. Because I don’t know how much longer I can resist her…*Keeping Harmony is a full-length enemies-to-lovers forbidden romance that is intended for mature readers. This is book three in the Denver Series and should be read after Beautifully Broken. If you are not a fan of morally grey alphaholes or sassy, feisty females, then you should keep scrolling. This book will contain themes that some readers may find triggering or offensive, such as dark themes, sexual/violent content, excessive swearing, and smouldering heat. If you’re still here and interested, buckle up, it’s going to be a bumpy ride..",
