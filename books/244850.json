  "description": "What is the correct etiquette for visiting a brothel? How should one react when a transsexual wants to show off her latest surgery? Is it appropriate to speak to television personalities when theyâ€™re buying underwear? These are the questions that matter in London's Soho neighborhood, where Clayton Littlewood runs the cult clothing store Dirty White Boy. From his window on one of the busiest street corners in the world, Littlewood watches the daily parade of fashion queens, prostitutes, gangsters, and celebrities that make up the population of this strangest of villages. Dirty White Boy is a vivid mosaic of modern London, caught between the ghosts of the past and the uncertainties of the future. With an unforgettable cast of characters ranging from Chico the camp queen to Pam the Fag Lady (with guest spots by stars like Kathy Griffin and Graham Norton), these compulsively readable true tales offer a wry panorama of Soho's rich and often raucous subcultures.",
