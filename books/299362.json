  "title": "Sophie's Key",
  "description": "After inheriting a long-abandoned farm, Sophie Sanders trades her empty existence for a fresh start in Utah. Moments into her new life, she uncovers a wooden screen door that sends her spiraling into 1901 where she meets Texas Ranger and widower, Jacob Warren. When an injury leaves Sophie reliant on Jacob and his hospitality, she resolves to keep her time-traveling secret. Before long, she finds herself falling for the rugged Texas Ranger despite her modern sensibilities constantly being at odds with his old-fashioned values. When the only thing that keeps her anchored in the past, a silver skeleton key given to her by a Romani woman, is taken during an attack, Sophie must depend on Jacob to help her get it back. The strength of their newly formed bond is tested as they race to discover who’s behind a string of accidents and recover Sophie’s key before time runs out.",
