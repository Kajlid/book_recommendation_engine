  "description": "TRAVI remember the first time I met Dylan Rodriguez. It was one sweaty encounter I’ll never forget.The second time we met, he arrested me. I can still see the hot scowl on his beautiful face as he slapped handcuffs on me and realized I was … me.Dylan’s main goal in life is to forget he ever met me. My goal is to make him mine.Turns out, I'm better at this game than he is.DYLANWhen my law enforcement career falls to pieces in front of my own eyes, I don’t know who I can trust.I have nowhere to go. No one to turn to.Asking Trav for help is a last resort, but I’m desperate.If he can’t get me out of this mess, I may as well turn myself over to the guys hunting me down.I’m not sure which will be more protecting my life or my heart.Because when it comes to love, my heart wants what my brain doesn’t. It wants Travis West.",
