Hell, Micah isn't even gay, but he can't seem to control his reaction to the man that he knows belongs to him. Riley is a vampire doctor. He's also unconventional, secretive, and dealing with a heavy case of lust toward the warrior in his care.[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, Vampires, Demons]",
