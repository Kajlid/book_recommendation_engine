  "title": "Destiny Never Sleeps: Quest of the Two Queens",
  "description": "Four aging seniors set sail from Miami, but the intended destination will never be reached as they naively enter perilous waters. Deep within the Devil’s Triangle, terror lies in wait, and an inconceivable nightmare is about to begin. A mysterious force transports Kathleen Tate (Kat) and three lifelong companions through an ancient portal. Upon emergence, they are delighted to discover their youth has been miraculously restored. This strange parallel realm is beautiful, magical … and deadly. Two Queens — one good, one evil — will soon meet on a bloody battlefield. The quest for earthly domination, or salvation, is about to commence. Creatures of myth and legend, of land, air, and sea, unite to battle a vile malignancy. An act of valor is needed to reverse the portal and allow the foursome to return home. However, the task comes at an unbearable cost. Many lives now rest in the fateful hand of Destiny.",
