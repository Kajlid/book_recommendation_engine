  "description": "\"I fell in love with the author. A great mix of action, character development, dialogue and setting, and yes ... a bit of very painless history!\" - Vision Quest \"A well-crafted western adventure\" -Gojan Nikolich, author of The Gopher King After losing everything he held dear to the wickedness of man and the weakness of the law, Persimmon Apricot is a lost soul who places no value on the lives of callous men and little value on his own. Resistant to the label of Gunfighter, Persimmon vehemently rejects offers to be a gun for hire, preferring to drift aimlessly in a futile effort to outrun his memories. It takes a young boy and his widowed mother to give Persimmon purpose once more. Befriended by a failed writer, the pair take a reluctant journey across the country to help her. What they discover is that happiness sometimes carries a steep price tag. Saving the widow will cost more than they could have imagined. Persimmon must decide whether or not to make the purchase, even if that means paying with his life.",
