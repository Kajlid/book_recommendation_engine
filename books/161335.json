  "description": "When cult science fiction novelist Shamus Ohio wrote his latest book, Horrorcaust, he expected it to appease his publishers and earn him a small paycheck. Instead, it re-defined the public perception of the \"vampyre\" for an entire generation. With mainstream success, Shamus comes face to face with the real blood-sucking parasite: the media. Everyone wants a piece of Shamus, as the mass hysteria surrounding his novel and the fight for control of his intellectual property threaten to tear his mind and conscience apart. When fact starts mirroring fiction with deadly results, can the writer be held responsible? Can anyone achieve mainstream popularity without selling their soul? Can any piece of fiction make the leap from one medium to another with its core intact? What exactly is Parma ham, and why do people insist on serving it with rocket? All of these questions and more will be asked, if not answered. The first of a two-part satirical vampire novel, for people who may already dislike vampire fiction, new-media, the film industry, hyperbole, social media, the 24-hour news culture and other day-to-day trappings of post-millennial life. Edited by Nico Reznick, with a cover by Jay Heath.",
