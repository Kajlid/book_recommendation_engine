  "description": "This gritty dark fantasy pushes boundaries. It explores society's perception of people, taboos, and personal relationships. For mature readers. Pony is a bipedal half-centaur with no desire to waste tears on a history she cannot remember. She’s busy enough with her mail routes and package deliveries and floundering through an unrequited love for the beautiful and aloof elven courtesan, Mardyth. Then, the mundane drudgery of her life shatters when Konstantine Bywater takes over as the new boss. He starts asking questions she can’t possibly answer, and stirs up a past better left dead and buried.Running away is no longer an option. Not when Kon and his minions accuse Mardyth of an unspeakable crime. Pony will stop at nothing to uncover the truth—not only to prove her lover’s innocence, but to save herself as well.",
