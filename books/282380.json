  "title": "Living with Alzheimer's: A love story",
  "description": "When Robin Thomson and his wife Shoko were told she had Alzheimer's, they had no idea what lay ahead. As the disease gradually took over their lives, Robin watched as his adventurous and independent wife slowly seemed to disappear. He and their adult children faced painful and real struggles, and experienced both frustration and great support from the health and social care systems. Yet Shoko's love remained constant and Robin found himself invited into a deeply spiritual journey with his wife. This honest and hope-filled account, with its practical insights, suggestions for ways forward and advice on further resources, is a must-read for caregivers and for the friends and families of those affected by this mysterious disease. It shows how we can respond, with with fear and incomprehension but rather with heightened love and creative friendship.",
