A risky affair with a beautiful Italian the night before they leave begins to ease his survivor’s guilt.  Sophia Negri, suffering jitters over her engagement, falls for the handsome SEAL and pretends she speaks no English, letting their bodies do the talking. When Marc finds her on the ship and learns Sophia is half American, he is angry at first, but falls for her all over again as they set sail.  Terrorists take over the ship and hold the passengers for ransom, Marc and the other SEALs are the only ones who can stop the plot.
