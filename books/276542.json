Howtown finds Rios back in his hometown of Los Robles, California defending Paul Windsor, a boyhood acquaintance accused of murdering a pedophile. Windsor is himself a pedophile, and the police believe the murder was the result of an extortion scheme gone wrong. It’s up to Rios to prove otherwise, if he can. To do that, he has to confront the ghosts of his past that still linger in the sleepy river town. Simultaneously, the novel explores Rios’s relationship with his HIV-positive lover, Josh Mandel. This is a revised edition with an author's endnote.",
