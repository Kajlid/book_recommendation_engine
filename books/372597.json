  "title": "The Bad Advice of Grandma Hasenfuss",
  "description": "Danny Hasenfuss needs some good advice. A gang of kids at school are bullying him. Grandma Hasenfuss has plenty of ideas, but somehow everything Danny tries just seems to make things crazier. You'll hear all about it as you read Danny and his Grandma's e-mail messages to each other. How many black eyes can there be at one school? Why does the lunch lady keeps flinging utensils? What’s so scary about “Twinkle twinkle little star?” What should you do when you’re stuck in a basketball hoop ten feet off the ground? But then, what kind of advice do you think you’re going to get from a Grandma who swats lightning with a pillow, plays jazz trombone, rappels from the fire escape with her bathrobe tie, and crochets a bear trap? It’s going to be a crazy month at Edgar Middle School. And this book contains exciting vocabulary up to and including \"floccinaucinihilipilification!\"",
