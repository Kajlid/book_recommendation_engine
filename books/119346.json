  "description": "*This novella takes place during Bluewing, #4 in The Frost Chronicles series*  Adam Brewer has a past, and he doesn't like to speak about it. Few know his journey from refugee to Thorns agent. Even fewer know the extent of his feelings for a certain fierce young woman. Stuck in a prison cell, he must stay sane...and hold on to hope that he'll see her again.  Author's Note: This novella reveals a bit of Adam’s complicated past and contains spoilers through book #4 (Bluewing) of The Frost Chronicles. I suggest reading it after you’ve read at least Frost, Thorns, Weavers, and Bluewing!  (If you have read the entire series, including Aeralis, you can still enjoy this story just fine.)",
