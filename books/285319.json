But when the daughter he rarely sees is abandoned by her mother, Dylan heads home to Stillwater Springs ranch. Somehow the champion bull rider has to turn into a champion father--and fast. Town librarian Kristy Madison is uncharacteristically speechless when Dylan Creed turns up for story time with a toddler in tow. The man who'd left a trail of broken hearts--including her own--is back...and this time Kristy's determined to tame his wild ways once and for all.",
