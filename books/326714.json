  "description": "The flatmates at York Street are broke and desperate, so they take in a new guy despite the Celine Dion albums and the hoardes of fluffy stuffed animals. Soon he goes missing, with half the household possessions and all the rent. The flatmates have one week to sober up, find two thousand dollars and catch the runaway before Pauline Hansen, the federal government, assorted cops and crims, their landlord and some very angry lesbians tear their house down and stomp them to jelly.",
