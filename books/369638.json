This time the Empire will not stop until a black and gold flag waves over Stenwold’s own home city of Collegium.Tisamon the Weaponsmaster is faced with a terrible a path that could lead him to abandon his friends and his daughter, to face degradation and loss, that might possibly bring him before the Wasp Emperor with a blade in his hand—but is he being driven by Mantis-kinden honor, or manipulated by something more sinister?",
