  "description": "They say that behind every great man is a great woman…but what if that woman is a Werewolf? \nTHIS IS A MONSTER BOOK - We have taken pains to price the book low.  (Craig is crying in the corner, don't mention I reduced it to what you see).\nThe readers LOVE the Nomad!\n\n“This series is one of the best I’ve ever read.” “This is the series that keeps on going with great writing and wonderful characters.” “I absolutely love this series, and hate the wait at the same time between books.”\n\nThe Forsaken have gone into hiding, and Terry sends the Force de Guerre’s tactical teams on missions around the globe to root the evil ones out. When Ted can no longer keep the pod flying, things heat up quickly in a race to corner and finish Mister Smith.\nNomad’s Force starts nearly one-hundred years before Michael’s return to earth and the events that happen in Justice Is Calling.What does the mundane look like when gearing up for war? This snippet is a taste of that. How can TH keep the blade sharp when no enemy stands before him? What will his kids do? Always his children, but not children. \nThe FDG finds out how small they really are when they have to search the world for their enemy. And the New Schwabenland pod is getting old and doesn't charge like it used to. Is Terry's dominance waning?",
