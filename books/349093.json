  "description": "The Savage Mandarin could be your neighbor...Nicholas Coad, the Savage Mandarin: detached, scientific, 'converted' into a state of 'sublime, cosmic indifference'. He is working on a unique project – the 'conversion' and liberation of the soul or Higher Self from chains of physical bondage. His 'patient' is his good-natured neighbour, Rogers, up-and-coming ad-man. Rogers does not realise that his piercing headaches are caused by the fearsome, hypnotic machinery in Coad's flat. But as Coad brings him further along the path to liberation, he has no choice. After all, his brain now resembles a chunk of Gruyére cheese...Bizarre, weird, scathingly satiric and terrifyingly convincing, Masque of a Savage Mandarin is a modern masterpiece of offbeat science fiction.",
