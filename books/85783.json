  "description": "A young boy from Brooklyn comes of age in the first play in Neil Simon’s semi-autobiographical “Eugene Trilogy”—followed by Biloxi Blues and Broadway Bound .Meet Eugene Jerome and his family, fighting the hard times and sometimes each other—with laughter, tears, and love. It is 1937 in Brooklyn during the heart of the Depression. Fifteen-year-old Eugene Jerome lives in Brighton Beach with his family. He is witty, perceptive, obsessed with sex, and forever fantasizing his baseball-diamond triumphs as star pitcher for the New York Yankees.As our guide through his “memoirs,” Eugene takes us through a series of trenchant observations and insights that show his family meeting life's challenges with pride, spirit, and a marvelous sense of humor. But as World War II looms ever closer, Eugene sees his own innocence slipping away as the first important era of his life ends—and a new one begins.Winner of the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award for Best Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play",
