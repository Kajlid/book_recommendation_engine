  "title": "Finding Peace, Happiness, and Joy",
  "description": "The gospel offers us the unmatched gifts of peace, happiness, and joy, but sometimes these promises seem elusive and unattainable. In his familiar, warm style, Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve outlines the truths we need to understand and embrace to live a life of peace, happiness, and joy. He covers such important topics as developing a godly character, receiving and responding to heavenly guidance, repenting of our sins, loving others, and learning to cope with what seems unfair. Using insightful stories and examples, Elder Scott mentors the reader while at the same time he teaches with profound apostolic counsel. If we will trust in the Lord's promises and accept the gifts he offers us, if we are obedient to his commandments, then we too can fulfill the scriptural declaration, \"Men are, that they might have joy.\"",
