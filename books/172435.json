  "description": "The music calls Georgie.   Every night, she stands offstage, watching Xan Valentine set fire to the crowd with music until they would burn down the city for him. His music wraps her until her fingers dance, desperately wanting the piano, but her terrified legs could never walk onto a stage.  Most nights, when Xan Valentine strides off the stage, his dark eyes shift, blurring, and he becomes Alexandre de Valentinois again.  Sometimes, Xan won’t let go.  Some of the other band members, Rade and Grayson, are caught in a death spiral of booze, drugs, and groupies. The drummer, Tryp, is too infatuated with his new wife to do more than show up to play.  Xan is the only one who can compel them onto the stage. He’s holding Killer Valentine together with the force of his will.  This can’t go on.   Something has to break.",
