  "description": "Scorchwood Supernatural Penitentiary is Hell. Literally, it’s in Hell.\n\nOf all the things to end up in jail for, embezzling wasn’t what I thought would bring me down. I’ve got a pretty healthy arson and murder hobby on my down time. White collar crimes never go to Scorchwood. I should have been given a fee and probation at most. Something is going on. My cell mate, Skoll is an Alpha wolf in for manslaughter. He wants me to meet Roman, a vampire and Amduscias, demon who is really shifty about what his demonic form is.Something fishy is going down in Scorchwood with the elementals. Skoll’s last five cellmates were elementals who were framed for white collar crimes. Amduscias is cellmates with one of the worst elemental women in the entire jail and she is not pleased I’ve made friends with him.Something is going on. Someone is framing elementals and sending them to Scorchwood. But they made a mistake framing me. They didn’t know about my little hobbies before they sent me here. They didn’t know about Fergus, my fire dragon.\n\nThere’s so much I don’t know about why I’m here, but there’s so much they don’t know about me too. I’ve made friends in Scorchwood and I don’t call myself Elemental Batman in secret for nothing. This should be fun.",
