The one person she dreaded seeing and wanted to see the most.He was still as gorgeous as the first time they had met. Muscular, tall, with his golden brown eyes that said more than what he spoke. They're opposites in so many ways. He was closed off, and so utterly irritating the last time she was around him. He was rude and bossy but the one man she had been dreaming about for the last year. Now that she's back in Lakefield, Julia is getting to know the real Holden. He's resorting to blackmail, physical dominance and isn't listening to her protests. He's the one that tempts her with his vulgar mouth and makes her body sing like no other man. She can't decide whether to punch him or kiss him. Maybe both.They're up against stalkers, the media, and a lot of bizarre circumstances as she makes a decision about her music career. But he's making his intent crystal clear: he’ll protect her, possess her, and make her beg.Everyone hides something. Julia should know. She's been trying to hide from her past for the last year. But this troublesome, mischievous man, may not let her hide any longer.**Full-length standalone romance. 70,000+ words. No cheating, or cliffhangers with a Happily Ever After! Suggested 18+.",
