The new beginning is off to a rocky start, however, when Mark gets too familiar with Gabe Tennert’s horses. It’s obvious their next-door neighbor prefers his solitude. Even so, he shows incredible patience with Mark. And when Gabe turns that intense gaze Ciara’s way…how can she resist such a good, sexy man? But crossing the line between friends and something more is riskier than Ciara expects. As Gabe pushes for a commitment, she fears revealing her secret truths could turn him away forever.",
