  "description": "When James Peter Matthews, a senior at Tech U. , confesses to his parents that he is an atheist…well they don’t take the news very well. His Mom cried for a week, his name was plastered all over the church prayer lists, and his entire family was on his case about it. After several weeks of vainly trying to convince his family that he was right, James has an ingenious (and admittedly crazy) idea – travel forward in time and bring back irrefutable evidence that God doesn’t exist. Will James’ plan succeed? Can he actually manage to travel forward in time? And if so, will he find the answers that he seeks, or merely more questions? Come follow James’ thought provoking, yet humorous, tale and find out.",
