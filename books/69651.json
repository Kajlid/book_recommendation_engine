  "description": "Jeni Acerna's longstanding friends-with-benefits relationship with her bestie, Brian Hamilton, has been both blissful and troublesome. Unable to commit to any other relationship, she compares everyone to Brian in or out of bed. She has been in lust (and love) with him for years. Fear of losing him has prevented her from confronting him with her feelings.After several months of not seeing each other, Jeni and Brian meet in Cleveland for a friendâ€™s wedding. Their weekend getaway, however, is anything but normal. A five hundred dollar bet. A tryst in a garden. Their passion picks up where it left off - hot and heavy. However, this time Brian wants more than Jeni just in his bed. Can he can convince her to take the risk?",
