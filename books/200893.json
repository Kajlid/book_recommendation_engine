  "description": "Rachael Rose was living la dolce vita in Italy until she lost her restaurant and her boyfriend. Under a cloud of public shame, she crawls back home to New York and the life she never thought she’d have to live again. But soon she’s given a chance at redemption with a job offer from one of the most celebrated chefs in the world.  Dante Coppola had built a very successful career on his discerning palette and keen business sense. Then, one night, in a desperate attempt to assuage the pain of losing his wife, he goes home with a mysterious woman he meets at a bar. The passion only lasted one night, but the consequences change his life forever... and turn him into something that is barely human.  Dante now has to put his trust in a failed chef no one seems to have any faith in, not even Rachael herself, but along the way, he soon learns that his restaurant is not the most precious thing he has given Rachael.  Can Dante and Rachael make it work, or are they both too shattered to even believe in love again?",
