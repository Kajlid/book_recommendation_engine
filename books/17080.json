  "title": "Stand & Deliver: The Autobiography",
  "description": "One of the most successful pop stars of the 1980s, Adam Ant's face adorned posters on teenagers' walls from Acton to Akron. His wholly original look, based on a mixture of warrior, dandy, eighteenth-century cavalry officer and punk marked him out as a true pop icon.Now in this revealing autobiography he tells for the first time the full story of his amazing life, from a childhood scarred by his father's violence to his time as a King's Road Punk and his creation of a unique musical style that brought him a string of hits (both singles and albums). Adam's success was so great that one night even Michael Jackson called him for advice on clothes and music. His sex appeal was legendary and his many girlfriends included Amanda Donahoe, Jamie Lee Curtis and Heather Graham.Adam also writes honestly about the more painful episodes in his life: the imprisonment of his father, gruelling encounters with stalkers, and his battle with bi-polar disorder that has brought him suicidal depressions, public humiliation and the difficult and painful realization that he has an illness that needs constant monitoring and medicating.At times funny, at other times tragic, Stand and Deliver is a gripping account of the turbulent life and times of one of music's most fascinating figures.",
