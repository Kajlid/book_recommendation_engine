  "description": "Colton Alcott was a soldier with no family. The Army was not just his career; it was his life and the only thing he felt he needed. When he agreed to go home with his battle-buddy prior to deploying to Afghanistan, he had no idea that a single night with a woman he intended to be a one-night stand would become his beacon in the night. When his career is unexpectedly cut short and his inner demons threaten to consume him, he finds the comradery and brotherhood he thought he had lost with the Demented Sons Motorcycle Club. Stephanie Quinn was focused on her college graduation and the beginning of her culinary dreams. When her best friend, and roommate, dragged her to the big end-of-the-year party, she planned to hang out for a little while and then head home. Alone. What she didn’t anticipate was that the blue-eyed stranger she brought home would leave her with an unexpected surprise. A surprise destined to change both of their lives. Can two star-crossed lovers overcome the obstacles of fate and find one another in the vast ocean of life? Colton’s Salvation is a story of love lost, second chances, and the unforeseen salvation of a single tormented soul by an unexpected, but precious, gift.",
