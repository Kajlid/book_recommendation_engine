Now he’s shattered us beyond repair.  He sacrificed his freedom to give me mine, only to have our bond completely broken. I lost him just when I truly found him. I need to bring him back to me, to save him from the fate he set for himself, and most of all, to find a cure.  Since all this began, I’ve been their prey, but the tables have turned and this time, I’m the hunter. The Blackthorne vampires won’t take anything from me again.",
