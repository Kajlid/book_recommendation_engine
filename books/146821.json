  "description": "Megan Peterson's life is far from quiet - between studying for her Master's degree, volunteering at a low income clinic and helping her best friend Tom raise his daughter since their mother died two years earlier, Megan has had absolutely no time for a relationship herself.  Her friends all tell her Tom is perfect for her: the billionaire owner of a tech company, a loving single dad and the sweetest man Megan has every known. But she knows their relationship is strictly platonic, and doesn't want to even risk ruining what they have for a shot at love.  But when Tom's brother and business partner Jake shows up at her door, gorgeous smile and all, and asks her out, Megan says yes in a moment of weakness. After all, it's been over a year since she's been on a date, can't a girl have a little fun? But Jake's a known monogamist, womanizing playboy. Will Megan be able to keep up with his lifestyle, or is she destined to have her heart broken by the sexy, you-only-live-once, jet setting billionaire?",
