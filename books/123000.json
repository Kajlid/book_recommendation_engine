  "description": "In the neon-lit corners of the city lies La Société de la Nuit, an exclusive nightclub known only to the elite paranormals. Delilah, a captivating succubus with secrets as ancient as her allure, finds herself managing the club when her jet-setting friend Cassin disappears to Europe. With a vision to transform the club into a haven for the queer community, Delilah, alongside Kyne, a brooding wolf-shifter, and Rayze, a cheeky ghost with a habit of becoming all too real, dives into the city's vibrant LGBTQ+ nightlife. But it's at a sultry lesbian club where Delilah's world collides with Annabelle's. With fiery red curls and a spirit to match, Bel is everything Delilah is drawn to and everything she should avoid. Because Delilah's touch is as deadly as it is tempting. Unbeknownst to Bel, she steps into a world teeming with monsters, millionaires, and mysteries when she signs up to bartend at La Société. As sparks fly and boundaries blur, dangers creep closer. Bel attracts admirers, both human and supernatural. A changeling's unsettling interest and a break-in at Bel's apartment set off alarms for Delilah. With passions and perils running high, can they navigate the line between love and danger? Dive into a tale where love defies norms, ancient lore intertwines with modern mysteries, and the night holds more than just secrets.",
