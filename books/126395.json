  "description": "Welcome to Woodbury a subdivision in the burbs where desperate housewives do desperate things. Ask Zada Clark. Zada appears in divorce court expecting to get a quickie divorce from her spur-of-the-moment marriage to her hunky ex-marine husband - a man she thought was Mr. Right until she realized Rick's first name should have been ALWAYS. Not exactly known for her own ability to compromise, their short marriage has been a disaster. EXCEPT in the bedroom. Zada insists there's more to marriage than just great sex, and wants her divorce. Now! But when a brawl over the house and the dog breaks out in the courtroom, the disgruntled judge rules that Rick and Zada have ninety days to reach a compromise or face serious repercussions. Them?Reach a compromise in ninety days?Ain't gonna happen!Rick suggests they turn the situation into something they can settle between them - a real-life game of Survivor (Zada's favorite reality show). He'll move back in, and the first one to outwit, outplay, and outlast the other - wins the house and the dog. Never one to back down from a challenge, Zada says \"game on.\" And when Rick moves back home and into the guest bedroom down the hall from hers, Zada informs Rick real quick, \"We are not going to end up in your bed or mine!\" But the burning question Will Rick be able to out-tease, out-tempt, and out-tantalize Zada into changing her mind and calling off the divorce?",
