  "description": "Every summer, fourteen-year-old Rachel leaves her home in England to stay with her grandparents in Florida. But this year, there's an exciting change when Rachel meets Jed, a brooding, cynical guitar player, and Kyle, an idealistic future soldier. Shy, lonely Rachel blossoms under the attention she receives from the boys, and she finds herself strongly drawn to both. But as the summer unfolds, so does the tension, jealousy, and attraction between them, and conflicts threaten to destroy their friendship. Things become even more complicated when Rachel is assaulted by one of Kyle's friends, spurring an explosive reaction from one of the boys, and consequences none of the three could have foreseen.",
