  "description": "It is May 1886 and all is not well at Christ Church, Oxford. The curator of Christ Church, the Reverend Mr. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known as the author Lewis Carroll), is expecting a visit from Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle - an acquaintance and would-be writer - and his wife when he learns of a series of troubling events. The wine cellar seems to have mysteriously become depleted, while some of the students and faculty have begun complaining that many small personal items - items of value - have begun disappearing from their rooms. Over at Lady Margaret Hall, one of the female students finds herself the subject of blackmail, with a photo taken of her as a child by Mr. Dodgson the object. And Lord Nevil Farlow, pressed by gambling debts and in financial difficulty, finds himself contemplating a desperate maneuver to come about. In the midst of all of this is Ingram, an insolent scout, whom Dodgson believes has been going through his things in his room and fires after a public disagreement witnessed by half the college. So that evening, when Dr. Dodgson discovers the murdered body of Ingram on the grounds, the only suspect for miles around is Dodgson himself. Now it is up to Doyle, with Dodgson's help, to find out how these various disturbances are related and uncover the truth about Ingram's murder before disgrace, or worse, lands at Dodgson's feet.",
