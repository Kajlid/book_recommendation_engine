  "title": "Breakdown Motel",
  "description": "Stranded by the side of the road with a broken down vehicle in the middle of the hot New Mexico desert, Danny Major figured that, at very least, nothing else could go wrong. Then he arrived at Motel X.Before long, the young man is captured, restrained, and pushed beyond his physical, mental, and sexual limits, thrown into a twisted world of bondage, sadomasochism, and discipline, a world where survival means submission. Can Danny escape his torturous fate? Or is he destined to be broken down into the perfect slave?[AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is an adult story focused on themes of bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism between adult men. Subject matter includes explicit sexual activity and increasingly intense BDSM scenes (captivity, fisting, dubious consent, watersports, electro-torture, enemas etc.), and is intended purely as erotic fantasy for mature readers. If such material offends you, or if it is illegal to own or read such material in the area where you live, then you should find another title.]",
