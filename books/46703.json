  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Eveline Fallon has lived her entire life on the move—and she hates it.Believing her to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, her parents have done whatever it takes to stay one step ahead of those who wish to see her dead in order to keep the prophecy unfulfilled and the doorway between the worlds closed.But Eveline isn’t fully convinced that her parents’ beliefs match her own. What she does believe is that Leadville, Colorado, and the sanctuary offered may be the chance she’s been waiting for.The chance to be somewhere safe. The chance for her to make friends and have fun. The chance to finally date a guy.The chance to be a normal girl, at least as normal as possible for someone not human.",
