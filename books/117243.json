  "description": "The homicide case that convicted young Kevin Shea and sent him to the slammer looked hopeless - and the perfect puzzle for Jane da Silva. Under the terms of an eccentric uncle's will, Jane has to right a wrong and solve an uncrackable conundrum twice a year before she can inherit the estate. With her fortieth birthday looming in the not-so-distant future and a so-so career as a cabaret singer in the fast-fading past, Jane has both an unslaked champagne taste and a willingness to risk her pretty neck snooping where nice girls don't...and earn her inheritance the hard way.As for Kevin Shea, he has had one foot firmly planted in trouble all his life. Formerly a pill-head and going-nowhere teenager, he graduated to armed robbery at a local drugstore, botching the attempt and leaving a woman dead. Kevin says he didn't shoot her. Even his own mother doesn't believe him and the DA tagged it an open and shut case. All Jane has to reopen it is a call from Kevin's lawyer. It seems there's a remote possibility that a key witness exists - somewhere.",
