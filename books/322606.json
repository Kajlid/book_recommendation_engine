  "description": "When Jenny Ashton, a beautiful and successful young business woman, begins talking to a mysterious man over the Internet, their conversations set in motion a chain of events that soon lead to her being kidnapped. Waking to find she’s been incarcerated in the cellar of a large country house, it quickly becomes clear that her captor possesses some very unorthodox tastes, which include plans to train her as his personal slave. And thus begins a psychological battle of wits, with Jenny pitting her steely defiance against her abductor’s rigid determination to shape her into his perfect concubine. But as the days unfold and Jenny gradually grows accustomed to her new regime, she begins to understand there’s a lot more to her idiosyncratic host than she'd first realized.",
