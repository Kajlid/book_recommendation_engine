  "description": "After surviving childhood at the snooty, stuck-up boarding school for budding omegas, I have everyone convinced I'm a dud.My awakening? Never gonna happen. Heat, mates, and a fairytale pack life? Maybe next reincarnation. All I want is to be left alone.I'm invisible, and headed to a blissful solo future until the Wyvern Pack destroys my dream of independence. But Atlas, Hunter, Finn, Jett, and Orion are poison candy. They don't want an omega, but they need one, even if there will never be a real spot for me in their pack. Who needs a pack? Iâ€™ll keep myself safe, same as always. I'll never awaken, and I'll never ever give the Wyverns my heart...because all they'll do is rip me apart.This book contains a slow burn, high heat, and growly alpha males. It's intended for mature listeners due to MM content, frequent cursing, and references to past assault that may be disturbing. The author not responsible for any ugly crying.",
