  "description": "Zara Mitchell's nightmares began when the Observers landed. These strangely vivid visions continue to haunt her nightly, leaving her terrified of the silver-eyed visitors and their true intentions. When one of the eerily beautiful beings shows up at her diner with the local sheriff, her world changes forever. The Observer insists that she come with him. He claims her life is in danger. But can he be trusted? After two years, Caelan's search is finally over. He's found her, the human female from the prophecy. She is the one thing he recognizes from his life before Earth, his only link to the truth. Now all he has to do is keep her alive long enough to find the clues to a past he can't remember and a future she fears.",
