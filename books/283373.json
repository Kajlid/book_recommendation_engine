So, I didn't die.But I may as well have.One minute, I'm a woman trying to find her way in the world, and the next, I'm the sender of six of the most embarrassing text messages that have ever been sent in the history of time--or the cell phone. Whatever.We're talking code red, send a flipping mayday, the apocalypse is coming kind of texts.And I didn't just send them to some random person I'll never see again.No. That would be too easy.I sent them to Milo Ives.The man who played a starring role in all of my teenage fantasies--and my brother's lifelong best friend.And, boy oh boy, has he grown up.He's hard-bodied, blue-eyed, jawline-of-stone handsome, crazy successful, and has more money in his bank account than my brain can fathom.\nDeflower me, please?\n I said.Yeah. Send help.",
