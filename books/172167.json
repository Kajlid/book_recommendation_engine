Struggling attorney Hope Kendall loves her outlaw biker boyfriend Rochlan “Rock” North with all her heart, but the questionable activities his motorcycle club is involved in threaten her legal career. But does she even want this career anymore? As a near-death situation makes their professional differences seem insignificant, a cloud descends over their personal relationship’s already unsteady future. Even though Hope seems to have finally found her niche in the club as Rock’s ol’ lady, can she mingle in politics with neighboring clubs as well? A trip to the Lost Kings MC downstate charter will put her to the test. While Rock works hard to give Hope the honesty she craves without betraying his loyalty to his brothers, tension from outside forces threatens to push him to the brink. But it’s the one secret Hope has hidden all along that may finally drive them apart for good.This is the third book in the Lost Kings MC series and shouldn't be read as a stand-alone. Strength from Loyalty is a full-length (over 100,000 words) novel.",
