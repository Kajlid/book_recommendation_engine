A one night stand with CEO bad boy and all round \"manwhore\" Landon Peters will change Aurora's life, if she'll take a risk and break some rules. She's under his skin, in his mind and pushing her way into his heart. She sees more than he wants her to. Landon doesn't do vulnerable. He doesn't do weak. And that's exactly what she makes him. She's got him completely at her mercy. Landon's world is unravelling fast and with control out of his reach, he might just push to enforce his rules in a desperate attempt to reclaim the control he craves. He told Aurora he would help her break her rules but he hadn't planned on it being at the expense of his own. But will his need for control prove too much for Aurora, a young woman trying to break free. Can this British bad boy and pretty English socialite balance their need for control or will their relationship fail before it even really begins?

I just love this series and can't wait to read the next book!\" - Behind Closed Doors",
