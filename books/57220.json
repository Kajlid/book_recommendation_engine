  "description": "A book about love as seen by the ancients, Eros is Anne Carson's exploration of the concept of \"eros\" in both classical philosophy and literature. Beginning with: \"It was Sappho who first called eros 'bittersweet.' No one who has been in love disputes her. What does the word mean?\", Carson examines her subject from numerous points of view and styles, transcending the constraints of the scholarly exercise for an evocative and lyrical meditation in the tradition of William Carlos William's Spring and All and William H. Gass's On Being Blue.",
