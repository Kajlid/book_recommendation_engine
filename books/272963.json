  "description": "He's a (mostly) reformed bad boy. She's a (mostly) professional woman.Their history together has made having a relationship...problematic.But if they take a chance, can they find a solution - and love?Danny BoyI've somehow done the impossible: I got the girl I wanted. Only, I have no idea how to make a lovely person like Amelia Patterson, my former therapist, happy. She's a respectable woman. I'm a recovering . . . everything. Just barely getting a life together. Though she may claim I have something to offer, it's only a matter of time before she recoils from the reality of what I am. At least, that's what the old me - Danny Boy - keeps thinking. The new me - Daniel - has to figure out how to make this work, even when it turns out Amelia and I want totally different things. Amelia I've thrown all caution to the wind and decided the fact that I was once Daniel's therapist is not a big enough deterrent to keep from having a relationship with him. I never should have crossed that line. But I took a chance. Because I couldn't get him out of my head. I couldn't get him out of my heart. The thing is, for all the work I did with him, and for all the progress he's made, he's still incredibly damaged. Is this really what I want? To be with a man who requires so much? It's a question I have to figure out, especially when it becomes clear that Daniel and I want totally different things. ***This book should be read *after* reading Looking For Trouble and Felicity Found. The other books in the series (including the Christmas novella) do not have to be read to enjoy this one, but it would definitely enhance the experience!",
