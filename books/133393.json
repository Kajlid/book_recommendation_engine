  "description": "Explore your wildest fantasies in a hot new series where women are stripped, shamed, and publicly humiliated before they’re coerced into degrading sexual acts—with a little blackmail or bribery as extra incentive. The action is so intense that the women can’t help getting aroused themselves!Each volume contains three short stories.VOLUME 1“Shaming the Au Pair” – A middle-aged housewife is jealous of all the attention her pretty young au pair is getting, so she arranges for the girl to “accidentally” fall into a muddy pond in her back yard. The poor girl is forced to strip off her filthy clothes in front of a dozen neighbors, then stand in the middle of the yard completely naked while she’s hosed off. Her boss’s husband is so turned on by the events that the au pair is coerced into giving him some much-needed relief.“Shaming the Stepmother” – An 18-year-old boy catches his 24-year-old stepmother having an affair while his father is out of town, so he blackmails her into acting as his sexual slave for the weekend. In addition to fulfilling the young man’s dark desires, the woman is also forced to cook, clean, and do her other household chores in the nude. Adding to her shame, the young stepmother is paraded in front of the neighbors—and a few complete strangers—in various stages of undress.“Shaming the Bartender” – A feisty redhead earns plenty of tips as a bartender with her low-cut dresses and lack of underwear, but her income increases even more once she starts over-billing and double-charging her drunken male customers. Two of the men’s wives uncover the bartender’s scheme and give her the punishment she deserves. The poor redhead is stripped, spanked, then persuaded to get down on her knees and “apologize” to five of her male customers, one after the other.",
