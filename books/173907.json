  "description": "Anna Goldsmith has moved with her family from her posh school in Surrey to a small Yorkshire town and the local comprehensive. Anna worries she won't fit in - she's a bit too brainy and her accent sticks out a mile. But Anna's got everything going for her; she's attractive, sporty and musical, and Hayley Parkin, the most popular girl in her year, wants to be her best friend. So Anna reckons she'll be fine. Except that Hayley - charming and gorgeous with a year round tan - is not all she seems. Soon she's playing power games; freezing Anna out one minute, then nice as pie the next. Anna is totally confused. As the school year progresses, Hayley's behaviour gets more erratic, and the sarcastic remarks get more personal. Anna is sliding into depression and despair. Melanie - her other best friend - tries to understand, but she's caught in the middle, and Hayley's playing games with her, too. Can Mel help Anna before she goes and does something really silly...?",
