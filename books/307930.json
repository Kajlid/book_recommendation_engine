  "description": "The god of hell wants me to be his queen.I’ve screwed up. Big time. A day ago, I mistakenly released the evil Titan Chronos onto the Earth. He’s spreading devastation in his pursuit of ultimate power, and it’s all my fault.The only way to stop him is to fulfil an ancient prophecy and unite with Hades. Problem is, Hades plans to rule in Chronos’ place, spreading the underworld to earth. He wants me to rule by his side, a dark queen to his dark king.As much as I want Hades—I might even be growing to love him—I can’t be part of something so terrible. Underneath Hades’ dark exterior, I know there is goodness inside. My only hope is to convince him to turn to the light, because I’m afraid I can't live without him.",
