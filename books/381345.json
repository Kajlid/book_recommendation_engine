  "description": "The most consistently brilliant SF writer in the world - John Brunner.Ragle Gumm is an ordinary man leading an ordinary life, except that he makes his living by entering a newspaper contest every day - and winning, every day. But he gradually begins to suspect that his life - indeed his whole world - is an illusion, constructed around him for the express purpose of keeping him docile and happy. But if that is the case, what is his real world like, and what is he actually doing every day when he thinks he is guessing 'Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next?'.For everyone lost in the endlessly multiplicating realities of the modern world, remember: Philip K. Dick got there first - Terry GilliamOne of the most original practitioners writing any kind of fiction, Dick made most of the European avant-garde seem like navel-gazers in a cul-de-sac - Sunday TimesCover illustration: Chris Moore",
