  "description": "The last time I saw her, she was asleep—and I'd just taken her virginity. She was my best friend's little sister. I'd broken the guy code, and the guilt had me running before she woke. Ten years later, she's a corporate bad ass negotiating across the table from me—and hotter than ever. I want my second chance, but she's all grown up and isn't about to hand it to me. This time, I've got a whole different game plan in mind. * * *The last time I saw him, he was balls deep inside me—and I'd just lost my virginity. When I woke up he was gone. Ten years hasn't erased the sting of rejection. And now he wants his second chance? I swore I'd say no ... but then he made me an offer I couldn't refuse: when we're working, we're strangers, but at night? He'll make my every dirty fantasy come true. This time, I'm not going to be the one left wanting more. Standalone steamy, erotic romance.",
