Animal lovers and detractors alike will find Harris'' unique brand of visual humor and scientific smarts---well---the cat's meow.SIDNEY HARRIS's cartoons enliven the pages of magazines as diverse as Playboy, The New Yorker, The Spectator, and American Scientist, and adorn bulletin boards and refrigerator doors around the world. Other collections of his cartoons include Can't you Guys Read?: Cartoons on Academia; Einstein Cartoons on Science; and Freudian Cartoons on Psycology (all by Rutgers University Press). Traveling shows of his science cartoons and paintings have been displayed at museums in the United States and Canada.",
