  "description": "'Up From Down Under' tells the remarkable untold story of how Australian music took over the world. Beginning with Peter Allen’s unlikely journey from the plains of Tenterfield to the stage of New York’s Radio City Music Hall — astride a camel, no less — and charting the rollercoaster rides of the Little River Band, Helen Reddy, the Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John, Air Supply, Rick Springfield, Men at Work, Keith Urban and recent Grammy-winner Gotye, this broad panorama plots the massive influence our tiny population has had on popular culture over the past 40 years. Along the way Australian artists have collected Grammys, Oscars and sales registering in the hundreds of millions.'Up From Down Under' also serves as a cautionary tale about the hefty price paid by so many of these big names. The deaths of such stars as INXS’ Michael Hutchence and Maurice, Robin and Andy Gibb proves that old adage to be true: it really is a long way to the top.",
