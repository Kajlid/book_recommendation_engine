Two sisters, Namima and Kamiku, born to the family of the oracle, are separated as children. Kamiku begins her training to become the next oracle, while Namima becomes Priestess of the Night. The Goddess Chronicle—a retelling of the ancient Japanese myth of Izanami and Izanagi—pulls the reader deep into the realm of the undead.

It is a dazzling story of sex, death, gods and revenge that will draw the reader in and won’t let go until the exhilarating end.",
