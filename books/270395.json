  "description": "He’s a rich, famous writer. He doesn’t work or play well with others. He’s under an insane deadline. And I’m stuck on a private island with him for the next two months.I was supposed to be taking my rightful place as head chef at one of my family’s resort restaurants. Instead, I’m stranded on our new private island getaway, where I’ll be catering to Pierce Davenport, an infuriatingly arrogant guest with a palate that’s about as adventurous as a plain boiled potato. His personality leaves a lot to be desired, too—imagine if the Grinch and Oscar the Grouch had a baby. That child would end up almost as grumpy as Pierce. So when disaster strikes and he’s forced to rely on me to type for him, we wind up spending twenty-four hours a day together. And when I have to transcribe a sexy time scene for him…well, let’s just say things heat up like a gas burner—fast and hot. I can’t be falling for him, can I? I hate him. Like really hate him. Only maybe I don’t… Whisked Away is an irresistibly romantic, delightfully funny, enemies-to-lovers tale of passion, books, and food. It stars a writer who’s as talented as he is hot, a feisty chef who won’t put up with his crap, a ferocious iguana, and one of the most hilarious grand romantic gestures of all time. It can be enjoyed as a standalone. Strawberry daiquiris not included.",
