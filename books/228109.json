  "description": "It's taken law librarian Becky Schrader a long time to stop comparing herself to her family of overachievers and hone in on what she really wants--a normal life, white picket fence and all, Mr. Dream Guy included. But before she gets ahead of herself, her girlfriends convince her she needs to let down her hair for once, meet a hot guy and let the moment take over . . . After graduating from an Ivy League law school and practicing in New York for a few years, the plan for Foster Deacon was to return home to Denver and join the family firm, marry the right woman, shoulder his responsibilities. Except Foster's always been a bit of a rebel, and he's decided to suit up with his family's rival firm. What better way to celebrate than to spend a night with a gorgeous blonde who leaves before he could say, \"Good morning . . .\" Becky feels she did the right thing, leaving her lover's bed and not her number. After all, she needs to focus on her job at Glassmeyer & Polak--until the new hire walks through the door . . . with a bad case of happily ever after.Praise for Sarah Title's Southern Comfort Romance series \"Sexy and made me laugh!\" --Smexy Books \"A fast-paced read that provided just as many smiles from the humor as it did sizzles from the romance.\" --The Book Divas Reads \"Wild, witty, and wonderful.\"--New York Times bestselling author Jo Goodman \"Quite a sexy book.\"--USAToday.com",
