  "description": "In the Big Easy, nothing comes easy, not life, not love . . . not justice. Two cases, one involving an innocent young girl and the other a jaded sophisticate who thinks the rules don't apply to her, lead Micky Knight to a tawdry bar where two streets intersect, the corner of Law and Desire. When Micky finds out what is hidden in the dark rooms behind the bar's fa√ßade, she will do anything to make it stop . . . anything . J.M. Redmann is the author of four Micky Knight mysteries. A trade paper edition of Lost Daughters will be available from Bywater Books in the spring of 2005 and a new Micky Knight that fall.",
