  "description": "There is no question; America today faces many problems and has multiple challenges ahead of it. If the country is to maintain its status as a free and independent nation, that honors free enterprise, liberty and capitalism as it’s foundation it’s citizens must make some changes in their thinking.Many today blame President Obama for our present situation. While there isn’t any question his political and social views and actions have been a contributing factor in our current dilemma, he is only the symptom, not the problem. Just like a boil or sore throat is a symptom of a deeper hidden disease, so is Obama a symptom of the much larger problems America has.",
