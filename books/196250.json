  "description": "Although this can be read as a standalone, it's better if you've read the first book His Christmas Rose. :D  Reed Landry and Danielle Kane want each other. Despite her concerns, she lets her inhibitions melt away in Sin City. Waking up in Vegas can be problematic especially when it’s with the man your family dislikes and distrusts. Running away, Danielle can’t keep everything hidden in Vegas.  Reed isn’t going to let his runaway woman get away from him forever. He refuses to let her spend Christmas without him, even if it means walking into a houseful of Kane men and claiming his Danielle.  Their relationship is a surprise for the family, but Danielle’s got a special surprise for Reed as well.  Warning: JUST LIKE ALL MY BOOKS THIS IS INSTA-LOVE/LUST :D",
