  "title": "The Last Jew of Treblinka",
  "description": "Quickly becoming a cornerstone of Holocaust historiography, this is a devastatingly stark memoir from one of the lone survivors of Treblinka.Why do some live while so many others perish? Tiny children, old men, beautiful girls - in the gas chambers of Treblinka, all are equal. The Nazis kept the fires of Treblinka burning night and day, a central cog in the wheel of the Final Solution.In the tradition of Elie Wiesel's Night and Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz and The Drowned and the Saved, Rajchman provides the only survivors' record of Treblinka. Originally written in Yiddish in 1945 without hope or agenda other than to bear witness, Rajchman's account shows that sometimes the bravest and most painful act of all is to remember.",
