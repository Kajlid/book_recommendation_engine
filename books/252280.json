  "description": "This is the third book in my Friends, Family and Love series. It is best to read the other books first ('Captive Love' and 'Freed Love', both of which are available on Amazon. In this book we see Krista's and Theo's story and how their love started.  Initially they hid their love from friends and family, but at a surprise birthday party for her brother Rob, their relationship is outed by a 6 year old. Will their love survive now it is out in the open? Or will it fizzle and die under the pressure that family and friends put on them?",
