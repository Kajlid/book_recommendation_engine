  "description": "A lonely girl. A dangerous Wolf. A plan that will either save them or break them.  Ruby Contos is the best young journalist in her city. She has interviewed hostile criminals and a former assassin without flinching. Just don’t ask her to stand up to her grandmother, the blunt newspaper editor who rules her life with an iron fist.  When Ruby gets a job offer from a famous art studio, she sees a way out of the professional journalism that is slowly crushing her spirit. She’s close—there’s just one story left to write before she can leave.  All she must do is trust a Wolf who refuses to trust her, journey across a wasteland, survive in a city run by criminals, and confront the continent’s most terrifying enemy.  As things go from bad to worse, Ruby must face the question she’s always been afraid to ask—how much is her life really worth?  --  Betrayed: Ruby's Story is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood set in a magical world and filled with hope and sweet romance. It's Book 4 in the Destined series, a collection of overlapping fairy tale retellings all set in the same world.
