  "title": "Fearworms: Selected Poems",
  "description": "Written and illustrated by Robert Payne Cabeen (Tainted Treats, Heavy Metal 2000), this collection of horror poems and full-color artwork features cover art by Eisner-winning, Emmy-nominated artist Bill Sienkiewicz (Elektra: Assassin, Stray Toasters, The New Mutants). Cutting close to the bone, Fearworms' manically crafted word machines are visceral, psychological, haunting, and terrifyingly humorous. From a cannibalistic clown convention to the antics of Krampus (the Christmas demon), Cabeen's grisly tales offer madness and mayhem to readers who seek a glimpse into the frightful abyss, and they are sure to be loved (and feared) by fans who previously found horror and delight in Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.Website:www.fanboycomics.netFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/fearwormsFearworms: Selected Poems may be purchased at the following link:http://fanboycomics.ecrater.com/filte...",
