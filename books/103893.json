  "description": "The Astral Codex is a comprehensive and enthralling guide by Belsebuub to what out-of-body experiences are, how to have them on a regular basis, what to see and do in the astral plane, and how it fits into the structure of life. It is a must have for anyone interested in astral travel.From over twenty years of extensive experience in astral projection and spirituality, Belsebuub shows how to consciously harness and use the natural connection each of us have to other dimensions for our own personal growth and journey through eternity.Discover how to remember your dreams, become lucid in them, understand their symbolic language, astral project using different techniques, and use astral travel to seek out incredible knowledge about existence beyond the five senses just as mystics have throughout time. * 67 percent surveyed had an OBE in first two months* Over fourteen tried and tested techniques* In-depth analysis, tips, and programs Based on the hugely popular online course by Belsebuub taken by tens of thousands of people worldwide “Astral projection is a natural function of the human body—every night we go into the astral plane unconsciously in dreams; astral projecting is simply going there consciously (which is going there knowing that you are leaving your physical body). It happens spontaneously to around 10 percent of the population, but it’s possible to learn techniques to consciously be aware of the natural process of traveling out of the body into different dimensions, to learn to travel around the astral plane, and to seek out knowledge there on a regular basis.” ~ Belsebuub",
