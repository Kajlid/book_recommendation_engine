  "description": "Gisela von Hohenems joins the teaching staff of an exclusive girls' school in upstate New York, where she befriends fellow newcomer Faustina Coyle. But a climate of fear surrounds Faustina, and after several strange incidents which defy rational explanation, she is forced to resign. Gisela asks her fianc√©, detective-psychologist Dr Basil Willing, to investigate.\"The story belongs to the Dickson Carr tradition - a supernatural puzzle.... The quiet violence of families and wills and slow-stalking terror, woven of themes which have served novelists as diverse as Wilkie Collins and Mauriac, can still cast ripples of terror across the mind when the rattle of gunfire dies quickly in the wind\" -Punch",
