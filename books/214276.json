  "description": "Why is a church girl thinking more about bad boy bikers and sexual domination than she is about the Lord?  What would make her run away from home with an unpredictably dangerous member of an outlaw motorcycle gang and submit to the barbaric, male dominated culture of SATAN Nation?  Keisha is having a crisis of faith. She’s a sixteen-year-old girl who was raised in a loving, Christian family. But she no longer knows what she believes. Or does she? Is she a Christian? Or is she being untrue to herself and living a lie? Are her Christian values hers? Or are they her parents’? The inner conflict is driving her nuts. It’s driving her to do things a Christian girl would never do.  A crushing loss pushes her deeper into cynicism and farther away from God than she has ever been. During this storm of confusion and warring passions, she meets De Ville. An alpha male who seems to have stepped right out of one of her bad boy biker novels. He’s as scary and hot as he is fascinating and dangerous. He’s a SATAN Nation man.  She wants him.  She wants him bad.  She’s going to have him.  Even if it means agreeing to making him her god.  Even it means becoming his property.  It’s the SATAN Nation way.  Author's Note  There's no crazy middle-of-the-scene cliffhanger stuff at the end! The first story ends at a good, satisfying spot. You'll be begging for more, but still happy (smile).  New and Revised Edition This book was previously published in 2014 as The Runaway’s Journey. It has been rewritten and enlarged by fifty percent and published in two parts, which comprise the total story. The first part is The Runaway: Beginnings; the second part is The Runaway: Endings. The first part has revisions and new chapters. The second part is a totally new creation.",
