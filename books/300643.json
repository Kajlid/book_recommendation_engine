  "description": "A party in the Hollywood Hills.A perfectly timed smoke break.A chance encounter.From the moment I laid eyes on Judah Colt, I knew I was screwed.He was a whirlwind of emotions, a disastrous tornado of need, while I was only searching for a taste of reckless abandon and a chance to let go.What I got was almost more than I could handle.In the blink of an eye, I was no longer just a fan, a girl with an obsession, but instead I became a necessity—to the music, to the fans, to Judah himself.Together, we were a chaotic mess of feelings, fears, and attitudes, but apart it all got worse.Neither of us were ready for love—especially not the kind we found—but once we started...there was no going back. We are Phoenix and Judah.Nix and Jude.Baby Bird and her Skyscraper.Me and my twin flame.OFFICIAL TRIGGER WARNING: This is a work of fiction with mature themes such as emotional trauma, drug use, strong language, infidelity, and suicide references. It is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18.",
