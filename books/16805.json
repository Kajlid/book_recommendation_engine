Sly has wanted a mate for as long as he can remember. When he crawls up Colton's leg while trying to escape his ex-lover, he quickly realizes that the big hippogriff shifter is just what he's been looking for. Sly possesses something very special, thoughâ€”something anyone would kill to have. Unfortunately, it's also his only hope of achieving immortality if he wishes to stay with Colton forever. But how long can he keep his treasure hidden from those who seek to take it as their own?[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, sex toys, light bondage, spanking]",
