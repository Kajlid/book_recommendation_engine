  "description": "Hettie Redfern tends the stables on Lord Melton’s English estate and makes no secret of her feelings - she prefers dogs to men. Dogs don’t lie. They don’t manipulate, and when they love, they love unconditionally. Men, as the petite, copper-haired beauty has previously discovered, are rarely so loyal. Alexander Melton, the son of Hettie’s employer, returns home from Afghanistan bringing with him the stray dog he adopted during his tour of service. He is immediately attracted to Hettie but finds her past distasteful - and Alexander is as suspicious of women as Hettie is of men. The attraction between the two is powerful and magnetic, but their growing passion struggles against suspicion and mistrust. Can Hettie and Alexander put aside the past in order to look to the future?",
