  "description": "In this little book, Aaron Hoopes brings twenty years of experience in the martial arts, fitness training and meditation to bear on one of the most fundamental dimensions of good proper breathing. He calls it a secret not because it is hidden or mysterious, but because so little attention is paid to it. Breathe Smart shows us how, through conscious breathing we can raise our level of oxygen intake and reap the benefits of increased energy, better health, and a stronger sense of well-being.",
