  "title": "Emeralds for the King",
  "description": "It was midnight when young Tosty was roused from his sound sleep and invited by a rude mud-stained stranger to search for a great treasure to aid his king. Before the dawn he had to memorize a secret map and the map was then destroyed. Woe to him if he forgot his hastily conned lesson!Tosty sets out for his brothers' home hoping to get the treasure before anyone knows his mission but unfortunately his brothers have excellent wit and know just why he came. While they struggle to find the treasure for Cromwell without the map, Tosty, who knows just where to look, is held prisoner and cannot serve his king. But the boy does escape time after time and often without light or proper equipment makes his search. Among the adventures in this book is a struggle with an underground river, a climb down the sheer face of a cliff, a long visit to a kindly old lady whom Tosty thinks is a which, and such riding and excursions and alarums as generally fill three or four books. England is described with Miss Savery's usual beauty of expression and Tosty is a very real boy. Just wait for the chapter when he meets king Charles the First.",
