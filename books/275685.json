  "description": "Named one of 2018's TOP TEN ZOMBIE READS.   THE PLAGUE BOX SET features all found memoirs of Winter Miles, an ordinary survivor in a rabies-infected world. With Cleo, her beloved dog, Winter fights through the destroyed remains of the States, desperate to reach D.C. where she hopes to find her sister. Only, when she meets the first band of survivors she’s seen in months, Winter's long isolation is tested, and her independence rattled. Leo, a mysterious soldier who saved her life, surrounds her with lies and one secret that gnaws on her core...a secret that hides in the restricted RV. And when Castle arrives—the most intimidating man Winter has ever met—she realises that their intentions are much darker than she’d ever imagined… Not only does Winter have to battle through hordes of rotters to reach her sister in D.C., she faces a lethal battle with broken hearts and even deadlier men.",
