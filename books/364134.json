  "description": "So you think know the story of Little Red Riding Hood, the girl with the unfortunate name and the inability to tell the difference between her grandmother and a member of a different species? Well, then, try your hand at answering these questions:-Which character (not including Little Red herself) is the most fashion challenged?-Who (not including the wolf) is the scariest? -Who (not including Granny) is the most easily scared?-Who is the strangest? (Notice we're not \"not including\" anyone, because they're all a little off.)-Who (no fair saying \"the author\") has stuffing for brains?Vivian Vande Velde has taken eight new looks at one of the world's most beloved (and mixed-up) stories. You may never look at fairy tales in quite the same way again.",
