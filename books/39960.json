  "title": "The Resurrection of Deacon Shader",
  "description": "“Ever-widening in its scope - fearless in its telling.” -- David DalglishDeacon Shader is a man of contradictions. Trained for holiness, he is also the deadliest warrior of his generation.When plague strikes at the heart of the city of Sarum and the Abbey of Pardes is attacked by an army of undead, Shader is thrust into the forefront of an ages-old conflict.After being hidden for millennia, the scattered pieces of an artifact known as the Sun Stone have resurfaced, and an ancient enemy comes to claim them.Armies clash, dark magic is unleashed, and devastating science threatens to unmake the whole of creation.These are the times of the Unweaving that Shader has been prepared for since a child; and these are the days that will test his faith to the limits. The Resurrection of Deacon Shader is an earlier, alternative version of the story told in the First Shader Against The Unweaving. Many of the events recounted in Sword of the Archon, Best Laid Plans, and The Unweaving will be found here with a simplified narrative, and a classical style that will appeal to those of a more “old school” persuasion.The Resurrection of Deacon Shader is written in British English and features a real world setting, including real world religion.“Rich and varied, touching, maddening, and addicting. Elegant, polished, and believable characters in an amazing world.”Archelle Baker (eBook Alchemy)“Complex and intriguing; intelligent and engaging; descriptive enough to invoke all senses.The style is a nice mix--fast-paced and contemporary, yet with classical prose and imagery to satisfy those of us who love the 'old masters'.”C.S. Marks (author of “Elfhunter”)",
