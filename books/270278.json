  "description": "THIRST, a new standalone novel from New York Times bestselling author, Deborah Bladon.  Do you see what I see? I see my half-naked neighbor staring at me whenever he gets a chance.  When I moved into this apartment, I knew I'd get used to the noisy tenant across the hall, the broken air conditioner, and the squeaky floors. I didn't think I'd grow accustomed to the lustful stares of the gorgeous man who lives in the building next to mine. He watches me when dusk falls with an intense hunger in his eyes I've never seen before. I sense his gaze trailing over every inch of my skin as I strip slowly, just for him. It’s innocent until I finally get the chance to pitch my business idea to a trio of private investors. That’s when I realize that the man who stands at his window every night staring at me is one of the three people who hold the future of my start-up in their hands. Rocco Jones has seen my body, and now he wants to touch it. I want my business to succeed, and I want him, but is it possible for me to have both?  *Author's Note: Although a few characters from my past books make appearances in THIRST, it's not necessary to read any of my other books to enjoy this sinfully sexy standalone romance.",
