  "title": "Orlando the Marmalade Cat: A Seaside Holiday",
  "description": "Orlando, the beautiful marmalade cat with eyes like \"twin green gooseberries\", made his first picture book debut in 1938, to instant acclaim. His adventures grew into a series of eighteen books which, with their exciting, humorous stories and distinctive illustrations full of interesting detail and visual jokes, have become classics of children's literature. They are now reissued in editions that faithfully reproduce the elegant folio format of the originals, to delight a new generations of children and bring nostalgic pleasure to all Orlando's former admirers.When Orlands wants to take his dear wife Grace and their three kittens on a summer holiday, he is very disappointed to find that all the hotels and boarding houses are full up. Then unexpectedly Vulcan the horse saves the day by suggesting a trip to the town of Owlbarrow-on Sea where there is a huge old beached ship in which they can all stay. And it does indeed prove to be the holiday of a lifetime, as they swim, sunbathe, go flying on the tail of a kite, discover a \"mermaid\" and even help to rescue some shipwrecked travellers.Kathleed Nale modelled the little town of \"Owlbarrow\" on Aldeburgh in Suffolk where she spent her holidays with her husband and sons, and saw the old ship that features as Orlando's holiday home. The whole book wonderfully conveys the magic of childhood seaside visits.",
