The delightful characters will become storyland friends for life for children who meet them here. Just wait until your child sees the Giant's expression as he cries, \"Fee, fi, fo, fum,\" or the adorable Elves dancing in the Shoemaker's cottage! The Ginger-bread Boy's candy buttons and the dazzling feathers of the Ugly Duckling are among the many inviting details to discover with each new look. A collection of nursery tales so child friendly, rewarding, and full of fun could only have come from the rich and playful imagination of Mary Engelbreit.",
