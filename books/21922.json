  "description": "Emma and Jack are playing in the sandbox while their mother is pushing their baby brother in a nearby swing. They hear a noise. Looking over the bushes, they see a little girl crying. They ask if there is anything they can do to help. She tells them that her name is Princess Florinda Clara Amelia Rafaela Louisa Josefina and that she is waiting for her friends. Lauren, as Princess Florinda Clara Amelia Rafaela Louisa Josefina likes to be called, tells Emma and Jack all about her life in her castle. Emma and Jack can't decide which is more that Lauren paints on the walls, that she throws her dishes on the floor or that she came to the park alone. Emma and Jack meet a Princess tells the story of how you can find a friend almost anywhere and how someone who seems very different from you can turn out to be just like you after all.",
