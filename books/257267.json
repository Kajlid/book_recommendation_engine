  "description": "Former Army Ranger, Dylan \"Hook\" Hoecker, has a new job along with a new prosthetic arm. Being a bounty hunter is the closest career field he could find as a civilian that gives him the adrenaline rush that is his addiction. So, when his first solo assignment is to keep an eye on a flight risk the boss bonded out of jail, he's not thrilled. However, he soon discovers a fresh addiction--one mouthy, nerdy redhead, who resists his attempts to keep her out of trouble.Felicity Gronkowski is grateful for the bone the head of Montana Bounty Hunter threw her. She didn't have the money to pay for bail, but he has a soft spot for former military, and she bartered to install a new computer system in his satellite office in Bear Lodge. Being on the outside of jail was her first imperative because she has to figure out who framed her for a series of high-end robberies while she worked installing home security systems. However, her bounty-hunting babysitter isn't giving her any slack. Every time she thinks she's given him the slip, he's one step ahead of her. Either she has to find the perfect method of distraction to escape him or she has to enlist his help to clear her name.",
