  "description": "\"The devil's end time tactic is to get as many people offended as possible. In the book of Matthew, Jesus stated that many people would be offended. He also commanded His followers to learn the parable of the fig tree. The parable of the fig tree uncovers the generation that all the things Jesus spoke of in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthews would come to pass. According to the parable of the fig tree, that generation started in 1948. There are so many prompts today that will facilitate the devil's efforts to get people offended. In tracing the etymology of the word offense, it means bait. The devil knows that God cannot use a person who's harboring an offense. Inside the pages of this book are the principles to an offense free life. Read them, and release the freedom on the inside of you that is just dying to get out. \"",
