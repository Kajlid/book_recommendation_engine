  "description": "Pat Conroy is without doubt America's favorite storyteller, a writer who portrays the anguished truth of the human heart and the painful secrets offamilies in richly lyrical prose and unforgettable narratives. Now, in Beach Music , he tells of the dark memories that haunt generations, in a storythat spans South Carolina and Rome and reaches back into the unutterable terrors of the Holocaust.Beach Music is about Jack McCall, an American living in Rome with his young daughter, trying to find peace after the recent trauma of his wife'ssuicide. But his solitude is disturbed by the appearance of his sister-in-law, who begs him to return home, and of two school friends asking for his help intracking down another classmate who went underground as a Vietnam protester and never resurfaced. These requests launch Jack on a journey that encompasses the past and the present in both Europe and the American South, and that leads him to shocking--and ultimately liberating--truths.Told with deep feeling and trademark Conroy humor, Beach Music is powerful and compulsively readable. It is another masterpiece in the legendarylist of classics that his body of work has already become.PAT CONROY is the author of five previous The Boo , The Water Is Wide , The Great Santini , The Lords of Discipline , andThe Prince of Tides , the last four of which were made into feature films.",
