  "description": "Drink the mead.  When such odd advice comes from the lips of a friend in a moment of peril, it sticks with you . . . and Minalan the Spellmonger, Baron of Sevendor, desperately needs some hope, right now. The mind of his poor wife, Alya, is damaged beyond repair after a selfless sacrifice, and Minalan has vowed to make her whole. Yet even the gods are powerless. As Yule approaches and Minalan contemplates despair, and a life without his beloved wife, he has run out of options . . . and hope. When magic and the gods themselves fail, a man will cling to any shred he can . . . such as a whispered phrase in the middle of battle.  But following that advice means coming to terms with his loss - perhaps even remarrying, to fortify his domains and give his children stability. That seems beyond the power of the Spellmonger to do in his grief. Opening the bottle meant for an anniversary they will never share symbolizes saying good-bye to his beloved forever, and Minalan knows it.  But what else can a man do when he's run out of hope?",
