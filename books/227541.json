In her hero-worshiping eyes, the Wyoming rancher could do no wrong. But one urgent April night, Cash made a woman of Abby... and Abby came up pregnant. Cash cursed himself for stealing her innocence and vowed to give their baby his name. Then he'd set sweet Abby free -- to find herself a better, younger mate. After all, when a man loved a woman, heartache was nothing... but honor was all.Marriage by NecessityTo fulfill her father's will and keep her precious ranch, Megan Kane needed to marry, bear a child. Since she'd always loved handsome neighbor Nate Bravo - a maverick she couldn't tie down - her solution was simple. She'd beg Nate to wed her and bed her... Meggie vowed she wouldn't cling. Wouldn't linger. She'd cherish her marriage until she got pregnant. Then she'd raise Nate's baby lovingly...and alone. But all too soon Meggie swelled with child. And she learned some promises were hell to keep...Practically MarriedLovely widowed mother Tess DeMarley had \"perfect wife\" written all over her, but rancher Zach Bravo had lost at love once before. So he proposed an arranged marriage. And he knew that it would stay just that, because Tess was a one-man woman, all right. Too bad Zach was the wrong man! If you'd asked Tess DeMarley what man she'd always dreamed of having down on one knee proposing marriage to her, Zach Bravo might not have been her first choice. But now that he was her husband, she began looking at him in a new light and wondering if her in-name-only spouse could possibly be turning into her dream man.",
