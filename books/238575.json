  "description": "Years before Archer became Captain Khoury's trusted lieutenant, before he faced down giants and murderous trees and sorcerers, Archer was just Reid Tarhill - the simple son of a trapper in love with a girl he thought beyond his reach. Maura O'Mara is many things to young Reid Tarhill - childhood friend, partner in crime, not to mention the chieftain's daughter. One fateful Fire Night, young Reid plans a performance to gain Maura's attention. Unfortunately, his father notices her interest too, and Old Tarhill tries to thwart the courtship by throwing in with a rival clan's suitor. The Seal Clan's heir is a far better match for a woman of Maura's status, but Gilland Fynan doesnâ€™t know her like Reid does. While Gilland tries to impress her with his skills, Reid charms Maura with tales of love and honor. But then sickness, a dangerous rogue bear, and a damning revelation threaten to tear them apart for good.Who knew that the fate of the entire Clan would rest on Maura's choice. It will take more than a faithful heart and a handful of stories to keep his Clan and his beloved Maura safe . But more than anything else, Reid realizes she is the woman he'd risk everything for.",
