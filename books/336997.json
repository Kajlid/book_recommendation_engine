  "description": "More Than Mortal is an epic adventure spanning two centuries in time and linking the incredible lives of history's most popular Victorian Age adventurers of the 1800's with the greatest action heroes of the Pulp Era and an assortment of well-known, real-life figures. In this completely original action-adventure story, four champions of justice, Doc Titan - The Ultimate Man, Darkness - The Master of Shadows, Guardian - Steel and Ice Justice, and Scorpion - The Deadliest Man Alive, are brought together for the first time to battle a deadly threat and save the Earth and mankind from absolute destruction. The story also features famous fictional characters from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Around the World in 80 Days, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly's Frankenstein, Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger series, Chester Hawks' Captain Hazzard, H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, J.H. Rosny's Ironcastle, John W. Campbell's Who Goes There?/Thing from Another World, Philip Wylie's Savage Gentleman and Gladiator, and many more. Pulp Heroes - More Than Mortal is a fast-paced chronicle about relationships between humorous and entertaining characters. It's a story about daring adventure. About fathers and sons. Unexpected storyline twists. Secrets revealed and more secrets exposed. The passing of the heroic baton. It's about how everyone is linked in some way and how actions in the past affect the present. It's not about their abilities that show who these heroes are; it's about the choices they make. Above all, it's an action-packed thrill ride. And, most importantly, it's a story about great adventure heroes and heroines.",
