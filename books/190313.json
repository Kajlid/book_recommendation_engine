  "description": "The highly-anticipated sequel to the ARTHUR C. CLARKE, BRITISH SCIENCE FICTION ASSOCIATION and JOHN W. CAMPBELL MEMORIAL AWARD-nominated EUROPE IN AUTUMN.  In a fractured Europe, new nations are springing up everywhere, some literally overnight. For an intelligence officer like Jim, it’s a nightmare. Every week or so a friendly power spawns a new and unknown national entity which may or may not be friendly to England’s interests. It’s hard to keep on top of it all. But things are about to get worse for Jim. A stabbing on a London bus pitches him into a world where his intelligence service is preparing for war with another universe, and a man has come who may hold the key to unlocking Europe’s most jealously-guarded secret...  'Europe in Autumn is the work of a consummate storyteller and combines great characters, a cracking central idea, and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Excellent.' Eric Brown for The Guardian on Europe in Autumn  'Hutchinson goes from strength to strength; top notch SF mixed with a tense, gritty story of espionage in the le Carre vein.' Adrian Tchaikovsky on Europe at Midnight",
