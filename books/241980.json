  "description": "No one knows crazy quite like Dr. Violet Marchand. As the preeminent psychologist to Whispering Hope’s supernatural population, staying calm, cool, and collected in the face of crazy is sorta part of the gig. So, when she starts receiving death threats, Violet isn’t all that rattled. But when her new bodyguard turns out to be the man who betrayed her—the only man who ever came close to breaching the carefully constructed walls around her heart…well, trusting him again might just be a little too crazy, even for a pro like Violet. Nikolai Aleyev has a lifetime of sins to atone for—not the least of which is betraying Violet’s trust. She’s made it clear she wants nothing more to do with him, and he understands. She’s better off without him. It doesn’t matter that he’s broken and only semi-sane without her. But when he’s assigned to act as Violet’s bodyguard, Nikolai knows he can’t stay away. Protecting her? That’ll be easy for a dhampyre like him. Keeping his hands off her and controlling the attraction that sizzles between them with every touch? That just might be more than he can manage.When bullets—and sparks—start flying, Nikolai will put everything on the line to save Violet—his freedom, his heart, his life. Because sometimes, the line between crazy and happily ever after is razor thin, and the reward just might be worth crossing it.",
