  "title": "Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel",
  "description": "When it appeared in 1972 'Bloody Murder' was greeted as the classic study of crime fiction, a book \"heartily recommended to anyone who has ever enjoyed a detective story or a crime novel\" as Kingsley Amis wrote. Subsequent edition ensured that this study was kept up to date to include later authors, and a third and final revised edition was issued in 1993 in celebration of distinguished author/critic Julian Symons' 80th year. The views expressed are as candid as ever. One bestselling writer is called unreadable, another compared to writers of \"strip cartoon stories\". But the general tone is warmly appreciative of every sort of book within the genre.",
