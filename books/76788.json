  "description": "This is my journal — my diary. It’s a personal glimpse into my life and all that would happen to me one fateful summer and fall. A record, you might say, of the events that would change the course of my life for all eternity. This is my story, and I will tell you all you need to know of me — of the life I once had, of the girl I once was. And of what I have now come to be. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be immortal? To live forever? To be free of the pain that comes with being human? Have you ever wondered what the consequences of such a thing might be? If you had to decide between morality and a happiness few ever find — which would you choose? And what would you do if the choice were suddenly taken from you?",
