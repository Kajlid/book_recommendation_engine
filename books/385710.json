  "description": "Salt is a crystal compound of Sodium and Chlorine; faceted and transparent. Simple and pure. What life could there be without salt? It is known as God's diamond, by which we should be aware of the infinite variability of scale for the divine perspective. Every grain is a landscape, a world. And us? We are fragile. We dissolve in immensity like salt in water. And after thirty-seven years of travel through the vastness of space we arrived on the planet Salt. And we took Heaven and Hell with us. Told by two people, Petja and Bariel, SALT is the story of a planetary colonization that slips into a tragedy of Biblical proportions. The two communities who went to Salt were united by the dream of a new beginning and, isolated in a landscape of cruel majesty, torn apart by ancient enmities. SALT is a novel of remarkable power, intense beauty and profound insight. In its evocation of an alien world it compares to nothing less than DUNE. It marks the debut of an extraordinary new writer on the SF scene. â€”From the dust jacket flap",
