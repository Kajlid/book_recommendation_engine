  "description": "Taking over the family business always has its challenges for the lucky heir. Following in your father's footsteps can be daunting, but never so much so as when you father was once Marie Antoinette's Chevalier and lover, your uncle was a famous Monk to the Monarch and your older brother has been in a coma for 200 years. Roger and Jace have some big shoes to fill, this is if they can stay alive long enough to get the laces tied.",
