  "description": "There's a new Magical drug flooding the streets, capable of giving Magic to humans. It's addictive, powerful... and it's not what people think it is.  I make a powerful new enemy, alienating the other Archons in the process, and she's clever enough to make me regret it, drawing me ever deeper into a web of vice, power and evil that I struggle to untangle before it's too late.  I discover new allies, but also new threats, and terrors from when humanity was young. Monsters close in from every side, bringing heartbreak, loss and guilt. It will take everything I have to get out of this with my sanity intact and my precious hide in one piece.  And that doesn't even cover the second fairy princess, the large coven of vampires, the crazy Death Mage I get stuck with, and a city so foul, it's known simply as Gomorrah.  To think, there was a time when I thought getting attacked by a Demon King was the worst thing that could happen to me...",
