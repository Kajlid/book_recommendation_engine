  "description": "New town, new school. Same story. I'm Laura, I've spent most of my life crisscrossing the county yielding to the whims of my transient mother. We've never stayed in one place long enough to call it home, and I don't have any hope of that changing. I follow the rules; no drawing attention to myself, no friends, and especially no boys. But my mom's been keeping secrets, secrets so profound they threaten to turn my world upside down. I've always assumed her paranoia was a symptom of a mental illness, but as her secrets begin to unravel, I realize nothing is what it seems. As my life careens out of control a group of guys from school promise to give me answers about who I really am. I'm afraid of what I might learn, but more afraid of what I could be giving up if I don't listen.Reverse Harem including MMFM Updated to resolve previous editing errors",
