  "description": "“I’ve abandoned all my principles for you… Broken laws I held to so firm for centuries, did things I never thought myself capable of…” He kissed her as he whispered. “Was it worth it?” His tears wet her lips. “I don’t remember.”~David   Helena K. Sharpe was raised by a man who had sympathy for supernatural creatures, for the vampires his bloodline hunted for centuries. She was too young to understand how he tried to help them, but she knew it was important. Her father made her promise never to hunt them and she would do anything to keep that promise.  Until he is murdered by the very things he dedicated so much of his life to.  Orphaned and alone, Helena takes to the street, afraid for whatever’s left of her life. Without her family, she doesn’t know how—or even if—she can go on. Until a vagrant takes her under his wing and gives her a purpose. Revenge.  For six years she learns about the monsters, studies their habits, until, at 15 years old, she feels she’s ready to find the ones responsible for her parent’s death. All she has to do is become one of them. She’s cute, young, innocent…  They’ll never see her coming.",
