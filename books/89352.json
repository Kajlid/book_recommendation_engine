  "description": "Years ago, Julia Whittaker gave up two daughters for adoption. Now she must find them to try to save the life of her son.Julia and Matt Whittaker’s son was diagnosed with biliary atresia at birth. Dillon has beaten the odds for thirteen years only to have the odds—and his liver—crash precipitously. The only hope for his survival is a transplant. He can receive a “living liver” transplant but neither his parents, nor various family members and friends, are compatible.The transplant list is long and Dillon’s time is short. Very short. He has two chances for a compatible liver: his two older half-sisters, born eighteen months apart and adopted at birth.But can Julia ask a young woman—someone she surrendered to strangers—to donate a portion of her body to a brother she’s never known? Will either sister even be a match for their half-brother? Will either of them show mercy and courage if they are? Julia knows she’s probably on a fool’s errand—reaching out to the daughters she abandoned only now that she needs them. But what other choice does she have except to try?",
