  "title": "The Happy Mutant Handbook",
  "description": "In the wrong hands, this book would receive a dousing of gasoline and a quick flick of the Bic. In the right hands, this is a delightfully subversive manual for a lifetime of fun.  This is the do-it-yourself handbook for enjoying our media-saturated world by tinkering with how it works. Pulls together the kookiest and most engaging ideas from the Internet, great suggestions on \"culture jamming\" (a practice of co-opting the resources, messages, and brain-washing machinery of existing media, pioneered by Adbusters magazine), and generally jam-packed with loads of fun ideas and funny material.  Notable contributors include Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, R.U. Sirius, Richard Kadrey, and that most prolific of all authors, Anonymous.  (Editor's note: In some ways, the Happy Mutant philosophy is the cyberspawn of the behavioral shenanigans of the  Dadaists, Surrealists, or the lesser-known but more interesting Situationists. )",
