  "title": "A Day in Hell: Death to Life to Hope",
  "description": "Nine-millimeter shots rang out from every direction. The shooter stood on the corner of the cracked concrete sidewalk. He squeezed the trigger of an Uzi machine gun, anger pumping through his veins, spraying bullets into the crowd outside of the building. Matthew was hit from behind, the 9 mm bullet piercing the back of his head, instantly knocking him to the ground... dead. A Day in Hell is the riveting, true-life account of one man's descent to the bowels of hell after dying from a gunshot wound to the head in March of 1992, and the true, wholehearted prayer of love by his newly wedded wife. Matthew survived, waking up twenty-seven days later. Unbeknownst to all those surrounding him, God had pulled him from his cell in hell and said, 'It's not your time.' A Day in Hell is a story flooded with hope and inspiration as this young couple figures out how to plot their new life. Matthew and Nancy Botsford have a firsthand testimony of what the future holds without God and what it can become with Him! Their testimony offers real hope when it seems there is none to be found. You will be extremely blessed by hearing what God has done and what He will do for you! -David White, Pastor of MorningStar Fellowship Church, Wilkesboro, NC",
