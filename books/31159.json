  "description": "The children want revenge. Tech-savvy victims of abuse unite to turn their collective pain into bloody retribution. The group calls itself K.A.R.M.A: Kids Against Rape, Murder and Abuse. To ensure the group’s message is heard, K.A.R.M.A’s leader enlists the aid of Tom Hackett, a rebellious freelance photojournalist who flaunts his willingness to break the rules for that perfect moneymaking shot. By tipping Hackett to the location of fresh kill, the group ensures sensational front-page media play. But when the identity of the first victim hits too close to home, K.A.R.M.A awakens a haunted past that could destroy everything Tom holds dear. In struggling with his conscience, Tom becomes an obstacle that K.A.R.M.A can’t allow to live.",
