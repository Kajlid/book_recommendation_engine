  "description": "Former deniable operator Nick Stone seems to be living his dream, not a care in the world as he steers his camper van round the surfing and parachuting paradise of Australia.But when he sees a news report of the massacre of women and children in a terrorist outrage on the other side of the world, long-suppressed memories are triggered, and Nick knows he must risk everything to repay a longstanding debt of friendship.As events unfold in the teeming streets of modern Istanbul and the bleak, medieval villages of Georgia, Nick finds himself catapulted once more into the murky, clandestine world he thought he’d left behind - a world in the grip of nameless enemies who linger in the shadows, and stalk the corridors of power...Reviews:“Andy McNab knows where his strengths lie, and it's not just in his biceps... Only people who have not read this book could suggest that he is not a fine writer. It is a heart-thumping read” - Daily Express (UK)“McNab is the best suspense thriller writer to put pen to paper since Alistair MacLean” - Stephen Coonts“McNab is a terrific novelist. When it comes to thrills, he’s Forsyth class” - Mail on Sunday (UK)“McNab’s great asset is that the heart of his fiction is not fiction: other thriller writers do their research, but he has actually been there” - The Sunday Times (UK)",
