  "description": "It’s Hell on heels—again! When Shar tries on a Tiffany’s diamond ring from Hades, the annoyingly hot Lord of the Underworld, it activates an obscure contractual clause that puts Shar and former-frenemy-turned-friend Meg in Hades’ service once more. Shar is whisked away to prepare a ball, while Meg is sent to help a spoiled rich girl. Just when it appears the girls will be doomed to serve Hades for eternity, two gorgeous demigods show up. But can the girls finally ditch Hades forever?",
