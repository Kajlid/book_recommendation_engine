  "title": "A Season for Hope",
  "description": "What's a soiled dove to do when she suddenly finds herself with child? Eighteen-year-old Gwyndolyn Klein certainly never envisioned her life coming to this when desperate measures landed her in Miss Sadie's bawdy house at the tender age of fourteen. Desperate for a fresh start and a quiet place to raise her daughter alone, she sets out with little more than the clothes on her back and her newfound faith in God. But when she meets handsome young Tucker Lawson, a conductor for the Underground Railroad, does she dare hope for a second chance? As the mistress of a rather large southern plantation in Tennessee, Addie Frankford seems to have it all...except the one thing she wants the most-a child. Her husband, Cooper Frankford, seems determined to hold her at arm's length until a moment of weakness results in a child that could cost Addie her very life.",
