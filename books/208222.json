  "description": "I knew Destiny wasn’t done with me. I knew that she was just getting warmed up, but I had no clue just how hard my world was going to come crashing down on me. I had thought that I was going to get my fairytale wedding and marry the man of my dreams. I was wrong. Now, faced with having my world torn asunder and Faery exposed, I have to make choices I never thought I’d have to make. I’m divided between two worlds, and I have to decide just how far I will go to get back what was stolen from me. Old enemies are closing in, new enemies are being revealed, and surprising allies are entering the playing field. War is on the horizon, and it’s coming right for us.",
