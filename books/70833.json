  "title": "Bitter Consequence",
  "description": "In a desperate act of survival, Michelle slays a vampire queen, inheriting her power, her people and her progeny. What Michelle can’t know is that her triumph sends violent ripples through the supernatural world.Across town, in a NY nightclub dedicated to dark desires and pulsing sexuality, the ancient blood-goddess Kali is struck down as a result of Michelle’s act of self-preservation. Kali wakes from the unwitting assault with a physical need for revenge and an immortal thirst for power—the death of the vampire queen gives Kali’s own evil plans a chance for new life.Michelle and this cunning immortal are thrust against each other, not in a battle for survival alone, but for the power to rule a voracious army of the dead.Now she is entangled in a web of deceit where lives, loves and destinies are changed forever or lost completely—where sex is as dangerous as a vampire’s bloodlust—and all actions can result in bitter consequences.",
