  "description": "The first book in the new Eternity Gambit series from USA Today bestselling author Renee Bernard. This is a romantic comedy series with an original paranormal twist that defies categorization and turns every notion of Heaven and Hell on its ear. Workplace comedy is always fun but when the company in question in H.E.LLc (Hades Enterprises LLc) and your job is being Lucifer, let's just say, there are some unique challenges beyond Casual Fridays and who keeps taking your lunch out of the break room. Even if Hell really is just a place where evil is tracked and analyzed in endless cubicles—no brimstone and not a human soul in sight—there’s no room for error. This Lucifer (who is the seventh unlucky archangel to get the position behind the black onyx desk) is about to have his entire world rattled when a very sweet and likable mortal woman crosses his path.After all, angels can't lie. And when Jayne Hamilton wants to know what he does for a living, all bets are off. Because \"dating\" isn't exactly in the cosmic scheme of the Eternity Gambit, but Love... Well, Love is never really off the table.Now, if Lucifer can just figure out how to win the girl and get himself fired, he'll be one very very happy angel.“Filled with sparkling wit and devilish charm, DEVIL TO PAY is a delightful visit to the Shangri-La of Hell!” -- Erin Quinn, The Three Fates of Ryan Love, NYT Bestselling Author“Only Renee Bernard could make dating Satan sexy as sin! Funny, fresh, irreverent and utterly adorable!” – Dakota Cassidy, National Bestselling Author",
