  "description": "One Blue Moon. Two wild hearts. And a love that won’t be stopped. Twenty-year-old wolf, Sóley Omega, has never felt The Pull—that fated, all-consuming connection to another wolf—and given her mixed-pack heritage, she wonders if she ever will. Hoping to finally be marked by her one true mate, Sóley travels from her humble hometown of Dutch to attend the River Pack’s largest annual Mating Pull event, but with her uniquely pale complexion, she’s never been more of an outcast. Until she meets Kanoa. And suddenly, everything changes. Charming, handsome, and easy to talk to, Kanoa is the ally Sóley needs to survive the week. The only problem is, he’s also the Alpha’s son.With his ruthless father insisting he fulfill his destiny as Beta, Kanoa is running out of time to mark a mate. But none of the pre-selected Socialites hold his interest—not like Sóley can. As the future leader of the River Pack, Kanoa’s choice of partner has never really been his own, but as his bond with lower-ranked Sóley deepens, it’s getting harder to imagine life without her. Following their hearts would mean turning their backs on tradition and defying the Alpha’s rule, but walking away from one another feels impossible. Now, they’ll have to decide where their loyalties truly lie, a devastating choice that could change the face of the pack forever.This is a sweet, fade to black, PG romance.",
