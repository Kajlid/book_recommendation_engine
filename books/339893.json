  "description": "For decades Hudich, the leader of an evil army, had been held prisoner in a world called Pekel. Before releasing him last summer to save Max’s friend Cindy, Max’s grandfather neutralized Hudich’s magical powers with the aid of an advanced high-tech collar. Unfortunately, Hudich’s escape allowed him to relay a centuries-old secret to his followers that helps them find a powerful weapon. With the aid of this new weapon, an ancient magical gateway, the enemy kidnaps Max’s mother and forces him to do their bidding by threatening to kill her. To keep his mother a live, Max will embark on another perilous adventure into new worlds with hidden dangers. Convinced there is a spy among his friends, Max must decide who he can trust, if anyone, in his attempts to rescue his mother and destroy the enemy’s plans. His failure could free Hudich from the collar and leave innocent lives across the universe at the mercy of ruthless beings.",
