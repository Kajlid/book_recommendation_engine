  "description": "There are many legends about the castle that overlooks Mill-On-Rye. People claim it’s haunted. They say that the King and his court died during the plague and never left. They say that when the air is still, you can hear the cries of the dead on the wind, and if you stand at the edge of the old bridge that leads to the castle, you can see the lights of their lanterns moving across the parapets. Mattie would be happy to tell the people of Mill-On-Rye that their legends are true. The Castle really is haunted. She has lived her entire life behind the tall stone walls, and knows every inch of it like the cracks in her mask. However, there is no way to leave the castle - the gate was boarded up and the bridge was destroyed centuries ago. She and the others are trapped inside until the end of time.And then one day, Mattie discovers a body in her father’s workshop, and she realizes that maybe there might be a way out. But is the world ready for the Undying Ones? And are the Undying Ones ready for the world?",
