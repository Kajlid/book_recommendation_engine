  "description": "Young lovers from starkly different lives and worlds, Clara and Ben Pipestone came together in passion and in tenderness. But their marriage could not endure deception -- or the betrayals of a tormented, searching soul. And now, though time and pain have torn them apart, they reunite for the sake of their troubled teenaged daughter -- embarking upon a rugged winter journey across sacred land in symbolic remembrance of Ben's Lakota ancestors ... and to reclaim something beautiful but lost -- and as eternal as the stars.",
