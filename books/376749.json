  "description": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER “ Among School Children  is more than a book about needy children and a valiant teacher; it is full of the author’s genuine love, delight and celebration of the human condition.”  — New York Times Book Review Tracy Kidder—the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of  The Soul of a New Machine  and the extraordinary national bestseller  House— spent nine months in Mrs. Zajac's fifth-grade classroom in the depressed \"Flats\" of Holyoke, Massachusetts. For an entire year he lived among twenty schoolchildren and their indomitable, compassionate teacher—sharing their joys, their catastrophes, and their small but essential triumphs.  As a result, he has written a revealing, remarkably poignant account of education in America.",
