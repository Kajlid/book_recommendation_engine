  "description": "Mercy Montgomery has money troubles—big money troubles. A recent college graduate, she can’t find a job to save her life. With bill collectors constantly nipping at her heels, she has no idea how she’ll ever come up with the money needed to keep her head above water. And she’s sinking fast. Mercy’s monetary worries seem to be over after a chance meeting with a mystifyingly pale stranger, who offers her a lucrative position at Dignitary, an underground organization that provides human decoys for wealthy bloodsucking clients . . . and vampires will do anything to remain anonymous. As if congregating with the undead doesn’t make life complicated enough for Mercy, there’s a savage killer on the loose who appears to have a craving for her blood. Soon Mercy is torn between a dark underworld of supernatural intrigue and a simple life of practicality, and sexy but dangerous business magnate Robert Bramson is the vampire she blames for her confusion. While Mercy’s new life provides endless thrills, it just might be the end of her.",
