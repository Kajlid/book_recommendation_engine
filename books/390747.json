  "description": "A \"Not Quite Christmas\" StoryHoliday ‘Holli’ James looks forward the week between Christmas and New Year’s. This is her one chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of her successful decorating business. The plan this year is a trip to New York City to see the sights and the lights. The plan doesn’t include a side trip to a small town jail in the middle of Pennsylvania. Nor does it include Officer Hunky.However...A single police officer, Michael is working the holidays -- again. With no local family and no interest in accepting the pity invitations to Christmas dinner from his married friends, he’s content to work and earn extra cash. Besides, this year looks to be as uneventful as ever. Until he pulls Holli over for speeding, only to discover she’s wanted on charges of fraud.Sexual tension spikes as Michael begins to investigate and discovers Holli isn't who her record says she is. While they await answers, Michael is granted permission to remove Holli from the jail and place her under house arrest.Only his idea of house arrest is much more personal than the law ever intended.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: anal play/intercourse, bondage, spanking.",
