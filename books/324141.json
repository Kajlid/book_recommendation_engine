Apart from the sound of past that echoes from the waves and threatens to destroy it all, that is.ErinMy friend inheriting an old manor is like a breath of fresh air to my world, where money is tight, my home causes only problems and the relationship with my boyfriend is less than rosy.

However the beautiful, fiery woman, relaxed evenings in front of a fireplace and the voice that slowly grew inside me surprised me. Could I keep my loved one safe, when the past wants to take me with it and control the present?The House of Past and You combines love with traces of fantasy.",
