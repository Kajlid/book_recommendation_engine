  "title": "Mary Lou at the Chalet School",
  "description": "Mary-Lou Trelawney is a week late starting the autumn term at the Chalet School, after the sudden illness and death of her grandmother. Mary-Lou was very close to her 'Gran', and her death marks the end of Mary-Lou's childhood: she is also now a senior at the school and her long-established Gang is breaking up now that its members are scattered across different forms. Mary-Lou hopes that she can have a relatively quiet term, but then Joey Maynard puts her oar in and asks her to tackle new girl Jessica Wayne. Jessica's family circumstances have made her very unpleasant to live with, which is partly why she has been sent away to the Chalet School. Joey fears that she may prove too intransigent for the Chalet School authorities, but hopes that Mary-Lou's forthright brand of kindliness will put Jessica straight in a way that her elders and betters have been unable to do.",
