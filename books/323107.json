Everyone…except me.I have no choices. The daughter of mobsters, I now belong to the Mexican Cartel. But even the terrible images those words evoke are nothing compared to what is coming for me.

I am determined to come out ahead in their Mafia Wars.*Gunmetal Lily is a full-length reverse harem novel in the dark and twisted Mafia Wars world*Recommended 18+ due to mature language, adult situations, and sensitive content",
