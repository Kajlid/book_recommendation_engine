  "description": "The sudden death of her brother brings Julia Weslin home to the High Horse, the family's sprawling yet cash-strapped Wyoming cattle ranch. A burnt-out member of the urban jungle, Julia is spiritually rejuvenated by the wild, still untamed land and reconnects to her home, family and heritage. Her sister wants to sell the property to a neighbor whose lucrative offer she finds irresistible, but Julia along with her irrepressible grandmother is fiercely determined to keep the High Horse in the family and to realize her brother's dream of saving a herd of wild mustangs that neighboring ranchers want destroyed. Blowing into her life on a south wind from Texas comes a charming drifter of a cowboy, a skilled horseman who can touch the wildest places in a horse's nature. K.C. Houston is a bright beacon of hope for Julia - and the only person capable of helping her rescue the mustangs.",
