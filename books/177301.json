  "description": "THE FANTASY MAKER is an erotic thriller that is part Fifty Shades of Grey and part Sweet Little Lies, with a character driven exploration of pleasure, sensuality and political repercussions. Thirty-four year old Emma Hamilton’s life is comfortable and predictable, right up to the moment she reluctantly enters “The Ranch”, an exclusive club where the wives of the ultra-rich and powerful surrender all inhibitions to meet every tantalizing desire. Far outside her element, Emma is initially swept away by the secret society that promises community, infinite eroticism and the fulfillment of every sexual desire limited only by the imagination. However, she soon discovers that her afternoon of pleasure comes at a shockingly high price. The more she learns about the “members only” club, the more she realizes the dangers lurking just behind the façade of sexual indulgence. With her family, life and the career of one of the most promising politicians in the country on the line, Emma goes up against a cadre of powerful players hell bent on silencing her before she destroys them all.",
