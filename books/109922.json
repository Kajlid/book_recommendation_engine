  "description": "Zachary Night and the Starbounders are back, in the sci-fi adventure series Pseudonymous Bosch calls \"a great ride and a great read,\" from Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson, authors of the Familiars series. Zachary Night may have saved Earth, but back at Indigo 8, he's still just a Starbounder-in-training. And unlike his fellow trainees, who are having a blast gearing up for the annual Indigo Games, Zachary has more important things on his mind. He has yet to decipher the cryptic warning Professor Olari left him, and it looks like someone is trying to beat him to it. When all the clues start pointing to a larger conspiracy, Zachary and his friends must once again leave Indigo 8 behind and take matters into their own hands. Their investigation will lead them through the far reaches of space, and it will test their friendship, too. And, oh yeah, did they mention the fate of the outerverse hangs in the balance? With the \"winning combination of action and humor\" ( SLJ , starred review) that earned The Familiars an Indie Next List Pick and eight state-award nominations, Rebellion catapults readers out of this world and onto a deep-space journey that's thrilling from beginning to end.",
