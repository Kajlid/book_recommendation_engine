  "description": "A creation of chaos and lust, I was born into a world so foul, I made it my mission to find the beauty hidden within, to reveal the sun behind the clouds, the rainbows after the storms, the life that still exists even in death. One-third my mother, I had an infectious smile and a heart so big, there was room enough for everyone, no matter their sins. One-third my father, I had a filthy mouth and a temper that could crumble mountains beneath the onslaught of my rage. And one-third myself, I was spontaneous, determined, wicked smart, and knew exactly what I wanted out of life. “I don’t just have a family. I have an empire.”— Ivy Olivia West",
