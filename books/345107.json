Helping and hindering this quest are his elderly wife, his young wife, grandchildren who haven't been born yet, romantic rivals he hasn't even met, a descendant from two thousand years in the future, and an alien nemesis who calls itself the Flying Doctor. Life in the military has never been so complicated.Commander Jodenny Scott would agree. She's seven months pregnant and trying to come to peace with her husband's death. When Myell reappears with tales of time travel, she's not sure what to believe.But with an invading army bearing down on Earth's last fleet of spaceships, there's not much time for debate. When the dust clears Jodenny is stranded in an Australia she never imagined, and Myell's more desperate than ever to rescue her from aliens, from treachery, and from history itself.",
