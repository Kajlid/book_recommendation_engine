  "title": "The Image",
  "description": "The Image, an acclaimed erotic novel, is one of only five erotic novels credited with true literary status by Susan Sontag. It is a tale of bondage, dominance and submission in the tradition of The Story Of O. The narrator, Jean, is assisted by Claire in the domination of the subservient Anne in a series of sexually explicit scenarios. Like O, The Image is ultimately a potent, bizarre love story, and was filmed in 1973 by Radley Metzger as Punishment Of Anne.",
