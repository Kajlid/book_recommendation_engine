  "description": "This title is presented with an introduction by Hilaire Belloc. 'P.G. Wodehouse remains the greatest chronicler of a certain kind of Englishness, that no one else has ever captured quite so sharply, or with quite as much wit and affection' - Julian Fellowes. \"Weekend Wodehouse\" - required reading at country house parties in the late Thirties - remains one of the best introductions to the work of PG Wodehouse. All the favourites are Drones Club stories, Mr Mullinger stories, and stories of Jeeves, Lord Amsworth and Ukridge.",
