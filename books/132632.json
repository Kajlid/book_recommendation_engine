It is Emma who is amazed. She has naturally concluded that the man reading in the conservatory must be the country cousin (who else in London would actually read?) and is quite vexed to discover that he is the Duke of Trent himself—imagine, stealing the duke’s prize Rhyncholaelia digbyana under his very nose!But her vexation doesn’t last long.For Emma is a practical young lady with a to end her dear sister Lavinia’s engagement to the villainous (and dreadfully dull!) Sir Waldo Windbourne, and she thinks that the famous libertine is just the man for the job.If he would only seduce her sister away from Sir Waldo… Well, not seduce exactly, but flirt mercilessly and engage her interest. Perhaps then Lavinia would jilt the baron. The Duke of Trent is resistant, of course. Despite his reputation, he does not toy with the affections of innocents.And besides, it’s not her sister he longs to seduce. ———————————————————— This book was absolutely delightful ! - Noorammk, Goodreads Reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐OMG!
