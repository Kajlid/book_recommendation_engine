  "description": "\"Dragon Warriors accomplishes what Cowboys and Aliens wanted to be; it's a Sci-Fi Western which comes from long ago, far away, and way ahead, all the while packing an Eastern philosophical meta-punch.\" Jordan MargolisHave you ever wondered why man has always looked to the stars for spiritual guidance and worship, instead of within? Have you ever imagined that visitors came to us many ions ago, and possibly influenced the primal inhabitants of earth? Have you ever marveled at the countless acts of heroism in the face of un imaginable odds and wondered to yourself \"How can they do this, what motivates them to these great deeds?\" Could it possibly be that the blood of humanity is also that of another race of people? These are all things you must consider as you read through the pages of this book. Where heroes known and unknown become more than fact, history, or legend. Come with me now as I take you on a journey of our past and future. To distant lands and long forgotten galaxies. We will start in the desert during the Crusades and end 700 years later at the death-bed of U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves. All in the hopes of identifying the descendants of Ibrahim, and possibly answering the question once and for all \"Are there no more Dragon Warriors?\"",
