But the hatred from a spitfire like Leah doesn’t die easily, and the more I try to break through to her, the more we fight. So when an accident leaves us stranded, we have no choice but to work together to make it out of the mountains alive.But will teaming up rekindle our flame, or be the final blow that destroys us?",
