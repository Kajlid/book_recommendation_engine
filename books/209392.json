  "description": "We all have inner demons. We fight them all the time. Some of us achieve inner peace by coming to terms with them. But how do you come to terms with inner demons that tear free and become outer demons? Eric has been a vampire for nearly a century, and his demons are more than metaphors. While they controlled him, he was the Demon King. Now he has to avoid the monsters in his own mind, as well as angry nobles, fanatical religions, assassins, magi, other vampires, criminal organizations, and the neighborhood gossip. He wants two things: To find Tort, and to have someplace to call home. It may be too much to ask.",
