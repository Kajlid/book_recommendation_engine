  "description": "Boats...Sydney Campbell hates boats, almost as much as she hates unsweetened iced tea, mornings and people that insist on wearing pantyhose with open-toed shoes. But when it comes to sexy London Boys singer, Simon Young, there aren't many things Sydney wouldn't do. And that's how she finds herself aboard a cruise ship to the Bahamas trying to not only win his business, but maybe even his heart.Simon Young has spent the past four years drowning in a sea of booze and women, trying to dull the memory of a night he knows he'll never forget. The only thing keeping him from calling it quits on life is a beloved silver locket that has somehow kept his sanity in check for nearly a decade. But it's not until he meets his new confident and incredibly beautiful public relations manager that he feels like he can finally breathe again. Simon and Sydney are both shocked by their instant connection, but even more surprising is how right it all seems. And now given the chance, Sydney hopes to repay a favor that changed her forever, but she may be too late. Simon may be too far gone to be brought back to life.Only time - and a silver locket - will tell.Note: The Fangirl Series is a stand-alone series. You do not have to read \"You Never Know\" prior to reading the other books in the series, but there is character crossover.",
