  "title": "Expedition to the Zambesi: The Zambesi River and its Tributaries",
  "description": "Commissioned during Britainâ€™s golden age for expeditions to chart the Zambesi river for minerals and trade, David Livingstone left England in 1858 for what is today Zimbabwe and discovered an area whose sharp contrast between misery and natural beauty bewitched him. Outraged by the racial injustice he found during the eight-year expedition, Livingstone wrote this gripping account in a refreshingly contemporary style. Worthy of the best writers of the time, the book was an instant success and turned him into one of Britain's most famous public persona.",
