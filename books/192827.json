  "description": "My dreams were simple. College, a career, and let’s see what happens from there. But things don’t always go according to plan. My name is Ari Worthington and I’ve had a very eventful week. A life-changing week. The kind of week that would make the average person whimper. It started when my ex-boyfriend Luke accosted me in the woods. How badly was I injured? Not a scratch. And Luke? Not so lucky. Nope, I whupped him good. It surprised the heck out of me. And it probably surprised him, too—once he woke up. And then I met Davin. Handsome, witty, amazing Davin. Perfect in every way, unless you think being an alien, from a planet called Olympus, might be a liability. “Seriously? Your planet is named after a Greek mountain?” I ask him. “Actually, it’s the other way around,” he tells me. “The mountain was named after us. We’ve been visiting Earth for a very, very long time. As a matter of fact, we are responsible for human evolution.” So, ancient aliens are real? Yeah. But there’s more. Davin’s an angel, which I could have handled, would have handled, if only he hadn’t told me I was one, too. “But we don’t have wings,” I say. “Real angels don’t need wings,” he counters. “Ah, that explains everything,” I reply. So, you think this is just another angel story? Well, it’s not. It’s got humor, romance, adventure, science, tragedy, and… did I say romance? It’ll make you think, and laugh, and cry. Davin and I, you see, are part of a larger plan. A noble plan. A plan to save the sons and daughters of man, or what’s left of them, after the war. A big war. Okay, enough of my rambling. Davin and I need to get back to training. And you’ve got some reading to do, yeah?",
