So she intercepts the invite--and asks her two best friends Antonia and Marlowe to come along to the fest with her. It'll be a spring break they'll never forget.But when Plum and her friends get to the island, it's not anything like it seemed in the invite. The island is run-down, creepy, and there doesn't even seem to be a festival--it's just seven other quasi-celebrities and influencers, and none of the glitz and glamor she expected. Then people start to die...Plum and her friends soon realize that someone has lured each of them to the \"festival\" to kill them. Someone has a vendetta against every person on the island--and no one is supposed to leave the island alive. So, together, Plum, Antonia, and Marlowe will do whatever it takes to unravel the mystery of the killer, and fight to save themselves and as many influencers as they can, before it's too late.",
