  "description": "You can’t run from who you are… Sandy Guilianno is just like any average girl--a committed student, a hard-working barista and the only stable presence in the life of her wayward brother and aging, hospitalized mother--and now that she’s escaped the rough Italian American neighborhood she grew up in for college, she feels certain she can finally leave the past behind and get on with her life. But the past has a way of repeating itself. When Sandy’s brother Lou gets involved with the local Mafia, Sandy is torn between wanting to escape the forces that dominated their early life and the desire to protect him--and the fact that he’s started dating her best friend only makes it more complicated. But when Sandy meets Lou’s new partner in crime, the brooding, mysterious Romeo Mancini, she finds herself inexplicably drawn closer to the heart of their criminal underworld… Romeo Mancini is not what he seems. Fresh out of New York and working with the Chicago FBI, the young undercover cop has escaped his own troubled past, only to find himself embroiled in more danger and deceit than anyone should bear. He keeps his head down and stays focused on his goal, but he wasn’t counting on Sandy Guilianno… From the moment they meet, a spark is lit. Mutual desire and attraction grow into something neither can repress and now everything they’ve worked for in their separate lives is at risk. And the forces of darkness are already closing in. Romeo of the Streets is the debut New Adult Romance novel by author Taylor Hill",
