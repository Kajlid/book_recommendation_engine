  "description": "Daphne Lee-Lee is a rock-and-roll mom caught in the middle of an explosion that shakes her straitlaced hometown’s rigid foundations—and blows up the local PTA. She knows she didn’t kill the ladies she’s dubbed “Cupcakes,” but as the police’s main suspect, Daphne doesn’t have much time to clear her hyphenated name. Then someone blows up her beloved Volkswagen Beetle, and the stakes are suddenly much higher. If the whole town doesn’t show up at her house with pitchforks and torches, the real killer may be the one who’s finally going to get her.",
