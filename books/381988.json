  "description": "The Chandogya Upanishad forms the last chapter of the Chandogya Brahmana of the Sama Veda.It is the second largest of the major Upanishads, next only to the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad. Shankara held this Upanishad in great esteem and quoted from it in his Bhasya of the Brahma Sutras .The Gambhirananda translation has the commentary of Sankaracarya, with Devanagri script and English translation. This is not an easy scripture to read or study, but is nonetheless an important scripture.",
