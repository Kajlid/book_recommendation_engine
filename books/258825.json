They leverage damaging inside information provided by a Treasury mole to formulate an elaborate, albeit illegal, plan. If successful, their plan will not only expose the Feds' $17 trillion heist to the world, but it will also bring down the corrupt Swamp Rats in DC, and may even possibly exonerate Jones and his associates.",
