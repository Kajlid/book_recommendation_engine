  "description": "In May 2005, Natalee Holloway disappeared from a high school trip to Aruba. Five years to the day later, 21 year old Stephany Flores Ramirez was reported missing in Lima, Peru. Implicated in both crimes was one young man, Joran van der Sloot. A 22 year old Dutchman, van der Sloot has become the subject of intense scrutiny by the media and the public in the years since 2005. He was arrested and detained by Aruban authorities in connection with the Holloway murder, only to be released after questioning. In2008, during a Dutch sting operation, he admitted to being present for Holloway's death, but later recanted his statement. In 2010, on the five year anniversary of her disappearance, a young business student in Peru named Stephany Flores Ramirez disappeared, only to be found dead three days later in a hotel room, registered to Joran van der Sloot. He was arrested for the murder, and he confessed, but later claimed it was coerced. This book offers a probing look at the man tied to two of the most sensational cases of the decade. With unprecedented access to investigative files from law enforcement in the U.S., Aruba, Chile and Peru, it is a glimpse into the workings of an international manhunt and a chilling portrait of the alleged killer within.",
