  "description": "\"Striking the right note could shatter more than their hearts. \"\"Biting Love, Book 7\"After an attack that slaughtered his family, vampire Dragan Zajicek walled off his heart and went on a sixteen-hundred-year rampage with the bad boys of history.Now a rock star of the concert podium and master freelance spy, he's taken the baton for a small orchestra near Chicago to investigate rumors of a monstrous, undefeatable vampire dubbed the Soul Stealer.But it's the lovely, unassuming Raquel \"Rocky\" Hrbek who mesmerizes him from the first touch of her luscious lips on her flute.Rocky, a shy shadow scarred by middle school cruelty, is mystified as to why core-meltingly gorgeous Dragan would notice a mouse like her. As his stolen kisses draw her dangerously close to the edge of her carefully constructed comfort zone, he exposes her secret-she's investigating the monster herself.As their quest draws them closer together, the monster zeroes in on the woman Dragan's rebellious heart tells him is his mate. Now they must find a way to destroy the indestructible before Rocky is utterly consumed. And Chicago is bathed in the blood of innocents. Contains a master of seduction and symphonies, an awkward and innocent flutist, small-town humor, heart-stopping action, and an exodus to Iowa. Oh, and the cheese balls are ba-a-ack-and deadlier than ever.",
