  "description": "LondonI had been broken into so many pieces that I didn’t think that anyone could put me back together again. When Mason Pelletier tried he only left me wanting more. To kiss him, have him spank me…all those bad things a man like him could do to a woman behind closed doors. What was supposed to be a one-night stand left us both yearning for something more.I know that he isn’t going to like me when he finds out who I really am behind all the black eyeliner. That’s okay because I don’t like me either.Mason claimed to love me so why did he hurt me so badly I can’t even breathe? How can I forgive someone for something so terrible?MasonI was no one’s knight in shining whatever. I enjoy my ladies fun, not clingy, but always a little crazy in the sack. I knew exactly who London Sullivan was when she came to me for a little wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am. She was persistent when I tried to turn her down so we had our fun, but when it doesn’t end there I felt the need to get her out from beneath my skin. She’s so much more than I bargained for. The plan was to keep her safe from harm. To save her from the ghost that continued to haunt her. Everything I did was to protect her until it’s too late. How can I make London realize that she rescued me?*Gravity is suitable for ages 18+. Contains sexual assault, an eating disorder and suicidal tendencies, which may be disturbing for some readers.*",
