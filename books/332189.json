Such is the fate of Dani, Aideen, and Orla—three daring women from different time eras—linked by a rare, mutual occupation. They meet on a tiny island in western Ireland, in the year 2022, and develop a fierce affection for one another. But their time together—and much more—will end unless they unravel a mystery surrounding their boss, Charles, a curious man from the future who claims he wants to save humanity. But Charles is hiding something sinister.

Apocalypse is only days away.",
