  "description": "When she was found barely coherent and staggering over sand dunes, word spread fast that the prophecy had finally come to pass and Lacáruna had been delivered to initiate the next expansion of this world. The trouble is Lacáruna has been removed from the world she’s intended to expand. Amy Darlidale must return to her mission before any harm can come to her friends. Fortunately, she knows the way back and, unlike the first time Amy found herself under a full moon in a starless sky, she knows what she’s up against. In order to fulfill the Promise of a New Morphósis Amy understands that the actual prophecy has to be found, but the sense of order in this mysterious world continues to collapse. Fires rage, clans are being slaughtered and townsfolk massacred, and leaders have proclaimed a great evil has returned. Licha and Jandro, the young companions who have been with her from the start, along with the Trotéjo comrades who have sworn to protect her—Dack, who has saved her life more than once, and their new ally Sheng, a Palace Guard who has joined their quest, continue pushing forward as their obstacles multiply. Unsure what answers might be found in the first mythic journals of this world’s origins, Amy searches for clues. But secretly she’s begun seeing visions and receiving messages from forces unknown. As she tries to understand the extent of her power others are becoming aware of it as well. Soon a new group with its own mysterious agenda believes Amy may have another fated purpose and only she can save herself from their terrifying trap.",
