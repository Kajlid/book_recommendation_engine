Through a lost two decades, the loving information from this partnership has sustained spiritual growth of many and explained much about our changing times. This is the eighth Kryon book, written in 2000. It represents the beginning of the new millennium and attempts to answer many of the questions about the energy that many were feeling at the time. It is still relevant to what is happening now as the chapter titles will show.",
