  "description": "In a world shared between oblivious humans and the non-Sapien creatures retired to myth, keeping secrets comes easy. Coming clean is a process undertaken one day at a time…  Introverted, routine-loving Betty enjoys a life split between work at the clinic as a physical therapist, and weekly meetings of the local chapter of Catch & Release. Structure, and the program, have kept Betty from a fall back into the reckless behavior of her past life. Besides occasionally calling for takeout, she has everything she needs without ever leaving her comfort zone. Betty’s kept her work at the clinic and work in the program separate for years. Outside the assumed anonymity of meetings, her secrets are all her own. Until her sponsor decides it’s about time for a change…  Cocky and frustratingly vague C. Lincoln is a wolf-shifter with his own past to reconcile, not that it seems to sour his quest for a good time. When he crosses paths with uptight Betty, the womanizing charmer thinks he’s up for the challenge. He has no idea what he’s in for.  A supernatural romance re-imagined for a bit of harmless plot alongside your usual dose of guilty pleasure. #supernatural #shifter #succubus #wizard | Profanity | Mild Violence | Adult Situations |",
