And so when she encounters the lawyer, Maria Gosselin, she understands just how all-consuming her jealousy can be, especially when when Maria makes it clear that she believes there is unfinished business between her and the rich founder of Stone Enterprises.Seeking at first only to understand more about Daniel’s past and to uncover the motives behind Maria’s actions, Kris begins to pursue the woman. It comes as a shock to her, then, to discover that her own attraction to this strong, clever rival threatens to overwhelm her own senses—and that Maria is more than happy to use this to get everything that she wants, even if it means destroying whatever fragile happiness Kris and Daniel have achieved.",
