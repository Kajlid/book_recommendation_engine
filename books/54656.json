  "description": "LaQueisha Malone is back with another compilation of poetry that relates to love, happiness, relationship issues, and different emotions that will leave you captivated. Sometimes these emotions can be overwhelming, and hold you hostage. Not all emotional captivity is unpleasant. Some emotions can be virtuous such as, love, happiness, joy, and peace. In Part One, Held Captive, her poetry reflects the different types of emotions causing a person to become depressed, sadden, hurt, or even betrayed. In Part Two, Been Set Free, she lets you in on how she became free. No longer trapped by other peoples’ expectations, she begins to find her own way of doing things, and learns to trust in God. Some situations may take days, months, even years to face, but until you do you will remain in the prison… Cell of the Mind! Journey through with poems like Appointed by the Press, Unexpected Pain, Confusion, Does It Really Matter What I Want, Baby Please Say I Do, Never Judge a Book by Its Cover, I Dream of Genie, and more.",
