  "title": "Bad Candy: Part One",
  "description": "What's the fastest way to screw up your closest relationship? Easy, hookup with your twin sister's best friend. I know, I know. I'm a dick. My sister, Kelsa, has always been very vocal about how she feels about me hooking up with her friends. Needless to say, she'd have my balls. But, you see, Renee Espada has always been \"bad candy\", a term Kelsaand I coined when we were kids. The ultimate temptation. That's exactly what she is. Sweet, innocent, and totally off-limits.  It's been rough, especially since I moved into the apartment she shares with my sister. I can't help but flirt with her. Itâ€™s just who I am, plus that blush of hers is addictive. I've always been drawn to her. But, what I never expected was her to make a move on me first.(This title was originally in a duet format, but now includes both books, Bad Candy Part One and Bad Candy Part Two, in one continuous story.)",
