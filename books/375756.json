  "title": "An Anthology of Canadian Literature in English",
  "description": "The editors (Donna Bennet and Russell Brown) explained the following about this third edition of the anthology: \"This annotated text for Canadian literature courses is the third abridged and revised edition of our popular two-volume Anthology of Canadian Literature in English (1982-3). The collection provides basic texts, and makes connections between them, offering a context for the study not only of individual writers but of the literary culture of English Canada from the eighteenth century to the present.  The book contains updated selections from poets and fiction writers previously included, as well as selections by writers new to the anthology-from early figures such as Oliver Goldsmith and Nellie McClung to contemporary writers including Eden Robinson, Wayde Compton, and Madeline Thien. Each author is given a headnote that gives biographical details and explains the significance of the author's work. The new edition is more inclusive, with more women and aboriginal writers and more writers from different ethnic backgrounds. In putting the anthology together, the editors paid close attention to the kinds of themes people are currently teaching, such as questions of identity, contact across cultures, fragmentation, and mobility\"",
