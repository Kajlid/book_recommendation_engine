  "description": "Why does the art world hypocritically promote female creative talent but simultaneously fail to accord women artists the respect given to their male counterparts? Why are women so under-represented in top curatorial posts? Just what has happened to the feminist movement?Using pornographic spam emails, and replacing the generic ‘he’ and ‘she’ with the names of leading feminist artists, Blood Rites of the Bourgeoisie delivers a vicious feminist assault on the pretensions and hypocrisy of the London art world.With walk-on parts by Martha Rosler, Sam Taylor Wood, and Tracey Emin, sensational lost Belle de Jour transcripts, and missives from the underbelly of the blogosphere, Blood Rites of the Bourgeoisie reads like SCUM manifesto remixed by The Bomb Squad. Rushed to Malcolm McLaren for an endorsement, legend has it his final croak was, ‘feminism with balls’.Stewart Home has a legendary reputation as a writer, artist and filmmaker. His novels include: 69 Things To Do With A Dead Princess, Tainted Love, and Memphis Underground. From 2007–10 he worked for Book Works as the commissioning editor of Semina, a series of acclaimed experimental novels.",
