  "description": "Ariane Tucker has the name--and life--of a dead girl. The original Ariane was fully human; this one's not. There are Rules that come along with her being Ariane. They're simple, but essential for her safety and her father's: Never trust anyone. Remember they are always searching. Don't get involved. Keep your head down. Don't fall in love. She has followed these Rules faithfully for ten years.The trouble, though, with rules is that you're always tempted to break one: for the right reasons, due to unavoidable circumstances, because it feels as if there's no other choice. Enter Zane Bradshaw.",
