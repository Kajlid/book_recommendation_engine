  "description": "At 27, I bought a one-way ticket to India. I had no idea what I'd do when I landed, but in the past my most rewarding experiences came when I let intuition be my guide. So, I traveled without an itinerary and found myself searching for an elusive monkey temple, teaching Tibetan monks to sing, \"You Are My Sunshine,\" and holding the hand of a dying man at the Mother Theresa Homes for the Destitute and Dying. Throughout, I followed an inner sense of joy. I could not be sure it would lead me to the happy life I dreamt of, but it was the only choice I had.",
