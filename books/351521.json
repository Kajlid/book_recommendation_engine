  "description": "Orion was born to a wild werewolf pack that spent more time as beasts than men. That changed when he met an elf of the Redwood, Thalanil. For the first time in over a month, the timber wolf felt compelled to return to human form when he sensed the presence of his mate.Thalanil had never thought to be bonded to a werewolf, of all things, though he wasnâ€™t about to question the fate given to him by the Earth Mother. When he returned to his military duties, he had a new mate in tow. Together, they found a home with their spec ops team and a purpose in life.Now, as the holdouts of the Inquisition have been rooted out one by one, the team has been called upon to aid in their destruction once and for all. With Shaw and Marcus returned, it should be a quick and easy job. Except, dark magic like they have never seen before lurks around every corner. Their only hope to survive might be found in a trio of powerful mate bonds and the magic of their tribe.Author's Note: This title is not stand-alone.Content Warnings:Graphic (explicit, detailed description): Blood, Confinement, Death, Gore, Mental Illness (PTSD), Panic Attacks/Disorders, Violence (guns, magical), WarModerate: Genocide, Grief, Kidnapping, Medical Content, TortureMinor (brief mention or description): Racism (fantasy races), Sexual Content (fade-to-black)",
