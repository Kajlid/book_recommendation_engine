  "description": "Too quiet.\n A talented hacker who got caught, Brigid Banaghan is now forced to work with a secret Deep Ops unit. But she won't reveal any more to these renegade Feds than she has to. Especially not to Raider Tanaka, her control freak of a bodyguard and handler. It's enough that his body is tensed for action and his heated gaze is always on her . . .\nToo sharp.\n Raider knows there's more to his new assignment than he's been told. Why send a deadly agent of his experience to guard a computer genius—even a gorgeous, unpredictable, undisciplined one? But when Brigid's estranged father is named in an investigation into Boston's organized crime, Raider's mind switches onto high alert, just like his senses . . .\nToo close.\n To clear her father's name, Brigid needs Raider's help. The Unit's idea that she bring a straight-laced Fed in as her \"fiancé\" won't fly, though—not unless Raider can release his inner bad boy and become the rebel Brigid can't resist . . .",
