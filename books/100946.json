  "description": "Before they can begin to understand who they are and how they fit into the world, Sonya, Chase, and Marilyn are thrust into a whole new world. In the world after everything else, corpses walk the roadways and the living must find ways and reasons to survive. Sonya has one goal in mind: travel halfway across the country to find her father. Chase, the son of wealth and privilege, must find a way to live for others and himself. Marilyn, from the happiest of homes, will have to reconstruct a family in order to learn to survive. Through their struggles to become the people they need to be to survive, they face the creepers, their name for the dead. But the creepers aren't the biggest threat. The biggest threat comes from the living.",
