  "description": "In 2013, Mike Macdonald was inaugurated the first Centrist President of the United States. He expected fierce budget battles with Congress, now politically split into thirds. However, on the morning of his first day in office a ground level nuclear device vaporized Detroit and Windsor, Canada forcing him into a much larger battle. Generals and intelligence officers instead of economists and financiers poured into the White House, while his VP, Bryanna Dudley, a former Midwestern Independent governor, flew out on Air Force Two to take over the heart-wrenching search and recovery mission. In Washington, Macdonald, a Marine, Rhodes Scholar, PhD in finance and high powered currency trader, had been elected to reverse the country's wasteful spending and downward spiral into third world status. Now he faces two daunting recoveries with questionable resources and no known enemy to attack, while having to allay the fears of a panicking nation. The military was at DEFCON 1, Code Red. The world stood riveted - what will this new president do? Would there be another bomb? How far would the US dollar sink? Where will Macdonald start? Did the bombing tie into the financial debacle? If so, how? He appeared proactive, but would that be enough? The full weight of his and international intelligence organizations begin the arduous search for clues. However, when the answer comes, it will be from a most unusual and unexpected source.",
