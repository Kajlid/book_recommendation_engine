  "title": "The Stakes Are High: God's Wisdom for Our Public Schools",
  "description": "Americas public schools are in crisis! It is no wonder that more and more Christian parents are removing their children from our nations public schools and placing them into Christian schools, or home-schooling them. Is this the correct move for us as Christians? Should we run from the fight with evil influences and let worldly wisdom direct the education of Americas youth? The future of all young people is at stake. Our nations future is at stake! This is not the time to turn our backs or throw in the towel! This is the time to get Godly wisdom and attack the issues at hand. In The Stakes Are High, veteran teacher Dennis Ray examines what Godly wisdom means and how to get it, providing practical applications for use in the lives of students and adults alike.",
