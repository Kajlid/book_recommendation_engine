  "title": "This Bloody Mary is the Last Thing I Own: A Journey to the End of Boxing",
  "description": "Fittingly, it is in Las Vegas, boxing's capital, that author Jonathan Rendall, a young British boxing enthusiast, reflects on his own exit from the boxing scene. What unfolds is the true story of his boyhood romance with the sport, his canny coming-of-age as a boxing writer, and his risky bid to bring the unknown Colin \"Sweet C\" McMillan to the World Featherweight Championship. Written with the detachment of a seasoned journalist, Jonathan Rendall has produced an uncommon sports memoir about having the faith and losing the faith. Intelligent and funny, This Bloody Mary Is the Last Thing I Own is a boxing book with appeal that extends well beyond the ring.",
