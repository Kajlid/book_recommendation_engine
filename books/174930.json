High school is hard enough without having to start all over，but that's exactly what sixteen years old twins Olivia and Haydon are forced to do.Not only are their relatives basically strangers--but the small town of Jasper Crane is anything but normal or welcoming. Soon they discover things may not be what they seem.Supernatural powers start making themselves known in both twins，forcing them to reconcile with the idea that coincidences are rare，and they may be in Jasper Crane for a reason，one that could have dire consequences.",
