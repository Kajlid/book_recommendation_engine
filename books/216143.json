  "description": "Waking up next to a dead stranger with no memory of how he got there should be the worst day of Caitlin Cavanaugh’s life. However, what seems to be a clear case of self-defense soon puts Caitlin on the defensive, as evidence left behind at the scene doesn’t match up with her story. But proving her innocence becomes the least of her problems... Criminal defense attorney Jack Wellington is highly sought after in the courtrooms of Savannah… not to mention the bedrooms of its female denizens. Jack believes himself to be hardened against the darker aspects of human nature, as well as the emotional plight of those he both cross-examines and defends. But when he encounters Caitlin in the hospital following her morning ordeal, something about the frightened but defiant romance novelist pulls at him. Jack’s attraction to his client continues to grow as what started as a simple enough case turns into a fight to save Caitlin’s life. Old friends, ex-lovers and even her own family – someone among them wants Caitlin dead. And both of them learn what lengths some will go to in order to avoid justice.",
