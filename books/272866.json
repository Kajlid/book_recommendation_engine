  "description": "My office job was like no other. I worked in a well respected and established firm. The benefits were fantastic but my favorite benefit was actually the president of the company. During my time at the firm, I worked very closely with Mr. Steel. We had developed a very special relationship, which had to be kept a secret. I understood. I was getting special treatment, after all.  Mr. Steel had a way of pushing my buttons. We shared one common interest: bondage. While working many late nights on a high profile case, we developed a relationship that should have never formed. I'm very grateful for it and we kept it extremely secretive. He even uses an undisclosed email address to let me know when he will be at my apartment. It's just one of the means he uses to keep me in line. I love it when he treats me like a bad girl. Just thinking about it gets my juices going.  Fourteen #FlirtClub authors have gotten together to do it again with the Mr. Billionaire short story series!!  Feeling a little blue?  Flirt Club is tickled pink to bring you a full spectrum of fourteen hot, steamy new romances.  These billionaires might cause some to be green with envy but their hearts are solid gold.  Are you ready to love in technicolor?",
