  "description": "“This book is the real  story.” —Robby Krieger“[John] Densmore's is the first Doors biography that feels like it was written for the right reasons, and it is easily the most informed account of the Doors' brief but brilliant life as a group. . . . Densmore is a fluent, articulate writer who both comprehends the Doors' unearthly power and is on familiar terms with their antecdedents in literature, theater, and myth.” — Rolling Stone“Well-written and touching . . . tells it all and tells it honestly.” — The New York Times Book Review“John Densmore's Riders of the Storm  is as good an account of the history of the Doors as has been printed to date.” — USA Today“ Riders on the Storm  is very enjoyable, especially its homespun and self-experienced insights. John Densmore is a survivor and a seeker.” —Oliver Stone",
