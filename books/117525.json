The following semester, incoming freshman Alejandro Velásquez arrives on campus, eager to reinvent himself after eighteen years of awkwardness, as well as a devastating family tragedy, shake his sense of worth and faith to their cores. The two lonely souls meet under the auspice of moonlit rain, and soon find themselves passionately, irrevocably attracted to each other.

The fast friends become intense lovers, and become determined to find a way to hold onto their own private miracle forever. Yet troublesome questions linger. How can Alejandro possibly explain to skeptical friends and family that his soul-mate is a ghost? Why does Leila get the nagging suspicion that their relationship might hold the key to understanding her existence as a spirit?

Will their love give them the courage to accept a destiny that surpasses time and perhaps even God, or is their love destined to die loud and young?",
