I can never really work out what they’re saying, and I’ve long given up trying.Everything changes when my life is threatened again, and the voices quiet, one strong voice telling me to run, so of course, I listen.When some supernatural agents turn up in town, I should be cautious, but thanks to my instincts, which have always guided me right before, I’m not worried about them at all, at least, I’m not until they start to notice things about me, differences that no human should have.Thankfully, a call from my more bloody job saves me from having to stick around. The betrayal that quickly follows doesn’t surprise me, it does leave me only one place to go, and I have no idea how he’s going to react or if I’ll even make it there alive.It’s a good job that I never turn down a challenge because this may be one that I don’t survive.This is a medium burn paranormal Reverse Harem.
