  "description": "What does the world look like through non-binary eyes? What does it feel like to start over in a city after being raised in a small southern town? What does it feel like the first time someone finds affirmation and embrace in a community? In That Year, we follow Collings as, with the help of a supportive grandmother and gramsâ€™ special friend, they navigate each of these questions in Tampa, Florida. Told from Collings perspective, we walk with them as they navigate emerging adulthood, cisgender norms and assumptions, and their first experiences living openly as a non-binary, pansexual young adult.",
