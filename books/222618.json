  "title": "Command Decision",
  "description": "While escorting supertankers in and out of the Persian Gulf, the crew of the USS Wadsworth is called upon to rescue a stricken naval vessel. Setting sail without the ship's officers, Ted Lawson becomes the ship's reluctant de facto commander. With the support of a seasoned crew, Ted must make one command decision after another as the tiny warship takes on the Iranian Air Force and Navy. For the USS Wadsworth, there is only one way out of the Persian through the bloody Straits of Hormuz. Against heavy odds, Lawson must make decisions that pit the well-being of those under his command against defending the strategic interests of the United States. With limited ammunition and experience, he knows doing what is expected will be costly.Adventurer, traveler, baseball fan, and dealer of death and destruction, Tom Lohr spent twenty-four years in the United States Navy as technician and operator for surface-to-air and cruise missile systems. Serving mainly on guided-missile destroyers and frigates, he survived several tours patrolling the Persian Gulf, including a stint during the Iran-Iraq War.Spending his youth as an island-hopping, skirt-chasing drunk with one foot in the grave while galavanting throughout the South Pacific, he finally wised up and rose to the rank of Master Chief Fire Controlman. After retiring from the military, he spent one year at the research facility at the South Pole, and seven years working in the pipeline industry.An avid admirer of mid-century modern architecture, fashion, and automobiles; pitching duels; and fine whiskey, he now resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
