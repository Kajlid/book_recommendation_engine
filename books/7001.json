  "description": "“THE FUNNIEST FICTIONAL HEROINE SINCE BRIDGET JONES.”—Teen PeopleLast summer, Vivian Livingston set the world ablaze in her first book The Autobiography of Vivian, a tell-all tale of a girl trying her best to be the woman she knows she is inside. With demons to kick, confidence to gather, and goals to reach, Vivian decides to leave her safe ‘n’ sound hometown and take a bite out of the Big Apple. If she can make it there . . . well, you know the song.Fast forward five eventful years—anyone would have thought that Vivian finally had it the “nice” guy, the great job, the “work in progress” bachelorette pad, a backstage pass to New York City, and an emotional first aid kit just in case. Not so fast! Just when Vivian thought that she had arrived (and on time no less), think again! an ever-buoyant subconscious, mind games without a set of directions, and pressures that make final exams and deciding on first date attire look like cake.In her second book, Vivian takes on her biggest challenge herself. Her real fears, her true hopes, and her big dreams. Befriend her as she realizes that disillusionment comes with the territory, that “breaking the glass ceiling” is the least of it, and that your past—the good and the bad—is a part of you forever. Take the journey alongside Vivian; be her travel companion through this game called life. Bring along a notebook, be sure to stop and smell the roses, and pack your favorite cocktail dress just in case!",
