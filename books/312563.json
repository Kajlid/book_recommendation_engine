  "description": "45 New Arrangments for Classical Guitar Players in Open D TuningThe classical guitar book in open D guitar tuning presents a new, and I think, additional way of approaching classical guitar repertoire. Tuning to an open chord, in this case, DADF#AD can have its benefits. The most obvious is that a major chord can be played with a single finger, or in the key of D, with open strings.Every attempt has been made to keep true to the original manuscripts, but occasionally the tune is transposed from the original, or the odd note has been altered to make the pieces playable. I have kept the arrangements primarily in the keys of D, G or A to take full advantage of the open strings in D tuning. In short, this book may not be for the classical guitar purist but does expand the repertoire that is lacking with open tunings.There is a good selection of graded pieces from prominent classical guitar composers like Aguado, Sor, Giuliani, Carcassi and Carulli, plus other well-known works by Bach, Dowland, Satie, Beethoven, de Visee, Diabelli, Grieg, Haydn, O’ Carolan, Pachelbel, Paganini, Petzold, Sanz, Schumann and Vivaldi. I also adapted 24 of the Giuliani right-hand exercises, major and minor scales and arpeggios, plus fretboard charts to further develop your knowledge and technique in Open D. Each piece has notation, tablature in Open D tuning, right- and left-hand fingerings, and performance markings. An assortment of reference audio tracks is available online at the authors' website.",
