  "description": "The Vampire King is dead…So now I’m on the run from his maniacal successor, with a critically wounded vampire prince who needs feeding and the maid who loves him at my side.And I thought the Harvest Games were bad…To make matters infinitely worse, I’m pretty much obsessed with the General of the Vampire Army, who—spoiler alert—has been tasked with leading the hunting party sent to kill me and my not-so-merry band of misfits. The only chance we have of getting through this mess alive is to throw ourselves at the mercy of the neighboring werewolves and hope they don’t rip us to shreds. They are the key to defeating the newly crowned “King” Edmund and saving the Vampire Kingdom from a return to the old days. Days filled with unchecked cruelty, torture, and mayhem.It would take a little cunning and loads of audacity to even attempt to negotiate an alliance between two species that have been warring for centuries.Luckily, I’ve got both in spades.",
