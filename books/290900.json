With mating season upon them, he will ignore his natural instinct to mate, choosing to build on the friendship they’d found when she came to the clan a broken female.  Anna Claire knew the male was her mate the moment she laid eyes on him. The youngest Morgan brother had taken her under his wing and provided for her during the previous year while she healed from her injuries, making a safe place in his den for their winter hibernation.  As they awake for the spring, hunters from an underground hate group make themselves known. The clan must come together to stop them before someone is killed. When their lands go under attack, Gunnar will stop at nothing to keep his mate and family safe…even if that means sacrificing himself for his unborn cub.",
