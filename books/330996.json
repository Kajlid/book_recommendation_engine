  "description": "Lovers in a room overlooking the North Sea, a missing boy on an island in the Hebrides, an itinerant saw-millerâ€™s tragic accident in the forests of Argyle, these short stories--often with a historical and sometimes speculative flavour--offer a glimpse into a Scotland of magic and mystery. First published in literary magazines such as New Writing Scotland and Gutter, they have now been brought together in this haunting anthology.",
