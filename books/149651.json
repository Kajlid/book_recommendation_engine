  "description": "Brianne is the opposite of her best friend, Kyla. Kyla is open-minded; Brianne is closed off, judgmental. Kyla is a hopeless romantic. Brianne?  Not so much. When Kyla shoves an apple into Brianne’s face and tells her to throw it across the cafeteria to find her future love, Brianne is unimpressed. And yet she throws the apple anyway.  Who does the apple hit?  Just Dannon Barone, the most popular boy in school.  Though he’s seemingly sweet and all-smiles, Brianne dislikes him intensely.  She thinks he’s a fake and a fraud.  But Brianne is about to learn that stereotypes are not always true, and that she’s been too quick to judge those around her.   Who would have known that a stupid apple could be right?",
