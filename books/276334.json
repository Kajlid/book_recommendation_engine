  "description": "Two siblings must deal with their troubled pasts while preparing for the devastating Shadow Army poised to destroy the world. Explore the world of Gaia like never before. Uncover new secrets, learn its magic, and discover the destiny that awaits our gifted students of the elements. Danger once again looms in the shadows, but this time the unstoppable Shadow Army has been created, and even worse, a giant beast, that was once considered to be a myth, has joined the enemy forces, making an already unwinnable war now seem impossible. Â With only three warriors of Fire left to take on an entire Shadow Army, Gabrael, the God of Fire, must go against the Laws of the Land to teach students this forbidden element. With the odds stacked against them, S'rae and Vayp must not only battle their own doubts if they wish to save the end of Gaia, but they must come to terms with the grave reality that the Shadow Army is not their greatest danger. It's themselves.",
