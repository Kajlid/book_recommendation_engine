Correction, I need to be taken—for my sister's sake. It's my fault she was chosen during the last offering, and I have to find out if she’s alive.I thought I was ready, but nothing could have prepared me for the four monsters who claim me. A vampire, wolf shifter, demon, and siren. They're terrifying, powerful, and infuriatingly arrogant...and now these alphas are fixated on me. Turns out, finding my sister won’t be as easy as I’d hoped. Now that I’m in their world, the monsters think I’ll become one of them. I’m in their monster trials, and they’re going to play with me until I turn. These a**holes think it’ll be easy to break me, but they picked the wrong girl. Because I’m already a monster. They just don’t know it yet. This is a fun reverse harem fantasy novel for audiences aged 18 years and older. **Language warning **Multiple POV",
