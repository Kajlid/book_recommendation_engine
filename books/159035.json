  "title": "The Fourth Monkey: Poetry With A Purpose",
  "description": "Visions of dawn...painted through words. A woman's helplessness revealed through poetic meter... Ideas, frustrations, and contemplations come to life through rhyme and rhythmic cadence. These poems are written to draw readers into thinking and reacting. The emphasis is more on the meanings of the words, than the words themselves. Here is an excerpt of one of the poems: Those eyes, once alive and joyful, Now look so vacant. That face, once so beautiful, Is now wrinkled and decadent. There are more faces like this, With eyes that long for affection. Their only fault lies in this, That old age is their affliction. Do not forget their contribution, Do not forget their kind-heartedness, Do not engage in retribution, Against those who once gave you happiness... The title of this book, The Fourth Monkey, is also the title of one of Lakshmy's poems in this collection, and more or less encompasses the underlying theme of this book. Every poem in this collection has a purpose, whether it is to speak up against archaic beliefs or unjust practices, contemplate on the complications of relationships or life, or simply appreciate nature's bounty and the other good things life has to offer.",
