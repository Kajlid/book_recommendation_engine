  "description": "Audrey Hunt hopes to make her mark on the world. Armed with her masters in broadcast journalism, she applies for a position as an investigative field reporter in her hometown of Philadelphia, which would allow her to do just that. Instead, Audrey finds herself in Columbus, Ohio, covering the NHL’s Blue Jackets. At first, she thinks that the job is a joke; however, she quickly discovers that there’s more to hockey than scoring goals and more to sports reporting than talking stats. With the support of the players on the team—including lots of help from the superstar captain Nathan Fox—Audrey searches for her niche as a sports journalist for Ohio Spots Network and finds out more about herself along the way.",
