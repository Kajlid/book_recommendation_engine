For twenty-four years she has laid down the law as she understands it.If you want to eat, you have to work.If you have children, you'd better support them.If you break the law, you have to pay.If you tap the public purse, you'd better be accountable.Now she abandons all judicial restraint in a scathing critique of the system -- filled with realistic hard-nosed alternatives to our bloated welfare bureaucracy and our soft-on-crime laws.",
