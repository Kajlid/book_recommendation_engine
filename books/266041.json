  "description": "Asta in the Wings is the poignant and often darkly funny story of Asta Hewitt, a resourceful seven-year-old growing up in rural Maine. Isolated from the outside world by their delusional mother, Asta and her bookish older brother, Orion, are content constructing their own fanciful, make-believe world. When circumstances push them into the strange outside world—with all of its discontents—Asta must find a way to assimilate while remaining true to herself and her fractured family.",
