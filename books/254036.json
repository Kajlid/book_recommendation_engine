  "description": "Rahman Ebrahimi never wanted to be someone who almost caught the guy. He had always wanted to be the one who caught the guy. Even after a long and tiring career, a serial killer on the street had managed to, not just surprise him, but instill fear deep inside him and the people of Hishapur. When the killings started, many speculated that it could become another one of those cold cases. Leading the largest manhunt in his town, Senior Policeman, Rahman catches up with the killer after he had left behind him quite a long trail of bodies. But little did he have any idea of the horror that was awaiting him when he looked into the mind of the most dangerous criminal he had ever known.",
