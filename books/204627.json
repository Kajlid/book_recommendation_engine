  "description": "Selena … The second our eyes connected for the first time, I knew my life would forever change. But I never anticipated how much. I fell for him, for the handsome, player and the enigma that is Jax. They say he doesn’t speak much, stays to himself, doesn’t trust anyone. But with me, with me he smiles, he laughs and he trusts. But sometimes that isn’t enough. Not when we are being dragged apart by what seems like everyone, not when too many secrets are kept and not when his dark life imposes on the light of our love.  Jax … When I first saw her, I knew she was different. I just didn’t know how. I didn’t know that she’d become as vital as the blood that runs through my veins. But sometimes that isn’t enough. Not when I can hurt her more than I can love her.",
