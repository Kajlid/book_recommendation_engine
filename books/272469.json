  "description": "My Cat Ate Aliens and Other Humorous Tales in Veterinary Medicine is a collection of over 40 outrageous stories from the world of veterinary medicine. Dr. June B. French and her friends take you on a journey where they find themselves in the most unlikely scenarios, filled with surprising characters and twists no human could have foreseen. It all begins in a shelter, wherein they are faced with an impossible, heart-wrenching dilemma. From there, many more adventures are mapped out as you follow June into the land of dogs, cats, horses, alpacas, camels, horses, and even birds of all feathers (the scariest June has ever faced). You will also follow the journeys of June's beloved veterinary comrades, who detail their unexpected situations. These stories include a junkyard horse, a nudist colony, a bear and even a few mountain oysters. And you will also soon meet the furry friend that inspired this whole collection: the cat who ate aliens. These events are the unscripted trials of animal loving professionals in their everyday careers, with the greater mission to aid shelter medicine as well as finding the humor in the crazy situations they find themselves in. We do hope that you enjoy our stories!",
