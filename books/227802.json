Rylee rescued me and I became the first outcast to join her pack.\nIn the Battle Against Orion, I sacrificed my life for hers and became the pillar which holds the Veil separating the human world and the supernatural world, closed. I kept the demons from spilling into the human world and left Rylee and our pack behind to live on.But something is calling me back to the land of the living and the journey to get there terrifies me. I must pass through the darkest levels of the Veil to prove my worth, and will come face to face with my past and all of those I've lost along the way. My deepest fear is that I'm not strong enough and I will prove unworthy.If I don't at least try though, I'll remain forever with the dead and separated from my pack.Eternity is a long time, but this decision and journey may very well tear me apart before I reach either destination. May the gods have mercy on my soul.Be sure to grab the first three epilogues all of which are FULL LENGTH NOVELSRYLEE (Rylee Adamson Epilogues, #1)LIAM (Rylee Adamson Epilogues, #2)PAMELA (Rylee Adamson Epilogues, #3)",
