Once viewed as humanity's saviors, the angels now find themselves struggling for a proper place in the new world.Monsters in the Vile Wedge are stirring, and in the south the nation of Ker moves to protect itself from a rule from on high. War comes, and if Harruq cannot stop it, their paradise of angels may soon become a blood-stained prison.THE PRISON OF ANGELS by David DalglishFear the grace enforced by the sword.------About the Author:David Dalglish currently lives in rural Missouri with his wife Samantha, and daughters Morgan and Katherine.
