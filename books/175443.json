Drawn out of a mirror by a rite of magic, a \"dark sister\" is confined to the dark. She vanishes in daylight. It is in this other world the dark sisters wait for moonlight or lamplight to call them forth again.This is their story: of myths turned real, ordinary people turned heroes, a land turned inside out by the coming of White Jenna.",
