  "description": "When Sally Benson wrote \"Meet Me In St. Louis\" in 1941, Europe and Asia were embroiled in a war into which the United States of America would soon be drawn. Her delightful story took readers back to a simpler place and St. Louis and the Smith family on the eve of the 1904 World's Fair. The novel's appealing characters and nostalgic theme proved just what the country needed in uncertain times. Her screenplay of the same name would become one of the best-loved movies of its era. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the historic World's Fair, St. Louis County Library proudly offers this reprinting of Sally Benson's classic novel. The narrative revolves around the Smiths and, in particular, three of the family's Rose, Esther, and 6-year-old Tootie, who is based on Sally herself. We invite you to visit the St. Louis of another era and enjoy this charming story once again.",
