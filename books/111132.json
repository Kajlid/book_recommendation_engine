  "description": "Book 4.0 follows Bette, an aspiring actress in the 1940s as she tries to find her place in the unforgiving and cruel world of Hollywood. When she meets up with friends who aren't what they seem, bad turns to worse. This volume gives us an outside perspective on what Jack and Caroline have been up to ten years after Jack's awakening in Book 4.1. It's also a speculative take on the infamous unsolved Black Dahlia murder case. (Please note that Elizabeth Short was a real person who was tragically murdered in a senseless and horrific act of inhuman brutality. The lead character in this story shares many personal details with Elizabeth Short and I want to make it clear that I am not attempting to write a biography of Elizabeth or a factual depiction of the events surrounding her murder, nor am I taking any position on the identity of her killer. I also want to stress that there is no evidence or even a suggestion (to my knowledge) that she ever appeared in a stag film. This story is entirely a work of fiction, taking inspiration from historical figures and places and events as well as from my imagination.)",
