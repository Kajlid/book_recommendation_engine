Sam’s twin sister put the “rival” in sibling rivalry.Sam ignores Stella’s competitive nature about who’s living a better life. So what if his law degree isn’t getting much use. And his previous relationship was a failure. And his Sundays are spent hung-over with his buddies. Despite Stella’s opposition, Sam is happy.Stella is happier, just in case anyone asked. She has it all. Skyrocketing career? Check. Impending fiancé? Check. Friends? She was too busy achieving her goals (and stepping on innocent bystanders) to form friendships. All she needs is her twin brother.Sam has accepted his place at the bottom. And there’s never been a threat to the hierarchy… until Harper. Sam’s unexpected one-night stand has the potential to be so much more. So why isn’t Stella happy for her brother?A rivalry like theirs isn’t short on secrets. False appearances are easier to fake when you’re already so good at pretending. And for Sam and Stella, the lies are getting in the way of the truth: are they really happy or just acting the part?",
