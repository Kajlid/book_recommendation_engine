  "title": "Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas",
  "description": "Behind the Christmas songs we love to sing lie fascinating stories that will enrich your holiday celebration. Taking you inside the nativity of over thirty favorite songs and carols, Ace Collins introduces you to people you’ve never met, stories you’ve never heard, and meanings you’d never have imagined. The next time you and your family sing \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" you’ll have a new understanding of its message and popular roots. You’ll discover how \"Angels from the Realms of Glory,\" with its sublime lyrics and profound theology, helped usher in a quiet revolution in worship. You’ll learn the strange history of the haunting and powerful \"O Holy Night,\" including the song’s surprising place in the history of modern communications. And you’ll step inside the life of Mark Lowry and find out how he came to pen the words to the contemporary classic \"Mary, Did You Know?\" Still other songs such as \"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" trace back to mysterious origins--to ninth-century monks, nameless clergy, and unknown commoners of ages past. Joining hands with such modern favorites as \"White Christmas\" and \"The Christmas Song,\" they are part of the legacy of inspiration, faith, tears, love, and spiritual joy that is Christmas. From the rollicking appeal of \"Jingle Bells\" to the tranquil beauty of \"Silent Night,\" the great songs of Christmas contain messages of peace, hope, and truth. Each in its own way expresses a facet of God’s heart and celebrates the birth of his greatest gift to the world--Jesus, the most wonderful Christmas Song of all.",
