  "description": "I never chose death—death chose me.  Now I choose change.  Kaah Maah had been the reaper for over a millennia. The mundane repetition of collecting souls night after night from an ever-increasing population was beginning to grind on him. Kaah had witnessed an ocean of unique faces, all confronted with their final moments on earth. Though different in appearance they all showed one final emotion—fear.  Kaah wanted a change. He craved quiet serenity, where he could perfect his yoga poses while listening to his favorite singer Michael Bublè. Kaah wanted nothing more than to retire and become a ‘no one special’ in a ‘nowhere special’ town.  When strange things began happening in Deadend, Ohio, the question had to be asked.  You might be able to take the reaper away from death, but can you ever actually take death away from the reaper?",
