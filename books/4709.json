  "description": "What do you do when you fall through the loopholes in the system and all you have to rely on are your own wits?Lois and Sophie have scrambled and saved for years, planning for their retirement in Florida. But now they've lost it all, and Lois's sniper training from her long-ago service as an Army nurse leads to a desperate career choice.When Detective Morgan Holiday is assigned to investigate a spate of sniper killings, it's just one more stress point in her already overburdened life. But as she grows increasingly solitary coping with an Alzheimer’s-plagued mother who refuses to be confined to a nursing home, and a police partner counting the days to retirement she comes to realize that these murders may cut close to home.A modern morality tale of justice, retribution, and women who refuse to be politely invisible.",
