  "title": "Dan the Destroyer",
  "description": "Cut Class. Kick ass. Save the frigging world.  Having obliterated Roderick’s Raiders, Dan vows to lead three hundred elves and gnomes to an ancient red elf fortress in the Wildervast, an untamed region created by a powerful succubus queen. Even with four powerful women by his side, how will Dan succeed when he’s up against ferocious creatures, desperate and deadly monster girls, and the mighty Warlord of the Wildervast?  In a dangerous world, you can’t just stroll to safety. Sometimes, to protect the ones you love, you have to become a destroyer.  Warning: Dan the Destroyer is an over-the-top adventure novel intended for readers 18 and older. It includes explicit sex, graphic violence, a harem of gorgeous ass-kicking women, inclement weather, a haughty black panther princess, and a two-fisted antagonist you won’t know whether to love or hate. Read at your own risk.",
