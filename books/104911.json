  "description": "\"The sparks of attraction lead Ben and Olivia into distinctly unprofessional situations, while Olivia has to navigate the scars of her own past…a pleasant and gratifying read.\"\n ~Publishers Weekly \nShe plays by the rules . . . \nArmy Major Olivia Hale believes in following the process for one simple reason — the rules are simple and clear. And she’ll fight to the death to bring those who break those rules to justice. But when she runs straight into Army captain Ben Teague, she finds herself tempted, for the first time in her life, to break those rules. \n. . . and he's about to break every one of them…\nCompany Commander Ben Teague has a way of getting under people’s skin — he’s a smart ass but no one cares more about taking care of his troops than he does. He’s got a low tolerance for the bureaucratic rules that keep him from doing his job. When a trusted friend is brought up on charges, Ben is ready to risk his reputation and his career in his defense. When everything Ben believes in is exposed to be a lie, he’ll turn to the one person he last expected. And the rules she believes in just may save them both — or damn them both to hell.",
