  "description": "Logan is a lonely, nervous rabbit shifter â€” until he meets teasing, gentle Gabe. He's so drawn to Gabe that he's frightened about what that means for him. Gabe might be funny and sweet, but he's also friends with wolves, and he has his own sadness beneath the goofy surface. Can they make a relationship work? Do they even dare try?  31,000+ words sweet gay romance set in the same world as the \"Shifters and Partners\" series but can be read alone",
