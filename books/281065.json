  "description": "They went to the stars in search of Earth-like planets. They found life. They had the perfect First Contact. They are even planning the first extra-solar colony. But do they really understand the world they came to conquer?\n\n\n\nTwo worlds are about to collide. And what seems to be strangely familiar may not be familiar at all.\nTwo hundred years from now, the exoplanet surveyor Endeavour arrives in the Kepler 452 system. Their mission is to map the site of the first human colony. Against all odds, they stumble instead across an alien civilisation triggering a first contact they aren’t ready for. Luckily the natives appear to be technologically in the Middle Ages and look completely unthreatening. Or so it seems …. Appearances can be deceiving. Aldeea is a Haillar frontier world at the edge of an ancient star-faring empire. A world where advanced field manipulation melds with astonishing psychical powers, creating something akin to magic. A world that is the frontline of a millennia-old war fought against a deceitful enemy. A world under siege.Caught between two vastly superior enemies, Endeavour's crew have only one chance of survival. For this to happen, two humans and an alien queen  need to learn how to trust each other. And in doing so, they will all end up reinventing themselves.\nA fast-paced space exploration saga featuring a strong alien female protagonist. A story for the fans of “Avatar” and “The Host”, a story about love and war, but ultimately a story about friendship and trust",
