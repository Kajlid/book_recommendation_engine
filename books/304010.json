  "description": "Growing up in Dorchester presented real challenges, but once Tom took over his father's auto repair shop in South Boston, life became intense. Mob-enforcers, drug dealers and killers became his friends and customers. Thomas Cirignano experienced Southie's era of extreme crime and violence, first hand. He managed to not just co-exist, but to thrive in that environment. At the shop, James \"Whitey\" Bulger threatened Tom with a gun. A neighbor was gunned-down at the gas pumps. After confronting another would-be killer, that man later returned and shot Tom's friend eleven times. In a house down the street, Whitey was killing people and burying them in the cellar. A friendly drug dealer often tossed samples from his car window while driving past the pumps. Life was never dull, and Tom got himself into near-fatal situations far too often. How did Tom survive his gunpoint encounter with Whitey Bulger? Find the answer within this inspiring memoir which is tempered by amazing humor. Buy the book now and begin an amazing journey!*  There are related photos throughout  The Constant Outsider.  Cirignano's second book,  67  Creation of a South Boston Killer ,   is a fictional adaptation of this memoir, in which Tom explores the alternate path to a criminal life which truly was available to him .  In  67 Cents ,\"Nick\" says \"Yes\" to every offer that was made to Tom by the Irish and Italian Mobs of Southie in real life, including an offer to kill for him.
