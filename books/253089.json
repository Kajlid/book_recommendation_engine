  "title": "Mafia to Mormon: My Conversion Story Facione, Mario",
  "description": "I learned early that if you don’t want to go to school for a career . . . then this was the life. And there were rules. You better not drink, you better not be a big shot and you better always stay low and keep your mouth shut. If you’re going to play the game, you’ve got to play smart. Thus began Mario Facione’s slow descent into the Mafia world. With a desire to please his father, Facione kept the rules taught him - don’t get caught, know your people. . . never let them have control of what you’re doing, and never let anyone fully know what you’re up to. So when two clean-cut young men in dark suits showed up on his doorstep, Facione’s main concern was to figure out the scam they were selling. Instead, he became surprisingly relaxed as these two answered every question he had unsuccessfully asked other clergymen. He learned real truth and began a journey towards knowledge. Yes, there is a reason why we are here on earth; yes, you can re-remember who we are and yes, it’s true, Heavenly Father still speaks through a modern-day prophet. Marion Facione’s story is one man’s extraordinary journey through the darkness into the light. Reading his story will confirm again that the gospel is truly for every child of God who is willing to change . . . even someone who wants to go from Mafia to Mormon.",
