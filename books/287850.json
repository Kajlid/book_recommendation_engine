  "description": "OUTLANDER meets ROBIN HOOD in the first book in this new trilogy keeping readers up late at night.Changing history is easy. It's what comes after that's difficult. Traveling through time to twelfth century England was never on Maryanne Warren's to do list. Not that modern-day life's going so well, but at least her little brother is in it. He's the only reason she's climbed out of bed recently. To get back to him, she's just got to convince young outcast Robin of Woodhurst to become Robin Hood. It should be simple. A quick trip through time, instigate a carriage robbery or two, then back to life as she knows it.Yet somehow Rob slips past the walls she's spent years building and makes her care about his cause. She doesn't even want to think about the way his intense stare renders her speechless.As the time to return home draws closer, she becomes less certain her brother is her future. Perhaps her place is here at Rob's side, as his Lady Marian.But the magic that sent her here has its own agenda, and Maryanne must decide which of her two lives is the life worth fighting for.Outlawed is packed full of fast-paced action with a slow-burn romance that fans of Sarah J Maas, Kiera Cass and Marissa Meyer can't get enough of.",
