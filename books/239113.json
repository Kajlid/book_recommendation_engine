  "description": "Rule #1: Never screw the sheriff’s daughter.  I’m an enforcer—an outlaw. I’ve never been big on playing by the book. But when I see Kyla Darlington and her candy-sweet curves, I can’t resist. It’s my job to protect her, to keep her safe given what’s she witnessed. Small towns are good for keeping secrets, but it’s hard when you’re a big, burly biker with an attitude the size of a city and the c*ck to match. Keeping a low profile is the name of the game, but playing house isn’t my style. All I know is that I want Kyla—every smoking inch of her body. And I’m going to have it. Just as long as her Daddy doesn’t find out.  If you love dirty-talking bikers who love their MC as much as their women, one-click this instalove novella now. Torch is a standalone MC Romance. The fourth book in the CAOS MC Series. No cliffhangers, no cheating, just kindle-melting happily ever afters!",
