  "description": "One witnessed murder can change your life forever. How it changes depends on you.  My life was full of one-night stands and dirty alleyways, but the moment I witnessed Dominik Romanov, Washington's most powerful crime lord, commit murder, my life as I knew it was over.  After being tossed head first into a world of blood, drugs, and sex, I climbed the ranks until I proved my worth. I became the prodigy. I proved that I could handle the mafia life.  But then, three drool worthy hellions walk into my life. They are my boss’ nephews and to me, everything about them is perfect; their loud music, fierce loyalty, and cold-blooded lifestyles… But when is perfect ever a good thing?  The hierarchy of the Mafia is put to the test when a traitor exposes the underground to the light of day. Overnight a war is started and our hold on the throne is shaken.  With all the bedlam and bloodshed, will I be able to survive until the end? Or will the people gunning to take over territory win?  War is brutal, but the mafia is deadly. --------------- This story is a #whychoose, which means there will be mfmmm & mfm. Please be warned, there are possibly multiple triggers and this series is intended for mature audiences due to its sexual content and graphic language.",
