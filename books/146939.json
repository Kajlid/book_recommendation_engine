  "description": "Paige Reed heads to a location shoot in Detroit where an A-list actor is filming the next big blockbuster. But it's the man in the background she can't take her eyes off. Throwing caution to the wind, Paige is captivated by Kellen Richards and the slow burning romance which emerges. But when Kellen asks her to move to L.A several months later, she quits her job, only to find the consequences could be deadly. With his life built around Hollywood, Kellen Richards expects the masks people wear and is drawn to what-you-see-is-what-you-get Paige Reed. But wealth and fame come with a heavy price tag. Kellen finds he has to keep Paige safe, a task that won't be easy. With everything stacked against them, can Paige and Kellen come out the other side together, or will the danger lurking within two separate worlds drive them apart?",
