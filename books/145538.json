  "description": "Brielle Douglas is the girl who always keeps her head down; she stays quiet, does her school work and never socializes. But sometimes the quiet ones have the most they wish they could say. Brielle's life has been a living hell since she lost her mother to cancer five years ago. Her abusive, alcoholic father keeps her under tight rule, and her only goal is to graduate, move on and never look back. When Brielle meets gorgeous ex-TV star Carson Malone, she sees it as a one-time meeting, a chance encounter, a memory to cherish. But when her home life goes from bad to horrific, Carson steps in to pick up the pieces. Learning how to trust and to be free isn't easy, but, with Carson by her side, Brie has a chance. If only the Devil from her past stays in Hell where he belongs.",
