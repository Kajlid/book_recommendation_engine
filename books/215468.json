How about if that guy had the sexiest ass on the planet, and was your birthday-cake one-night-stand with icing on top?London Reeves agrees that three years is a long time to live without sex, but she also believes that one steamy hot night could never last longer than the morning after. Unfortunately, her four lunatic best friends disagree on that last one. The voices in her head disagree, too, and even her mother seems to think she's crazy. And sexyass will not take a goddamn no for an answer.  One little dare leads to another, and before she knows it, London finds herself on stage with nothing but sparkly underwear on, and in a strip club, getting the lap dance of her life. Now what exactly is a girl to do against that?",
