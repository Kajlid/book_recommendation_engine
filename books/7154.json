  "description": "*Print-only exclusives! This version contains three extra stories not included in the ebook edition.*\"There is no greater drug than relationships; there is no sweeter death than love.\"Love is horrible. It’s ruthless, messy, mind-altering, and raw. It takes no prisoners. It chews you up and spits you out and leaves you for dead. Love is, you could say, very much like a zombie.In this haunting short story collection, anything is possible—a dying musician turns to tea for inspiration; a police sergeant struggles with a very unusual victim; a young wife is trapped in a house hiding unimaginable evil….With \"Hungry For You\", A.M. Harte explores the disturbing and delightful in an anthology that unearths the thin boundary between love and death.",
