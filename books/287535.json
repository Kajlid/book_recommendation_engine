  "title": "The De-Valuing Of America: The Fight for Our Culture and Our Children",
  "description": "No one sets the record straight like bestselling author William J. Bennett. In The De-Valuing of America, one of our leading conservatives gives us a provocative and unblinking critique of what is wrong with our nation in areas ranging from drugs to education to race relations, and provides an inspiring vision to turn the tide. In this remarkably candid personal account, Bennett reveals what he saw and what he learned -- and the people he came across and was crossed by -- during his controversial years as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Secretary of Education, and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In the straightforward style that has become his trademark, he tells us what's right and what's wrong with American education; discusses the heroes, villains, and shirkers in the war against drugs; analyzes the decline in standards and common sense on our college campuses; and offers his assessment of the failures of contemporary liberalism. Written with force and passion, The De-Valuing of America is a cry of alarm -- an honest, unsparing account of what has gone wrong in American society, and a tough-minded personal assessment of how to reclaim our culture and protect and nurture our children.",
