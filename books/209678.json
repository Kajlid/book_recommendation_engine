  "description": "The heat between them is impossible to ignore. But can they ever be anything but rivals?   Dante Mills has one more year to prove he can hack it in the NFL. If he can't score attention from the scouts this season, he'll never be able to give his hard-working mom the life she deserves. The last thing he needs is more competition, but that's exactly what he gets when blond-haired, blue-eyed behemoth Mitchell Erickson walks into the locker room.  Mitchell Erickson has one year to prove he belongs on a football field. He's spent his whole life struggling to find acceptance in his family, and now his father's finally giving him the chance to follow his passion... for one season. If he doesn't bring the Tigers to victory, it's back to upholding the Erickson legacy in a suit and tie. But how can he possibly succeed when someone as talented as Dante stands between him and a starting position?  As if the tension between them wasn't high enough, Mitch is insanely attracted to the very straight linebacker. As the season ramps up and both men fight for their place on the team, a heated locker room encounter leaves Dante questioning everything he thought he knew about himself.  When Dante and Mitch work together, they're unstoppable. But can two men destined to be rivals ever be anything more?  False Start is a steamy, standalone gay romance novel with a HEA and no cliffhanger.",
