  "description": "A dark erotic standalone that may have triggers amid the Broken Bonds series. Features Alexis and Chase from With Ties that Bind. Here at Lark and Gannet, you’ll work directly under the partners, being groomed by the most powerful, all-male partnership to handle an exclusive clientele. While within The Firm, your level of training goes deeper, requiring more…varied tasks, which you’re obligated to perform to your Master’s pleasing.  Are you nervous? You should be. Chase Larkin has chosen you to be his submissive.  Alexis Wilde, will you submit?  All I wanted was to save my brother. Something my parents failed to do—and then, I failed him also. As an introvert, getting ahead in the cutthroat law firm required a level of ego stroking I didn’t posses, and that meant my talents were overlooked. Until Chase Larkin noticed me.  My erotic fantasy come to life, Chase is all powerful, all man, all dominant. In one night, he changed my life irrevocably. Now I’m ruined, destined to crave him forever. His scent. His taste. His brutal touch…  If I never followed him to his office that night, then none of this would’ve happened. A serial rapist on the prowl. Our lives in jeopardy. And only a moment—one pivotal moment—to decide our fate. His life or mine.  *This is a full length, standalone dark romance with an antihero that may trigger uncomfortable feelings for the reader. The court proceedings are centered around a rape case. Although there is no onscreen rape in this book, there are instances of rough sex and violent debasement for the main character.",
