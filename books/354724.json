  "title": "Multiple Meanings of Money: How Women See Microfinance",
  "description": "This book analyzes what microfinance money means to women; and in doing so, it focuses on the perspectives of individual women and of women-only groups. It explores womenâ€²s own money management strategies, group dynamics and learning processes in groups, and in this context, discusses the divergence between the perspectives of external intervening agencies, and those of women who are members of self-help groups. The book does not consciously follow a feminist methodology; yet the perspective is feminist, as it questions the benefits and costs to women from development programs.",
