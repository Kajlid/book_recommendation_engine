  "description": "It was bad enough when Lije Baley, a simple plainclothes cop, was ordered to solve a totally baffling mystery, the murder of a prominent Spacer. It was worse when he found that the smug, self-satisfied Spacers were behind the pressure to provide an impossibly quick solution. But then Lije discovered the worse of all bad news. The Spacers, distrusting all Earthmen, insisted he must work with an investigator of their choice. That investigator turned out to be R. Daneel Olivaw. R stood for \"robot\" & Lije hated & feared robots deeply, bitterly & pathologically.",
