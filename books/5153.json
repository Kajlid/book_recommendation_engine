Crappy grades, a teacher who is out to get her, and being grounded more times than she can count, double threat her bleep. With Alex being gone, Meggie relies on her girls to keep her busy with parties, movie nights, and trips to Denny’s. Joining the crew this year is Travis, who is patiently waiting for Meggie to ditch her college boyfriend. While annoying at times, Travis is funny and cute, and may just provide the temptation that Meg can’t resist. Confronted with gorgeous college-aged girls in his dorm, distance and typical teenage boy desires, Alex’s commitment to his young high school girl is threatened. He is forced to make a decision he doesn’t want to make. Can Meg and Alex survive the long distance and temptations? Should they even try?
