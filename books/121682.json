  "title": "Stedman's Surinam: Life in an Eighteeth-Century Slave Society",
  "description": "This abridgment of the Prices' acclaimed 1988 critical edition is based on Stedman's original, handwritten manuscript, which offers a portrait at considerable variance with the 1796 classic. The unexpurgated text, presented here with extensive notes and commentary, constitutes one of the richest and most evocative accounts ever written of colonial lifeâ€”and one of the strongest indictments ever to appear against New World slavery.",
