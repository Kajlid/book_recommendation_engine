  "title": "Unleash the Sloth! 75 Ways to Reach Your Maximum Potential By Doing Less",
  "description": "It’s the self-help book you’ve always wanted. The one that tells you’re fine just the way you are – and that you can probably get away with doing even less. It sounds like a paradox, I know. But just look at the mighty sloth, who makes no excuses for who he is – and becomes everything he needs to be. And now it’s your turn. Take a nap instead of mowing the lawn. Save yourself a few steps and jaywalk. Save yourself a few pen strokes and replace your signature with an X. Make life easier, and you’ll find that you’ll be just as lovable, productive or unproductive as you would’ve been anyway – but without all the unecessary stress and guilt. Now THAT’S what I call reaching your potential!",
