  "description": "Foster MacAult's grandfather has been missing for over half a century. A missionary, he disappeared in the remote mountains of the Middle Kingdom, China. Case closed-until Zee Yan, an attractive young Chinese woman, reaches out to Foster. Zee claims to have answers to the mystery of the missing grandfather; out of intense curiosity, Foster answers the call and arrives in unfamiliar territory, watched closely by unseen eyes. Foster and Zee undertake a lengthy journey into the heart of the Middle Kingdom, searching for anyone who might remember the missing missionary. As they continue their investigation side by side, Foster begins to feel attraction toward Zee. But they're not alone; they're being watched. The unseen eyes belong to Private Investigator Jack Sun, hired to keep an eye on them-hired by a man with his own romantic feelings toward Zee. In the Middle of the Middle Kingdom offers a thrilling mystery that strives to unravel a missing person report, as well as the intentions of the human heart. As Foster and Zee begin to make sense of his grandfather's fate, Jack Sun looms large. He is driven to separate Zee from the American man, as Foster's priorities in coming to China fall to pieces. Now only time will tell if they'll all get out of the mysterious mountains of the Middle Kingdom alive.",
