  "title": "Insanity",
  "description": "Insanity has destroyed humanity once and is now poised to destroy it again. For a thousand years, the scourge has been held in check by specialized vitamins. Instability in the human genome, however, threatens to render the vitamins impotent, unless someone can solve the DNA Dilemma. Fighting a losing battle against his own decline into insanity, medical student John Turner writes a revolutionary thesis that he hopes will save the human race. But as events unfold, John discovers that insanity is not at all what his education has led him to believe. Furthermore, his wife concludes that his thesis is not the panacea he imagines, but instead represents the greatest threat to human freedom and happiness that the world has ever known. With time running out and the stakes rising, John must face the evil within and make a terrifying choice.",
