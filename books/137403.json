  "description": "“Like my time in ‘The Corps’, this account is full of fun, exposing the calamity as well as recognising the great. But please, don’t expect tales of derring-do. I will leave that to the heroes.”  At 16, Mark Time wants to become either a geologist or a Royal Marines Commando. Despite his love of basalt, he chooses the career that teaches him how to kill… and shit in plastic bags.  Knowing his weak body will have to shape up to complete 30 weeks of commando training, Mark prepares for the Royal Marines by sleeping in his shed wearing only plastic bags. He braves pain by ordering his mate to attack him while trapped in a sleeping bag. He even starves himself in a stupid urban survival exercise, turning down the offer of his favourite crispy pancakes from his mother.  He knows about cold, he can endure pain, and he can resist crispy pancakes. He is ready. Some, might say, for the nut house...  Often hilarious and yet shockingly sobering, Going Commando is the true story of a boy who joins one of the world’s most elite military units with only naivety and incompetence equalling his will to succeed. As the first book in the ‘Bootneck Threesome’ series, it will appeal mainly to military enthusiasts, and any former/current/future military personnel. Humorous in tone, the book will also be enjoyed by lads’ mag readers, and audiences worldwide will be able to relate to Mark Time’s story, for whilst the military is the book’s subtext, it is really a motivational tale of spirit; of a young man who will go through anything to reach his dreams.",
