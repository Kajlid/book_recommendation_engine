  "description": "Paradise is a small industrial city in Pennsylvania that’s about to become Ground Zero for the end of the world.  For far too long, we’ve been poisoning the planet with toxic waste.  Not any more.  This morning something finally woke up in Paradise.  It’s intelligent, virulent and ambitious.  It’s everywhere, in the water we drink, the air we breathe.  And it won’t be satisfied until we’re gone.",
