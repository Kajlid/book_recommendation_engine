  "description": "My name is Landon Hamilton. Once upon a time I was a security guard, trying to regain my life after spending a year in prison for stealing people’s credit card numbers.  Now, I’m dead.  Okay, I was supposed to be dead. I got killed after all. But a funny thing happened after I had turned the mortal coil...  I met Dante Alighieri. Yeah, that Dante. He told me I was special. A diuscrucis. That’s what they call a perfect balance of human, demon, and angel. Apparently, I’m the only one of my kind.  I also learned that there was a war raging on Earth between Heaven and Hell and that I was the only one who could save the human race from annihilation. Dante asked me to help, and I was dumb enough to agree.  Sounds crazy, I know, but he wished me luck and sent me back to the mortal world. Oh yeah, he also gave me instructions on how to use my Divine ‘magic’ to bend the universe to my will. Too bad a sexy vampire crushed them while I was crushing on her.  Now I have to somehow find a way to stay alive in a world of angels, vampires, werewolves, and more who all want to get rid of me before I can mess up their plans for humanity’s future.  It’s not like it’s the end of the world if I fail.  Wait. It is.",
