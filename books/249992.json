Demons & Thieves is a fast-paced, riveting tale of demonic powers that bring destruction, of unconditional love that brings restoration, and of man's ultimate choice toward one or the other. In this brilliantly crafted historical novel, master storyteller, Brae Wyckoff, weaves together the account of the two thieves on the cross and the Gerasene demoniacs in an action-packed, epic adventure that progresses across a span of twenty years against the backdrop of ancient Israel.From the first page, Wyckoff captivates us with vivid characters brought to life as he carefully peels back layer upon layer to reveal raw emotion and the fragility of human existence. Readers will be deeply moved and completely enthralled by the two brothers caught in a cycle of loss and tragedy, the father racing against time to restore relationship, the loyal friend who will not walk away, and the Messiah who encounters each one.This hauntingly powerful novel will inspire readers to look deeper than what can be seen on the surface and to recognize that behind every person is a story that may surprise us. What influences one's behaviors and decisions? What determines one's destiny?
