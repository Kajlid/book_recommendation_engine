But when a man is found near death with a jigsaw piece in his hand, Sean fears that Edie might be in danger and shuts her out of the investigation. As the body count rises, however, Edie knows that only she has the knowledge to put together the killer’s murderous puzzle.Only by fitting all the pieces together will Edie be able to stop a killer – and finally lay her past to rest.",
