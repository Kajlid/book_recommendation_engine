  "title": "The Old adventures of Hailey and Jared: Book 1",
  "description": "Hailey and her best friend Jared have gone on several exciting adventures. Originally separate short stories, I have put six of their fun but spooky stories together for this book. Each story has suspenseful adventures that always end with a twist!Even though Hailey is a girl, you'd have to call her a tomboy as she loves adventures with her best friend Jared and has no problem getting in and out of spooky situations! She, Jared and her beloved bike Blue manage to keep their lives pretty exciting and sometimes they are not sure whether it's ghosts or just their imagination. You'll just have to decide which one it ends up being!",
