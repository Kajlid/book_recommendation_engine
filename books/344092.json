  "description": "An offer she should refuse.Polly doesn't expect to win when she bids in a charity auction on a sealed envelope offered by a devilishly handsome marquis. Once the contents of the envelope are revealed, her world turns upside down. An offer she won't refuse. Adrian, Marquis of Shoreham, seems as shocked as Polly when she accepts his offer of WILD SEX. Tall, dark and magnetic, he's everything Polly wants-except he's one of the pampered elite she despises, a man who uses his privileged position to gain every advantage. She knows she should walk away and go about her boring, abstinent life. Instead, Polly finds herself walking toward Adrian on London Bridge with nothing but wild sex on her mind. An encounter that will lead to: An offer she never expected. This book follows Perfect Timing, but is a perfect stand alone.",
