  "title": "Cura Te Ipsum: An Integrative Psychotherapy Model",
  "description": "The phrase 'cura te ipsum' is Latin, meaning \"Heal thyself.\" Existential psychology, Adler’s psychoanalytic approach and Ellis rational emotive behavioral therapy have a number of things in common. Each of these approaches expects the client to find health through making the choice to change self-perception and then acting accordingly; in a sense, the clients are healing themselves. Living in the present and maintaining a factual view of the world is a key component to each one of these approaches, whether as the end-goal or a means to the end. Existential psychology represents the individual, Adler’s work represents the interpersonal, and Ellis’s theoretical framework supplies the structure that grounds these three approaches. A plausible integration of these models is presented here, with theory of personality, psychopathology, therapeutic process, shortcomings and strengths outlined in clear language. Research is necessary to validate this integration and would lend valuable understanding to its suggested application.",
