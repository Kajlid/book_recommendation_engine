  "description": "My witchy senses have been tingling from the moment I arrived in adorable seaside Crescent Cove.  Crazy hot and totally mysterious; Jace, Bastian, Dorian and Ethan are the ones who run this town. My magick keeps drawing me to them, but whenever one of them touches me, my power glitches out of control.   After a centuries-long search, the guys believe my powers are a sign that they've found their mate. They say it’s the Pentamorous bond; an ancient spell that joins five souls for eternity. If I accept this fate, we’ll live happily ever after.  Thing is, I don’t believe in fairy tales.  NOTE: The Pentamorous Key series is a completed Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance trilogy. Medium/Fast burn, #whychoose, and extra steamy.",
