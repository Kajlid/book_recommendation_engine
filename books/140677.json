  "description": "What is a sociopath to do?Dyson Devereux has it all – a way with the ladies, impeccable good taste, and a complete inability to empathise with other human beings. Perfect for the head of Burials and Cemeteries at Newton Borough Council.But Dyson’s fed up. How long will he have to deal with banal work colleagues, drug-addled girlfriends and gaudy memorial structures? It feels like he’s just serial-killing time …When Dyson suspects someone of having an even darker past than him, he sees a chance to get out. Will he take it, or is he destined for a life of toil in the health-and-safety-obsessed public sector?Brutal, bleak and darkly comical, Necropolis is a savage indictment of political correctness and woke culture.‘… a magnificent foray into the mind of a sociopath’ – DLS Reviews ‘The book is full of razor-sharp satire’ – Crime Fiction Lover‘… a mix between The Office and American Psycho’ – Amazon ReviewerNecropolis is the first instalment in the Necropolis Trilogy - #1 Necropolis #2 Sepultura #3 Golgotha ‘…it’s the well-crafted and perfectly executed satirical observations, along with the dry wit and devious humour that makes ‘Necropolis’ such a delight to read.’ – Chris Hall (Top 500 Amazon Reviewer. Vine Voice)‘I remain slightly troubled as to why I found myself applauding a sociopath for being so thoroughly entertaining.’ – Little Bookness Lane (Top 1000 Amazon Reviewer)",
