  "title": "The In-Betweener",
  "description": "Two years ago a new medical nanite advance divided humanity into three types: humans, deaders and the frightening in-betweeners that crave human flesh. Emily's world has grown quiet and ordered, her days bounded by mornings killing deaders at her fence, and nights huddled alone in a warehouse office. She's begun to believe life will always be this way, alone with the dead or fighting in-betweeners for her life. But even that life is better than the alternative.Everything changes when one of the deaders at the gate isn't a deader at all. Heâ€™s an in-betweener different from any Emily has seen before...and he has a message. The In-Betweener is book one of the Between Life and Death series. The Between Life and Death series is suitable for ages 16 and up, with occasional violence and mild language.",
