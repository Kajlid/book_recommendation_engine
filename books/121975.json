  "title": "The History of American Trotskyism, 1928â€”1938: Report of a Participant",
  "description": "Trotskyism is not a new movement, a new doctrine, Cannon says, but the restoration, the revival of genuine Marxism as it was expounded and practiced in the Russian revolution and in the early days of the Communist International. In this series of twelve talks given in 1942, James P. Cannon recounts a decisive period in the efforts to build a proletarian party in the United States.",
