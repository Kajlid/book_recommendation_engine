  "description": "Book 1 of the Young Adult Paranormal Romance Series; The Presenting SagaTo Kaylee Ward, the ticking of a clock was the cruelest sound in the world. Her time with Will was passing too quickly, and the answer to whether she was the next Presenter, was taking forever to come. As crazy as the idea was, what the Gregorys believed had to be true. Kaylee had to be the next mortal to present powers and make the transition to immortality. The alternative was unthinkable. If Kaylee stayed mortal, the new world she’d discovered would be taken from her memory, and she’d never be anything to Will but something weak he once had to protect.",
