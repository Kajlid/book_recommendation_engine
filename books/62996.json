  "description": "Love, lust, sex, relationships, kinky, queer, questioning, BDSM, swingers, threesomes and plenty more fetish and fantasy topics can be found between the sheets of THE VIXEN FILES: NAUGHTY NOTES FROM A MONTREAL SEX COLUMNIST.From October 2007 to December 2009 Laure L'Amour was a featured sex columnist in Montreal's alternative weekly paper, Hour. Though the Hour sadly folded in early 2012, Laure's cheeky \"V for Vixen\" columns live on in this new collection.Featuring writing on subjects ranging from love and romance to sexual escapades and dysfunctions, L'Amour covers all the bases of the typical sex column with her own unique twist. Scrapping the usual Q&A style, she interviews local sex workers, burlesque performers and Montreal personalities; reviews a variety of sex toys and books; and comments on the permissive sexual culture of the city sometimes dubbed \"the Sin City of the North.\"Fans of Dan Savage, Violet Blue and Tristan Taormino will find plenty to explore in this collection of naughty notes from our neighbor to the north.",
