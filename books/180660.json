  "description": "Highgarden Academy, home of New York’s most prestigious actors. No less than greatness is expected from all of its students, and directors specifically seek out anyone with Highgarden on their résumés. Join six of Highgarden’s acting students as they strive to achieve that greatness despite the obstacles in their paths: a caretaker battles a stalled career while needing to provide for her children; a lothario strives to find his breakout role despite his short stature; a beauty gets the part of a lifetime and a director who fights her every step of the way; a composer mounts his first show starring an incompetent box office draw; an optimist struggles to get any acting work but never stops believing that she will; and a geek realizes that sometimes reality is better than fantasy. Will their unique talents be enough to reach their goals as theater professionals? Or will they learn that success is not measured by how large their names appear on a marquee but by the friendships that help them through the hard times as they spend their careers in oblivion?",
