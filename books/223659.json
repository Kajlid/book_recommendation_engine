  "description": "Nadine Butler is a popular disc-jockey on Squire's Isle, Washington. Due to her public persona, she is content with being in the closet. At the end of a particularly long day, Nadine goes to a Town Hall meeting with her girlfriend. During a debate concerning the banning of a book from the town library, Nadine surprises everyone, including herself, when she inadvertently \"outs\" herself. Word spreads like wildfire through the small town and, before long, Nadine finds herself threatened with unemployment because her sponsors are pulling out of her show. Desperate, and given one last chance to be on the air, Nadine barricades herself in the booth. With help coming from some unforeseen corners, she decides to make the most of her last time On the Air.",
