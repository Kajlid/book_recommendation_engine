  "description": "Some secrets can't stay hidden forever  One look was all it took.  A single chance encounter with her and I knew she was the one. She was everything I wanted but I knew there was no way she'd want a man like me once she found out about my past, and I was right.  Now that she knows about my demons, I've lost the woman I loved. I'm not giving up; she will be mine because I'm never letting her out of my sight.  Stalker is a full-length 50,000-word dark romance novel. For a limited time, it also contains a copy of Share Me, my debut novel, as a thank you for your purchase!",
