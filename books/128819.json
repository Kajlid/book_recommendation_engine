  "description": "When architect Brian Townsend meets a man dressed as Zorro at a Halloween party it seems like a chance hookup, but Brian is attracted and it takes more effort then he originally thought just to find out the manâ€™s name. NYPD homicide detective Tristan Blake, comes from old money, which he loathes and an idealistic streak burns within him to do a job that serves a purpose. A previous lover scorned him as a time when he was most vulnerable, after the death of friend, and Tristan is slow to trust what appears to a developing relationship between him and Brian.  Beer tasting, a broken window, a fall down a flight of stairs, a grenade and a violent attack on Brian, what do these all have in common? Each one brings Tristan an inch closer to trusting Brian with his heart.  Previously published as separate short stories.",
