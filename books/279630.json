  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  The boys are back, and an old face from Seong-Jae’s past plunges BPD Detectives Malcolm Khalaji and Seong-Jae Yoon from a two-month suspension right into the depths of hell — and into one of the most horrific, grisly cases of Malcolm’s life.  He's never seen anything like it. Macabre ritual killings, and the only one who's ever been able to crack the killer's pattern has been his partner and lover.  But Malcolm and Seong-Jae aren't the only ones tracking this case.  And with the return of FBI Division Chief Aanga Joshi, Malcolm may have to contend with more than a rogue killer.  A jealous ex. More of Seong-Jae's buried secrets. A prison break turned into a blood-soaked crime scene.  And two men, far from home, standing on the brink.  Where nothing may be safe.  Not even each other.  ABOUT SEASON TWO  Malcolm Khalaji and Seong-Jae Yoon are back on the case — and partnering with the FBI on a horrific serial murder case that will test Malcolm's faith and revive the darkest parts of Seong-Jae's past. With an enigmatic killer leading them on a wild goose chase through city after city and body after body, both Mal and Seong-Jae will find themselves pushed to their limits as they discover the worst of what humanity can do.  Even two minds against one may not be enough as they track the devious Golden Ratio Killer, and try to find the key to his pattern. But the trail of breadcrumbs left by the white rabbit will lead them suspiciously close to home, and a connection they never could have predicted. With their worlds exploding around them and everyone they know suddenly cast into doubt...  Can their partnership — and their love — survive the greatest trial of their lives?",
