  "description": "If you think a negative charge is something that shows up on your credit card bill -- if you imagine that Ohm's Law dictates how long to meditate -- if you believe that Newtonian mechanics will fix your car -- you need  The Cartoon Guide to Physics  to set you straight. You don't have to be a scientist to grasp these and many other complex ideas, because  The Cartoon Guide to Physics  explains them velocity, acceleration, explosions, electricity and magnetism, circuits -- even a taste of relativity theory -- and much more, in simple, clear, and, yes, funny illustrations. Physics will never be the same!",
