  "description": "“The Four Graces” is a sly, enjoyable love letter to life in a small English town. Yes, it pokes fun at as much as it endorses, but this book makes you think that setting up in a vicarage with three sisters and the occasional gentleman caller is just the kind of life to have. There are really four Grace sisters, but we hardly see Addie, the youngest, who is in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and hardly ever at home. The focus is mainly on the three Liz, the lively beauty of the family, Sal, whose quick wit makes her more than just an ex-invalid, and Tilly, sweet, shy, musical, who wants to know why everything had to go up and change. There’s World War II, of course, but that’s not quite what Tilly means. There’s also the disagreeable Aunt Rona, who drops in for a visit after London is bombed and quite overstays her welcome. And there’s the gentleman callers William Single, the Roman history expert, and Captain Roderick Herd, who has clear intentions that end up more than a bit muddled. In fact, the whole book is a bit muddled – but in a good way. There’s just so much going on that you’re never bored. If you’re not laughing at Aunt Rona, you’re smiling over the simple yet kindhearted townsfolk, unless you’re wondering how Mrs. Chevis-Green and Miss Bodkin will ever patch up their misunderstanding. And if the town isn’t being spotlighted, the Grace family certainly is. Intelligent, observant Sal was my favorite, but I also liked Tilly and her practical outlook. --E.J. Jones, Amazon reviews",
