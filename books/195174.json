  "description": "Nothing quite like taste of death to make the heart grow fonder...  Urenya has been conditioned to be the best version of herself. As a healer, she is held in high regard. As the closest friend of one of the most fearsome generals in the Brion armies, she has a delicate role to play. Not only must she be wise and with hands that can heal any harm, but she must also act as a moral compass when the bloodlust of great men around her drive them wild. But where does that leave her desires? And what if she needs her own damn warrior to fight and bleed for her, instead of standing up for herself on her own all the time?  Narath knows one thing - any problem can be solved with a spear. And not just a spear, but a spear in his very capable hands. Battle has always been in his blood and he could have never imagined that it would not be enough... Until laying his eyes on the sexy, curvy healer of the Triumphant. After that, he wants nothing more to use a very different spear, but with the same intent - to solve a problem.  Will Narath and Urenya realize what fate has in store for them at the right time, or will war tear them apart before they can ever really taste happiness?  Alien Warrior's Wife is a standalone novella with a happy ever after ending and no cliffhanger. There's plenty of steam in this book and unless you love mindblowingly hot sex, you might want to keep away... Or at least brace yourself for a hell of a ride!",
