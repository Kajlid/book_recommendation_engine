  "description": "It is a time of danger. A colony of Persian refugees is under attack. Corrupt and powerful ministers of the Sultán have banished the community’s well-loved and benevolent leader. Within three days a perfect horse must be found to carry him out of Baghdad in the majesty befitting his station. The 11-year-old story narrator, her 8-year old brother, and their uncle are chosen for the task because of their uncanny ability with horses. Enemies pursue them during their journey by carriage, horseback, and river barge. In order to protect themselves the children and their uncle must acquire the ability that horses have to see behind without turning their head. In spite of their vigilance they fall prey to poisoning, kidnapping, and murder attempts. Two horses, a magnificent Arabian mare and her wild foal, join them and expose the most ruthless instigator of hate crimes against their community. Along the way the trio discovers that trusting their own intuition is the best protection—a lesson that will help each one to survive separation from family and community.",
