  "description": "Your deceased loved ones are only a whisper away.They are still here, still with you, even though you cannot see them.Unlike me, I can see them just fine.People call me weird, crazy even, but I only want to help the souls who are trapped in between and the loved ones they leave behind.Until my good intentions get me locked away and leave me broken and traumatized. So much so, I swear to never talk to a spirit again.But a road trip through the country—driving away from a home that has nothing left for me—and a night spent in the arms of tequila, helps me find myself in the embrace of a strong and handsome fisherman with ocean blue eyes.The same ocean blue eyes his three brothers have, including the one who is a ghost.He needs my help, but can I leave the shadows of my shackles behind to ensure he will find the light?",
