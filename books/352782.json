  "title": "The Rage of Achilles",
  "description": "In his first book,  The Rage of Achilles ,  Terence Hawkins imagines an Iliad that really happened. Informed by the brutal realities of Bronze Age warfare and Julian Jaynes' theory of the bicameral mind--now a basis for HBO's Westworld--the novel depicts real men and women struggling in the end of a decade-long war, their gods dwindling into hallucinations and half-heard commands as the modern consciousness is suddenly and painfully born. Emily Hauser, author of   For the Most Beautiful,   \"Terence Hawkins' 'The Rage of Achilles' . . . is Greek myth red in tooth and claw. Visceral and to-the-point, it grabs you and doesn't let go.\"  Tom Perrotta, author of Little Children and The Leftovers , called it \"a rare thing--a genuinely fresh take on a classic text.\"",
