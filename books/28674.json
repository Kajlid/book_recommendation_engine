This comprehensive reference assists individuals with limited botanical knowledge as well as natural resource professionals in identifying wildland plants.

Each plant description includes identifying characteristics, an illustration of the plant with enlarged parts, and a general distribution map for North America. Each species description includes nomenclature; life span; origin; season of growth; inflorescence, flower or spikelet, or other reproductive parts; vegetative parts; and growth characteristics. Brief notes are included on habitat; livestock losses; and historic, food, and medicinal uses. This second edition includes updated information about closely related or easily misidentified species, new and revised illustrations, and revised distribution maps.",
