She was sent to sabotage a rich man, wanting to pay down debts incurred from her daughter’s bout with leukemia. When billionaire Benjamin Kent catches her with his computer, Tessa’s lies are exposed, one after another. He didn’t know she was a stripper either, until he came to the club to see her dance. They have no future, because she’s a thief and he’s way out of her league.  Infuriated, conflicted, enraptured … the emotions Tessa provokes in Ben are anything but tame. The woman he met in the Caribbean has lied her way straight into his heart, and there isn’t a thing he can do about it. Ben finds something endearing and vulnerable about her, which provokes his need to want to protect … to take control and make her his.",
