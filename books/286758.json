  "title": "Doctors are not gods: Taking responsibility for our own health and wellbeing",
  "description": "It's my inherent belief that you are the only person on this earth who knows your body better than anyone else. Our bodies talk to us all day, every day, and we need to be listening to what they're saying.This is not a story about badmouthing general practitioners and ridiculing the medical fraternity. It's a centuries-old notion that doctors are healers and near to gods, but they are mere mortals and their expertise is limited. You should be taking control of and responsibility for your own health and wellbeing - pure and simple. In Doctors are not gods , Michelle Cox shares her very personal experiences of both her mother being medically mistreated and her own case of being misdiagnosed for months before needing emergency surgery for cervical cancer. With an attitude of learning from mistakes, Michelle asks what she herself could have done better in order to be the boss of her own health and wellbeing in future and stop handing over the power of something so important to others. This book is about creating a working relationship with your medical professionals to ensure you are responsible for your own health, especially in a world where the healthcare landscape is changing so rapidly.",
