  "description": "When Reno’s parents announce the family will be camping on an island, she realizes their drug-dependent / drinking / hyperactive / disabled eccentricities are normal compared to this new plan. She soon learns the island is not the tropical type, but the kind in the middle of a busy traffic rotary. Her parents pack a tent, some blankets, and a Porta-Potty to camp in the center of the busiest rotary in town. So Reno quickly comes up with a survival plan which includes avoiding any and all street lunatics (besides family). Once they arrive, she is at least grateful their camp is hidden amongst tall trees. But events take a peculiar and disturbing turn, first when Reno sees her new neighbor, a bum who shares the rotary and resides on a nearby bench, and second, when her young sister Wiley pays the price for their mother’s liquor binge in a bloody trauma to the head and Reno must face her own responsibility in the accident and help her sister fight for her life. But how?",
