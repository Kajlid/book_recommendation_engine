  "title": "The Two Baronesses",
  "description": "In addition to the fairy tales for which he was so well known, Hans Christian Andersen published several novels including \"The Two Baronesses\" (1848), \"Be or Not to Be\" (1857), and \"Lucky Peter\" (1870). There is a good deal of autobiographical material in all of them. \"The Two Baronesses,\" with \"The Improvisatore\" perhaps the best of Andersen's novels, owed some of its inspiration to the works of Sir Walter Scott, which Andersen greatly admired, and particularly to \"The Heart of Midlothian,\" his favorite novel.",
