  "description": "He used to date her roommate’s sister, but now he’s single and she’s ready to jingle… his balls. A California Christmas is all Nora’s ever known. She’s got everything she needs in Los Angeles – a flexible part-time nannying position, roommates who might as well be her family, and an acting career in the making. The last thing she’s looking for is a relationship. So why does this redheaded, dirty-talking Brit suddenly have her tinsel in a twist? Bowie has a nasty habit of falling too hard, too quickly. When he finds himself suddenly single (yet again) just before the holidays, he decides to take his friends’ advice and try something new: a holiday fling. Seems easy enough until he meets Nora, the hypnotic, purple-haired goddess with curves for days, who just so happens to be his ex’s sister’s roommate. She just wants something casual for Christmas. He doesn’t think he’ll be able to let her go come Boxing Day. Can they turn their naughty month together into something nice forever? Meet Me in Los Feliz is a low-angst, high-heat holiday romance novella. This book features a “Soft Dom” short king with painted nails, a plus-size, tatted baddie who loves her body, one adorable wiener dog, and twelve-ish days of holiday shenanigans.
