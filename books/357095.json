  "description": "Meet Glory Potter, a strong-willed farm girl coming of age on the Midwestern prairie during the early twentieth century. Driven to please her dying reverend father, young Glory takes the helm of his ministry. Folks gather from miles around to witness the holy woman's powerful sermons and her church begins to prosper. But after protesting one World War, and another brewing on the horizon, the pacifist sect comes under fire from its patriotic neighbors.Further complicating matters, Glory's childhood sweetheart, Emma, returns to the church even lovelier than the traumatic day she left. Glory struggles to hold onto the pulpit--as well as her sanity. The strictures she places on herself will affect the Potterite flock in unforeseeable ways for generations to come.The saga of four intersecting lives, THE CHILDREN OF MOTHER GLORY, explores our need to belong versus our urge to seek. It is a story of that mysterious inheritance known as human desire and its ability to outpace human ideology.",
