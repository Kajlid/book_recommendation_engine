  "description": "After spending years trying to locate and destroy Prince Radu Zeklos, the vampire that killed his fiancé, Daniel Jameson finds a solution to his problem when in the summer of 1882 the King of Romania decides to host an international race of “self-propelled ground machines” through the Carpathian Mountains, a story told in “Carpathia,” a Steampunk/Paranormal novel.Four nations — Germany, England, France and the United States — are set to take part in the race, and Jameson finds allies in Major William “Stump” O’Brien, the American team’s military liaison, and Olivia Lowenby, the daughter of the man responsible for building the English vehicle and a woman who also desires revenge against the vampire for the death of her brother.Initially opposed to the race because if successful it will destroy the “traditional way of life” for Romania’s vampires and werewolves, Prince Zeklos has changed his mind. He too seizes the contest as an opportunity to achieve something he has spent years dreaming of: the creation of a new nation of the undead, Carpathia.With airships battling in the skies and humans fighting undead creatures on the ground, “Carpathia” is filled with action and plot twists as Jameson and Zeklos maneuver to achieve their very different goals.",
