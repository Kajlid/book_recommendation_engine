Aboard are the specimens of the next generation, genetically modified to develop powerful abilities, which they must use to fulfill their life's purpose: exterminating those infected by the plague and stopping the apocalypse.From the day Eos Europa was created eighteen years ago, she's cared about little else. But when she fails to develop an ability, everything she's worked for is lost—that is, until soldiers start disappearing only seconds after reaching Earth's surface.In an act of desperation, Eos is sent to Earth to find the missing soldiers. But what she discovers challenges everything she's ever been taught—about who she is, where she's come from, and how the apocalypse really began—leaving her to decide whether she'll continue to play the puppet she was created to be, or disappear like everyone else.",
