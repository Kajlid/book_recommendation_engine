  "description": "The Flaherty Brothers Traveling Carnivale and Freakshow has rolled into Pleasant Hills, Tennessee, and the quiet little town will never be the same. In fact, much of the town won't survive. At first glance, the freakshow looks like so many others - lurid, rundown, decrepit. But this freakshow is definitely one of a kind . . . The townspeople can't resist the lure of the tawdry spectacle, though it isn't mere morbid curiousity that draws them into the freakshow's inescapable web. What waits for them behind this curtain are hardly the usual performers and tricks. The main attractions are living nightmares, the acts center on torture and slaughter . . .and the stars of the show are the unsuspecting customers themselves.",
