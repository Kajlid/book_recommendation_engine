  "description": "It has long been said that good friends could go months, or years even, without seeing each other and then, on the occasions they do get together again, it is like neither of them have ever been away. They talk and laugh together like they see each other every day. They confide and whisper secrets they would share with no other. They have seen each other at their worst and they have seen each other at their very best. They have each otherâ€™s back. They would lie down on the floor for the other and they would go to the very ends of the earth to protect and care for them without a second thought or glance or question. If you find one of these special friends, or you are so lucky to have three or even four of them then you will know what I mean.  For these four girls, Jo, Anna, Lilly and Katie, this is absolutely true. But what happens when the unthinkable happens, when life, or rather death, has other plans for one of them. How will their world change? And will they be strong enough to pick up the pieces and make the changes they need to their own lives to ensure happiness and success.",
