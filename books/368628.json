Included in these colorful and decorative pages are such stories as the well-loved legend of Baboushka; the stately measures of the classic carol \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" and the rollicking new song \"North Pole Express\"; descriptions of Christmas food, animals, and plants; a history of Santa Claus; a verse play about shepherds; and poems that are reverent, witty, and touching. This beautiful book, the loving collaboration of a distinguished author, artist, and musician, is the ideal companion for a family Christmas.",
