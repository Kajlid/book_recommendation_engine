  "description": "Each day offers encouragement and hope from a Savior who is closer than you can imagine and who will never leave you.Grow in a deep personal faith while reading a message that everyone needs to hear and embrace deep within the soul. \"Jesus Calling\"(R) is a devotional that is read daily by more than six million people. This version includes the beloved original content, but with a modern cover that will appeal to a younger audience.After many years of writing in her prayer journal, missionary Sarah Young decided to listen to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever she believed He was saying to her. It was awkward at first, but gradually her journaling changed from monologue to dialogue. She knew her writings were not inspired as Scripture is, but journaling helped her grow closer to God, and from that experience \"Jesus Calling\"(R) came to be.It is Sarah's fervent prayer that our Savior may bless every reader with His presence and His peace in ever deeper measure.",
