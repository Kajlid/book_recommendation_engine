  "description": "In Cartesia, no one is free except for those who don't understand the meaning of the word. The Council, populated and run by deviants and murderous politicians, have reduced nearly all cities to either impoverished wastelands or places operated solely for their hedonism. But the Shakespeare-loving vigilante named Shal has had enough of the Council's tyranny and she's going to put an end to them once and for all. Her struggle to protect her stepsister, escape Malay Prison, avenge her father's death, and do it all without being sent to the Herald of the dead called the Capesman, takes her on a maddening journey of war and emotion she'd never seen coming; especially not with only one eye. From the Herald's Wearied Eye follows Shal, a soldier named Raoul, and the Capesman through the world of Cartesia where the good live underground, God is long dead, and even one's own mind cannot be trusted.",
