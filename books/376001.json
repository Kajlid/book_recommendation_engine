  "description": "Owly & Wormy want butterflies! But when they come home from Mrs. Raccoon's nursery with a milkweed plant that's supposed to attract some fluttering friends, what they get instead are chubby, green bugs. Green bugs are NOT butterflies! Will butterflies ever come to the forest? Only time will tell...Bold, graphic and full of fun, this wordless storybook will give pre-reader the wings they need to start reading on their own, and a firm footing on the idea of metamorphosis.",
