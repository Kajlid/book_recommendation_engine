  "description": "What do you do when your sister introduces you to her new boyfriend and he turns out to be the same guy who hit on you the day before? What do you do when your father tells you he’s leaving your mom for another woman after twenty plus years of marriage? These are things I shouldn’t be dealing with during finals week, but here we are. I just want to pass my classes. That’s all. Then they come into my life and change everything. How is it possible to meet three guys like this in the span of three days? Maybe things aren’t as simple as I once thought? What if soulmates do exist? And what if… I’m not human? I’m in over my head.  Concealed is book 1 in The Tiger Shifter Chronicles. This is an RH, why choose series. Book 1: Concealed Book 2: Exposed (coming soon!)",
