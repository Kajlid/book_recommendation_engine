  "title": "There Are No Accidents: Synchronicity and the Stories of Our Lives",
  "description": "A woman is set up on a blind date with the same man twice, years apart, on two different coasts. A singer's career changes direction when she walks into the wrong audition. A husband gives his wife an unexpected gift—after she repeatedly dreams about that very same item.\nIt was Carl Jung who coined the term \"synchronicity\" for those strange coincidences that we all experience—those moments when events seem to conspire to tell us something, to teach us, to turn our lives around. They are the strange plot developments that make us feel like characters in a grand, mysterious story.How do we identify these startling coincidences as something special? How do we recognize their significance...and learn to use them as turning points that lead us toward a more meaningful life story? In this inspiring book, Jungian psychotherapist Robert Hopcke explores the role of synchronicity in our love lives and work lives, in the everyday and the spiritual, in waking and in our dreams. Filled with fascinating stories, There Are No Accidents offers us a \"novel\" way to examine our lives—as coherent, powerful narratives in which we ourselves are the protagonists.\"There Are No Accidents is a fascinating, brilliant, and invaluable guide to those 'meaningful coincidences' that provide sudden glimpses of an expanded reality, illuminating our life path and connections to others, and helping us find our way in times of change and transition. This superb and practical book by a noted therapist is sure to become a classic, inspiring generations to come.\" —Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of A Woman's Book of Life and Minding the Body, Mending the Mind\"The author's deep love and passion for his work, with many illustrative stories, makes this book a gem in the field of human consciousness. An exceptional contribution.\" —Dan Millman, author of The Way of the Peaceful Warrior",
