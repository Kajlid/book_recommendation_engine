  "title": "Amongst the Marines: The Untold Story",
  "description": "Amongst the Marines is Steven Preece's firsthand account of life as an elite Royal Marine Commando. He delivers a direct and unflinching depiction of the excessive and often shocking lifestyle of the Marines, and explains the impact this had on his own personality and behavior. On duty Steven was fit, committed, and loyal, while off duty he displayed a mammoth capacity for drinking, fighting, and, when the drink had run out, womanizing. On home leave, Steven found it increasingly hard to adapt to civilian life. He earned a reputation amongst his fellow Marines for pranks and dangerous behavior, and his eagerness to accept any challenge from other commandos eventually led him to be court-martialled. Preece was acquitted by the court, and here tells his story of life as a Marine.",
