  "description": "Social consciousness meets Southern Gothic in this ferociously funny mystery about green living, mayhem, and murder in a southern town. In Knoxville, Tennessee, a depressed woman decides to plant a garden. An idealistic young man assists her. When their environmental helpfulness extends beyond the backyard, all hell breaks loose. Spurred by talk radio and a nosey neighbor, the city gets turned on its head, and residents take it to the streets. Throw in missing canisters from a nuclear power plant and an untimely murder, and the stage is set for a social explosion of epic proportions. Like a slow boil, this profoundly irreverent story pits green vision against the status quo; Right-wing against Left-wing; and fundamentalists against pagans–all beneath the shadow of the Sunsphere, Knoxville’s relic of a World’s Fair that moved on.",
