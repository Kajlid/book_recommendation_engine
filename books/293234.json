  "description": "In this follow-up to his “hilarious yet soul-shaking” (Black Enterprise) New York Times bestseller How Not to Get Shot, comedy legend D. L. Hughley offers satirical terms for a peace treaty between white America and the rest of humanity.For more than four hundred years, white America has been safely a majority and has used that power to f*ck with blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. Now, however, the demographic tide has turned—and a reckoning is coming. On the eve of America becoming a majority-minority nation, D. L. Hughley advises, “Surrender, White People!” and offers his terms for reparations and reconciliation in this edgy book infused with his trademark blend of humor and cutting social commentary.As Hughley explains, whites better make their peace with their black and brown brothers while the getting's still good. There's a lot to answer for: the United States has subjugated African-Americans and other ethnic minorities since its founding—from slavery to Jim Crow to modern police brutality. Under the terms of Hughley’s satirical agreement, white people will stop having their police officers kill young black men, stop poisoning the water, stop appropriating black culture, stop trying to prevent black people from voting, and more. . . . In exchange, black people will talk some sense into Kanye. And they shall keep their opinions of white people's dance moves to themselves.Surrender, White People! includes 25 black-and-white illustrations.",
