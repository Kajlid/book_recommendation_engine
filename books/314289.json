  "description": "“Gentle, sensitive...sometimes funny, occasionally sad, and ultimately life-affirming.”— Winston-Salem Journal   The Sweet By and By is the story of five southern women of different ages and from very different backgrounds whose lives come together in a journey of courage, hope, and humor. First-time author Todd Johnson—who was a co-producer with Oprah Winfrey of Broadway’s The Color Purple —makes an indelible literary mark with a debut novel that bestselling author Adriana Trigiani ( Very Valentine ) calls, “heartfelt and stunning.” People magazine chose The Sweet By and By as one of its “Great Reads for Your Book Club,” saying, “ Steel Magnolias fans will love this one.”",
