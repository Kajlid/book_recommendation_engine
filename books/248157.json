  "title": "Last Homage To Mom: A sonâ€™s letters to his mother in her sunset years",
  "description": "(Bronze Medal Winner of the 2018 Global Ebook Awards!)Allen Randall, a baby-boomer born on Long Island, decided to write to his mother in the fall of 2007, after he learned from his siblings in New York, that when he called from California his mother, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease, had difficulty holding the phone.In this heartfelt book he wrote about anything and everything -in large print, believing that the topics were all new to his mother. Allen had fun bridging his current adult life, with his childhood, when his mother was ever present to him. There is a lightness and lucidity to the verbal sketches. Eventually, taken as a whole, they form a story, mildly amusing and partly philosophical, with a backdrop about life in America.",
