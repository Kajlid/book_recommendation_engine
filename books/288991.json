  "description": "Friends don’t let friends séance drunk.Vivien Stone lost the love of her life over twenty years ago. Now that she’s in her forties with a string meaningless relationships under her belt, she can't help but pine for what might have been. It doesn't help that she's somewhat psychic and can pretty much predict where a relationship is heading before it even starts.When she and her best friends find a hidden book of séances, Vivien believes it's the perfect opportunity to talk to her lost love. But things don't go as planned and what was meant to be a romantic reunion takes a turn for the bizarre.Maybe some things (and people) are better left buried in the past, and what she really needs has been standing in front of her all along.Book contains: kick-butt women who are considered middle-aged in their forties but who don't let themselves be defined by a number, paranormal elements (psychics, ghosts, magic, etc), some strong language (nothing too earth-shattering), sexy scenes but they aren’t 50 shades of OMG or anything, and a nice heaping helping of a second chance at first love. Doing midlife right!",
