  "description": "Book one is the first in this series about real life and real people, and one young man’s first steps on a journey to self-discovery. No sugar coating here. It is a raw and unfiltered look at growing up and leaving home for the first time. From a traumatic beginning, this roller coaster of emotional and visual images will tug at your heartstrings and then just as quickly make you burst out laughing. The underlying message is one of humor, hope, and triumph of the human spirit. This is the ultimate underdog story in which the readers may very well see themselves or their own circumstances come to life. This one man’s journey will prove that nothing is impossible because, “The hard you do now; the impossible just takes a little longer.” And in the end, you will know his story to be the ride of your life!",
