  "description": "Suburbia just got a little bit stranger.Liam is keen to re-establish links with his old childhood friend, Will. Will lives in a nice house with his wife, Iman. Liam decides the best way to be near Will is to buy the house next door, which he does. Except he doesn't tell Will or Iman, and then goes on to create a 'portal' between the two houses - a little doorway from his bedroom into the wardrobe in theirs. When they're out - and sometimes when they're in - Liam can come and go as he pleases, tinkering with their lives in more or less innocent fashion . . .Delightfully skewed, occasionally bizarre, often hilarious but never less than original, SEMI-DETACHED is a genuinely novel first novel.",
