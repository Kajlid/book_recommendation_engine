Now, while I secretly plot to break Wren out, I am forced compete in a lethal set of trials. Failure means that a monstrous headsman kills us both.       Turns out I have to train with a dragon-blood fae. He’s powerful, scary, and lethally attractive. And, like me, he’s harboring dark secrets.     Worst thing about him? He's the monstrous headsman himself.
