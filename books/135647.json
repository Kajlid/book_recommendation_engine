  "description": "The world has turned its back on Japan: it has been economically devastated, thrown into political turmoil—and then attacked.A small team of highly trained, ruthless North Korean special forces troops invade the city of Fukuoka, holding the residents hostage. This is the vanguard of operation 'From the Fatherland, with Love'—and if nothing is done to stop them, 120,000 more troops will follow.And while the government seems incapable of acting, there is one possible source of resistance: a troubled gang of psychotic misfits, masters of guns, explosives and toxins, self-taught and unhinged. But they are driven only by a desire for chaos, and death.Thrilling, bloody and unstoppable, From the Fatherland, with Love is a vast, mad achievement: an all-too-believable, vividly realised alternate present, with the careening, incendiary power of Murakami at his terrifying best.",
