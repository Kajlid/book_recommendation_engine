  "description": "I knew I couldn’t run from him forever.  Eight years ago, I thought I left it all behind. I thought I left him behind. Nicholas Stone. A dangerously delicious mix of tattoos, testosterone, and devilish charm. He had nearly ruined my life, my future, if I hadn’t cut him out of my life.  I hate how I can’t chase him out of my mind. I hate how I can’t forget the way he used to hold me. The way he used to please me. The way he used to make me feel so alive when I was in his arms.  And now he’s back in my life.  And I know this time, he won’t let me go.   Warning: this is a dark novel that deals with very disturbing topics. Not for the faint of heart readers. Caution is advised.   Mine is book 1 of the Black Sparks MC trilogy. Books 2 and 3, Snatched and Owned are available everywhere now!",
