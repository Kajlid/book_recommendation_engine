  "description": "A Gothic horror story of disconcerting fear and human weakness - in the traditions of Edgar Allen Poe, Bram Stoker, and Shirley Jackson! A mysterious tale of a haunting and possession that teeters on the boundary between fiction and reality - so terrifying simply because itâ€™s possible; it could be true. And if it is, it could happen to any of us!",
