  "description": "I’ve never had the Big O. Not with a bad boy. Not with a good guy. Not on a train. Not in the rain. Not with a pillow, shower massager, pocket rocket, XL extra-veined d*ldo, Ben-Wa balls, rabbit thruster, diamond glider, bionic bullet, remote control vibrating panties—nothing. You can say I’m frustrated. So when I enroll in Human Sexuality my sophomore year, it’s with the hope that I might discover what I’m doing wrong. Turns out it’s who I’m NOT doing that’s the problem. He walks into the classroom—trimmed pants, tight ass, folded-up sleeves, wide chest, blue eyes, Clark Kent glasses. Older. Hot. I pray to the climax gods that he sit next to me and become my new study buddy. Instead, he sets his briefcase down and begins to write on the board in big bold letters: Dr. MacKenzie -- “Welcome to Human Sexuality 101.” And I’ve never loved college more. Teach me, Professor. I’m listening. ** This younger woman/older man standalone in the Taboo 101 Novels does not contain cheating. It does, however, contain an HEA and will melt your panties off. You have been warned.",
