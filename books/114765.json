  "description": "No one knows what the grave robbers were looking for when they violoated the final resting place of Connor Hawthorne's recently deceased grandmother, Gwendolyn. Whatever it was, they didn't find, but they died trying. Two caskets and a casket full of stones are what the parish vicar finds. Connor leaves her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico for Glastonbury, England with Laura Nez, the courageous Navajo woman who saved her life in the high desert of New Mexico at the end of Deceptions--the first Connor Hawthorne Mystery. But Connor, a former district attorney turned crime novelist who is no stranger to mystery and danger, is ill-prepared for the family secrets that come tumbling out of the past and threaten to engulf not only her but everyone she loves. Now Connor will face a formidable enemy, and the outcome will depend on wielding a power much more subtle and more deadly than a gun. Taking readers from modern England to the mists of Avalon, \"Witchfire\" weaves a thoroughly contemporary tale of death and mayhem tied to an ancient secret. As she did in \"Deceptions,\" Lauren Maddison blends thriller fiction with deeply spiritual themes and lets it build to a heart-pounding conclusion.",
