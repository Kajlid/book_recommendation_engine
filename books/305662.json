  "description": "I've always lived in darkness. Now that darkness has taken root inside me. It's where I'm the most comfortable, but also the most afraid. Especially now. I've found a beautiful light. I want to grasp it and never let go. I worry that inevitably, my soul's deep depravity will eventually smother the beautiful light with its darkness. And that's something I don't think even I could live with. So, for now, I'll keep control of my darkness and just stare into the beautiful light from a distance. Always wary. Always wanting.Always watching.",
