  "description": "Sarah Spalding has learned to forge her own way and never to trust anyone - least of all a Yankee. But when her companion abandons her while on a train to Colorado, Sarah begrudgingly accepts the help of Whitman Kendrick - a Yankee, yes, but one with the most bewitching green eyes. Allowing Whit to be her travelling escort is one thing, taking him as a lover is another - even though she's tempted beyond reason...Whit Kendrick isn't quite sure what to make of the sharp-tongued, sassy woman sharing his train compartment. All he knows is that Sarah is refreshingly different from most women - and his urgent, primal attraction for her is unlike any he's experienced. Breaking down Sarah's wall of defence won't be easy. But Whit is determined to prove to Sarah that they're more alike than different - and loving each other is all they need.",
