  "description": "Baptisms - There is so much confusion about the various baptisms in the Bible. Many think that every time they see the word “baptism” that water is involved.* Did you know that there are 8 to 10 “baptisms” mentioned in the Bible?* Did you know that only 2 of these baptisms mention water?* Did you know that about half of these baptisms may be for Christians?This book is an effort to help bring clarity to the \"muddy waters\" of Bible baptisms. If one does not understand which baptism they are speaking about, misunderstanding and erroneous interpretations are likely to follow.",
