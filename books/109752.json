  "description": "“They walk in artificial enlightenment, and it’s so limiting, so miserable, and they can’t even see it. It’s so bright around them that their shadows cover everything, and it’s so dark in their shadows that if you find yourself there, it’s very hard to know where to go to be able to see again.”Monty and Walter are an unlikely couple who meet under the most extraordinary circumstances. They dive into a passionate secret relationship, and though they appear to be polar opposites in personality and lifestyle, they discover that they have a lot more in common than they realise.Their love changes both of them as they navigate the rough and rocky terrain of sharing a home with Walter’s judgmental stepmother. No matter what tries to tear them apart, they come to the painful conclusion, again and again, that they are soul mates.",
