  "description": "Sassy, southern, and starting over; Whitney Parker is down, but she ain't out! Instead of despairing about her now defunct wedding, Whitney seizes her life changing moment. She packs her belongings, says goodbye to her parents, and escapes her small home town in Coastal Georgia to Charlotte, North Carolina. Whitney makes a seamless transition into Charlotte and lands a receptionist position for a local NASCAR race team, GCR Racing. Even though she is clueless about stock car racing, Whitney's desperate need for independence and a life of her own fuel her determination to succeed in her new career. Within a matter of weeks, Whitney is catapulted to Public Relations Manager for NASCAR's resident bad boy, Ryan Carter, the one and only son of racing legend Garret Ryan Carter, Sr. As Whitney struggles to gain her footing with her new position and Ryan's approval, she gets caught up in the drama and adrenaline rush of this dangerous sport. Each week, she finds herself in a new city craving the on-track action, the smell of gasoline, and the roar of the stock car engines. Whitney develops a new passion not only for NASCAR, but for Ryan, too. After a series of events leave Whitney hospitalized and Ryan suspended from racing, she comes to realize that not only has Ryan gotten under her skin but into her heart, as well. Now forced to maintain a professional working relationship with Ryan, Whitney banishes all her feelings for Ryan in order to save his uncertain motorsports career from smoking and spinning.",
