  "description": "A young woman with visions of death and destruction… A new queen leading her people against an insidious foe… When Sorrel Qinsa was a little girl, a powerful seer told her she was destined to do great things. Now at eighteen, all she wants is to fulfill her destiny to become a seer for the queen. With a war raging, and the losses piling up, the queen needs someone who can help show her how to save the realms from falling into the hands of the self-proclaimed emperor, and Sorrel is determined to be that person. Only one thing holds her back – her voice. Plagued by a crippling stutter since the death of her parents, no one believes her capable of being more than an ordinary citizen. But Sorrel feels compelled to share her foreknowledge, and secretly sends warnings to the queen, setting her on a path that will lead her out of the confines of her mind and into the darkest of realities. Sorrel may find her voice, but will it be at the cost of all she loves?   Although you can read any of the books in the Book of Kaels series out of order, they are part of a larger series and it is highly suggested they be read in order to ensure the greatest enjoyment and satisfaction.",
