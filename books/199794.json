  "description": "Tate Locklear has worked as a vampire enforcer at his coven for almost two centuries. He’s ready for a change of pace. When his master calls for volunteers to protect shifters in the forest, he thinks it’s the something new that he needs. Tate discovers it’s so much more when the scent of a reclusive leopard shifter’s blood calls to him. Somehow, he must convince the pretty kitty known as Psion, that staying in human form longer than it takes to open and close a door can be extremely pleasurable and beneficial to both of them. Unfortunately, that also reveals a new problem. Can Tate get Psion past his fear of blood so he can claim him?",
