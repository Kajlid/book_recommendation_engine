  "description": "Domenico’s Table is a riveting postwar adventure loosely based on the life of Domenico Sacchelli, a charming proprietor, chef extraordinaire, and gregarious cousin to the Bertozzis of Tuscany. When a sassy American joins a former German soldier and his stoic granddaughter for a reunion at Domenico’s holiday rental in Italy, sparks fly. For love to kindle, bitter memories and closely guarded secrets must be surrendered--but bigotry, suspicion, and fear stand in the way. With the help of a handsome Italian tour guide, time, truth, and a miracle will determine if love prevails.",
