Now nothing but her complete surrender will purge her from his soul. If it weren't for the children she cares for in her makeshift orphanage, Audrey would have left Defiance long ago. Now the sheriff is blackmailing her to distract the man who might derail his corrupt schemesÂ—a man who can offer Audrey not just protection, but a passion bold enough to make them claim their place in this harsh and beautiful land.",
