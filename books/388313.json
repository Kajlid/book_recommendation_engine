  "description": "In 'Don't Take Your Love To Town' Langford writes: 'we saw a big sign saying BUNDJALUNG NATIONAL PARK and I told him he was now in my territory'.This is Ruby Langford's (Ginibi) first book and autobiography.First published in 1988, Ruby worked for over 2 years with her editor Susan Hampton to write her story to share with the world.'Don't Take Your Love To Town' paints a picture of what it was like growing up in Australia from the 1930s onwards, in a society divided between black and white, in both rural and urban areas.Beginning life on a mission in NSW, Ruby grew up surrounded by the love of her father, sisters and extended family which helped her develop her deadly sense of humour in the face of the many hardships and heartbreaks she experienced in her life.She has observed and lived the changes wrought on Aboriginal communities, the poverty and tragedies that found their way to her doorstep and yet she managed to find a way to keep smiling while bringing up her 9 children mostly on her own.Ruby Langford has lived a life rich in both sadness and joy; she has a very easy style of writing for the reader to find themselves drawn into the pages within minutes and, peppered with her wit, her story captures and holds the reader within its grasp until the end.",
