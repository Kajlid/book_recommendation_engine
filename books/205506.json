  "description": "As Harry and the other residents of Orchard Close struggle to survive, a new crop of problems present themselves. Unstable electricity damages equipment, days are spent scavenging for ammo, weapons, food, glass bottles, and of all things, yarn. Elsewhere, gangs carve out their territory throughout the city. Residents pay for protection through coupons, barter or worse. Citizens fleeing the city gangs, violence and lack of food flock to Orchard Close, but how many can they take in? Worse, as time goes by, life changes from surviving to enduring. What's the point of maths if you are going to starve to death? The peace is fragile with only a bullet away from having the whole world change again...and it does.",
