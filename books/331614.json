No woman, he told himself, could make him feel the way he did after a successful mission- no matter how beautiful she was.So why was he standing on a cold pier like a lovelorn teenager, hoping for a glimpse od Linette Collins?But then he saw her, and the sight of her took his breath away. The wind whipped her lustrous dark hair about her face and she lifted a finger to wrap a think strand behind her ear.The smart thing to do was turn around and walk away as fast as his feet would carry him. He'd gotten what he wanted. One last look at her. His curiousity should be satisfied. But even as his mind formulated the thought, Cain knew that just seeing Linette again could never be enough.",
