  "description": "When Emily Brown's life and business is turned around by a surprise visit from Carina Lees, an immaculately-groomed reality TV star, she can't believe her luck.With just one other member of staff to help her out at her Essex salon The Beauty Spot , Emily is pushed for time as well as money. So Carina's patronage and the subsequent financial success of the salon is more welcome than a sunbed session in December.But even with the assistance of skilled-yet-shabby new girl Natalie, things start to go mysteriously wrong, and it soon becomes clear that someone's got it in for the salon. And with tactics dirtier than a gardener's fingernails, the battle of the beauticians commences. For, under all the make-up and manicures, Carina is not who she seems and, although confronting the past can be painful, Emily eventually has to stare the truth in the face and realise it's what's inside that really counts . . .Praise for Chris Manby'Nothing short of brilliant' - Marie Claire'Delicious read' - Daily Mail",
