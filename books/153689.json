  "description": "Rowan Hill seemed like the perfect place for Ellie to escape and lick her wounds; a huge estate surrounded by a nice big wall and plenty of peace, quiet, and time to think ... Will has a reputation for being a humourless grumpy loner, but it’s his estate and he doesn’t want anything to change; things would be perfect if everyone would just leave him alone. Maybe it’s not that he’s grumpy at all though, maybe it’s the big fat secret he’s keeping that makes him act the way he does … Finn ran away from his past, but is now planning a return home to Rowan Hill. What he finds when he returns though is not quite what he was expecting … The perfect solution for all of them is staring Ellie in the face, trouble is she’s been accused of meddling before; should she follow her heart or her head? With old friends and new pulling together, the course of the year plays out amid the challenge of building an exciting new creative community project. As romance and friendships blossom however, the complications of the past are never far away, and a shocking revelation soon threatens their hopes for the future. Suddenly the beliefs they once held true become the biggest obstacle they have to overcome. Will they find the courage to learn from the truth? After all, life, like art, is all about perception, and sometimes it just depends on your point of view….",
