Even, or especially for the Mafia Princess. Lynette Selvaggio had grown up in the shadow of her family. Never allowed to thrive, voice her opinions or simply be herself. And it had never bothered her. Until her life dramatically changed in a matter of seconds. One decision set in motion a series of events she could never come back from. Faster than she was able to handle. And being surrounded by monsters lurking behind every corner and sadistic murders the escape became a distant, unreachable illusion.There was no way out. The target on her back made it clear. All she wanted was to break free, yet the world she’d been born into seemed intent on breaking her instead. She was the girl nobody knew could be an angel, and still her light was setting everything around her on fire. But above all else, she’d always been innocent.Innocent is a debut, full-length novel. It contains graphic violence some may find offensive.",
