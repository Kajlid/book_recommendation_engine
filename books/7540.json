  "description": "Like any other fourteen-year-old, Myri Monaco has problems that she doesn't know how to deal with: a crush on her best friend's boyfriend, a mother who's dating her science teacher, and a \"punishment\" for a science-project-gone-wrong that lands her in the last place she wants to be--in auditions for the school play. But most girls don't have what Myri has--a ghost named Wren who not only lives at home, but who is willing to \"trade places\" whenever she is needed. Although Myri is reluctant at first, Wren's offer becomes a quick and easy solution when her problems collide. However, this experience in ghostly possession soon takes Myri's life to new levels. How much will Myri lose to avoid the problems mounting around her? How much will Wren take to fulfill her own desires?",
