  "title": "Kingdom, Grace, Judgment: Paradox, Outrage, and Vindication in the Parables of Jesus",
  "description": "Here in one volume is Robert Farrar Capon's widely praised trilogy on Jesus' parables â€• The Parables of the Kingdom, The Parables of Grace, and The Parables of Judgment. These studies offer a fresh, adventurous look at all of Jesus' parables, treated according to their major themes. With the same authorial flair and daring insight that have earned him a wide readership, Capon admirably bridges the gap between the biblical world and our own, making clear both the original meaning of the parables and their continuing relevance today.",
