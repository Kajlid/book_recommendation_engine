  "description": "Ever wonder what adventures a dog has in a day? Meet Klaus, a schnauzer dog. From the challenge of trying to catch the neighborhood squirrel to doing tricks for a treat. He grabs his leash and he is off to explore around the neighborhood with his owner, Terry. Out on their walk, the two set off to the park for a game of catch, playing other dog friends, and then for a game of hide and seek. At the end of a busy day, Klaus is ready for sleep. And like most dogs, he falls fast asleep to do it all again the next day.",
