  "description": "All Avery wanted the minute she graduated high school was to hop on a plane to Rome with her two best friends and spend the next three weeks sun tanning and eating gelato. All Cameron wanted was to get away from home and lose himself crisscrossing Europe with no plan in mind. When classmates Cameron and Avery have a chance encounter at the airport and end up stranded in Paris together for one night, neither one of their trips are going how they imagined. For Cameron, it’s perfect. For uptight Avery, it’s just about the worst thing that could happen. But as the night goes on, the roles reverse and it’s Cameron who is wishing he was back with his friends in Italy after his plan backfires, while Avery is having the time of her life with newfound friends and adventure. As the excitement moves from Paris to Monaco, Avery and Cameron discover that they needed to make a few wrong turns to end up where they were meant to be.",
