Women are destroying the joint – Christine Nixon in Melbourne, Clover Moore here. Honestly.’The twitterverse exploded with passionate, disbelieving and hilarious responses, and now here in Destroying the Joint women reply to his comment and the broader issues of sexism and misogyny in our culture.With Jane Caro editing, this entertaining and thought-provoking collection consists of essays, analysis, memoir, fiction and more, from some of our best and brightest.",
