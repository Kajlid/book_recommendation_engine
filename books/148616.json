  "description": "What’s really going on in our public school classrooms?Good question.- Journalists are not allowed in…- Teachers risk punishment if they speak out…- School administrators will only share the good stuff…- Most lawmakers?

From el barrio to Wall Street, they’re all present…speaking in their own voices.Yo Miz! is a remarkable odyssey through the largest public school system in the US.Want a front row seat in class? Then Yo Miz! = required reading. Fa real!“Despite the fact that there's never been a sub quite like Miz Rose, she manages to capture what it is about NYC schools that that both of us love (and occasionally hate). I love this book. It's a masterpiece. I couldn't put it down.” Deborah Meier, In Schools We Trust\"\"Elizabeth Rose's Yo Miz! is hands down the best book ever written about being a rotating substitute teacher. Following her journey from school to school is heartbreaking and infuriating, especially because this is an incredibly talented teacher who LOVES young people. Her portraits of the students she meets are filled with empathy, humor, and an incredible ear for dialogue. But the treatment she receives, along without thousands of others in her position, is a sure sign of an education policy that has gone off the deep end, at the expense of children as well as teachers. This book takes an awful subject and brings it to life in a way that will make readers laugh and will tug at their heartstrings. A must read!” Dr. Mark Naison, Badass Teachers Unite!",
