  "title": "A Kiss in Costume",
  "description": "This Halloween, Maggie Juarez just wants to nerd out on the finer points of period costume design in her hand-made Regency ballgown and try to ignore her painful, awkward crush on beautiful ice-queen Samantha Winters. But Sam is impossible to ignore, especially when she shows up to a party dressed--perfectly--as Mr. Darcy. She can't be trying to attract Maggie's attention...can she?",
