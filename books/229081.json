  "description": "Philoctetes is a play written by Sophocles, an ancient Greek playwright, that tells the story of Philoctetes, a Greek warrior who was abandoned on a deserted island for ten years after being bitten by a snake. The play begins when Odysseus and Neoptolemus, two Greek soldiers, are sent to retrieve Philoctetes and his magical bow, which is needed to win the Trojan War. However, Philoctetes is filled with anger and resentment towards the Greeks who abandoned him, and initially refuses to help them. As the play progresses, the characters grapple with issues of loyalty, betrayal, and the morality of using trickery to achieve a desired outcome. Philoctetes is torn between his desire for revenge and his duty to his fellow Greeks, while Odysseus and Neoptolemus struggle with their own consciences as they try to convince Philoctetes to join their cause. The play is known for its exploration of complex moral and ethical issues, as well as its portrayal of the human condition. It is considered one of Sophocles' greatest works, and has been studied and performed for And yet I wonder not; for if aright I judge, from angry heaven the sentence came, And Chrysa was the cruel source of all; Nor doth this sad disease inflict him still Incurable, without assenting gods?This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.
