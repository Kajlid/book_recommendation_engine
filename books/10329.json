  "title": "A Guide to Functional Analytic Psychotherapy: Awareness, Courage, Love, and Behaviorism",
  "description": "For more than two decades, Functional Analytic Psychotherapy has brought new meaning – and new meaningfulness – to client/therapist relationships. And clients with disorders as varied as depression, PTSD, and fibromyalgia have benefited from its nuanced, curative power. In A Guide to Functional Analytic Psychotherapy, originators Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai join with other FAP practitioners to present a clinical framework, addressing points of convergence and divergence with other behavior therapies. Tracing FAP’s emerging evidence base, it takes readers through the deep complexities and possibilities of the therapeutic bond. And the attention to mindfulness and the self makes maximum clinical use of the uniqueness of every client – and every therapist.",
