  "description": "Fans of New York Times Bestselling author Susan Isaacs’ signature satire won’t be disappointed with this new edition of her classic tale of family, sex and New York politics Marcia Green is a sophisticated, witty, successful New Yorker, a whiz of a political speech writer, a woman who finds a smoke-filled room more intoxicating than a magnum of champagne. Her private life is a little less bubbly. She has a passionate but not very promising live-in relationship with her boss’s dashing chief of staff, Jerry Morrissey. He offers her only a good time- but what a time! Can Marcia resist when a new man arrives on the scene, a man who is exactly the sort her family wants her to marry- bright, kind, attractive, wealthy, and charming- in short, too good to be real?",
