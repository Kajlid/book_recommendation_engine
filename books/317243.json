  "description": "\"Chandler Burr's challenging first novel is many things: a glimpse into Hollywood culture, an argument about religious identity, a plea for the necessity of literature. This is a roman that needs no clefs.\" —Washington Post. New York Magazine calls You or Someone Like You, \"The highbrow humanist name-dropping book of the summer.\" The remarkable first novel by Chandler Burr, the New York Times scent critic and author of The Perfect Scent, is funny, smart, and provocative—an extraordinarily ambitious work of fiction that succeeds on many different levels. It is a book David Ebershoff, (author of The 19th Wife) enthusiastically recommends \"for anyone who defiantly clings to the belief that a book can change our lives.\"",
