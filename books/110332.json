  "description": "Harmonizing his stream to the tune of life, the Acoustic Funambulist travels on time through the galaxies in a progression of unlikely encounters. Dodging black holes, almost starting a world war and having peculiar philosophical discussions are just normal episodes of the aerialist's voyage through the Universe. The hair of the comet is the first episode in English. Acoustic Funambulist is also available in French under the title Le funambule acoustique (six episodes published so far).",
