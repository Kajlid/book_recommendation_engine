She is the band manager for Vanish and her boyfriend is the guitarist, James, a sixteen-year-old high school junior.James is so into her that he can’t stand for her to be with anyone else. That should be a good thing, but what seemed kind of sweet at first is suddenly getting annoying and even kind of scary.James’s jealousy doesn’t just mean Amalia can’t see other guys. He doesn’t want her giving her attention to anyone: not her friends, her family, or even a toddler she’s visiting at a shelter.When you’re thirteen, love can be tricky, but is this the kind of love that Amalia wants, and is it even love at all?",
