Convinced there's no such thing as Prince Charming, and against her best friend's better judgment, she places a personal ad seeking a one-night stand. No strings, no commitments, no second dates. Her goal? To restore her faith in men by setting up a single night of fantasy that can never be tainted by reality. William is a busy executive, newly arrived in the United States from England. Life for him is all about minimizing complications. He doesn't have the time nor the inclination to share his life with anyone, to have obligations outside of work, or to become entangled in a relationship with an emotional basket case of a woman who’s desperately seeking her Prince Charming. But he does see the value in having an attractive woman on his arm for networking purposes ... This ebook is Part 1 of the contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT, approximately 25,000 words or 100 paper pages long. The story continues with Parts 2-6.Content warning: Due to sexy situations and content, this book is definitely not appropriate for younger readers. A note from Elle about this series: Hello readers! I had such a great time writing this serial. Like you, I had no idea what was going to happen from one part to the next. I didn't even know how many parts there would be. It was great having all the feedback from my readers as each part was released; it definitely influenced the end result. Edward's story, JUST ONE WEEK, is coming soon in 2016.
