  "description": "Sweet, helpful, sympathetic – both in and out of drag Stephen Walsh (aka Helena Montana) plays Disney princess to his best friend Bunny’s snarling Ursula, the Blanche to his Baby Jane.  But like so many Disney princesses, Stephen has dark origins. Violent drunks, thieves, liars, cheats – he’s had them all and had his heart broken so many times that he’s decided it’s easier to remain single, even if some days the loneliness is unbearable.  Then one day he walks into the local magic store and meets the owner’s nephew. Newly arrived from San Francisco, Hu Chen is shy, thoughtful and a perfect gentleman, so different from Stephen’s usual type that the attraction between them catches both of them by surprise.  As their flirtation blooms into a hot summer fling, Stephen is forced to confront his painful past, and face the frightening possibility that it has left him too broken to learn how to love a good man.  This full length novel (80,000 words) can be read as a standalone or as a sequel to All That Drag.",
