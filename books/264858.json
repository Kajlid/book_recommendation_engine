  "title": "Blind Fall",
  "description": "I was gifted as a slave-bride to an alien giant. That’s the start of my day. At least I have my guide dog, Kota, with me. I’d be lost without her… literally. Yes. I’m blind.And our new alien owner is kind enough that he’s not holding me to the wife or slave deal even though that’s what I was intended for. We’ve basically been dropped into a scene from Little House on the Alien Prairie, complete with his one-room cabin, and he’s been the perfect gentleman. He’s pretty great, and I’m actually starting to wish I could take him home with me. He doesn’t know it yet, but the threat of him going into ‘rut’ is no longer a deterrent...  **This book is a standalone--grab and enjoy! (Note: Explicit language and adult scenes are contained in this book.)  ***Heads up for readers of the Stolen by an Alien series: this is an interconnected standalone, so hop in and have some fun “Aha!” moments with me!",
