  "description": "The World’s #1 Personal Development Agency . . . has to prove it. What if you brought together five top personal development experts―equipped with virtually everything we know about unleashing human potential―and gave them some lives to change? Could they really coach anyone to lose fifty pounds, fix a broken relationship, or get rich? What would they do for a homeless person, or a pro-golfer trailing at the back of her league? How about taking the racism out of a racist, or turning a hellish employee into a ray of sunshine? Welcome to Quest, Inc. They say they can change your life. Now, as they’re followed by an investigative journalist from one of the world’s leading news publications, they have to prove it―or be damned as charlatans. Based on real life peak performance and transformational strategies, you’ll see the highs and lows everyone faces on the road to self-realization―especially the experts. Get ready for breakthrough . . . or breakdown.",
