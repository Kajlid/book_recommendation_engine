  "description": "Silas Creswell was the nightmare I wanted to escape, but kept falling back into.The mind is a beautiful thing.Bullshit.The mind was a toxic waste land of nightmares and misery. My cousin Finn suffered from the plague of memories every time he closed his eyes. His ghosts haunted his every thought, while mine moved in next door.Star Chadwick wasn't the little girl I met on the beach ten years ago. She was broken, beautiful, and pissing me off. My entire life I heard her words when my dad drove me to be better. Do better. Become the best. And now she was here. Taunting me from the window next door.There was one good thing about the voice haunting my thoughts becoming real...I couldn't hurt a ghost.A fresh start, that's what my parents called the move, and that's what I tried to do.I left my past back in England and reinvented myself. Became the person I destroyed. Someone kind and thoughtful. The friendly girl who thought of others.Then I met him.Silas Creswell, my new arsehole neighbor. He hated me more than I hated myself. I fought to keep the old Star away. Fought back my urges to destroy his perfect little life. Except it wasn't just him. The entire town of Ashen Springs was as corrupt and wrong as the people in it.All I wanted to do was save one girl. If Harper couldn't stand up for herself, then I'd do it for her. Because if I'd learned anything from what happened.It was that karma's a bitch.This book contains intense situations.
