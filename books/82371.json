  "title": "A Companion to Marx's Capital, Volume 2",
  "description": "The biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression shows no sign of coming to a close and Marx’s work remains key in understanding the cycles that lead to recession. For nearly forty years, David Harvey has written and lectured on Capital , becoming one of the world’s most foremost Marx scholars. Based on his recent lectures, and following the success of his companion to the first volume of Capital , Harvey turns his attention to Volume 2, aiming to bring his depth of learning to a broader audience, guiding first-time readers through a fascinating and hitherto neglected text. Whereas Volume 1 focuses on production, Volume 2 looks at how the circuits of capital, the buying and selling of goods, realize value. This is a must-read for everyone concerned to acquire a fuller understanding of Marx’s political economy.",
