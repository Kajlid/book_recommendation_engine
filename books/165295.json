In 1913 she reinvigorated the American campaign for a constitutional suffrage amendment after returning from being arrested and forced fed in the English campaign with the Pankhurst mother and daughters. In the next seven years she dominated that campaign and drive it to victory in 1920 with bold, controversial action - wedding courage with resourcefulness and self-mastery.Using oral history interviews and Paul's correspondence, Zahniser and Fry substantially revise our understanding of Paul's role in the suffrage movement and her charismatic leadership qualities.
