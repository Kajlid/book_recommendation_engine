  "title": "Tobruk Commando: The Raid to Destroy Rommel's Base",
  "description": "\"Gentlemen, we are going to capture Tobruk and destroy it.\"'Operation Agreement' started as a fairly simple plan to destroy Rommel's bomb-proof oil-storage tanks at Tobruk on the eve of Alamein. But, catching the imagination of GHQ, the plan snowballed alarmingly. As well as a commando unit led by the plan's originator, Colonel Haselden, it came to include the RAF, the Royal Navy, the Marines and two of the largest destroyers in the Mediterranean.It was a daring attempt to rob Rommel at one stroke of the three essentials to success in North Africa - oil, a supply port and shipping. But the calculated risks began to out balance the chances of success when it seemed that every dockyard worker in Alexandria and every cocktail-party-goer in Cairo knew about the raid before the officers and men set out. The operation went on, and became a tragedy of slaughtered men and sunken ships.Tobruk Commando is a classic adventure story of the Second World War. The fast-moving action centres on the small commando of men which set out secretly through the deserts towards Tobruk. After a long journey across the desert sand, they arrived disguised as a group of POWs and their German captors. Expertly written, this is a wonderful tale of heroic bluff and a venture to test the courage and nerves of the toughest men.",
