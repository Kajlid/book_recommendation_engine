  "description": "He’s my best friend’s brother – and the only boy I’ve ever loved. Movie star, manwhore, and totally off-limits. Until now. I told myself it was time to move on, until one epic night changed everything. Now there’s no denying the way I feel when he touches me, or the reckless desire in his eyes. Once we cross that line, there’s no going back. But can I risk it all for him when he’s still hiding secrets of his own? Some love stories are destiny. Ours is still unwritten.",
