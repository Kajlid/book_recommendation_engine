  "description": "Kidnapping with benefits.Karis is the arrogant young prodigy of the Radiant Order, and his talents have found him plenty of admirers but far fewer friends. There’s one thing he has to hide, though: the voice in his head that tells him to do very un-paladin-like things. Sometimes it’s helpful. Sometimes it gets him into trouble.This time, trouble’s name is Ronan.Ronan’s done more for the gods than any paladin, but an insidious conspiracy means he’s the wanted criminal. Fine by Ronan. When he's captured by the corrupt Radiant Order, Ronan doesn’t think twice before kidnapping a cute little squire to cover his escape.His new hostage is a lot more complicated than he expected.Between escape attempts and counterspells, Karis keeps getting under Ronan’s skin, and Ronan keeps getting inside Karis’s head. And the longer they stay together, Karis starts thinking less about escaping, and more about how Ronan might taste.But the conspiracy they’re tangled in is more dangerous than either of them know.",
