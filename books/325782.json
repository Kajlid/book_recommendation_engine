  "description": "“He looked exactly the way I liked him to… dangerous and mine.” Benjamin Thomas, a billionaire philanthropist and a rumored mob-boss, was everything you expected him to be—dangerous, ruthless, and handsome. When he found me in the dead of the night, sick and asleep inside his locker room, I expected him to shoot me…. or at the very least, arrest me. He did neither. Tucked within the pocket of his arms, he carried me home. In a blink, I had a warm bed, a new doctor, and a man who refused to leave my side. The look in his eyes reminded me of a storm. I didn’t know it yet... but it was brewing just for me. Benjamin Thomas wasn’t a man capable of loving anything but himself… until he met me. Mad Love is a quick, fast paced MM romance with an HEA and no cliffhangers. This story features a morally ambiguous Daddy and the boy he’s dangerously obsessed with. Expect to find steamy scenes, needless violence, and soul-bending love.",
