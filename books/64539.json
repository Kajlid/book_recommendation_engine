But not all battles are fought on a battlefield; sometimes they are fought in the heart.As chief surgeon for the Wardens, Evelyn Stone fears her own life is on the line when she is kidnapped by a band of pirates—only to discover that the airship captain is Gavin “Mac” MacRae—her former lover. The man whose life she once saved. The man she abandoned.Since Evelyn left, Mac made his mark as both a pirate and a pilot. But his true allegiance isn’t known. Upon asking Evie for help with a wounded woman on board, he tells Evie that the woman is his wife—even though his feelings for Evie have never waned.As the days pass, however, the unease between Evie and Mac gives way to the old comfort they once had. Yet, their newly ignited romance is complicated by conflicting loyalties and desires, and a betrayal that may cost both of them their love and their lives.",
