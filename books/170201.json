  "description": "Grizzly bear shifter Grant Waters wants one womanâ€”Curvy Chelsea O'Reilly. He's wanted her since they met. Except he's worried his secret may be too much for her. It may be what sets her running.  Curvaceous Chelsea works at a salon in Bear Canyon Valley. She gets butterflies when Grant's around. But she's got her own baggage. Plus, she thinks that Grant would be better off with the local, stunning, curvy, widowed-way-too-early Mae Forester.  If hot sex skeeves you out, you may want to pass on this book. If freaky, downright dirty sexy talk bothers you, yeah, for sure you gotta pass on this one. We believe in sex--hot, dirty, delicious sex. Yup, make it sweaty, too. It's not just sex, it's about the romance. But good romance has sex, and we keep the doors open! Oh, and the lights on! ;)  This BBW Paranormal Shape Shifter Romance for adults only.",
