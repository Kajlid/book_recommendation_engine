  "description": "It's a beautiful spring day! Following the advice of prim Penelope Pig, this community of lovable animals happily begins its spring cleaning. But when Lainie Lamb discovers that Gallagher Goat (who will eat anything!) has carelessly gobbled the prized curtains she hung out to dry, she scolds him. Embarrassed by his mistake and sorry for upsetting his friend, Gallagher runs away to hide. Then, realizing that her friendship with Gallagher is far more important than her curtains, Lainie organizes a surprise party for Gallagher featuring \"junk\" food she knows he'll love. And Gallagher has a surprise for Lainie that brings the story to a very happy ending for everyone.",
