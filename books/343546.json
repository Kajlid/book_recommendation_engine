  "description": "\"Klein's characters are compelling, one and all.\" —San Diego Union-Tribune\"A quirky, quickly paced story of a young woman ending a relationship with a young woman then developing a relationship with another young woman: herself. Klein's first book, The Commuters, was a fine debut. Second books aren’t necessarily as good. In this case, it's better.\" --Noel Alumit, FrontiersFelix Ketay, a twenty-five-year-old Los Angeles dyke, has her foundations shaken when she's ditched by her pomosexual girlfriend and then gay-bashed on the streets of West Hollywood.Felix's old-school lesbian aunt, Anna Lisa Hill, ran away from home in 1965 at age nineteen and ended up in Lilac Mines, a small town in California's Sierra Nevada foothills with a small but tight-knit butch/femme community.When Felix joins her aunt in Lilac Mines hoping to discover a place of respite, Anna Lisa proves stand-offish, so Felix devotes herself to investigating the town's one hundred-year-old mystery: the disappearance of sixteen-year-old Lilac Ambrose in the mine shafts that run beneath the mountain.Felix learns that finding an authentic history is never easy, but Lilac Mines — with its abandoned mines, unknowable secrets, and the occasional quirky-cute thrift store employee — might not be such a bad place to try.Cheryl Klein is a shameless Angeleno, quiet pescatarian, and shameful tabloid reader. She lives in Los Angeles where she is West Coast director of Poets & Writers, Inc.",
