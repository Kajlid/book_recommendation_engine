  "description": "Hi! I'm going on an airplane trip with my best friend. It's so exciting! First we go to the airport, and I get to ride through the X-ray machine. Whee! Then the plane takes off and we go tip and up and tip above the clouds. You'd be surprised at all the things there are to do on an airplane! Miss Mouse, the mischievous rag doll introduced in Miss Mouse's Day, is back in a high-flying adventure bursting with the warmth, humor, and bright illustrations that are Jan Ormerod's signature.",
