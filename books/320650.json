To her surprise, he also decides to hire her brother and his best friend, Hayden, whose arrogance overshadows the fact that he is one hundred percent her type. She loves the fast life. Unfortunately, that entails more than just cars. As she and Hayden spend more time together, she feels drawn to him the same way the drag strip calls to her. Hayden’s supposed to be off limits, and she’s holding on to secrets that will destroy either her relationship with her brother or her future. For six years, “The City That Never Sleeps” has been Hayden’s home. When the opportunity to oversee his own department, with his best friend at his side, is offered, he returns to his hometown. His one distraction? Grace Walters. His friend’s terms are crystal clear: his sister is a hard no. But her luscious curves, enticing body, and sincere personality aren’t so easily ignored. She’s no longer the kid he left behind when he went to college,but pursuing her might be the end of his longest friendship. Will they be able to resist the temptation?",
