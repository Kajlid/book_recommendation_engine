  "title": "UPGRADE",
  "description": "The year is 2058 and nobody ever leaves their home, automated delivery-bots bringing all their daily needs. That’s because life is now lived entirely online, making work and play more convenient than ever. And it just keeps getting better, through regular UPGRADES that optimize society right below your feet. Avery J. Mankin was a perfect citizen of this perfect world - a real Mainstreamer by any standard - but all that's about to change, for he was just wrongfully convicted of High Crimes against The System and the consequences are dire... Written by Louis Rosenberg, with artwork by Stan Timmons, this is PART TWO of “UPGRADE” - a graphic novel in three parts. \"Embrace!\"",
