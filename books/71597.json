With her maid as chaperone, they board the train heading South. After his father passes, his mother insists any marriage will have to wait the requisite year, which is proper for mourning. She hopes to send Heather home for the year, and to use the time to dissuade David from his foolish choice, especially since his mother has already handpicked his potential bride from a neighboring plantation.Heather longs to stay to wait out the year, and to begin teaching the slaves how to read and write, since she knows those accomplishments will be needed when slavery comes to an end.But she knows the South is no place for an abolitionist.Sensuality Level: Sensual",
