  "description": "Twelve-year-old Millie Moskowitz doesn’t know that her father has a “Mafia mistress” and an illegitimate son; she only knows that he sleeps elsewhere, carries a gun and comes and goes as he pleases. When Lee Moskowitz is at home, Millie is his personal foot rubber and back scratcher while her mother cooks his meals, washes dishes and irons his shirts. Seeking to escape her oppressive home life, Millie skips school to meet select neighborhood men for a soda in a delivery truck, a cigarette in a supermarket storeroom, or a ride on the school bus to an abandoned house. Millie is empowered by her misadventures, until she finds herself pregnant by a Black man twice her age. Later With Myself: The Misadventures of Millie Moskowitz chronicles Millie's midlife quest for peace and redemption, as she faces her childhood demons with honesty and humor.Show more Show less",
