  "description": "Life was bad enough when Lauren DarPayne hit puberty and sprouted a set of fangs, but now it’s hell. After almost killing her boyfriend Derik and turning him into a vampire, she quit college and moved from small town Louisiana all the way to Atlanta, Georgia to be a stripper at Wicked Intentions. It's good money, a great place to hide, and an easy meal ticket... well, at least until a psycho with some interesting non-human abilities starts eviscerating her coworkers. Now, due to her past ‘indiscretion’ with Derik, the governing body of all cryptid, the Abattoir, is giving her an ultimatum: play bait willingly, or by force.WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT. Contains Graphic Violence and Sexual Situations.",
