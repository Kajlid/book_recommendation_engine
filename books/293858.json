  "description": "Sugar Applebaum doesn't hate the idea of spending a quiet summer at Sideling Springs, a sleepy Jewish resort in West Virginia, with her mother (who she adores) and her sister (who she does not), but she's not exactly hyped about it. That is, until she crashes a staff party and meets Mara, the older, gorgeous, and acid-tongued dance instructor with very little patience for people with Sugar's amount of privilege and supposed heterosexuality. But Mara's dance partner, Tristan, is getting top surgery and can't perform, and she needs a way to replace him without anyone noticing. Guess who's the only volunteer?Learning to look, dress, and, especially, dance like a boy means a lot of time with Mara, listening to her, arguing with her...touching her, and suddenly Sugar's feeling things she thought were just in those sappy songs they have to dance to. But falling for a girl, especially one who doesn't particularly seem to like her, was not in Sugar's summer plans. What's a girl to do?SUGAR SUMMER is a lesbian retelling of the '80s classic DIRTY DANCING, like you've never seen it before.",
