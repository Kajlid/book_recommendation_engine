He's also left with psychic powers, a ghost following him around, and the unwanted knowledge that not everyone in the world is humanâ€”some are something other. In the midst of all this turmoil, it's the ghost, Lucas, who becomes his closest friend.But when Keith starts having prophetic dreams about horrible monsters hunting Others down, he can't remain uninvolved anymore.
