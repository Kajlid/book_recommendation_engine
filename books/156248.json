After her father's death, her mother remarries and moves far away, her boyfriend jilts her, and finally her roommate evicts her. Her prayers for help appear to be answered when she finds a new home and a circle of new Christian friends. Her new life leads her directly into the path of the one person she has despised and feared since their first encounter years ago. Her instinct is to run, but her new faith teaches her to forgive. Can she make peace with the past without risk to herself or her daughter?",
