And all of her attempts to get his attention haven’t worked. Except, there’s one thing she hasn’t tried.  In a daring move, she stages a situation where he must rescue her. Her ploy works, and she finally has the chance to show him that having a wife is just what he needs. But Greg is proving to be harder to impress than she thought and all her fancy meals, beautiful dresses, and seductive maneuvers haven’t worked.  Is there any way she can secure her place in his life or has she just lost her gamble?",
