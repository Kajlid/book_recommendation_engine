Yet, he barges in like a storm, leaving everyone mesmerized by his charms.Every evening I find him at my doorstep in the pretense of a silly promise he’s made to my son. And let’s not talk about my boy, Ray who believes Zach is some sort of a Prince and maybe he is. But not of my story.Until events lead me to accept Zach’s insane proposal of a contract marriage.He promises me everything. Care for my mom. A better future for my son. A loving group of family and friends.Except one thing. Love.And that’s okay. I have full faith, I can never fall for someone as spontaneous and impulsive as him.Yet, I do. Another stupid mistake to add in my long running list.I fall for his stupid jokes, his crazy habits and most of all for him. I fall in love with my husband and that’s one thing he didn’t promise me in our marriage vows.",
