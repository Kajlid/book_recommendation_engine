  "description": "Saving a life shouldn’t come with so many complications.Saving Marcus’s life should’ve qualified as a good deed. Except, that’s not why Kyra saves him. She’s pulled to the deed by something supernatural. But then Marcus sees Kyra’s hybrid dragon and she finds herself bound to protect him. A bond already causing tension between Kyra and her best friend, Sebastian. Only, Kyra will find it is not easy defying Death. Yet, she is determined―even at the cost of her own life.Bad things happen in the blink of an eye.Sebastian has built his life around his tarot cards, more so since taking refuge at Mystic’s Magical Carnival. Trying to include Kyra in that part of his life goes all wrong. Now Kyra’s interest in Marcus stands between Sebastian and Kyra, and places Kyra in emanate danger. Sebastian needs to make her see, needs to steer her away from Marcus, needs to save her from the consequences of her decisions before it’s too late. If he needs to, Sebastian will bare his most guarded secrets to protect her.~Slip through the portal and get lost in the extraordinary fantasy world known as the Mystic Carnival Collective. This is one within a group of short stories, novelettes, and novellas with one thing in common―a connection to the supernatural location, Mystic’s Carnival. Is it a carnival or a circus? Maybe it’s a melding of both.",
