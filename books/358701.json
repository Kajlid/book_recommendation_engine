  "description": "Returning from their ordeal in Japan, Aoi, Itsuki and Aya look forward to making love in their own bed, their own shower, and to getting back what passes for normal life for them. Aoi's dancing again, Itsuki is his usual possessive self, and Aya takes care of them all. Too bad things go horribly wrong, with a freak accident sending Aoi to the hospital. Aya and Itsuki try to take care of things, but it's tough to keep things going with their whole routine shattered. When Aoi gets out of the hospital, he's not sure if he'll ever be able to dance again. Aya and Itsuki are trying to make ends meet, working outside the home, and between that and physical therapy, Aoi is having a tough time. Can he find a way to heal and to keep his life, and his loves, in balance so they can get back to life as they know it?",
