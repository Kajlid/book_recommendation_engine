  "description": "Three dragons. One woman. A reverse harem fantasy that will leave you breathless and begging for more...   Dareena Sellis is a nobody. The orphaned daughter of a no-name farmer, she toils away as a serving girl at Hallowdale Inn, her only marriage prospects either shipping off to war, or pawing at her skirts with their grubby, gnarled hands.  But fate takes a strange turn the day a dragon huntress comes to town. Suddenly, Dareena is swept off to Dragon’s Keep, trading in her raggedy dresses for silken gowns, her closet-sized room for feather pillows and spacious gardens, and her miserable suitor for three very handsome, very virile dragon princes.  For Dareena is not a nobody. She is the Dragon’s Gift—the one woman chosen by the gods every century to bear children for the future king of Dragonfell.  Despite her pre-ordained path, Dareena’s fate is far from certain. The crown has not given birth to more than one son in nearly a thousand years, and the line of succession is far from clear. Neither of the princes are willing to cede Dareena to the other, and yet she must choose. For the enemy is knocking on Dragonfell’s door, and Dareena’s decision could either mean the kingdom’s salvation…  …or annihilation.  Don’t deny yourself the pleasure of this scorching hot reverse harem romance. Scroll up and start reading today!  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a TRUE reverse harem romance, NOT a love triangle. Expect to see danger, intrigue, hot sex, strong language, and fire-breathing dragons between the pages of this book. For 18+ readers. You have been warned!",
