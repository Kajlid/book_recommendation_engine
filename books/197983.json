  "description": "Elliot Strand isn't a lawyer... yet. He's just a lowly paralegal on an unexpected flight to Wyoming. Oil has been discovered in the wild, beautiful country out near the Bighorns, and Elliot's bosses desperately need him to close the billion-dollar deal on its sale—a task that should be as simple as collecting a signature. Or it would be if it weren’t for Jared Carter, the stubborn, ruggedly handsome cowboy who refuses to sign away his land.Tensions run high as Elliot tries to convince Jared to sell. The rancher is more than his ultra-masculine exterior led Elliot to believe at first glance, sensitive and beautiful in the most unexpected of ways—and undeniably attracted to Elliot. Elliot struggles to ignore the building heat between them, the strange pull that keeps drawing them together despite mounting pressures. When they give in to their deepest temptations and embark on a passionate, physical affair, will oil and money drive them apart?",
