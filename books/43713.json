  "description": "Lexi Morgan has always had The Touch; the ability to pick up an object and 'see' its past. Doomed to wearing protective gloves at all times, she learned to accept it as equal parts gift and curse. When her brother in law Neil disappears, she'd rather tell her sister to celebrate than try to help find the jerk. But after her young niece vanishes as well, it's time to put her gift to good use and help track her down, especially when handsome Detective Gabriel Ryan takes over the case. When the investigation leads them to the restless spirits of long dead children, they must work together to keep history from repeating itself before it's too late.",
