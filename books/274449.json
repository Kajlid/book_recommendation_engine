  "title": "Step Mom",
  "description": "'Some women are forbidden, others wantonly available. I draw little distinction between the two. My neglectful father recently got married... again... and is feeling sentimental. So I booked myself into the hotel that we'll be rendezvousing at; myself, him and my new stepmom, who my father is very eager for me to meet. Personally, I'd rather shit in my hand and clap, but the old man lets me hang on to his credit card and so I am bound to his will. But while I wait for the new couple to arrive, I amuse myself by feasting my eyes on the countless women strolling about the hotel floors, sprawling beneath the sun by the poolside, wearing practically nothing and basically daring me to have them. And I will, every single one that catches my eye... They will each get a turn to see the inside of my hotel room. This should be fun!'This book is no longer available for purchase.",
