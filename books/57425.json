  "title": "Alan Turing: The Enigma of Intelligence",
  "description": "The official book behind the film, The Imitation Game , this is a dramatic portrayal of the life and work of Alan Turing, one of Britain's most extraordinary unsung heroes, and one of the world's greatest innovators. This is the official story that has inspired the British film, The Imitation Game, a nail-biting race against time following Alan Turing, the pioneer of modern-day computing and credited with cracking the German Enigma code, and his brilliant team at Britain's top-secret code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II. Turing, whose contributions and genius significantly shortened the war, saving thousands of lives, was the eventual victim of an unenlightened British establishment, but his work and legacy live on. Prime Minister Gordon Brown released a statement of apology in 2009 on behalf of the British government for the \"appalling\" treatment of Turing.",
