  "description": "Lachlan Downy was a lover, not a fighter.  Okay, he wouldn't lie, he was a fighter, too. But nobody had to know that. Especially not Memphis Tennessee Conner and her stuffy attitude when it came to cops and ‘men like him.’  Memphis knew cops. Her daddy was a cop. He was also the president of a motorcycle club. Needless to say, he’s about as alpha as they come, and she’s tired of overbearing men who think they know how to run her life better than she does.  So when Downy comes into her life running his smooth talking mouth, she realizes that she’ll have to stand strong against his pretty words and promises to give her what she needs.  Downy is determined, though.  He’s the hostage negotiator for KPD SWAT, and he’s never met a person, man or woman, he couldn't talk around into his way of thinking.  Although, Memphis is about to show him just how much he miscalculated.  Seems Downy may not be as smooth as he thought, and Memphis is just the girl to show him the error of his ways.",
