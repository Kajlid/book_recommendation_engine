  "description": "I need to save the tiger shifter before it’s too late-- but I have my own fires to jump through.  Every burn on his paws, every poke and prod from his cruel masters, I feel as if it were my own. I also feel his anger and his thirst for blood. He’s even more of a predator than Hunter or Razvan. There’s a danger about this tiger shifter I’ve never experienced before. But the road leading to his rescue takes a detour to my past. I’ve thought about my siblings every day since I walked away from that place, and the monsters I left them with. They need to know I haven’t abandoned them, that I’m doing everything I can to get them out. Even if it means facing her. If it weren’t for the three amazing men in my life, I wouldn’t have a single shred of hope of facing either of these obstacles. I can only hope their love is enough to get me through it all. Step right up. The ride’s not over yet. Jump through Fire is the fourth installment in the Harem of Freaks series, which should be read in order. Contains violence, M/M, and M/F sexual content.",
