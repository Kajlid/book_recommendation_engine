  "description": "Rachel Ashby thought she had it all. She was in the midst of blending her family with her fiance, and mere weeks away from her wedding. After a lifetime of disappointment, everything was finally falling in place.That is, until she was killed.Cast into the afterlife, Rachel struggles to hold on to the parts of her life she was ripped away from. As she tries to remain near the people she cherished, the layers of her life are peeled back. Rachel is suddenly faced with the incriminating evidence of her imperfections. Even more, she's exposed to the glaring human side of those she loves the most. Suddenly, it's unclear what hurts the most - the fact that she's dead, or the fact that her loved ones aren't as innocent as she thought. Crissi Langwell has written a novel of love and loss in a portrait of one woman's journey, as well as the journey of those she left behind. The story offers a beautiful yet somber glimpse into the mystical world of spirits, and the heartache and healing in the world of the living.",
