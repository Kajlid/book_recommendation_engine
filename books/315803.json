  "description": "2nd place Finalist in BBNYA 2022, this queer dark fantasy Norse myth retelling is perfect for fans of Circe, The Witch's Heart, and The Silence of the Girls.Perhaps you know the myths.Furious, benevolent Gods.A tree that binds nine realms.A hammer stronger than any weapon.And someday, the end of everything.But few have heard of me.Looking back, it’s easy to know what choices I might have made differently. At least it feels that way. I might have given up on my title. Told my father he was useless, king of Gods or no, and left Asgard. Made a life somewhere else.Maybe I would never have let Loki cross my path. Never have fallen in love.But there’s no going back.We were happy once.And the price for that happiness was the end of everything.",
