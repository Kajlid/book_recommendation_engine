She may have trained with Robin Hood, but she's going to need to steal more than a key to escape Gwenevere's trap to take back Excalibur. And even if Rexi manages to get free, she still needs to reclaim her storyland from Morte's wicked plotting.It's not over until the last spot of ink dries.Dorothea and Rexi won't give up their happily ever afters without a fight. But with the villains of Story scripting their triumph, does this spell The End for Dorothea and Rexi?",
