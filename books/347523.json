  "description": "The White Gryphon is Skandranon, the former Black Gryphon, who has returned to his natural plumage now that the time of war is at an end. He has taken his people, gryphons and human allies alike, to the coast where they have built an eyrie city in the cliffside. But though the troubles from without have pretty much ceased, wherever there are communities of people, there will be mavericks and rogues with agendas of their own. In exiling one such, a doctor using his patients for his own ends, Skandranon and White Gryphon's ruling council begin a sequence of events that threatens the future of their entire city.",
