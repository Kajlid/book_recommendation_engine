  "description": "\"If he's gross, I'm bailing.\" That's what I said to my supposed best friend when she asked me to take her place. A blind date, she said. What harm could it do? He was charming. Beautiful. God's finest creation. He wined me and dined me. Made me do things I'd never before dreamt of in the bedroom. It was perfect. Dangerous. Arousing. But Jenny didn’t tell me the full story. She didn’t tell me about the debt she owed. And now Quinn Cane wants his money's worth, and he’s going to make me pay whatever way he can.  “A debt needs to be paid.” The woman who came to meet me didn’t owe me money. I could tell by her innocent eyes. Still, the debt will be paid either way. She was something to play with and use as I saw fit, but something about Emily Brooks made me want to keep her. So she became my dirty girl. Pure. Innocent. Mine. Then she whispered my damned name and invaded my world, changing its reasoning. She wasn’t meant to break the rules. But she rolled my dice and won.  Shame. Forgiveness. Dark. Erotic. Romance.  This book is intended for mature audiences. 18+ only.",
