  "description": "Goodbye, Padania. Parallel text e-book. English and Italian. Translator: Eva Bruno. Author: Bryan Murphy. 98 pages. Price €1.99 from: http://www.bryanmurphy.eu/ebooks.aspSet in an imaginary future independent country carved out of Northern Italy, “Goodbye, Padania” is the story of a young woman’s attempt to go beyond the role that fate has apparently designed for her: contract killer. Against the background of the death agonies of a pariah state, Daria Rigoletti transforms herself first into a people-smuggler and then into a cult leader, but circumstances combine against her attempts to break free of violence. As well as being entertaining in itself, this parallel text edition aims to provide material for learners and teachers of English, Italian and translation.",
