  "description": "Every life has its secrets, but some secrets only the dead can tell... When Paul and his wife Donna move to the community of Kingston Corners they are hoping for some peace and quiet, but soon after starting his new job as custodian at The Church Of The Resurrection, he notices something isn't quite right about the place. Apparitions move through the halls, a girl's anklet appears and reappears, mysterious messages are scrawled on chalkboards, and as Paul comes to realize a restless spirit haunts the church, he finds himself on the brink of losing both his wife and sanity. But once started on the trail of mystery, there is no turning back as the tale of a long missing young girl unfolds and the horrible truth of what happened to her threatens to tear his whole world apart.",
