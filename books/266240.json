  "description": "A wolf with no claim. A disgrace to the wolves’ society. Never fit to be a mate for any wolf… Trash.  Elodie Masters knows she is too weak to escape her life as a pack slave, a wolf with no claim and overall blight to the wolves’ precious society. When her pack is attacked, Elodie should have run, but instead she is kept by the Alpha Brothers. Ruthless. Cruel. Heartless brothers…or at least that’s what everyone says about them. And they were right. The brothers don’t want her as a mate; they claim she is too weak to be anything…but they won’t let her go. Yet sometimes strength hides in the weak, and you don’t see it coming until it literally bites you back.  Dark RH Romance 18+ WARNING: Contains dark themes not for the faint of heart.",
