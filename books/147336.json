  "description": "Mike Forester is a writer, traveler and free spirit from New York. Packing his bags and moving across the ocean for the summer sounds like just the thing to get his creative juices flowing. Ana Rhode is an Austrian tour guide and waitress, unsure of where she is heading. Her only certainty is her dislike for American men. He signs up for her tour and is convinced that the blonde fur ball is just what he needs to make him feel more at home. She shows him the ropes of her city and is certain that the infuriating man from overseas has a screw loose. When his research gives way to chasing her sinfully pink lips, Mike knows he's in trouble. Ana just knows that he is trouble. She is lost in time while he gets lost in place. Can she learn to trust the handsome American? Is it worth his efforts, or will their culture shock turn into a culture clash?",
