  "description": "You promised you could always find me…Zane’s death lingers like a bad dream. I’ve been searching for months, but I can’t find him in the void. The jerk vampire died on me just as things were getting nice and complicated between us.Meanwhile, true nightmares have been terrorizing the city. Death magic is ripping tears in reality, destroying my home, and threatening to swallow the world in darkness. If my necromancy powers hadn’t been stolen by an overly ambitious vitamin villain, I’d be able to tackle the void tears with my classic Wilde flair.That is, if I could focus on saving the city from ruin.I’m tangled up in hurt and heartache. Not just for my lost vampire, but for the protective and seductive incubus waiting in the wings.With the city on the verge of chaos, my heart in shambles, and my powers stolen, I have to somehow keep my world from spiraling out of control.But first? I’m saving my vampire.\nSave the Vampire is the last book in the trilogy that contains intrusive death, fuzzy feelings about vampires, insane pining for an incubus, perfectly timed F bombs and a vaguely magical fish named Kevin.",
