  "title": "Razor",
  "description": "Razor moved from the Memphis RTMC chapter to Chattanooga to set up and manage a series of laundromats, because the local chapter needs more ways to legitimize their illegal income. He’s gay, but the Chattanooga chapter has accepted gay couples into their social circle, so he hopes they can accept him.Matty is about to graduate college, and he’s in the market for a Daddy. He walks into the RTMC bar with two of his girlfriends, and a huge hulk of a man rescues him from some rednecks. He recognizes the bouncer for the leather daddy he is, and sparks fly between them.Most of the MC is prepared to accept Razor as a gay brother, but they know they’ll have to figure things out as they happen once Razor is serious about someone. Will his ‘boy’ be an ol’lady? And can all the ol’lady rules really apply to a man?Razor is a Raven, Matty is human. The RTMC fits into the local supernatural hierarchy in a myriad of ways, and Razor is already friends with Abbott and Spence. But a supernatural storm is about to blindside the club, and their personal ties to The Dragon King and Master Vampire won’t be enough to help.This title can be read as a stand-alone.Warning: Male-male sexual practices are front and center in this book, not to mention it’s kinky as your grandmother’s old phone cord. Razor and Matty are heavy on the D/s, the S&M, and the B&D. Since some reviewers have been surprised by this, it seems necessary to also warn that sometimes bikers solve problems with their fists, and there’s lots of sexy fun in the clubhouse with women who hang around because they want to be there, and who can leave anytime they want.",
