  "description": "When Samantha’s husband doesn’t make the flight for their family’s Belizean jungle vacation, she’s not entirely disappointed. With their divorce all but certain, she could use an adventure with some romance on the side. After her daughter disappears on a trip through an underworld cave, Samantha discovers that dealing with an escaped murderer bent on sacrificing a maiden to the Mayan rain god may bring more danger than she bargained for. Trapped during a hurricane in the midst of a jungle teemingwith the warriors of an ancient tribe, and tracked by the most dangerous gang in the world, Samantha must find the strength to become the person she’d always hoped to be—to save her family—or die trying.",
