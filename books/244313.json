  "description": "A story written from the heartShe Came From Heaven is anything but a cute little doggie book. Rather, it is a kaleidoscope filled with wonderful detailed descriptions of characters, settings and situations that lure the reader into a crisis they never saw coming. The journey back from the frontier of desperation often moved me to tears. The further I got into the story, the more emotion was being poured out. She Came From Heaven has great elements of transition and foreshadowing that build drama and intrigue to the last page.Writer/Editor - Ginny De Mille\"The dog's identity remained unknown, untraceable.
