  "description": "Return to the Scottish Highlands in the latest Kilts and Quilts novel from the author of The Accidental Scot— The quilting ladies of the Scottish village of Gandiegow are known to piece together more than just fabric . . .  Life isn’t going as planned and Sadie Middleton is rethinking her whole future. Thankfully one thing is staying the same: she’s able to share her love of quilting with her grandmother Gigi. The two of them enter a contest and win an all-expenses-paid trip to the Kilts and Quilts retreat in the Scottish Highlands. But their victory turns hollow when Gigi passes away before they can go. Sadie is grief-stricken, but her brother convinces her to take the trip to Gandiegow anyway.   There she meets a charming circle of quilters who remind her of her grandmother—and Ross Armstrong, a handsome fisherman who brings a smile to her face. Newly single, Ross intends to enjoy his freedom. That plan goes awry as he comes to know Sadie—and a surprising spark is lit. Too bad some well-meaning folks want to protect Ross from getting hurt again and are determined to keep him and the American lass apart. . . .",
