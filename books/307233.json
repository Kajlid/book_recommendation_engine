  "description": "Samantha's roommate is getting married, and the impending nuptials will leave her without a home as her best friend starts a new life… without her. Okay, maybe she’s being a little dramatic. Their friendship isn’t over, but Sam definitely has to find a new place to stay. Luckily for her, her cousin has a sweet loft close to campus. Not so lucky for her, Sam’s cousin already has a roomie, a really hot one, and he’s teaching the one class she’s failing.Gavin’s pretty happy with his living situation. His roommate is low key, and he’s pretty much got the run of the loft, and for minimal rent. But when his roommate lets his cousin stay with them, it puts a definite damper on the bachelor pad vibe. For one thing, Cousin Sam is not the dude Gavin was expecting. For another, he can’t shake his attraction to her, an attraction he definitely shouldn’t have for his student.Maybe he can just avoid her until the semester is over. Except, their attraction is unavoidable.",
