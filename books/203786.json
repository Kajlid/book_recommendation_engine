  "description": "Friends to lovers?\n  Anthony James Bainbridge IV has everything a millionaire could want – a penthouse apartment, a Maserati and an up and coming tech company he founded with his three best friends. But the one thing he doesn’t have is the love of his life. Charlotte Wingate’s been his friend since they were five and now she’s in charge of his HR department.  Beautiful and popular, Charlotte always belonged with the cool crowd while Tony hung with the nerds. She’s out of his league, but even if he wanted to ask her out, she’s his employee and therefore off-limits. But when Charlotte suddenly makes it clear she doesn’t want to be off-limits, he has to decide whether to go all in, knowing he might lose everything.",
