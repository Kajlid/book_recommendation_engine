  "description": "Sequel to Quinn's Need Book 3 of the Whispering Pines Ranch Novels Ty Callahan knew Quinn Taylor was special the moment he first laid eyes on him. When the angry and heartbroken cowboy finally opens up, Ty sees the real man inside, and for the first time in years, Ty is ready to love again. There's only one problem: Lorcan James. Although Lorcan has owned a piece of Quinn's heart for some time, Ty is convinced he is the better man for Quinn and will stop at nothing to prove it. Then Blake Henderson, a strong, dominant cowboy, strolls confidently into Ty's life, offering an outlet for Ty's anger, a chance to heal, and an option for his torn affections. Can Ty look beyond his feelings of rage and betrayal and find true peace, or will his obsession destroy them all?",
