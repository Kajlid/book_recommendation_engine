  "description": "Through the shattered looking glassThis is the story of my chipped and broken childhood which would lay the foundation for the woman I would one day become. Thirty-five years have passed since my earliest memories, some distorted by fear others engraved in stark relief with no sense of distance between now and then, but all buried somewhere in memory that even now, as an adult, I cannot escape from.This is my beginning, but it was not my end.",
