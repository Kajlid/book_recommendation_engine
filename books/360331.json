  "description": "Somewhere in this great nation of ours is Project Skin Horse, an overworked, underfunded secret agency dedicated, to assisting America's nonhuman citizens. The receptionist is a clockwork robot, the project head is a swarm of bees, the field team consists of Sweetheart the talking dog and her faithful zombie Unity, and Dr. Tip Wilkin, the lone human staffer, feels he can only do his job properly in high heels. They're the shadow government. They're here to help. Please go easy on them.",
