  "description": "Jean, Michael and Steph are three reluctant loners who are just getting by. Damaged and fearful of life, they cannot survive alone for much longer. A mixture of deceit, good luck and misfortune draws them together to Walden Manor, a secluded and gracious country house that promises sanctuary and freedom from impending destitution.   Out of an invented past they shape a beautiful present, full of hope and happiness. And, beguiled by the gentle passing of time itself, all three of them, for the first time in their lives, lose their dread of the future.If their sense of safety is built on a delusion, does it matter?  When the idyll is threatened, Jean, Michael and Steph discover that because their lives are now worth living they are now also worth preserving, although at appalling cost.",
