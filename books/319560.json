  "title": "For the Soul",
  "description": "Memories and fiction fill this collection with humor, heartwarming compassion, and spine-tingling fright from the author's own experiences and an imagination she can barely control. Quilts, children, and dogs have always played a large part in the author's life. Therefore, it is not surprising to find stories of warm quilts wrapped around her tales or tails. A trait the reader discovers in Barbara's writing is that much like life, nothing within the covers of this book will be what one expects.",
