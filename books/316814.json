  "description": "Come closer.At the sound of her familiar voice, my heart thuds in my chest. She speaks as she always does, with words only I can hear, but as much as I try to convince myself otherwise, I know I’m not imagining it. She’s inside the crumbling shell, just waiting, biding her time. “No!”Come closer, she repeats.As desire overrides the urge to run, I realise I want to see her. “Stay away from me.”I mean you no harm, Lucas.“I don’t trust you, Mina.”",
