  "description": "With one foot in the grave, and the other between two different worlds, Hannah Porter is a lesson in survival. The only latent in a clan full of wolves required a fierce approach to life. After an unrelenting existence, one filled with both struggles and triumphs, Hannah assumed she had conquered it all. But the reaper is knocking on her door, and only one man has the power to save her.  Elijah Drake has enemies at the gates, a silent predator stalking his property, unknown to any detection. As king, he must keep his eyes on his people and on his own land, a splitting of concentration that could cost him, because the one that could destroy it all, was the human woman he never saw coming.",
