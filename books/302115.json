  "description": "It’s a pathetic tale as old as time. Zach, the hefty offensive lineman for Juniper High School’s football team is in love with the beautiful head cheerleader. Jill is completely out of his league, there’s no way she could ever want him back…oh, and she’s his sister’s best friend. But one magical night in the back row of the bus changes everything when Jill asks Zach to help her explore a budding need for intimacy…and he’s the only one she trusts enough to help. What else is a big man to do when the incredible girl he’s loved since childhood offers her lips…and so much more? But is winning Jill’s love really so far-fetched? Or has Zach had it all along…",
