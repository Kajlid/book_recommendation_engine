  "description": "\"Evil is... A living spiritual being, perverted and perverting. One of the greatest needs is defense from the evil which is called the devil.\" —Pope Paul VIMichelle Smith was five years old when her mother offered her up to a cult of devil worshippers—to be used demonically to raise Satan himself. Twenty-two years later, on a psychiatrist's couch, she relived the long-buried horrors inflicted upon her, as her childhood agonies came screaming forth in terrifying detail.With the help of her Bishop, Michelle brought her hideous story to the Vatican—Satanic witches chanting to summon the Devil, wounds appearing on her skin, human and animal sacrifices. Now the full story, with vivid photographs, records Michelle's victory—a child's survival in the face of sheer madness.",
