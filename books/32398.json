  "description": "For children of all ages Halloween is the only holiday that even comes close to Christmas as being eagerly looked forward to, and truly loved. It's a wonderful, magical, and even scary time of the year. People wear costumes, go to parties, watch horror movies in the dark and of course there's also the promise of FREE CANDY.On the afternoon of October 31st, across the quiet suburbs and throughout the busy city of Albuquerque New Mexico, children are happily putting on their costumes and carefully planning out the routes to make the most of All Hallows Eve- knowing it's the one night of the year when the rules of begging and not taking candy from strangers are at least temporarily suspended.In a world where perverts seem to be hiding on every street and in every neighborhood, parents are always cautious when it comes to the safety of their beloved children. But by the time night falls and twilight dies they will learn there are much worse things to worry about- Much, much worse.Zombies of All Hallows Evil goes where few have dared imagine. It's an epic tale of horror, over 160,000 words in length, that explores what happens when people appearing as zombies do not come seeking sugary treats but in search of blood, death, and violent unreasoning madness. Happy Halloween!",
