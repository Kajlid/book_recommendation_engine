Now, living in an isolation of her own making, she's slipping away from everything and everyone she once loved. She can't piece the remnants of who she was back together with who she is now.

Now he wants to man up and make it right.Can Ghost stitch Shelly back together again when all he's ever really been good at is ripping things apart?**Mature Audiences Only (18+)****Language, Sexual Content, Graphic Violence, and Strong themes such as sexual assault.**",
