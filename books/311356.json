  "description": "Garrison Love sucks! There I said it. I've never looked for it, nor do I want it. All it seems to do is cause open wounds. I already suffer from the guilt of a horrific accident. I won't let love suck me down the rabbit hole. But Murphy's Law is a diva out to destroy my life. Someone sees me for more than just a one and done and though I've pushed men away for years, he's refreshing. But remember that diva I told you about, she's sort of a b**** too. Yeah, love more than sucks but since I can't use the words I want, I'll just stick to that because the man I want has a connection with me, no one knows about. Lawson I met a man. Sure he's a little detached and cynical. Though, try telling my heart he's all wrong for me. I've been over it with this particular traitorous part of my body. And, I do the one thing I never do with my hook-ups. I give him a way to reach me. But it's moreâ€”I almost beg him to call me after my next deployment. Oh, yeah, forgot to mention, I'm in the military and am shipping out. I want him to be my welcoming party, when I come home, yet, when I unravel every complicated part of Garrison Fisher, I find more and more I should run from. But I can't. He's broken, but after my time in the military, I'm broken too. Can we fix one another and heal the wounds that may very well tear us apart?",
