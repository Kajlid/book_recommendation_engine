My first evening in London feels like kismet when I bump into a charming, book-loving Englishman, and by the end of the night, he’s making me see stars. I’m floating when we make plans to meet again.Then fate decides to pull a fast one on me. Turns out my smoldering new lover is my red-hot competition, and we’re vying for the same promotion at the elite auction house I crossed an ocean for. If that’s not enough, the hottie and I are forced to work together on a brand new collection. Every. Single. Tempting. Day.  What's an American woman in London to do? Staying far, far away would be the safe choice, especially when I learn about his past and how it mirrors mine. But I don’t always play it safe with my heart… Contents Include: A grumpy/sunshine office romance, secret gardens, knee-weakening kisses by the river and a hero who loves books.",
