Starting new jobs, finding new loves, leaving old love behind and getting used to the lives they've chosen. But these twenty-somethings will soon realize their plans for the future don't come with a map, and they'll have to make some tough decisions that might stay with them forever--or take them down for good.Welcome to the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts where a group of young professionals and students are working to get their lives on track. They're ambitious, to say the least, but their foray into \"real\" adulthood is filled with hook ups, heart break, backstabbing and more bad decisions than they'd ever thought they'd make. In this Novella Series, J.D. Leon takes you into the world of life after college, for most of us anyway. It's not what you thought it'd be. You're working a lot harder and you're making a lot less. But, just maybe, if you stick with it long enough you'll find yourself in that place Over The Rainbow.",
