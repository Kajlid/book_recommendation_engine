Years ago, Noah Sinclair promised his dying mother that he’d stay strong and work hard for his younger brothers and sisters. Even with the Sinclairs’ newfound wealth, Noah has never steered from that blue-collar drive. His siblings think it’s time—with the gift of a Cancún vacation. To Noah, being forced to relax isn’t bliss. It’s a chore. Especially under the watch of a beautiful family friend enlisted to make sure every laptop under the sun stays closed.All Andie has to do is convince a handsome billionaire to take a deep breath? It should be a dream for the bohemian travel writer. If Noah—a workhorse so resistant to change—weren’t spoiling for a fight. But no matter how hard Noah pushes her away, Andie is pushing back. She promised she’d teach Noah to embrace every pleasure in life. It’s a promise she made to herself once, too.What begins as a battle of wills becomes a chance for Noah and Andie to open their hearts and share their fears. Night after intimate night. It’s the last thing they expected from Cancún, and it’s what they need the most. Even if it isn’t supposed to be forever.",
