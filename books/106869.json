They shoot and kill the highest bidder, a professor who has recognized the female figure carved in the stone as Chaucer’s Wife of Bath. The masked would-be thieves flee, leaving the stone behind.Peter Diamond and his team are assigned to investigate, and the stone is moved into Diamond’s office so he can research its origins.
