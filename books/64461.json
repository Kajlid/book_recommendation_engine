  "description": "Tanaka Manabu is a geeky student. One day on the way to school he meets a girl carrying a bloody bat. That girl is Ryuuzaki Reina, leader of the school's female delinquents. It's love at first sight. A gag manga (with a combination of 4-koma and normal page) about having a yankee dere-dere girlfriend.Note: In the title of this series, \"yandere\" isn't referring to this term, but instead it combines \"yankee\" + \"dere-dere\".Yandere Kanojo comes out in two editions. One is the \"magazine version\", Yandere Kanojo (Joker); and the other one is the \"online version\", Yandere Kanojo (Online). Both stories follow the same storyline, characters, and concepts; however, each version shows different events while not contradicting the other.",
