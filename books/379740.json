  "title": "John Brown",
  "description": "A moving cultural biography of abolitionist martyr John Brown, by one of the most important African-American intellectuals of the twentieth century.In the history of slavery and its legacy, John Brown looms large as a hero whose deeds partly precipitated the Civil War. As Frederick Douglass wrote: \"When John Brown stretched forth his arm ... the clash of arms was at hand.\" DuBois's biography brings Brown stirringly to life and is a neglected classic.",
