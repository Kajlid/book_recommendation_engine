  "description": "As you probably know, in the winter Moomins always sleep, like dormice, from November to April, when the warm weather starts again. But one year something extraordinary happened to Moomintroll; he woke up and found he couldn't go back to sleep again. All the clocks had stopped ages ago, and a fine coat of dust covered everything ... There was nothing to eat and no one to talk to at home, so he went out - straight into the first snowdrift he had ever seen. The valley wasn't green any longer, it was white.",
