  "title": "Forest Song: Finding Home",
  "description": "The story of Judy Baumann s struggle to escape to her true home in the woods and to grow into her power there. A cast of magical characters, including a witch, the witch s consort, a family of fairies, an ancient oak, and a bevy of animals each help her in this enterprise. We lived just at the edge of the frontier, as Mama called it, at the border of civilization. According to her the woods beyond our field was a lawless place, full of perils far worse than I could imagine, and so she made me promise to stay in our back yard or, if I was with my brother or an adult, the field beyond. But never did she allow me near the woods. She worried about the forest and other dangers too, man dangers. That's what she called them. Man dangers. The story, situated between Germany and Poland, begins in 1929 and ends in 1933 when Judy becomes a woman.",
