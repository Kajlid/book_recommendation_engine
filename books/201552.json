Romantic sparks fly when she gets to know him and finds there’s way more to the handsome athlete than meets the eye. As their romance blossoms, they struggle with relationship boundaries, Sara’s insecurities, and the fact that Philip’s injury could very well derail a promising football career. But will she lose him and her dreams of a future together if he returns to the game to reclaim his position on the field?
