  "description": "A TYRANNY OF GOD is a story about obsession and the triumph of love over the ruthless machinations of fate.  On a stormy night in October 1943, a small frightened boy flees the Gestapo as they round up the Jews of the Roman ghetto.  Plucked from the dragnet by an aged priest and his two perverse assistants, the child is sheltered in the rectory of a nearby church where a feeble-minded scullery maid and six slobbering mastiffs become his new family. When the war ends in 1945, he enters the seminary and becomes a priest.  Newly minted Father Adamo Di Domenico is a conflicted individual who constantly finds fault with both himself and his adopted religion as he struggles with the hypocrisy and injustices that surround him and the contradictions in his own life. For criticizing the Church in print, he is summoned before a Vatican tribunal and banished from his native Rome to a parish in the far reaches of Canada. Here he begins a slide into madness, engaging in an erotic relationship with a young nun and descending deeper and deeper into a well of guilt and despair.  While delivering a lecture on the Lost Jewish Library of Rome, he is inadvertently reunited with his only sister thought to have perished at Auschwitz. But their meeting comes with a curse. The father they never knew has died and left the siblings an inheritance so controversial and morally compromising that the Church will do anything, even murder one of its own sons, to obtain it.",
