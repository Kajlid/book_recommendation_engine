  "description": "Freshly jobless and girlfriendless, terminally in love with their best friend's wife, Sylvie has hit rock bottom. Where's an oldschool dyke in a newschool world to turn except toward the pastâ€”the bars, the protest scenes, the arms of volatile exes. But when the past has been gutted by neoliberalism, when the bars are closing and the butches of today aren't like the butches of nostalgic memory, what's left?With nothing but vague words from an ex, Sylvie sets off to find themself at thirty-four. On a drugs-and-depression-fueled whirlwind bender through Obama-era New York, they grapple with the echoes of the past and the incomprehensibility of the future, the excesses and violence of capitalism and the ongoing gentrification of the city they love. letter from a high femme (to every butch they've ever loved) is 'a stone butch blues for the modern age': a butch-femme statement of 'I am here', an intimate exploration of trauma and a wild, sexy, at times frightening adventure through a land of maybe-could-have-been.",
