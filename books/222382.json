  "description": "A Chicklit Christmas NovellaWhen Zara’s boyfriend can’t come home to Sydney from New York for Christmas she decides to go to him instead. Sure, the ticket costs a bomb, and her overbearing family thinks it is a bad idea, but that’s what you do for love right? Or so she tells the tall and hunky ex-basketball star, Kyle who is squeezed into the plane seat beside her.But when a blizzard hits and she finds herself snowed-in in Denver a few things become clear – her boyfriend isn’t that heartbroken about her absence, the airport doesn’t seem like a very festive place to spend the holiday and there aren’t anywhere near enough pumpkin spiced lattes to fix the situation.So, when Kyle offers to take her to stay at his buddy’s empty house, she decides to take a chance and make the best of her first white Christmas. What she hadn’t banked on was Kyle’s ex and a reality television crew crashing the Christmas party. If you like fun and flirty heroes, ugly sweaters, snow covered mountains and sugar cookies, you’ll enjoy reading Snowbound these holidays.",
