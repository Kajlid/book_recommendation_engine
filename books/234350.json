  "description": "The Story Continues...Joseph F. Girzone has woven another magical story, a modern-day parable, in Joshua and the Children, which gracefully continues the teachings and inspirations from his previous bestseller, Joshua. A stronger Joshua arrives in a deceptively ordinary village only to witness the doings of unscrupulous leaders and violent people. The children are the first to recognize that something is quite different about this stranger who has come seemingly from nowhere. It is through the villagers' children that Joshua is able to restore a sense of peacefulness and honesty. \"A new day had dawned, a new spirit spread throughout the land, and it all seemed to have happened because of the simple, unassuming goodness of one gentle stranger who knew only how to love.\"",
