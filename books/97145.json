  "description": "Scott Spectrum, Head Script Writer, Science Fiction Channel, is being haunted by a ghost giraffe called Jim. Scott thinks he is the man who has everything - high speed Internet connection, hitech armchair, alien shaped slipper, a beautiful wife called Continence...But according to Jim, Scott's days are numbered. Jim is on a mission to save Scott from certain death by sexual repression. He hasn't touched Continence for years and she's left furiously polishing the sideboard, dreaming of black stallions. To save himself, Scott must perform every sex act in the lovemaker's lexicon. Jim Giraffe knows all about sex. He also love pizza and beer and breath that smells of tree tops. The prudish Scott is at first shocked by his perverted foul-mouthed yellow and blue saviour. But he accepts Jim's help and comes to see him as his best friend. Little does he realise that the ghost giraffe has his own agenda and that his suburban idyll is about to be turned upside down.",
