  "title": "A Night Without Stars",
  "description": "The planet is isolated from the rest of the universe, unable to seek help as it's targeted by hostile aliens. Bienvenido's ruling authorities have slowly responded to this gradual infiltration. But they have no idea that a highly organized invasion is now underway, designed to wipe out all human life on the planet. All factions must work together to survive. But due to prejudice against enhanced 'Eliter' humans, and crippling technophobia, the parochial government won't collaborate. Kysandra, known as the Warrior Angel, heads up the Eliter resistance. With their enhanced capabilities and technological know-how, they could avert disaster. But only if the authorities stop hunting them at every turn. Then, as both resistance and government are caught in a desperate race to save lives, the planet receives an unexpected visitor. As events escalate, petty power-plays, politics and age-old prejudices may prove fatal. And as the more sophisticated hostiles can hijack a human body, humanity is undermined by spies within - wearing the faces of family and friends. Death will also fall from the skies, once the full invasion begins. Desperate times call for desperate measures or humanity on Bienvenido will not survive.",
