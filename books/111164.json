  "title": "Good as Dead",
  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Nina Belmonte knows her way around death; as the daughter of wolf witches lost in a magical catastrophe when she was just a baby, she grew up used to fighting on her own, tooth and claw. But her new next-door neighbor is something she’s never met, something that shouldn't exist. He’s a vampire; vicious, cunning, and determined to hunt her down and suck her dry. Nina knows she can’t beat him alone, but the only person willing to believe her is Gideon, a young renegade agent as mysterious as the magictech organization he once worked for. Despite the danger, his presence lights up her heart with hope—and maybe something more. Death comes for everyone, but Nina never gives up without a fight. And if she and Gideon can’t hold off the vampire’s teeth, she’ll lose everything—her family, her chance at love, and her life.",
