  "description": "When I was in high school I fell in love with the boy who made my life hell. He did everything he and his friends could do to make sure that I suffered. And suffer I did. Then everything changed, he moved in next door.Moving away from my friends was the worst thing that my mum could do to me. Having parties and making a lot of noise was my only salvation in a situation that I had no control over. Then I saw her. She was alone and I took every opportunity I could to pursue her. Eventually we fell in love and were ripped apart all too soon. Our life together was cut short all because I had one thing she didn’t.I learnt to move on without her, learnt to live without her but never forgot her or got over her. It was almost ten years later when Tess Morgan came back into my life and when she did, my heart picked up where it left off at the age of seventeen. In love and in trouble.Moving back home was the best decision that I had made in a long time. It was time for some stability in my life and home is where I could find it. Last time I was here my world was flipped and spun around and now that I’m back, I’m prepared to do anything it takes to get what I want and I’m prepared to do whatever it takes to get it.That’s what I told myself until I discovered that the boy I had fallen in love with in high school was still here. I hadn’t even been back a week before Ryan Bennett flipped and spun my world around all over again.",
