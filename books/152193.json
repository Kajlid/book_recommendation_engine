  "description": "“How rough can you take it?LOURDESHe was brazen as hell from the moment I laid eyes on him. He was aggressive, and dominant, with Mack truck arms, and a bar brawler voice.He was too good looking for his own good, with a hard jaw, and harder eyes.I’d always led a fairly peaceful life, but even I could tell at a glance that this man was dangerous. For so many reasons.Not the least of which being that rough, dirty, sheet-clawing sex fairly radiated off him.I’d thought I’d known how to handle every kind of man, but this one left me baffled.To say he wasn’t my type was putting it lightly.But you couldn’t tell that to my libido.Not even when I found out the truth.My lover had lied to me from the very start.Nothing about our meeting was a coincidence.This book can be read as a standalone.",
