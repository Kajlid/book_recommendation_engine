  "description": "From the beloved author of Family and A Piece of Mine comes a dazzling new collection of stories featuring ordinary women who discover that love sometimes comes when you least expect it.Vinnie is an overworked and self-sacrificing single mother who gets a second chance at love and independence, in \"The Eagle Flies.\" In \"A Shooting Star\" a happily married mother of two laments the fate of her beautiful friend Lorene, whose naivete about desire has deadly consequences. In \"A Filet of Soul,\" Luella's luck soon changes when her mother leaves her a modest inheritance, but not as soon as she initially imagines. And in \"The Lost and Found,\" Irene confronts her womanizing boyfriend with the one piece of information that will bring him to his knees. Bursting with earthy wisdom and humor, these warmly engaging tales are a testament to Cooper's gifts as a storyteller.",
