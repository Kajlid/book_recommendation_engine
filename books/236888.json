  "description": "Suicide. It's an ugly, dirty word that nobody wants to talk about, so it gets swept under the rug and forgotten. Only I can't forget, because it's the people who are left behind to suffer that hurt the most. People like me. I thought I'd always have Katie. It was us against the world. I thought nothing could stop us, that we'd be together forever. And then she left us. She had a choice and she chose to leave us. I'll never forgive her for that. A year has passed, and while time has moved on, I haven't. I fight to get through each day for Ellie, because there isn't anything I wouldn't do for that little girl. That includes packing up our whole life to head over to where her mom was born in Australia. I'll do whatever it takes to keep my wife's memory alive in our daughter, and that includes letting her get to know the grandparents she's never met. All I want from Daisy is her spare room. What I get is so much more. A sole carer to her six year old disabled brother, Daisy knows pain. Every single day, she gets up with a smile on her face, because that little boy is her whole world. Daisy she gives me hope that maybe I can do this. Maybe I can let go of the anger and the hurt I still feel, because unlike Katie, I don't have a choice. I have to let this go. Because I don't get to decide if I get to see my little girl grow up. That choice has already been made for me.'",
