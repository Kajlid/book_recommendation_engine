  "description": "From Bestselling Author, Ally Vance, comes a new Dark Romance that is part of BLAIREâ€™S WORLD.   About EVELINA:   For four years, I was hidden from everyone and everything I knew. I became a toy; a slave to be played with on a whim. He locked me away, robbed me of light, and forced me to live in the darkness.  He used me, abused me, and left me shattered. My screams went unheard, my tears went unseen, and my pleas went unanswered.  When the chance to escape presented itself, I fled. All I wanted was my freedom. All I wanted was to see the light once again. But when your name means Light, it makes the monsters want to keep you in the Dark.",
