  "description": "Bryan James knows everything about hockey. That's a passion he and his daughter Allie share. What he doesn't know is how to be a single father. And the way he's scrambling to hold his thirteen-year-old's world—and his— together kind of proves that.So does the fact they're in community mediation after Allie's run-in with another player on her own team! There's probably some valuable learning in this for Bryan, but he's too distracted by the other player's parent Clare Sampson. She's smart and beautiful…and outraged at what's happened. Worse, she wants nothing to do with his beloved sport, his amazing daughter…or him! Luckily he's been in this game long enough to know there's always another play to get you what you want.",
