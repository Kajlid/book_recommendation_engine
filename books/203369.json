  "description": "Winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.  A wise and graceful new collection by one of our \"major, indispensable poets\" (Sidney Lea). The mysteries of Eros and Thanatos, the stubborn endurance of mind and body in the face of diminishment--these are the undercurrents of Stephen Dunn's eleventh volume. \"I am interested in exploring the 'different' hours,\" he says, \"not only of one's life, but also of the larger historical and philosophical life beyond the personal.\"",
