Known to a few as Seth, the formidable leader of the Dark Order, a clandestine legion of vampires, this entity’s true identity remains a mystery.Why would a being of such power and darkness willingly surrender to mortal chains?It isn’t until Eunice Wang, a tenacious young paralegal, steps into the cell of this condemned soul during his last hours that Seth weaves an astonishing narrative, revealing his past as the ancient Formosan vampire king. His tale spans millennia, chronicling a reign steeped in blood and shadow over an island kingdom, a realm of awe and dread that eclipsed the horrors of history.As the prisoner’s story unfolds, Eunice discovers a lost civilization that had flourished, only to vanish mysteriously at the dawn of the 20th century.
