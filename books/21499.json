  "description": "Ailbhe Darcy's debut collection is a set of urgent dispatches from her point of origin, Dublin, and from her skirmishes further London, Paris, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the US. Driven less by metaphor than by wild conceits, semantic leaps, and startling juxtapositions, these are poems that itch and pluck at the pelt of what we think we know. Darcy is an exuberant and inventive new presence in the poetry world. \"\"A humorous study of life and everything else from Ailbhe Darcy who speaks with a frank passion in her debut volume.\"\"-The Midwest Book Review",
