Quick-witted and cocksure, young upstart Capac Raimi arrives in the City determined to make his mark.

Then he crosses paths with The Cardinal, and his life changes forever. The Cardinal is the City and the City is The Cardinal. They are joined at the soul. Nothing moves on the streets, or below them, without the Cardinal's knowledge. His rule is absolute. As Capac begins to discover more about the extent of the Cardinal's influence on his own life he is faced with hard choices. And as his ambition soars ever higher he will learn all there is to know about loss, and the true cost of ultimate power!",
