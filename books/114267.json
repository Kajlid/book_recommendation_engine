  "description": "It had only been a few weeks since Katie returned home and a lot had happened in that time. Coming to terms with the fact her father had been murdered and she had inherited the majority share of her father’s corporation was enough for anyone to contend with. Katie had also fallen in love with Andrew who she thought was well out of her reach. Everyone told her he was not a ‘happily ever after’ type of man but as much as she tried, she couldn’t help but fall in love. It was confirmed for her the night of the Charity Dinner when they finally came together for a night of passion; what next? Only in her dreams did she imagine he would be content with a monogamous relationship with her. Would Andrew’s past and his belief that love and marriage only brings trouble stop him having a future with Katie?",
