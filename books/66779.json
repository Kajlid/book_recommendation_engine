  "description": "Fasten your seat belts for another round of domestic adventures with houseboy Gillibran Brown.In his own words: ‘think of me as a gay male version of Flora Thompson writing not so much about Larkrise to Candleford as Arsehole to Breakfast Time. The BBC will never commission it as a series, but there you go, it’s their loss.’Gilli talks and quips us through another year of life with his beloved dictators Dick and Shane. In many respects it's a tough old year and Gilli has a lot to adapt to.",
