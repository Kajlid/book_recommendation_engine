  "description": "The Montclair Emeralds and ImpulseApril Foster had always been offbeat. She'd almost married Dan Butler once, but his cautious nature had gotten in the way. Eight years later nothing had changed; she still found him maddeningly attractive ... and totally unimaginative. Which was why, she decided, he was opposing her \"radical\" plan to beautify the town square.Yet something had changed, after all. Dan now possessed an heirloom ring -- a talisman of the love his mother and father had shared. And April was soon bedazzled. Not only was it a breathtaking gem but it also seemed to inspire Dan to act on impulse ... satisfying all her fantasies.",
