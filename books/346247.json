  "description": "These magnificent illustrations, created for a 1905 edition of Washington Irving's enchanting fairy tale, established Arthur Rackham as a leading illustrator of his time. The illustrations featured traits that soon were to characterize much of Rackham's flowing pen lines and muted watercolors, forests of looming trees, lovely fairy maidens, and quizzical troll-like figures. Today these images are recognized as among Rackham's very best works.This edition features all 51 full-page color plates, as well as the full text of Irving's classic tale. And enduring foundation of Catskill lore, the captivating narrative recounts the fanciful adventures of an amiable ne'er-do-well colonial farmer who wanders into the highlands, falls asleep after drinking with a band of strange little mountain men, and wakes twenty years later in a world that has passed him by.Effusing a gentle humor, Rackham's art is a constant reminder of a more innocent era. This edition — sure to enchant art lovers — will also delight Rackham devotees and fantasy fans alike.",
