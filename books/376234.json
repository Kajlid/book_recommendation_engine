As books go out of print and stories fade from memory, the journey of Joseph and Mary and her delivery inside a common barn continues to bless and inspire hope in people around the world.Accompanied by moving and beautifully rendered illustrations throughout, Donna VanLiereâ€™s retelling shows that the story of the Nativity is alive in our modern world, and a journey that began more than two thousand years ago is still the most powerful series of events ever to touch the minds and hearts of people everywhere.",
