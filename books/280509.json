  "description": "Dog Talk concerns Dave Henry, newly blind, and his guide dog Ezra, a powerful wolf-shepherd cross. Either can be lethal. Made one by a bond forged on the primal instinct of Ezraâ€™s lupine forebears, their abilities grow troubling. Premonition ensues, bringing Dave insight to the future, accurate, sickening distortions clouded by his murky past. The story is one of searing change. Dave and Ezra become something dangerous; wolf-like perception drawing them from the laws of man, back to the cruel but simple laws of nature. Circumstance involves them in the hunt for Edwin Carter, ER Doc, sexual sadist and serial killer. Driven by insatiable need, brilliance makes Carter a shadow. The plot flows through the lives of others as Dave and Ezra intercede. Past and future collide in the present, brought forth through the portal of their bond.Dog Talk does more than entertain. Enter the world of a man suddenly blind. Feel the fear in your guts, and feel it fade as you come to know Ezra. Stay close to Dave as his world changes, sometimes distorted by premonition, again seeing clearly through the eyes of his dog.",
