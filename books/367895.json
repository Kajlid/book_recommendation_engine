  "description": "This is a beautiful Hardcover book that is approximately 10.5\" by 9\". \"Words from the This collection of pictures and moments captured in time during the first three decades of Narcotics Anonymous is a kind of NA scrapbook, like a collection of old photoes, letters and picture postcards of the efforts of the founding members. ....At the same time, this collection does seek to help our members-newcomers and old-timers alike - to gain a depper sense of the hardships and triumphs of our early developments.... And it aims to help us gain a more profound respect for the members who came before us, those who laid the groundwork, not only for the program itself, but also for our local communities..... The pre-1953 information in this book is presented to offer the reader some publicly held perceptions about drugs and addiction. For their perseverance in the face of many hardships, for their implicit belief in the hope our program could give to the suffering addicts, and for action in starting Narcotics Anonymous meetings even when others told them that no one could stay clean in NA, we owe those early members a debt beyound measure.",
