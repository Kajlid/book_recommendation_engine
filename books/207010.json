  "title": "An Appetite For Crime - The Memoirs of Former Detective Superintendent Ron Chapman",
  "description": "Born in Balham, South London in 1940 Ron was destined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a painter and decorator. That was until a chance encounter with a young police cadet led him down a very different path. What followed was a very successful 30-year career in the Metropolitan Police and in this book Ron shares memories of his time in the Police force, giving us a real insight into old fashioned police work in the good old days. The story begins in April 1959 at St Ann's Road Tottenham and continues through the streets of London, taking the reader on a journey that is both reminiscent of those times, touched with humour and some personal memories of colleagues, friends and family. Published in loving memory.",
