  "description": "Three years ago, few people had heard of Smithton, Missouri. But when Smithton Community Church experienced a powerful revival, the church and its pastor, Steve Gray, gained international prominence. Newsweek described a church service there as a five-hour Pentecostal power surge, a phenomenon that has attracted visitors from all over the world. When the Kingdom Comes chronicles the resurgence that has rocked this small town and explores the various facets of revival, answering questions such How do we invite revival?What does it look like when it comes?What is the cost?What happens to us as individuals, churches, and the church?What stops revival?How can the church overcome her historic blocks to revival?We live in a day when the kingdom of God is forcefully breaking into our lives, churches, and communities, just as it did when Jesus walked on the earth, Gray writes. Readers will be inspired to examine their own hearts and prepare for the miracle of revival.",
