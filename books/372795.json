  "title": "A Visual Guide to Gospel Events: Fascinating Insights into Where They Happened and Why",
  "description": "As the inspired authors of the Bible relayed the story of salvation, they frequently mentioned place names that contributed to the story. Yet readers who are separated from the texts by thousands of years and thousands of miles are often unable to fully understand or appreciate those references. In the tradition of the well-received A Visual Guide to Bible Events, authors James C. Martin, John A. Beck, and David G. Hansen offer this new resource focusing on the Gospel narratives. This beautiful, full-color book is filled with photographs, maps, and easy-to-read explanations. The engaging writing style makes this resource perfect for anyone--student, scholar, pastor, or layperson--who wants to understand the events recorded in the Gospels in a deeper way.",
