  "description": "I’m a male exotic dancer. Yeah, I said it. And let me tell you, it’s an end to a means, my friend.My brothers and I are the kings of Las Vegas. Owning our own male revue club has been a fantasy of mine for a long time. And now that dream is finally a reality. My nerves are shot. The stress is real. And I need just one night to let loose. But, after a night I won’t soon forget it’s time for the club’s premier. And the new bartender, Shayne is late. I’ll have his head for this. But when Shayne shows up for his shift, he’s not exactly what I was expecting. Shayne’s a girl. A very pretty, no, beautiful woman with striking green eyes. The same eyes I gazed into the night before. My life just got a whole lot more complicated. Because I’m the boss and I can’t fraternize with the employees. But, there’s just something about Shayne I can’t stay away from, and pretty soon I won’t be able to stay away no matter how hard I try.",
