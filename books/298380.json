  "title": "Life on Mars? The case for a cosmic heritage?",
  "description": "A NASA-funded team of scientists has announced that there is evidence of previous life on Mars. This book analyses the results from the meteorite ALH84001, critically interprets the information from the Vikings 1 and 2 space probes to Mars and looks at the evidence of organic material in the Cosmos. The overwhelmingly most likely explanation and by far the simplest interpretation of all the findings is that life is a cosmic phenomenon seeding the Earth and Mars.",
