  "title": "Comfort in Sorrow",
  "description": "We have all needed comfort at some time in our lives. People search for comfort in all sorts of places, from the empty psychobabble of the self-help book to the oblivion of alcoholism.The only completely satisfying source of comfort is found in the Bible - and, more particularly, knowing Jesus as a friend.This is shown in the story of the death of Lazarus. Jesus comforted Lazarus' sisters, Mary and Martha, weeping with them, before going on to raise Lazarus back to life after four days in the grave.Robert Murray McCheyne, one of Scotland's greatest preachers who saw great revival in his less than 30 years of life, looks at this wonderful passage, offering us tremendous encouragement and pointing us to the one true source of comfort - Jesus.",
