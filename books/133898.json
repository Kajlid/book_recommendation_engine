  "description": "Serena Chastain, former reality TV - sparkly purple shorts wearing – starlet, and Earth Witch is having a really bad five months. Imprisoned in a mental facility by two Chaos demi-gods bent on revenge, Serena is drained of her magic and only days away from dying. Truth Mage Locke Valhalla battles evil every day… in the boardroom, wielding the contents of his briefcase like a sword, his platinum credit card his shield. His life is pretty much perfect. He’s established very firm boundaries to ensure his loving but interfering family are kept at bay and his immaculate home is the equivalent of the fortress of solitude – only much cleaner and better decorated with a big screen TV plus an expensively stocked bar. Unfortunately Locke’s perfect world is about to come crashing down. Blackmailed into rescuing Serena, what’s a three piece suit wearing corporate lawyer with a slight dirt phobia supposed to do when he’s saddled with an Earth Witch with a bounty on her very fine - but definitely off limits – ass? A woman who insists upon rolling around in the mud to reconnect with her magic! A woman who refuses to wear clothes and seems to take great delight in twitching all her mouth-watering assets in his face at every opportunity! With a Kiss of Vampire Assassins also chasing that very fine butt, it’s up to Locke to protect Serena from the bad guys whilst the Earth Witch teaches him that only good things come to those who are willing to wrangle with a Witch.",
