  "description": "When Marielle Kaelan is widowed at just twenty-six, it seems that her entire world is destroyed. One year after the tragic accident that killed her husband, Hank, Marielle is unable to move beyond her grief, and friends and family feel helpless as they watch the Marielle that they know and love fades away under a fog of drug and alcohol abuse. After a bad night out, Marielle finds herself at her lowest point yet – stoned and drunk, she passes out on the side of a country road. It seems things really can’t get any worse. Then, a compassionate hand reaches out inthe dark and helps her find her way home. Nicolas has been haunting the earth for nearly four centuries. Once doomed to be executed as the son of a so-called sorcerer in 15th century France, dubbed Le Fils du Diable, or the Devil’s Child, Nicolas escaped death only to become ensnared in an even more horrible fate; one of eternal damnation. When fate offers him a taste of life again in his bizarre friendship with the grieving Marielle, their two lost souls seem immediately to connect. But when Nicolas discovers that this unexpected taste of hope in his dark world is more than he could have dreamed, their friendship turns to macabre romance. Marielle's world spins even more wildly out of her control as she is caught between a dangerous and inexplicable desire for her new friend and the discovery that Nicolas has not only strange powers but dark secrets, and is perhaps more of a demon than she was willing to believe. Worse yet, now that he has found her, Nicolas wants more than anything to have her all to himself, no matter what the cost.",
