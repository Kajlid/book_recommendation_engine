  "description": "Centuries have passed since the Silence, and the few remaining faithful cling to the ancient prophecies of the First One.  They wait for the Caller and watch the skies for the Sword in the Stars, even as the world they've always  known unravels around  them.  Murderous Gorracks have secretly penetrated the kingdom's borders. Their attacks grow more brazen...more horrific, threatening to touch off a war on a scale  that hasn't been seen in seven ages.    In  the capital city of Anglinore, noble King Aravel ponders  the advice of  this twin brother   declare all out war on the Gorrack nation.  While Anglinore's High Shepherd, the wise Sebastian Grenlaff urges caution and listens to troubling voices on the wind.    Queen Mariel, due to deliver a child any day, suspects the unthinkable about her husband's brother Morlan.  She sets off alone to Morlan's castle in Dunharrow, hoping against hope that she can keep old wounds from erupting in war.     Alastair Coldharrow,  tortured by an addiction to the outlawed Witchdrale and haunted by a violent past, wagers his life on the hope that the foretold Halfainin, the Pathwalker, would come.  When at  last, the Sword appears in the Stars, Alastair begins a fruitless search for the Halfainin that leaves him disillusioned, broken, and lost.  Used to caring only for himself, Alastair will enter a maelstrom of conflict as loyalties are tested, dark schemes are hatched, and  the many realms of Myriad brace  themselves for war.    Will Alastair realize what he has before its too late...for everyone?",
