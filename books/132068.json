For teen vampire Eren, his boyfriend Corbijn and best friend Andy, Paris seemed like the perfect place to escape to but the City of Light has darkness in its heart. While Eren finds himself struggling to deal with the horror he witnessed in his home town and fighting to reign in his power to cast, a surprising new enemy makes moves to destroy the one thing Eren can't live without - Corbijn.

Join Eren as he challenges The Order, accepts his fate and answers the terrifying question: how far would you go to save the man you love?",
