  "title": "Raw Power: Iggy & The Stooges",
  "description": "In 1972 Iggy Pop & The Stooges flew into London to record a new LP Raw Power. With David Bowie as executive producer, Raw Power proved to be an instant classic. During this time The Stooges, perpetually wasted, performed a single concert in London s Kings Cross. This whole crazed period of Iggy s phenomenal career was captured on camera by one man Mick Rock. An unparalled document of Iggy at the height of both his musical powers and his legendary excesses. Raw Power also serves as a unique visual diary of the heady times which produced one of rock music s most enduring recordings whose famous cover shot captured by Mick Rock is now indelibly established in modern pop iconography. SELLING Contains over 200 amazing photographs as well as interviews, conducted between Mick Rock and Iggy Pop in 1972. Originally published by Creation Books in 1999, this new edition with a foreword by Mick Rock and Iggy Pop contains extra previously unseen images and entirely new textual and photo layout.",
