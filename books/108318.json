  "title": "Dreamers of the Absolute: A Book of Hours",
  "description": "A young woman, dreaming of love and yearning to know what it is, drives up to a Trappist monastery in rural Kentucky, seeking her older brother who has taken the vows of a novice. She spends seven days of unplanned contemplation interspersed with the seven prayers that punctuate the monasteryâ€™s daily routine. Insights and recollections come and go like the ebb and flow of the tide. In her silent enclosure she asks herself who she is, what she wants, and what she believes. Anna Sun poses seemingly unanswerable questions, but like an illuminated book of hours, this sensitive and beautifully adorned novella also seems to point to where an answer might lie.",
