  "description": "When Ash Carpenter imagines a schoolgirl, the image doesn't match her. She wears long skirts that are sort of frumpy. Her bulky sweaters hide her shape, and her hair is always in a messy bun. Her tennis shoes are clunky and worn, and there are runs in her thick tights. Her dark-framed glasses hide some of her face...but not all of it. Because he's caught sight of those ice-blue eyes, and they've pierced him to his core.  She walks by his office every day, and finally, he's had enough. Ash decides he's tired of waiting and it's time to collect what he's owed. She'll come with him because there's no other choice. She'll pay her daddy's debt any way Ash sees fit.  Warning: Oh, honey, this is about to get filthy. If your delicate sensibilities can't handle the dirty, then step aside for those of us who can. It's quick, but it's just the right length if you know what I mean. *slow wink, elbow nudge, goofy snort*",
