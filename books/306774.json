  "description": "In horror movies, the final girls are the ones left standing when the credits roll. They made it through the worst night of their lives… but what happens after?Lynnette Tarkington is a real-life final girl who survived a massacre. For more than a decade, she’s been meeting with five other final girls and their therapist in a support group for those who survived the unthinkable, working to put their lives back together. Then one woman misses a meeting, and their worst fears are realized—someone knows about the group and is determined to rip their lives apart again, piece by piece.   But the thing about final girls is that no matter how bad the odds, how dark the night, how sharp the knife, they will never, ever give up.",
