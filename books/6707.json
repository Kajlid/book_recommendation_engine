  "description": "After seeing her best friend accept her brother’s collar, Kalinda Doherty realized without a doubt she needed what Nisey had - a Dom who was willing to offer her more than a few nights of hot sex, erotic pain, and sensual submission. Unfortunately that left out the man she wanted. So when the offer of an internship in Los Angeles came up, Kalinda jumped at the chance, leaving Chicago, her family and the man of her dreams behind. Now with her internship over, Kalinda’s heading home for the summer with a decision to make - take the permanent job waiting in L.A. or finding happiness with her new Dom in Chicago?Joshuah Redding was a man of deep needs. The time apart he’d forced upon Kalinda was finally over. Now that she’s returning to Chicago, he knows it’s time to claim her - for good this time. He had everything planned until the plane touched down. That’s when he finds out Kalinda has brought a man home with her…another Dom. Now what the hell is he supposed to do - especially when the new Dom wants him to join them - permanently?",
