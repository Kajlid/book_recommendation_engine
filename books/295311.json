  "description": "It's always a bad idea to fall for a hot mysterious billionaire with a spooky castle.Especially when you find out he's a dragon.Night nurse Andi Ngo was desperate for money to bail out her idiot brother. A one time nursing gig seemed like the perfect deal: lots of cash, no questions asked. Even when her employer turns out to be the notorious billionaire Damian Blackwood, Andi is determined to keep quiet and finish the job. But when Damian saves her life from a monster, there’s no forgetting what she saw — not his insanely superhero physique, not the hungry way he looks at her, like she’s some priceless treasure to be possessed, and definitely not the fact that he’s got another hidden self; he’s an honest-to-god dragon.Andi knows the dragon shifter’s secret and he’s definitely far from pleased. After a night of monsters and mayhem, he takes her home in his fancy sports car and….asks her for a date.The expensive well-tailored suit can’t disguise the fire in his eyes and wildness in his savage smile.She should say no.What if she says yes?Author note: This is the first of a slow burn paranormal romance series featuring a hot dragonshifter hero: heck yes, explicit scenes are in here but you’ll have to be patient for the HEA to come.",
