  "description": "I'm Ivy Clarke. Bartender, best friend, and disbeliever in love.And now I'm in over my head, trying to flip a house all by myself.Thanks, HGTV.I'm not too proud to admit I need some help. Too bad the only one who can help me is the same man I want to throw out this house's second-story window. Jackson Gamble and I can't be in the same room together for more than a minute without devolving into a sparring match.Except for that one timeâ€¦But enough about that. Jackson's looking for forever, and I don't believe in love, remember?Get in. Renovate. Get out. Keep my heart firmly in tact.Because it's much easier to fix up a house than a broken heart.Full of humor and dripping with delicious tension, Nailed It proves that every heart can be ready for a little rehabilitation, if only you're willing to open it up.",
