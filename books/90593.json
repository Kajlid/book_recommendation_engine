Combining elements of crime fiction, dark humour and social comment whilst introducing you to various gangsters, drunks, vengeful pensioners and moody teenagers this collection could best be described as Brit Grit. If you like the TV series Shameless then you'll love this. Just be thankful you don't live there!",
