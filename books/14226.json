  "title": "Bad Memories: Getting Past Your Past",
  "description": "Do memories of your past haunt you? Is there help for people who suffer because of their own past? Most people who suffer from bad memories want them to disappear. On the other hand, some want to deny the problem and ?just forget the past.? Robert D. Jones shows that God provides a solution to the haunting problem of nagging bad memories. What is God's answer? If you belong to Jesus, God does have something better for you, Jones writes. God does not want to remove your memories; he want to transform them into something good. Your bad memories of past sins-even the worst ones-can be opportunities for life-changing growth. You do not need to avoid, run from, or get rid of your past. Jones points out that painful thoughts may still intrude, but you need not escape them. God is bigger than your past.",
