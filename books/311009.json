  "description": "Hi there! I'm the author, and I'd actually not recommend reading my first book. Blinded by my early ambition to publish, I trusted a hybrid publisher, only to discover they were more interested in cashing in than crafting quality. The manuscript, admittedly, wasn’t ready—it’s under-edited and nowhere near my best work. Though it sold a few copies, I’ve yet to see any royalties, and despite violating the contract, they continue to profit from my mistake. To make matters worse, Goodreads won’t remove it, which feels wildly unfair. So, if you're here looking for book recommendations, I'd say... skip this one!",
