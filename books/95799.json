  "description": "A boy receives an email from his mother offering free movie tickets shortly after her death. He recognizes it for spam, but wishes she'd really sent it. He responds, and is soon barraged with offers for male enhancements drugs, home appliances, mortgages, and everything else he. Soon, he and his father are swallowing all manner of black market pharmaceuticals, somehow growing closer together as they fall apart, each in his own way.",
