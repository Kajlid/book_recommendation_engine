  "title": "The Alleged \"Nanking Massacre\": Japan's Rebuttal to China's Forged Claims",
  "description": "What was the 'Nanking Massacre', then? For reexamining the fact of the 'Nanking Massacre', we have started the following legal approach. Namely, we have tried to treat the so-called 'Nanking Massacre' as a murder case. Also, we have tried to precisely examine whether the crime had been proved or not and objectively verify the fact, using a method based on the Criminal Procedure Act, in view that the Prosecution has responsibility to adduce evidences to show the committed crimes. In other words, our objective is not to prove that there was no 'Nanking Massacre', but to specify the fact that the testimonies, which claim that there was the 'Nanking Massacre', are not substantiated at all. As a result of the examination, the motive of the Japanese Army, the sum of these corpses and the cause of death have not been proved. Of course, there have not been some regrettable facts of criminal acts of murders and rapes which have been committed by the Japanese Army. However, these sporadic criminal acts committed during the fierce battles, are far from the so-called 'systematic and deliberate large scale massacre' of 300,000. This book is bilingual in English and Japanese.",
