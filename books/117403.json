She awakens in an unfamiliar setting - and century - and quickly discovers that she will need more than her charm to complete the task assigned to her.On the surface, Tyler Monroe has everything going for him - good looks, the respect of his friends and neighbors, and a thriving horse ranch. However, his past holds deep wounds with thick emotional scars. When a brazen, beautiful woman arrives in town, Tyler makes an impulsive decision that will cause him to question everything he knows. Tyler is unlike any man Laney has ever met. Laney is exactly the kind of woman Tyler wants to avoid. As the attraction between them grows, questions arise that stretch the boundaries of trust for both. The secrets that threaten to tear them apart could be exactly what Tyler and Laney need to bring them together.",
