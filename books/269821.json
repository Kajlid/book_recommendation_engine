  "description": "When opposites attract, it’s messy… and perfect.From the moment Clover crashes into my life, she turns my world upside down. She’s quirky and fun—unlike any woman I’ve ever known.Her wild ideas pull me out of my comfort zone, and I love the way she makes me feel. But her free spirit longs to roam, and I don’t know if she can do the one thing I really need. Stay.I’m sure fate led me to Jetty Beach, but until I meet Cody Jacobsen, I’m not sure why. The small-town doctor—with his gorgeous body, ridiculous dimples, and adorable bedside manner—sweeps me off my feet and saves the day. Literally.Our chemistry is off the charts. But to a man like him—mature and put together—I’m a wild breeze who throws him off kilter. And for a woman like me—who never truly lets anyone in—he might want more than I can give.He might want everything.Messy Perfect Love was previously titled Must Be Fate",
