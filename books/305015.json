  "description": "When I asked my best friend to run away with me at sixteen, I knew he’d say no.⁣⁣He had football, an amazing family, and a happy home to go back to every day.⁣⁣So the night I snuck out of his bedroom window after hugging him goodbye, I’d accepted I’d probably never see him again.⁣⁣Then we both wind up at Lindon University four years later.⁣⁣I’m barely picking up the pieces of my life when the boy whose initials I used to doodle hearts around approaches me at work.⁣⁣Aiden Griffith. Lindon U’s star tight end.⁣⁣Still as attractive. Still as dedicated.⁣⁣With rumors of him being drafted to the NFL coming to fruition, I know it’s only a matter of time before we have to say goodbye again.⁣⁣But he can’t seem to let me go no matter what I say, and I don’t think I want him to.⁣",
