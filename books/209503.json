  "description": "The electrifying sequel to The Glare is here! Laney is alive, but just barely. When the apocalypse strikes, she escapes the men who are keeping her captive, but the tortured nightmares and hallucinations triggered by their abuse are harder to escape. She’s driven to find and protect her sister, but if Laney’s going to survive herself, she must face something even more terrifying than the apocalypse--her own broken soul. Pick up a copy of this fast-paced page turner today! AUTHOR INTERVIEW The Glare Continues is darker than the first book in the series even though the characters are so young. Why? The Glare Continues picks up where the first book in the series ends. The apocalypse has caused the death of most of humanity, so it’s only fitting the characters’ struggles are more difficult and more intense. The apocalypse doesn’t spare only those who are perfectly healthy, happy, and whole. Most people suffer great loss or hurt and it takes time to mend profoundly broken spirits. Working through their brokenness influences every thought, every action, and that pain results in a darker perspective of the world. Who would enjoy this story? Readers who’ve finished The Glare will definitely want to pick up a copy. Doomsday preppers and those who enjoy apocalyptic (and post-apocalyptic) fiction will also enjoy it. Anyone who is interested in reading about the resiliency of the human spirit will want to read this series, too. Is it strictly necessary to read The Glare before picking up a copy of The Glare Continues? Technically, no. But it’s a good idea. There’s so much readers will miss if they don’t know the details about Jenna’s life before the glare or how she became such a strong young woman despite her age.",
