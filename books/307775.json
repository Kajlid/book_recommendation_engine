  "description": "There is a war, and people with skills are deployed when and where it suits the cause. Even Omegas. Where necessary, they are allocated protection. A controller. And they are told to submit fully to the controller. That it is recommended.But the war brings many changes. Omegas must be protected at all costs and what was once a recommendation might soon become a mandate.Eloise is an Omega, and with her first deployment imminent she has already decided that she won’t submit to full control—not while the law still protects her. But they haven’t allocated her to an ordinary controller, they’ve let the best of them fight for the right. And nothing is going to stop the one who comes out on top from claiming his prize.",
