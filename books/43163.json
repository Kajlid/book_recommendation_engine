  "description": "When a glacier melts, a dam of ice fractures, and a river called the Rushing Waters is set loose on an old growth forest. The flood surrounds an ancient tree, where impish, stick creatures, the Old Seeder Twigs, are stranded. Their fate is tied to an enormous and sinister beaver far away. A young Twig named Leaf and his fearless friend Rustle fly on a gigantic leaf over dangerous grasslands seeking help from the chomper colony leader, but the journey proves far more treacherous than imagined, and their only hope for rescue dims. Jittery chipmunks and a mysterious Twig stranger join the perilous mission, but time is growing very short. The Old Seeder is drowning. A goliath beaver must build a mighty dam to save Leaf's tree home, but will he even try?Twigs live in a fragile world of old forests and magnificent glaciers threatened by climate change events, yet Twigs stick together to survive.Royalties are shared with nature conservancy nonprofits that protect wildlife and forests. Twig stories are illustrated by D.W. Murray, a Disney artist. His credits include Mulan, Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch, Brother Bear, and Curious George. He is a recipient of the New York Society of Illustrators Gallery and the 2004 Gold Aurora Award.",
