To escape, she jumps at the chance to attend Ravenhurst Academy as a boarding student. Sheâ€™ll even put up with the clique-ish Ravens if it means making a fresh start. At first, Ravenhurst is better than Hope could have dreamed. She has a boyfriend and a cool roommate, and she might finally have found a place she can fit in. But can she trust her online boyfriend? And what can she do after her brother shows up at the school gates, desperate for help, and the Ravens turn on her? Trapped and unsure, Hope realizes that if she wants to save her brother, she has to save herself first.",
