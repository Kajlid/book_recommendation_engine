  "description": "Journeys of the Heart is a memoir of short stories that I have been working on over the past several years. I never thought it would come to fruition and based on the memories in this new, upcoming book, you will have a closer peek into my life as I remember it. You will see through these stories how I came to this point in my life and how I have overcome the many different obstacles that life has thrown my way. A curve ball of events, some of which you may even relate to, and even may have experienced yourself. This memoir was written to document different events in my childhood from the earliest memories I recollect and evolve into the woman I have become today.",
