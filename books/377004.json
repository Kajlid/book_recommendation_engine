  "description": "Artemis Fowl seems to be running amuck. At least, that's what Captain Holly Short believes when she witnesses his strange behavior lurches. Eventually, she concludes that he's suffering from Atlantis Complex, a grab-bag psychosis that could keep a dozen therapists fully occupied. And Artemis' mental problems couldn't be occurring at a worse time: The actual underwater city of Atlantis is facing a very real attack and unless Artemis can free himself of his delusions, this once-bubbling metropolis is just a few gurgles away from its watery demise. The seventh episode in a first-class adventure fantasy.",
