  "description": "Jameson and Luuk have been on the run for their lives, but they’ve been running from more than their enemies.Three years running for their lives has brought Luuk and Jameson to the point of desperation. A close call that almost ends in their deaths makes it clear to Luuk that he must stop running and find a way to take back his position as the European Alpha Anax, leader of all wolf shifters in Europe. To do so, he must defeat the man who ambushed him and has been trying to kill him and Jameson.Jameson didn’t know when he fell for Luuk that he was Luuk’s mate. He didn’t know shifters existed, but he learned fast and hard. Three years on the run in the wild have left him too close to an edge that, if he falls over, he fears he’ll be lost. The darkness in his mind is threatening his life as much as those who hunt him.As Luuk and Jameson take their stand, they find they have allies in places they never suspected, and Jameson hasn’t been forgotten by everyone he left behind, not at all.",
