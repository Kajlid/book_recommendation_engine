  "description": "This book, Vol. 1, is part of \"To Move A Mountain - The Series.\" Arrancies began life as a street kid and he loved the city and its lessons. Everything you need to know for city life, breaking-and-entering, drugs, and sex. However, Arrancies was far different from the other kids, and most people, for that matter. At the age of four, he had a vision of what his life would become. Torn between friends, family, and his struggle to be a young boy, he had wisdom well beyond his years. The foundations of his life through adolescence appear no different on the outside from any other boy his age. More so, as he sees the torment of the world through the rioting, psychedelic, war-torn years of the 60s, he begins his own interpretation. His journey to become a visionary and messenger of the energy from which we originate is forming a foundation. His loves, loss, heartache, and hope become the background of his unexpected travel through the transcendental voyage of our mind. Saved by technology and destroyed by loneliness, Arrancies escapes everyday life that eventually unravels into the infinite beyond.",
