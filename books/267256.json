  "description": "Surviving the worst pandemic in history isn't enough. Now the survivors have to recreate everything all over again. How can ordinary people pull together to build a world safe from chaos and tyranny? Doing nothing isn't an option, but anything they do could have terrible consequences. No one had a plan for how to deal with a disaster of this scale, but collectively, the survivors may have the answers they need if they can get the right people in the room at the same time. Unfortunately, the right people are scattered all over the planet..  This book is best read following the first book in the series (Pandemic Reboot: Survivors).",
