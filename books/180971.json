  "description": "Chelsea spent most of her life running. She was young when her parents were killed, and she was thrown into the system as just another statistic. One foster home after another, hell after hell. When things got too hard, her first instinct was to get out and fast. She didn’t mind being a club girl. Who wouldn't want a group of possessive alpha males on your side and in your bed? The freedom and the lifestyle allowed her to spread her wings while the rules and bylaws kept everyone in line. It was comfortable – safe. But while her head told her she was happy, her heart reminded her constantly of what she really wanted – Brothers by Blood President, Optimus. He was a brooding asshole who was sexy, loyal and pushed the boundaries of both her body and her mind. He never let her all the way in, but she still couldn't stay away from him – he was addictive. Optimus had only one rule – family comes first. He knew that sometimes sacrifices needed to be made in order to keep the ones he loved safe. He'd done it before and he would do it again. Being President of the Brothers by Blood MC meant he couldn't show any weakness. His feelings for Chelsea were off the charts, but so far he'd managed to hide them and keep her at an arm’s length thinking he was protecting her. Beautiful, athletic and sassy, she wasn't just another club girl, she was HIS girl. Danger is fast approaching and Chelsea is in its direct sight. Will it be too late for Optimus to show Chelsea how he really feels? And when secrets are revealed will Chelsea stay and stand beside the man she wants or will the urge to run just be too strong?",
