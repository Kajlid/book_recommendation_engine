  "description": "You know who I am.I swear too much, I crack too many jokes, and I got a thing for Kat Tanner; a messy thing, a distracting thing, a getting-in-the-way-of-everything thing; a thing that makes being in the same room with the woman torture. Sometimes it's the good kind. Mostly, it's not.What you don't know is how it all started. You don't know how we met, you might not know what happened in Vegas (or the morning after), and you definitely don't know what happened after that.You want to know the story before the story? Well... here you go.But be careful what you ask for. As I've discovered the hard way, you might not like it.'Scenes from the Hallway' is a companion short prequel/short story (11k words) for Marriage of Inconvenience, and includes the first 3 chapters of that book.No longer availableNow included in \nNeanderthal Seeks (Extra) Yarns.\nWARNING: This short story contains a lot of cussing. Do not download or read if you dislike curse words in novels.",
