  "description": "Hello, my name is Cefa. Cefa is pronounced SEE-FA and it means C for Cat. I am a Russian Blue Cat. If you like cats and if you like to read about cats then you will enjoy reading my stories. Recently a very nice person adopted me from the animal shelter. He took me home with him. I have a lot of fun exploring my new house and yard. In my first adventure you will see that I get myself into a very scary situation. Read about how I am rescued. My story is a good bedtime story. For my friends who can't read yet, have your Mom or Dad read it to you. If you can read, you will enjoy learning about what I do and how I enjoy myself.
