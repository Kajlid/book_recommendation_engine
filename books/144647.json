The solution? Find two brilliant interns and give them a crack at launching the site into the stratosphere.Enter Mia Galliano and Ethan Vance.

For one thing, the night before their stint at Boomerang begins, Ethan and Mia meet at a bar and fall into bed together. What exactly happened between them? Good question. They're both hazy on the details. But they do know how awkward it is when they end up sharing a post hookup taxi . . . to the same Boomerang headquarters.There they find they're competing for just one job—at a company with a strict no-dating policy. But their connection is as powerful as their ambition. Will they manage to keep their eyes on the future and their hands off each other?",
