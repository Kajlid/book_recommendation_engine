Loving parents.And it all equaled happiness.Then my life went up in smoke.Happiness no longer existed.I trusted the wrong person.And in a blink of an eye, the cruelty of the world reared its ugly head.Four walls. Darkness.Memory loss.Chains.Sex.My first love.And people watching in the corners.Now, I'm conditioned.I need to watch.I need to be watched.No one understands the turmoil inside me.And the one person who seems to calm it?Ruby Raine.A little spitfire of a woman who released the strife I've been swallowing for eighteen years.She made me realize how weak I was and how strong I needed to be.To tackle my demons, I have to admit everything.I have to trust and that's one thing that doesn't come easy for me.Ruby shows me it's okay to let go, to let someone steer for a bit, to give up a little control.So I let go. I let her have the reins.The road is bumpy, a minefield of explosives with her debt and my pain.Every chance she takes on me is a step I take to better myself.Love is a surprise.A dart that Ruby tossed, and it hit me in the middle of my chest.Unleashingâ€¦ everything.I'm my own target. If there's one thing I can do, it's aim.",
