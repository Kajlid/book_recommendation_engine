  "description": "As the Dark Trine's noose tightens around Kinderra, young Trine Mirana Pinal and her mentor, the Trine hero Tetric Garis, embark on a quest to learn how the enigmatic watchtower of Jasal's Keep once saved the land. Teague Beltran, Mirana's beloved and an Unaspected herbsman's apprentice, wants nothing more than to kill the Dark Trine himself. As one born without magical powers, however, he is forbidden to take up arms in battle. His confrontation with the Dark Trine's forces may force him to sacrifice his healing oath. Mirana fears using her Aspects with the Light from Within will not be enough to save her people. The strength of her Aspects through the Power from Without, however, will lead her down a path she must not follow. Both must answer their true calling but each choice may leave them-and Kinderra-without hope.Additional formats:Paperback: ISBN â€Ž 978-1735051857; ASIN 1735051853; $16.95Ebook: ISBN 978-1735051864; ASIN B097LM1T6X; $9.95)",
