  "description": "I had four weeks before I shipped out again so it was sun, fun, and partying hard.  She wasn't a part of the plan.  We had one perfect month together before I had to go wheels up. Neither of us expected what happened next.  The blast left me scarred, inside and out. How could I ever be good enough for a beauty like her? She deserved better.  Now I've got the Ghost Riders Motorcycle Club, and I don't need anything else. If I can't have her, I'll never have another. A man can live without his heart...right?  Abraham has one regret—letting his Julie getaway. When he can't let go, there's only one thing left to do. Make her his.  Warning: If you want a scarred hero who's over-the-top obsessed, alpha possessive, and falls in love at first sight, take a peek inside.  *Not responsible if peek turns into a full-on read.*",
