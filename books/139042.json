  "description": "Life on the RopesWhen Frankie McGee told her Uncle Joe she'd do anything to help save the family business, she wasn't exactly thinking of dressing up in a fur-trimmed bikini and four-inch stilettos.

But now her fate was sealed: Frankie the accountant by day; Tatianna the Tigress by night. Was it possible lack could ever love both of them?",
