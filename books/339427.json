  "description": "Risk is a beautifully told story that spans the years from the mid-eighties to the post-9/11 world. Carol is an idealistic, Berkeley-educated, Jewish lesbian living in Oakland, California. Downwardly mobile, the Berkeley grad makes her living by tutoring high school students. Through Carolâ€™s life, Dykewomon explores the changing times and values in America. She contemplates war, class, race, community, love, relationships and change in mythic, historic Berkeley. Whew!",
