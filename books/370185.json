Ariel, enjoying a long weekend camping in the woods with her friends before college resumes, thinks she is perfectly content. Then Lucien and his vampire clan come down from the mountains, abducting young men and women for their settlement. When hLucien sees Ariel sunning by a lake, he knows he must make her his thrall - in every way. On the journey up the mountain, Ariel is subjected to the vampire's constant seductions, beginning with an arousing strip of leather attached to the saddlehorn of the horse he keeps her bound to, to nights of unbridled passion. She finds herself branded and pierced, and the object of the dark vampire's lust. More horrifying is the fact that Lucien seems to have awakened desires for domination and submission Ariel never knew she had. She desires more ... and even Lucien worries she will not survive the claiming of the vampire's curse.",
