  "description": "One woman. Three men. All Dragons.An exciting, toe-curling reverse harem that will make your heart pound! When Raiden’s mother took over the Lightning Kingdom in a bloody coup that left the nation reeling, Maya and her suitors were forced to flee for their lives.  But running away has never been an option for Maya, and she’s not about to start now. Instead, she takes her sexy suitors North to demand help from Lord Fafnir, ruler of the Ice Dragon Clan and Jack’s formidable uncle.  But protection comes at a steep price, and the ice dragons do not help those they find unworthy. If Maya is to survive the North, she and her men will have to best the northerners in a series of brutal games designed to break even the fiercest of dragons.  If they win, Maya will gain a much needed alliance, and Raiden will be able to rescue his family from the evil clutches of his mother. If they lose…well, failure isn’t really an option. Luckily, if there’s anything Maya and her dragons know how to do best, it’s how to beat the odds…and stay warm for the winter…",
