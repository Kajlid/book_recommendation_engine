  "title": "Reichold Street",
  "description": "Set in a working-class American neighborhood in the turbulent 1960s Vietnam era, REICHOLD STREET deals with tough issues: alcoholism, bullying, family dysfunction, criminal activity, suicide, murder and the horrors of combat. It takes you from teenage introductions to the searing tragedy, yet remarkable redemption of war. Albert Parker arrives in the neighborhood, bringing with him the emotional scars of parental loss and all the aggressive attitude a dysfunctional and abusive step-father can create. His struggle to fit in, and the stories of the people around him as he tries, create a powerful story about friendship, love and loss. Masterfully written in the manner of J.D. Salinger (Catcher in the Rye), William Golding (Lord of the Flies) and Stephen King (The Body), this debut novel was a 2012 Readers Favorite Gold Medal Winner that KIRKUS REVIEWS calls \"Skillfully written and emotionally charged.\"",
