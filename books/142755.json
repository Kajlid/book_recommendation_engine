Here is a story rife with adventure, suspense, and a dash of humor, and it had me turning the pages deep into the night--and it will have you doing the same.\"Children with extraordinary psychic powers are being used as pawns in a deadly supernatural war.

Their only hope for salvation is a covert group called the Guardians, who protect these children from the organization's merciless hunters.Dr. Larssen SÃ¶ssnacher, the organization's leader--called \"Soulsnatcher\" by the remarkable children he abducts and exploits--believes Chaz is the miraculous prodigy who will grant him the immortality he craves... and he'll stop at nothing to get Chaz.Cody Jackson, a Guardian and martial arts and weapons expert, rescues Jazz and Chaz from Soulsnatcher's hunters and takes them to Homestead, a safe haven where the children learn to use their powers to help others.
