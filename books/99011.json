  "description": "Delgado, a resident of an intentional community in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic, has railed against his lot in life since he was born and rejected all attempts to more fully integrate him into the life of the community. When Juan, a young male carer, arrives on the scene, Delgado becomes more amenable. However, he takes a step backwards when Juan leaves to undertake similar work in the Deep South of the United States. Juan struggles to adapt to the foreign culture and community.In communities established with the express purpose of offering a home to people marginalised on account of their being seen as different, a great learning / healing experience can come to the fore, both for the residents being cared for and their carers. A common humanity often rises to the surface, blotting out apparent differences, as those sharing the lifestyle support and enable each other to grow. But a danger for some living in environments where there is a marked emphasis on healing is that they can fall into the trap of wallowing in their hurt. Unprepared to relinquish cockeyed perceptions of the world, they can reject the very process that would enable them to move forward.'Proper Respect for a Wound' tells a heartwarming and inspiring tale surrounding a small community in the Dominican Republic. The story \"finds the artistic potential and cultural currency of the personal confessional and crafts a tale that will lead his audience to identify with the disabled and their caregivers.\" - Mark Decker, Kaleidoscope Literary Magazine.",
