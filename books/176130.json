  "title": "Marbot: A Biography",
  "description": "Who was this Andrew Marbot, whose name is not listed in any dictionary? We are told that he was an English nobleman from the early 19th century, 1801-1830, an aesthetician and art psychologist who, in an astonishing way, anticipated the artistic insights of Freud and modernism. He travelled through France, Italy and Germany, visited Goethe in Weimar, knew Byron and Shelley, Turner and Delacroix, Leopardi, Platen and Schopenhauer. His book Art and Life, which was also translated into German, was published posthumously in 1834. Marbot soon found his first biographer, Hadley-Chase – and was then completely forgotten. Unjustly, as Hildesheimer shows. For Marbot was also an interesting character, not least because of the incestuous relationship he had with his mother, Lady Catherine Marbot.« Hanjo Kesting, Frankfurter Rundschau'",
