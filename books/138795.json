  "title": "The Intelligence Explosion: When AI Beats Humans at Everything",
  "description": "An easy-to-read and fast-paced exploration of the myriad issues raised by generative AI by the author of The Final Invention.It is hard to overstate the existential fear and wild cheerleading that the rapid release of generative artificial intelligence software has inspired at this point in time. At such a moment in time it is important that the public understand the dimensions of the release of these tools into the wilds, the positive and the negative, and how we might guard against what the leaders of the industry declare may well lead to our annihilation, but could also lead to our salvation if handled with the necessary forethought.The Intelligence Explosion is a fast-paced exploration of the myriad issues raised by generative AI, how major technology companies have cemented themselves and us to impossible-to-interpret and impossible-to-predict unstable computer systems; how we are on the edge of a cliff in the development of Artificial General Intelligence that carries the potential for immeasurable benefit and ultimate harm; and hope, which will require maximum effort and international buy-in to reestablish the science of Artificial Intelligence on comprehensible and safe grounds. As one of the premiere technology writers and researchers, James Barratt's The Intelligence Explosion will be one of the foreground exploration of AI.",
