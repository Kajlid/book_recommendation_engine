  "description": "Enter an all too conceivable future when the Religious Right has taken over our country and basically made everything fun illegal. Where AIDS has become even more letal, and those found to be HIV positive are shipped off to concentration camps that are so over-crowded and under-staffed that the dead often lay in their beds for days before being carted off the be burned. The Freedom Coalition is fighting in the West to free the country from the grip of the Right Party's fanatical leader, Heilinger, and his so-called \"Good Law,\" and the rebel forces are drawing nearer. Lorn Zany has seen too much death and injustice at the hands of the Right Party for one life time. New it looks like he might just live to see the Right America crumble. That is, of course, if he doesn't die of AIDS first.",
