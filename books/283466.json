  "description": "The continuation of the Number 1 new release on Amazon in Christian fantasy, Where the Garden Begins. A Leaf of Faith, the second book in the Messenger and Thieves series, stands aloneâ€”without the necessity of having read the first book. The Word has been vanquished. Truth has become relative. Evil thrives.The Five Realms of Here have long sought someone to save them from the evil that holds them captive. Prophecy foretells that a brother and sister will come with a friend, bringing hope and news of a peaceful king. The prophecy is true.The would-be heroes, Seth and Melissa, enter into a foreign world seemingly by chance, without much more than their faith as a guide. They are not alone, however. Unexpected help comes from the humblest in the animal kingdom; a little red fox and a daring dirt dauber. Together they set out on a dangerous mission to save one world, while unknowingly jeopardizing their own. Will both worlds be lost, or will this unlikely group of friends figure out the way to conquer evil?",
