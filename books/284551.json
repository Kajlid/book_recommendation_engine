  "description": "Jacky Leon is a member of the strongest werecat family alive; a family that commands the loyalty of every werecat that walks the face of the earth. Her family is the definition of power and none have dared challenge that for millennia. It’s not a legacy she’s comfortable with but it’s the one she’s been given and Jacky is resolved to do her best with her new responsibilities.  When rogue werecats begin to test Jacky’s territory, paranoia mounts as questions go unanswered and lives are potentially at stake. The greatest werecat family of all time is about learn a valuable lesson, and Jacky is going to have to suffer the most before it’s through with them.  Loyalty is worthless when it’s broken.",
