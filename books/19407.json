  "description": "Sandra Felton's foolproof strategies can help even the most frazzled reader become Messie No More. With humor and much-needed affirmation, she sheds light on emotional and physical reasons for messiness and shows why most organizational systems don't work for Messies. She then shows readers how to break free from messy behavior by changing their mind-set and arresting the stress that plagues them. Originally published in 1989 and with more than 90,000 copies sold, Messie No More is now thoroughly revised and updated with the latest information on attention deficit disorder and two new chapters dealing with fatigue and depression and their relevance to messiness. Each of the twenty chapters in the book ends with a question-and-answer section called \"Assess the Mess,\" which helps readers take practical steps in applying the book's principles. Messie No More contains the basis for a permanent change in readers who long for an orderly home but aren't sure how to have one. It is a practical guide that is sure to be snatched up by frustrated Messies everywhere.",
