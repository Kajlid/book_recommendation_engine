  "title": "Agatha Parrot and the Floating Head",
  "description": "A hilarious new series—Clarice Bean meets Horrid Henry. Includes Agatha's report at the end, on Henry VIII! Hiya! This book is about Odd Street School where I go along with mad Ivy who always jumps down stairs four at a time WAHOO! And Martha who is big and can stand up to boys. The oddest teacher we have is Miss Barking who wears goggles and gloves to use a pencil sharpener. The story is about when she tried to execute Martha with a floppy cardboard axe, but instead Martha's head floated off and exploded! Don't worry. Martha ends up eating ice cream—but if you want to know how, then you'll have to read the insides, won't you?",
