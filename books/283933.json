  "description": "She’s been promised a dream wedding. The catch? She was abducted from Earth and her groom is a hot alien warrior with a bad attitude.   Taken to a high-tech space station designed to entice human women, LA socialite Mandy is anything but impressed. She’s not falling for their holographic fantasy suites, their promise of a dream wedding, or their gorgeous, brawny warriors. Especially not the arrogant, hot-shot commander she’s been matched with. He may be used to being obeyed, but no way is she following HIS orders. She could care less that he's huge and ripped and drop-dead gorgeous. Right?  The last thing Dorn wants is a mate.  As a Drexian commander tasked with defending his people from a menacing enemy, he has no use for a frail human mate. Even if they are his species’ last chance for survival. Especially not one as spoiled as her.  But, unfortunately for him, he has no choice. Not if he wants to get back to his battleship and save both Earth and the Drexian race from extinction.  This standalone action romance novel features steamy scenes on a holographic fantasy space station, a high-strung alien wedding planner with a penchant for platform shoes, deadly aliens hell-bent on invading Earth, and smoking-hot Drexian warriors with extra erogenous zones who are equally determined to protect Earth.  If you like hot alien warriors, kick-ass Earth women, and steamy romance with a happily ever after and a few laughs, you’ll love Tamed, the first book in Tana Stone’s sci-fi romance Tribute Brides of the Drexian Warriors series.",
