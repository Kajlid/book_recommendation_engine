  "description": "A collection of poetry written over a span of dark years in my life, sometimes with hope for the future, sometimes without. I wrote about the images in my dreams, my daydreams, my nightmares - think of it as a verbal expression of a painting in my brain, with all the variations you would expect from colorful to minimalist, strict verse to free verse.I publish this in hopes that you can find some light of your own in the darkness (or, if you prefer, some darkness in the light).Available at Amazon (Kindle), Barnes & Noble (Nook), and Smashwords (variety of online viewable or downloadable files).",
