  "title": "A Voter's Journey",
  "description": "There are lots of books about great political figures. This is not one of them. Rather, this is a volume about politics as seen through the eyes of an ordinary citizen. Bill Lewers has been voting for decades. He believes that the individual voter is just as much a part of the tapestry of politics as the officeholders, pundits, and political operatives. With that as his guiding principle, he tells a tale that includes * growing up during the fifties in a tranquil New York suburb where \"Republican - good, Democrat - bad\" reigns supreme, * a young voter dealing with the turmoil of the sixties through the ballot box, * a collection of letters from various politicians of the 1970s, * some of the more \"marginal\" players on the political stage, * \"democracy in action\" as seen through the eyes of an election officer, * a \"March Madness\" tournament where our nation's presidents square off against each other, * and as a last-minute addendum: the fulfillment of a political junkie's dream of participating in a political convention which extends to multiple ballots.  Mostly though, this is a book about elections. Lots of them. They just keep coming year after year. This is the story of one voter's attempt to deal with and make sense out of them. In that regard, it is the story of each of us as we exercise the prerogatives and shoulder the responsibilities of this thing called democracy.",
