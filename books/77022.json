  "description": "Beyond the borders of our world, the nihilistic beings known only as Nightmares thirst for the destruction of all sentient life. Only one thing stands between our vulnerable human minds and their terrifying wrath: the existence of \"dreamkeepers,\" creatures whose very life force serves to protect us from the Nightmare horde. But this protection, this bond, is only effective as long as one's dreamkeeper lives -- a condition the Nightmares are all too eager to exploit. Because of this inherent threat to their lives, all dreamkeepers have a unique supernatural power with which to combat their otherworldly enemies.But it has been centuries since a Nightmare was last seen, and in the city of Anduruna, powers have been outlawed. \"Infractors\" face imprisonment or worse. Because in a perfect city, there is no place for violence, and the Nightmares of legend can be safely dismissed as ancient fiction... until now.",
