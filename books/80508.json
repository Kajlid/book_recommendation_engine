A rumor of a rumor says that one world was left open. What emerges from this world does not fail to leave its mark.Small as a pebble or tall as a tree, shadowy creatures carry out secret missions. Things have been taken, fates intertwined, and piece by piece another world begins to fall apart. The end of their world draws near unless help comes from an unlikely source. A thousand branches tremble at the thought of welcoming a dangerous thing, a foreign agent, a hummen.One boy thinks it’s just another one of his daydreams. Just a fancy dragonfly landing on his desk, he supposes, until he takes a closer look.
