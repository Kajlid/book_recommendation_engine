  "title": "Kincaid Magic: Jake",
  "description": "The Kincaid brothers are an integral part of a small town. Some people think they are witches, while others don't care...as long as they continue to help other townspeople. Jake, the middle brother, can sometimes predict the future, normally dealing with numerical situations, like stocks and lotto tickets. However, he has other abilities that he cannot control that are more disturbing-- he can sometimes sense emotions or see other people's dreams. When Linda moves across the street and begins having nightmares, he is reluctantly drawn into her life and her troubles. As they resolve her problems, they become closer and face Jake's emotional issues regarding his abilities. In the end, they realize that the tragedies they have faced have made them strong enough to love each other.",
