If they can claim us as a territory, youths will be shipped to factory planets, and mineral resources will be strip mined layer by layer.Chor'Tan are friendly to mankind. They are close to us genetically. Their race is limited by the males of the species. A male Chor'Tan is no more intelligent than an Earth crocodile or alligator, and they want to cross breed with humanity to create a species with smart males.

He works with a team of other agents, going on missions trying to put an end to Centurian's reign of terror.",
