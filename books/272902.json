Two gorgeous, imperfect men who turn into wolves. They're both equally mine and I can never choose.  The third brother, Hunter, is marrying the love of his life. A human shaman with powers like mine. News of the wedding traveled fast in the shifter world, and has attracted a variety of esteemed guests.  I always thought my two wolf men were more than enough. But a surprise wedding guest has me questioning everything...  This reverse harem short story takes place after the events of Curtain Call, the final book in the Harem of Freaks series.
