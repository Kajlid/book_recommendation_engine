  "description": "Tim Carlyle is a young policeman in the sleepy Australian town of Millbrook who is about to come face to face with the strangest of ‘zombie apocalypses’.A local biotech company has been working with a strain of the Cordyceps fungus, famous for turning hapless ants into ‘zombies’ before devouring them from the inside.Unfortunately for everyone concerned, on the property next to the biotech’s laboratory, a local miscreant, Craig Mawson, is cultivating a clandestine marijuana crop. When spores from the Cordyceps cross-pollinate with the marijuana, things get bad. Really bad. It starts with Mawson turning into a very stoned zombie who infects his mother Rhonda, who goes on to eat his father Bill, underpants and all.It goes downhill from there.The infected seem to have ‘The Munchies’, but not the kind that can be sated by a packet of Sour Cream & Chives flavoured Pringles. Nothing short of actual flesh will suffice for those infected.Fate assembles a motley crew around Tim to help contain the outbreak. From his kind-hearted boss, Sergeant Graham Gibson, to the local naturopath and hippie Janet, to the local right wing military fanatic Dick Kelly - who has, at various times, claimed to be not only ex-SAS but also ex-Navy Seal and ex-French Foreign Legion - impressing and convincing exactly zero people in the townEventually the group realises that it is not just the infected they need to worry about and they will need to draw on all their disparate skills to overcome The Munchies.",
