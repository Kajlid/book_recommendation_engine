  "description": "A guidebook to seducing, satisfying, and loving the only man you’'ll ever need In an act of generosity, Adrian Colesberry has written an exquisitely detailed guidebook to ensure that every reader knows precisely how to please him— in bed and beyond. Brimming with self-indulgent and incredibly bawdy humor, How to Make Love to Adrian Colesberry is a sexual memoir disguised as a manual on Colesberry’s pet peeves, favorite positions, and surefire ways to turn on your man (aka Adrian Colesberry). Recounting dozens of annoying peccadilloes and helpful pro tips gleaned from his experiences with former lovers, Colesberry covers all corners to ensure that no stage of the court-and-conquer process is overlooked. Beginning with how to attract Colesberry, he later progresses to foreplay and finally the full monty, revealing his own erratic, often unerotic sexual history along the way. From his awkwardly celibate teenage years to the emotional scars inflicted by his domineering ex-wife, Colesberry muses on bondage, three-ways, toys, bi-curiosity, and other kinks. A pitch-perfect parody that spares no detail, How to Make Love to Adrian Colesberry is a hilarious and filthy new entrant into the fratire genre.",
