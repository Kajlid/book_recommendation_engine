  "description": "Rogrig Wishard is a killer, a liar and a thief. Rogrig is the last person the fey would turn to for help. But they know something he doesn’t. In a world without government or law, where a man’s loyalty is to his family and faerie tales are strictly for children, Rogrig is not happy to discover that he’s carrying faerie blood. Especially when he starts to see them wherever he goes. To get his life back, he’s going to have to journey further from home than he’s ever been before and find out what the fey could possibly want from him. But that’s easier said than done when the punishment for abandoning your family is death.",
