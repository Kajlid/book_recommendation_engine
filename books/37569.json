Their holiday away to find each other soon becomes a struggle for their very survival when they are suddenly thrust into a wild and unpredictable land filled with unnatural and deadly threats at every turn. The question is no longer will they regain what they have lost from each other, but rather how will they survive, 'the drive'.",
