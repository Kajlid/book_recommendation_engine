  "description": "Not Her Real Name is the stylish debut of a new and startlingly young international literary voice. A collection of twelve stories peopled by over-sensitive twenty-somethings, Not Her Real Name transcends the self-indulgence that generally plagues the slacker genre and brings modern life into harsh and comic focus.With a cinematic vision for character and dialogue and a cast of young and painfully vulnerable metropolitans, Perkins speaks to twenty-somethings like no one else. With unnerving wit and insight, these stories deal with diverse subjects, from a chance meeting with an old lover in a supermarket to a couple's ill-fated trip to discover the real Prague, to a drama student pissed off by Clown class Not Her Real Name presents an essential guide to post-modern romance, to the vagaries of city life and to a chronically self-absorbed generation whose love affairs are never as good as the last movies they've seen.",
