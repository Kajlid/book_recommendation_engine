  "description": "I remember the days when it was me and the ice. The jarring sounds that my skates would make when they’d slice through my frozen stage.Remembering my mother’s smiling face as she watched me perform. She was so proud. She was the best.Then she was taken suddenly. I never even got to say goodbye. It was her wish that I go to Russia to discover my roots, and I did.I never, in a million years, would foresee what would happen after that. In order to survive, sometimes you have to do things that you’re not proud of.My entire life has been a performance. At first, it was the ice.And now… it’s behind an 8 millimeter camera.",
