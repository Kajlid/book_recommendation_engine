  "description": "Dameon Gardener has recently learned that he is The Last Gardener, the person solely responsible for saving the world from drying up and dying. He was able to save the vault of seeds for the future, but now Dameon and Lan must travel to a time when the post-nuclear earth is flooded with the tempestuous waters of the melted ice caps in hopes of saving at least one drop for the withering future. But will they be able to navigate through the raging, creature-infested waters with crazy Captain Hurley at the helm? Especially since it isnâ€™t just pirates and Elementerpise they have to worry about chasing after them. Deadly plagues and the beasts of The Howling are also on the prowl. And most importantly, will they be able to find the life-saving serum and return in time to save Jaxson before it is too late?",
