  "description": "Book 2 of 5 in the Club Oxygen SeriesI used to have everything. Then my everything was ripped away from me. Now, instead of the warmth of his love, I feel the coldness of his loss. The darkness that remains in me is frightening.  I don't want to feel anything. The cold has a nice numbing effect. I've decided to embrace it. I've also decided that even though I no longer feel, I do still need. I need to bind, flog, and Dominate younger men.  Especially one in particular. I know he thinks he can change me. Thaw my frozen heart. He cries so beautifully for me; I could almost believe in love again. But I could never love another man the way I did my husband and Master. Not even my eager young submissive. He will never be my love...only my Plaything.",
