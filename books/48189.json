  "description": "Sassy Road is tough, beautiful, smart and looking for a little retribution against the stepfather who abused her. Logan belongs to Heroes and Rogues, a small town renegade motorcycle club with a bad reputation. Only Logan isn’t exactly loyal to the MC. He’s an undercover cop who’s been in place for several years, and he’s days away from taking down rival club leader Damsel Road. A new gal arrives at the H & R clubhouse and, after spending time with Sassy, Logan quickly realizes the newcomer is the step-daughter of a man he is supposed to put away for life. Unable to deny his infatuation with the lovely Miss Road, Logan’s life just became more complicated. To make the situation worse, vultures are circling. If Logan doesn’t claim Sassy as his old lady, club members will pass her around for their own twisted pleasure.  Logan refuses to see Sassy used, but when he discovers her true motive for associating with the Heroes and Rogues , he fears an intimate involvement could destroy them both. Then again, losing Sassy is a higher price than he’s willing to pay.",
