  "description": "In a novel rejected by a major publisher in the 19th century as too shocking for its time, writer Charles W. Chesnutt (1858-1932) challenges the notion that race, class, education, and gender must define one's \"rightful\" place in society. Both a romance and a mystery, MANDY OXENDINE tells the compelling story of two fair-skinned, racially mixed lovers who chose to live on opposite sides of the color line .",
