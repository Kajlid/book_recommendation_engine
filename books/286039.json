  "description": "When Casey Willardson is assigned to tutor Thomas Fairbairn  also known as Baby  she approaches her task with great trepidation. Baby is a member of the Clan, a mysterious group of young men who do not talk to outsiders or participate in school. Baby and Casey's relationship is awkward at first, but soon they turn to each other. As the Clan drifts from it's mooring, Baby grows distant from his brother and the rest of the group that he considers family. As as Casey takes a step away from her own secure world, everything she counted on is turned upside down. Kristen D. Randle has written a story that is absorbing and unusal, insightful and outspoken, about two teenagers whose lives become intertwined  and a collision that forces them to make difficult choices.  00-01 Tayshas High School Reading ListBooks for the Teen Age 2001 (NYPL)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n Kristen D.
