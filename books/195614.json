  "description": "*This book is a standalone. Each book in The Bennett Family series will follow a different couple.*  Logan Bennett knows his priorities. He is loyal to his family and his company. He has no time for love, and no desire for it. Not after a disastrous engagement that left him broken-hearted. When Nadine enters his life, she turns everything upside down.  She’s sexy, funny, and utterly captivating. She’s also more stubborn than anyone he’s met. . .including himself.  Nadine Hawthorne is finally pursuing her dream: opening her own clothing shop. After working so hard to get here, she needs to concentrate on her new business, and can’t afford distractions. Not even if they come in the form of Logan Bennett. He’s handsome, charming, and doesn’t take no for an answer. After bitter disappointments, Nadine doesn’t believe in love. But being around Logan is addicting. It doesn’t help that Logan’s family is scheming to bring them together at every turn.  Their attraction is sizzling, and their connection—undeniable. Slowly, Logan wins her over. What starts out as a fling soon spirals into much more than they are prepared for.  When a mistake threatens to tear them apart, will they have the strength to hold on to each other?  *This read is recommended for ages 18+ due to mature content.",
