Demoniac Dance A young girl running away from an unwanted marriage finds a new life among the mysterious magicians in the land across the river. What she didnâ€™t bargain for is the presence of the goblins who have befriended her benefactors.  Power of the Dance Khemael is a creature of beauty and grace with a mostly human appearance. His love of stretching his leather-like wings and flying freely in the world of men brings far too much attention to the existence of the goblins.
