  "description": "Nothing says Texas like a drive-thru liquor barn. If you've ever driven through one you know it is floor to ceiling liquor. It is like a museum. It's an awe inspiring collection of scotch, beer, whiskey, brown liquor, blue liquor and creamy white liquor, hard stuff , girly stuff and mixed drinks. The bartender came to my car with a tray full of Styrofoam cups. Each had a sliver of clear tape across the straw hole. I thought, Is he kidding? A piece of tape? That slight piece of tape was apparently going to save my ass from jail, should I have gotten pulled over by the police. Adrian Jackson is a freelance columnist in Beeville, Texas. She holds a masters degree from Texas Tech University (Go Red Raiders!) In her spare time, she works at a local college; raises a daughter, a pair of Labs and a cat; and entertains the idea of earning a Ph.D.",
