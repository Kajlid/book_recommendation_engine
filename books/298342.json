  "description": "Shorts - a take on poetry is the first collection of poems by Eric Daniel Clarke – a reflection on life, on human relationships, on chances taken and those missed.Written in a spontaneous, sparse, free-form style, disciplined by a trained sub-conscious mind, this generous collection of deceptively simple yet inventive poetry invites contemplation, interpretation and gives rise to smiles.Eric Daniel Clarke, an Englishman, a scientist, a life spent working at the interface of the physical and life sciences, now using words in place of molecules to explore life’s boundaries, imagined, real, of his mind, and yours.",
