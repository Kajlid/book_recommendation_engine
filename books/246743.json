  "description": "A boss-employee romance... with a twist.  Only three things stand between Ava Carmichael and her twelve billion dollar inheritance:  1. A year of living in Bliss, Kansas.  2. A relationship that lasts six consecutive months. 3. A pie.  Ava has run a multi-billion-dollar company, negotiated with shark investors, and hobnobbed with business royalty, but she’s about to be defeated by her inability to turn sugar, flour, and apple pie filling into something edible.  Conveniently, the owner of the diner next door, Parker Blake, is magic in the kitchen. And he technically works for her. So she can make him teach her to bake. And, hey, if everyone assumes they’re heating up more than the oven during their time in the kitchen… well, that’s called multitasking.  Parker Blake likes his women the way he likes his coffee: not in his diner. But gorgeous, strong-willed, type-A Ava clearly isn’t going to stop messing up his kitchen — or his simple, stress-free small town life — until the conditions of her daddy’s will are met. So, sure, he’ll teach his “boss” to bake.  But once the kitchen door closes, it’s pretty clear who’s really in charge.",
