  "description": "Edward DeVere, 600 and some year old vampire, resident of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, has been taking it easy.London is home sweet home and Eddy considers himself a Renaissance man; a bit of a modern day ‘flaneur’. Some would say a ‘slacker’ and a bit of a ‘stoner’. Opinions are divided.Eddy knows the city like the back of his hand. Life is ordered, predictable and boring. Until someone near and dear disappears and he is left with no choice but to find out why.It should just be a night’s work for such an ‘old timer’.But things don’t go as planned.Eddy’s cosy world starts to fall apart.Nothing is what it seems.It’s time to wake up, smell the coffee and roll his sleeves up.It’s a damn nuisance, he’s exhausted and could really do without all this ‘tom tit’.But it seems, there’s just no rest for the wicked.",
