  "description": "Gin has recently accepted that she is a lesbian. She also may just remain a loner for all of eternity. Meanwhile, across from her in class, Johnny is battling life at school and at home. His day-to-day life consists of a heavy dose of bulimia, self-hate, and abuse from his father. The two loners come together, connected by shared misery, but can they admit how much they need each other before it's too late?",
