  "description": "Shane Kalman looked forward to exchanging military life for a civvy job where he could freely be out of the closet, but the position he lands is nothing like he imagined. He didn’t plan to work undercover for a corrupt detective agency, much less gathering dirt on the city’s most dangerous crime boss. And he sure as heck didn’t expect to have his mind temporarily switched with a tabby cat in order to do it.His fellow agent, Jamison Rees, is a charmer and sometimes a German shepherd, but Shane doesn’t need animal instincts to know that he’s hiding something. When the job goes south and Shane’s brother becomes a target for the crime boss’s wrath, all evidence points to a mole in the detective agency. A dog may be man’s best friend, but is he a cat’s? Can Shane trust Jamison at all?",
