  "title": "From a Strident World of Soft Prevailing Things: Poems About Our Human, Animal and Vegetal Environment",
  "description": "The book is divided into four parts - Creatrix, Physiography, Animal Kind, Human Kind. There are some descriptive poems, but the greater part of the book is devoted to stories, (many are true incidents) about People, Animals, the Physical and Vegetal environments. Everything lives in this book and if it is mechanical, well we infuse life into it when we use it. All forms of life have their mysteries, trials and triumphs and yet there is always humour. Kindness and humour will always carve a way.",
