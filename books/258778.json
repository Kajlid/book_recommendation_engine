  "description": "Part witch, part ghost, total book nerd.  Gemma Abbott is a dead witch. Sort of. As a pure Essex witch, she’s permanently attached to Mother Earth’s ley lines. Pure magic equals life force. Which is the only thing that’s stopping Gemma’s body from dying and her soul from moving on.  A Paranormal MI5 agent, Gemma’s life work is to protect the ley lines. The magic contained within them is sacred, pure. When a serial killer starts leaving clues for Gemma, she quickly realises that not only does he know her secret, he’s trying to steal the magic out from under her.  As each new body is found, Gemma feels the lessening of magic that keeps her alive. She has no choice but to tell the one person she trusts. Dave, the cute admin guy. Although he sits behind a desk, his geeky mind could solve anything. Together, they have to find the serial killer, before he drains the Earth of magic, and kills every living thing on it.",
