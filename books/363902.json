  "description": "If you have ever picked up a book on going green, you most likely put it back down after a quick glance. They all seem to have the same problem; these books are made for people with money! Buy solar panels, get a wind turbine, go geothermal, new insulation and such. These things cost a lot of time and money. Going Green Without Going Broke was written for those of us who have limited resources. You may have some money set off to the side, or you may not. Either way, this book is for you. The suggestions in this book range in cost from FREE to about $80. Between these covers you will find 25 ways to go green without emptying your wallet. Most of them will even put a little green back in! We have heard for years that it's greener and cheaper to make it yourself. Is it really? I have done studies on that very thing so you can make an informed decision rather than the expensive trial and error method. Minimal impact on your wallet, minimal impact on your lifestyle; BIG impact on the environment.",
