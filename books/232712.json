  "description": "Poetry. \"This small book of flesh/no flesh takes, as its swift gesture, the act of inscribing something on the arm as much as the leg, the heart as much as the head. This book is a mental and bodily map of desire. Writing is what we read right there, on the 'new walls' of the skin, and it makes the skin react with, as this writer deliciously describes, a 'fine bristle'\"--Bhanu Kapil.",
