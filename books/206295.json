The guy you'd never bring home to your parents. His looks are pure sex, and the only fun he knows how to have is the filthy kind.  I've known him for years. No one in their right mind thinks I should date him. But now I've grown up - and everything has changed. I want him, even if it's just for a little while. Until I can't let him go.  Dean  I'm not that guy - the relationship guy. I'm the one-and-done guy, or so everyone says. But when Holly bets me she can date me for four weeks, I'm not going to say no. She's grown up gorgeous - and now I've got my chance.  I don't deserve her. It can't get serious. I can't get my feelings involved, because there are things she doesn't know about me. But until it falls to pieces, I can give her the wildest, hottest four weeks of her life....  *This is a full-length standalone with no cheating and an HEA*  Also by Julie Kriss: Bad Wedding (Jason and Megan's story): www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2TUKBK/ Break Me: A Stepbrother Romance: www.amazon.com/dp/B0189LNS4Q Play Hard: A Stepbrother Romance: www.amazon.com/dp/B01AIXIMLM",
