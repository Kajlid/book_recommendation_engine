  "title": "The Disappearance of the Universe: Straight Talk about Illusions, Past Lives, Religion, Sex, Politics, and the Miracles of Forgiveness",
  "description": "What would you do if you were sitting quietly in your living room when a mysterious couple appeared from out of nowhere—and then told you they were \"ascended masters\" who had come to reveal some shocking secrets of existence and teach you the miraculous powers of advanced forgiveness? When two such teachers appeared before Gary Renard in 1992, he chose to listen to them (and ask a lot of impertinent questions). The result is this startling book: an extraordinary record of 17 mind-bending conversations that took place over nearly a decade, reorienting the author’s life and giving the world an uncompromising introduction to a spiritual teaching destined to change human history.",
