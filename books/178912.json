  "description": "He has a touch of genius, but no talent for romance—until he meets her . . .   Tony Santangelo has a mild form of autism called Asperger’s Syndrome—but it hasn’t stopped him from finding success as a songwriter under the name “Art E.” His condition makes him unusually honest and straightforward, which can sometimes make things awkward with women. Despite his musical accomplishments—and his six-foot frame, dark blue eyes, and wavy black hair—the handsome Brooklynite has lived a bit of a lonely life, though he does have a caring brother to keep him company. And hobbies to keep him busy, like obsessively watching the Weather Channel . . .   But when he meets Trina Woods, he’s suddenly tempted to leave his comfort zone. The beautiful nurse seems to appreciate his shyness and sensitivity, and even his little eccentricities. Meanwhile, Trina’s gotten herself onto a reality show, and before they know it, they’re the media’s hot new Cinderella story.   But under the glare of spotlights—as Tony copes with his overprotective brother and overwhelming celebrity—the two must face trouble head on, and write their own one-of-a-kind love song . . .",
