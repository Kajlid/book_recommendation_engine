  "description": "Only twenty-nine, Darius Lucilius is a war hero and charismatic military commander. When he is sent to conquer the island of Hibernia and add it to the Roman Empire’s territories, he expects to be home within a year. But the strange Celtic tribes who dwell within Hibernia’s forests are not easily subdued.  After Darius’s fort is destroyed by an enemy tribe, his life is saved by Fionn, a mysterious Celtic warrior hiding more than one secret. Darius finds himself drawn to the beautiful, deadly, and mercurial Fionn, even as Rome’s fortunes in Hibernia grow increasingly dire.  Now trapped in the haunting, ancient wilderness he sought to conquer, can Darius place his trust in an enemy of Rome as two worlds collide and thousands of lives hang in the balance?  Set in Ancient Ireland, The Owl Prince is perfect for fans of Captive Prince and The Magpie Lord.",
