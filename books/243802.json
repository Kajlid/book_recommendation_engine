  "description": "“We think our father murdered our mother,” a woman tells police. Twenty-eight years earlier, young housewife Donna Burgard was stabbed to death. No killer was captured, although her husband was the prime suspect. Now, as the victim’s grown children request a fresh investigation, Detective Mark Bennett is plunged into murky shadows of the past. Can the truth still be uncovered? The Bennett family is dealing with its own challenges. While Mark navigates a new marriage, his mother is lost in dementia. Memories swirl as she talks knowingly about unfamiliar names and events. Younger brother Bobby—a Buffalo patrolman— feels the job and his wife pulling him in separate directions. Within these chasms, secrets stretch back for decades... Deftly weaving between 1984 and 1956, Chased By Thunder is a fast-paced story that may be read as a stand-alone novel. It is the final book in a four-story arc that includes Broken and Profane, Boneshaker, and Faces and Fingertips.",
