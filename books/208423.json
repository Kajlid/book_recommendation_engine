  "description": "A secret baby. A stepbrother that can't forget her. \n \nForbidden Love\n  Some women are untouchable. Like a stepsister who's alive because of his sacrifice.  Snare is part of the Road Kill MC, and as sergeant at arms, he takes his role as protector seriously.  He always has.  Snare doesn't discuss the scar that almost took his eye or the ultimate protection it provided for the only woman he's ever loved.  The sweet butts provide the distraction he needs and the emotional disconnect he craves.  Snare is married to the club. He doesn't need a woman who disappears without a trace.  \nGuilt\n  Sarah tries not to think of Snare. It was one night. And he paid for it—they both did.  The nightmares don't even interrupt her dreams. Much.  Except for the secret she keeps of the child they had together, life couldn't be more perfect.  Sarah knows that Snare isn't the type of man to toy with—or lie to. But when her abuser took things too far, Sarah couldn't allow Snare to protect her any longer. She fled and hasn't seen her stepbrother since.  The price for their love was more than fists and rage.It was flesh and blood.  Can Sarah hide the truth from the one man who protected her with his own life? Will Snare deny his true feelings because of scars that run more than skin deep?  Snare is a full-length, standalone romantic suspense novel with hot sex, no cheating, strong language, an HEA ending and NO CLIFFHANGERS. Contains disturbing themes that might be uncomfortable for some. Perfect for fans of Joanna Wylde, and who also like the dark fare of Pepper Winters.",
