  "description": "Kaplyn faces a dilemma. In a heart-pounding journey through a bedevilled tower set with traps he must find an ancient Eldric talisman. Everything in the tower seems unreal and he must use all his cunning to survive. Vastra, a self-professed sorcerer, claims the talisman will reveal the whereabouts of the Eldric, a lost race whose sorcerers were instrumental in defeating Drachar and the demon hordes in the legendary Krell Wars. But is Vastra to be trusted? He is manipulative and lusts for power and harbours a secret for which he will kill to protect. Their journey is fraught with danger and there are indications that demons are crossing the Divide, but are these random events or more worryingly an indication that Dracharâ€™s might is once more on the rise?In a world rife with superstition, no one wants to believe that a future demon threat is real. The dread that a demon can materialise anywhere and take souls for eternal damnation is horrifying. The Prophecy is largely forgotten, and the people prefer blissful ignorance to truth. Krell have been banished to the wild and the tribes fight among themselves. Guardian spirits watch over the people but for most, this link is tenuous at best, yet for a select few this link is strong, and the enemy will seek an advantage in that. For the moment the land is at peace, but evil is stirring, and peace can be shattered. War is coming. A war like no other.Prophecy of the Kings is a Gold Award Winner on Readersfavorite.com 2010 and was Book of the Month SFBooks.com.",
