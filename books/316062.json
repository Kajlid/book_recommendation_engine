  "description": "\"52 Affirmations to Spark Change and Pursue Happiness\" was birthed out of therapy, hardships, and life experiences. During the rocky roads, we had to throw up our hands and say enough is enough. We decided to end the pity parties and change our thought processes. We learned that our mindset changes our entire life journey. When we were at the end of our rope, we altered our outlook on life and started to look at life differently.Incorporating positive thinking and positive words turns your entire life around. Our thoughts and words determine our future and what comes next. Knowing that our mouth determines our fate, led to writing positive affirmations. Instead of dwelling in self-pity and depression, we bundled that energy to something far greater. We took our power back and started to speak what we wanted into existence.It is amazing how life can change when you view it positively. Looking at this life journey from a spiritual basis gives us a new perspective. We now visualize what we want to happen in our lives, write it down, speak the life we expect , and it becomes manifested in our lives. We no longer use any negative language. We embrace positivity in all aspects, from our thoughts, ideas, words, and actions.",
