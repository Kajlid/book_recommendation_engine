  "description": "Who's the Most Haunted One of All? When Ivy Spookerton realizes that her apartment is too small for all of her pets she decides to move. But where will she and her pets feel most at home? With the help of realtor Lady MacBeth she sets out to find the most haunted house in all of Pumpkinville. \"Clever and beautiful! This children's book will charm readers of all ages. Ivy's journey to find a new home brings her to a house unlike any she's ever seen. More amazing are the stories Ivy learns about its old owner Viathan the Magician.\"-Heidi Ruby Miller, author Ambasadora \"My daughter has always been a voracious reader and it is increasingly difficult to find clever, fun and original children's books that don't bore her (and me) after a few reads. BETTER HAUNTED HOMES & GARDENS is among the finest children's books I have added to my daughter's library. The artwork is stupendous -- think Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND film -- and the writing is imaginative and thoughtful.\"-D. Harlan Wilson, author The Kyoto Man",
