  "description": "\"A SERIOUS MISTAKE,\" a novel (Book Two in \"The Grievance Committee\" series) The Law is not just a job for criminal defense lawyer Scott Lonnigan, It's his life. Scott treats his appointment to the Grievance Committee in San Antonio, Texas the same way. He uses common sense in judging complaints against lawyers since each represents a story of hopes and fears for both parties. Each accusation means at least one person made a serious mistake. Maybe the lawyer accused of settling without the client's consent? Maybe the lawyer accused of extortion and harassment of the other party, an ob-gyn? Maybe the dead lawyer in the stolen airplane caper in the Bahamas? Maybe the baby lawyer accused of falsely advertising his abilities in the Yellow Pages? Now, it's Scott's turn because a serious mistake threatens to turn Scott's world upside down. When the judge is the accused, will Justice be there for him? Or will retribution? How will Scott find redemption?",
