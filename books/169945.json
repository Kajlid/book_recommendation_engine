  "description": "Emmy Ellison is a good, wholesome woman. Sebastian Black is an ultra-sexy hero who saves her life. Due to the effects of alcohol, she ends up between the sheets with Mr. Handsome. The next morning she sneaks off, certain that the gorgeous Adonis only wants a one-night stand. Unfortunately, while she can flee from her hunky savior, she discovers something she can't run from-—a baby. But when she goes to tell Sebastian that she's pregnant, she's shocked that he wants to marry her and help her raise the baby. At first, she's overjoyed, but she soon realizes that the father of her child has secrets. He's a werewolf and the leader of a massive pack. The truth drives Emmy away from Sebastian's loving arms. Can she eventually accept that she's carrying the Alpha's baby, or will she let Sebastian's true identity destroy her life-—and her child's as well?",
