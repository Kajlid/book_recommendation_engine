In a town like this, it's hard to keep a secret—but Dr. June Hudson has managed to keep one heck of a humdinger.…Though visits from her secret lover, undercover DEA agent Jim Post, are as clandestine as they are passionate, somehow it fits with her demanding schedule as the town's doctor—a calling that requires an innate ability to exist on caffeine, sticky buns and nerves of steel.But how can a secret lover compete with a flesh-and-blood heartthrob from her past? June's old flame has just returned to town after twenty years—and he's divorced. June is seriously rattled. So when the town's most devoted wife takes buckshot to her husband and some human bones turn up in her aunt Myrna's backyard, she's almost happy for the distraction.Sooner or later, love will have its way in Grace Valley. It always does.",
