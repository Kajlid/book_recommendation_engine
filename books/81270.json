  "title": "Yearning for Nothings and Nobodies",
  "description": "A story about wanting change so badly your teeth itch. When an eleven-year-old girl finds her drug-addicted and mentally ill mother after a seven year separation, she hopes the yearning can finally cease. Instead, a cycle of painfully familiar longing envelops her, until she is freed by losing what she never had. Darkly humorous tales of dropping acid with the town pedophile, playing pool with gun-toting pimps and spending time in Japanese prison cells with strippers and refugees, are sewn together with poignant emotion in this edgy but relatable coming of age story.",
