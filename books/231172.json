  "description": "In Waresville, a haunted tourist trap, there are very few surprises. Vampire attack? Werewolf gang roll into town? That’s just a typical week in the most supernatural town in America. Here, spooky tour buses, magic shops, and haunted houses are on every corner, and it’s an off day when someone doesn’t meet a sticky end. If the chaos stops, the tourism cash stops rolling in. But when a lake monster resurfaces just outside of town and takes a bite out of a dead body, that’s enough to make even these townspeople take notice. Especially Harper Beck, amateur sleuth, witch, and the woman with the bright, green Afro wig. With her friends and her sexy, detective husband, Wyatt Bennett, by her side, Harper thinks she can take on anything. Her theory is about to be put to the test. When her best friend’s ex-husband washes up on shore with a gunshot wound and a chunk missing from him, she snatches up the case. Soon, the mystery unfolds to involve environmentalists, a monster obsessed fisherman, and a whole slew of people who wanted the victim dead. Harper is used to investigating in the seething underbelly of Waresville, but is she ready to take that investigation underwater? With an old enemy’s freedom at stake, she may have no choice but to dive in head first, taking her chances with what lies below. And if Harper isn’t careful, she might end up in the belly of the beast. Novella (approx. 40,000 words). Eleventh Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
