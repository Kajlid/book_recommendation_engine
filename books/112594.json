  "description": "The battle to live in sync with the environment may not be with the planet… A tale of love and other human achievements.Set in an imminently possible future, cultures collide when two teenagers of a Rural Tribe are forced to deal with the arrival of Kali, a City Raider. Can she help their home avoid inevitable disaster, or is she bringing it upon them all?Many, many years ago we had already mastered how to obtain the sustenance we needed from this Earth. We have continued to evolve our lives, technology and environment since, but to what benefit?ADAPTATION is a social philosophy adventure dedicated to a new generation of readers, where again these questions are increasingly being asked of ourselves, and of each other. It is the adventure and common goals of survival that we all share together, despite our differences. Told from the perspective of teenagers enforced on a journey through our world’s contradictions, the tale is an allegory for the conflict, angst, failures and achievements experienced by all ages.\"So really, how are we to know what is the right thing to do? I think… it’s what I can feel deep down in my heart, and I continue to hope everyone wants a good outcome too… Even if they’re as bad as me…\"Any apocalypse is irrelevant when compared to those that you love, and adaptation is eternal.",
