The store-bought ones may sometimes be too sugary, too salty, or too filled with jam, or too many chocolate chips or too little nuts, etc. The list of complaints may not end but when you make them at home, there is no hassle of being disappointed. You will make it customized to your palate. In this book, you will find 30 exciting and delicious cookies recipes that are very different from one another.",
