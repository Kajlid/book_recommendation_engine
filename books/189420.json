  "title": "Forever Again",
  "description": "Fifteen years ago, Gena Taylor and Travis Ryan were forced into a marriage neither wanted, the price they paid after one night of passion. But what he believed to be a lie forced Travis to walk out of her life shortly thereafter, crushing Gena's dreams of a happily ever after with the only man she'd ever loved. Fifteen years later, Travis and Gena meet again. Only now, she owns the inn he's considering for his wedding-to another woman. And this time, she's guarding her heart carefully. She's not going to allow him to hurt her-or their daughter. Despite their resolve to keep things impersonal, the past comes rushing back and feelings they both thought long dead rise from the ashes. But there are other lives at stake now, including that of the child Travis once thought was a lie.",
