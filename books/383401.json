  "description": "\"Dear Mrs. I stand today at the edge of a New being kicked out of my house!\" So writes the 16-year-old Vijay to Jackie Kennedy in this \"powerful\" comic novel published in 10 countries, with over 50 printed reviews and eight 5-star Amazon reviews.Only ten years earlier, the 6-year-old Vijay had been separated from his parents and handed over into the care of Catholic nuns in Mangalore, a sleepy town on India's West Coast.Now, at 16, having overcome the canes of the nuns and Jesuits and his Catholic brainwashing, Vijay decides he is going to make love to at least 100 women by the age of 30.But first, he must learn how to deal with his erection.By the time he knows what to do with his erection, Vijay has followed his American Dream and landed in America, only to discover that Campbell’s Cream of Chicken soup wasn’t the mouthwatering delicacy the advertisements in Readers Digest had made it out to be.How he gets from there to the understanding that there is more to the meaning of life than sex or Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup is for the reader to discover.This is Richard Crasta’s best-known novel, and it was a sensation in India. Kurt Vonnegut called it “very funny”, and it has been published in ten different countries and in seven languages and sold 25,000 copies in print.The author has now disowned the Sunstar (American) edition as a mistake and a dilution of the original; the Amazon Kindle or Invisible Man Books version is the approved edition.“Hilarious.”—Time Out.“Hilarious and delicate.”—The Face, U.K.“Indefatigable good humor, charm”—Publishers Weekly.“An Indian Catcher in the Rye”—Mark Ledbetter",
