  "description": "In a supernatural world where Hell's been over capacity since World War II, Satan has no choice but to open the Gates of Hell. When Barry's tricked by his demon boss into signing a contract to serve Satan, he's faced with a choice to help release the damned souls through a portal to earth or turn to God's army. Either choice comes with a price, and with a screw up like Barry at the center of it all, there's no telling if God or Satan will win this battle between good and evil?",
