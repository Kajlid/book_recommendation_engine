But even though she is paid very well for a summer internship at Future Faith Cryonics, she regrets accepting a job \"baby sitting\" frozen bodies and seeing creepy and condescending Dr. Klein every day. When Dr. Klein actually attempts to revive the frozen corpses, Pam wonders if she will even live to regret her mistake. Enter hard-bitten combat veteran Captain Crawford, friendly Corporal Gordon, and Hercules - an obese deli owner and the grandson of a witch. Can they help Pam find the answers to the cure for the zombie apocalypse before it spreads too far?",
