  "description": "\"A touch of the sun, and you be caught. So you mind the fog. Keep this side of it. Sun burns off the fog and happen you're there, then there you will stay.\"The old fisherman's warning meant nothing to Claudia. And the odd metal object, shaped like a man, that he kept hidden in his fireplace seemed only curious, puzzling. But as she and her young stepbrother Evan learn more about the bronze man's strange power, they are drawn deeper and deeper into another place and another time. In an engrossing blend of fantasy and reality, a twentieth-century boy and girl move between an island off the coast of Maine and the world of Iron Age Ireland. Caught up in the passions and intrigues of Medb the warrior-queen and Cathbad the High Druid, of Fergus and his foster son Cuchulain (the Hound of Culann), Claudia and Evan face great danger and gain a new understanding of love and loyalty, courage and fear.The Sword of Culann is at the same time an exciting adventure story, a vivid re-creation of an ancient and celebrated legend, and a sensitive exploration of the emotional growth of two young people.",
