  "description": "No simple man is ever really simple. Nobody is just “the hero” or “the soldier.” We all walk many different paths to get to “that moment” – the one that defines …The one that tests our mettle in front of strangers, and beneath the burning spotlight of our own mind’s eye.  Kaith and his fellow arms-men are the only thing between the remaining villagers of Westsong, and the in-flowing tide of monsters that seek their deaths.  The Countess of Thorion herself, owns this village, and arrived for the annual autumn festival three days ago.  Against all advice, stand or fall; she has decided that she will stay to help defend the little lives of the ordinary folk that call this orchard town home.  Then again; there are no such things as little lives, are there? Nobody is ever really as simple as they seem. Nobody is just “the farmer,” or “the forester,” are they?  Smiths, Grooms, Soldiers, and Squires must survive desertion, despair, and death if they are to save themselves, let alone anyone else.  In Thorion County, there’s only ever really one constant.  “When the Falx finally comes for you; no one can help you. The best you can hope for is to make your life, make your death mean something.”",
