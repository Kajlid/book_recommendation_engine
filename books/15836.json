When he lost both parents in a horrible car accident, he made a Christmas wish a year and a half ago to be part of a happy family once more. Young Daniel knew he'd been granted a Christmas miracle the day that Nick Kirkland walked into his and his Uncle Josh's lives. Ever since then, Daniel has grown and blossomed from the unconditional love and support that both men have given him.But, Daniel wants more.Daniel's dream has been for his Uncle Josh and his fiance, Nick, to finally tie the knot and truly give Daniel for once and for all the family and stability that he has always wanted. When the question of Nick becoming an official guardian to Daniel comes to light, Daniel realizes that the only thing that would be even better than having two loving Uncles taking care of him...is having the two men he loves most in the world married, and calling them both Father instead.",
