  "description": "An unexpected friendship deepens, while an unexpected love threatens their future.\nAt twenty-six, \nGrace Embry\n is a success story—loving big sister, successful entrepreneur, loyal best friend—to everyone but her mother. What does she lack? A diamond ring on a certain finger. While her best friends settle down, Grace is no closer to finding love than she was in college when one man stomped on her now-fragile heart.It’s been over a year since \nReid Pruitt\n lost the girl he presumed he’d spend his future with to another man. He’s moved on, but his ego remains bruised. At least he has Lockwood Blooms. Though, the breakdown of the Lockwood family has everyone on edge.Thrown together by chance, Reid and Grace share their mutual woes. They’re both chasing the wrong people, both confused, and both looking for forever. The answer seems obvious, but love stories are never easy.\nThis is the third installment in a four-book series. While the romance stands alone, the plot is a continuation of the events occurring in previous books. It is recommended you read the series in order.",
