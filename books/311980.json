I’ve been called it all while rotting away in a maximum security psych ward, imprisoned for my crimes. When I’m given a chance to escape this hell, it’s an offer I can’t refuse.  I’m transferred to Blackwood Institute, purgatory for the dangerous and disturbed. The deal is simple. Complete the three-year experimental program and you’re free to leave.  I have no such intentions. People like me; we’re born to die. There’s no life for me out there. I’ll do whatever it takes to end my pitiful existence.  This time, nobody can stop me. Not even the four fellow patients with dark secrets and damage that rivals my own.  A tight lipped cutter.A manic nymphomaniac. A possessive control freak.A shadowy ghost from my past. The clock is ticking. If I’m not careful, the demons that frequent these blood-stained halls will get to me before I can take my own life.  Game on. AUTHOR'S NOTE: Twisted Heathens is a reverse harem contemporary romance set in a mental health institution. It contains very dark and triggering content including references to self harm, suicide, sexual assault, and violence. This is book one in the trilogy and it does end on a cliffhanger.",
