  "description": "When Love's in the game, you can't play it safe…All-Star shortstop Matt Darrington has more than a problem. His wife died, and now he’s juggling a too-smart-for-her-britches six-year-old and the grueling pace of professional baseball. Worse, his daughter is mom shopping. When they explore a local ranch, she decides the beautiful, free-spirited tour guide is premium mom material. Matt thinks the sexy guide looks like Grade-A trouble. \"I highly recommend this series to any readers who love Nora Roberts or Bella Andre.... I could feel the breeze on my face as I read. I love it when an author can paint such a clear picture that it is as if you are right there.\"—Jen's Reviews, Top Goodreads reviewer",
