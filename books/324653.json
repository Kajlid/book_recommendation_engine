  "description": "Oscar Wilde originally wrote these fairy tales for his two sons. The tales span the range of human emotions with a sense of wonder and romance that have ensured them an enduring place in the hearts of children and adults. Inspired by Wilde's stories, Hague has created dramatic, sophisticated illustrations. Printed in gold ink, they reflect the rich landscape of Wilde's stories and perfectly capture the opulence of his world.",
