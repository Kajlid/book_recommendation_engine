  "description": "From the Author:  Let me to take you to a faraway land where legends challenge the impossible and make you dream beyond the comfortable limits of your imagination. It is a place where fire dancing* is practiced publicly to this day. Every year on the 3rd of June the dancers tread in a bed of smoldering embers without actually getting burned, at all. It is a land where strong men and women listen to their intuition, make brave choices and follow their hearts.  Meet Eliana. She does not want to be different, or special. She is pretty content with her ordinary life (and a bit bored, not that she would admit it) and finds comfort in her family’s fire dancing tradition. But it turns out that her heritage is more than she thought it was. Now she must define who she really is and make a choice that will most probably change everything for her.  Meet Damian who protects her, sometimes to extremes, and teaches her to create her reality with the power of her mind.  And last but definitely not least, meet Konstantin who defies the boundaries between good and evil, right and wrong, and breaks all the rules - just because he can.  This story has the potential to empower and inspire you. This story could change everything!  - - - - - - - * Fire dancing is among the 76 elements inscribed on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity",
