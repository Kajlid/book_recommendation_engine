  "description": "A thrilling new Sukey Reynolds mystery DC Sukey Reynolds reports a man acting suspiciously, but on investigation her suspicions seem to be groundless. Then the man is killed in a road accident . . . Meanwhile, Sukey is sent to deal with the gruesome discovery of a woman's dismembered body. Sukey's hunch that the two cases are connected is brushed aside but could a coded reference to a Greek god, and a Chinese tattoo meaning death hold the answers?",
