  "description": "In an unsentimental, raw portrait of depression, self-mutilation, and suicide, L. B. Blake dives into the fractured, self-loathing mind of Kay Hathaway, a bright, young college student and aspiring writer. Kay does everything she’s supposed to do—she gets good grades, holds down a part-time job, and has friends, even a boyfriend. Yet she secretly makes herself bleed just to survive the day. Kay is a cutter. But lies and long sleeves can only keep her secret for so long.",
