  "description": "On his first day teaching math at a community college, Chris Reuben gets an unexpected and unwelcome blast from the one of his students is his former shipmate… and ex-boyfriend. Justin Hayes isn’t looking for a second chance when he signs up for his ex’s algebra class. All he wants is a passing grade and maybe a shot at mending fences with the man he loved—and hurt—while they were deployed three years ago. Pain, guilt, and bitterness aren’t the only lingering feelings, though, and even if three years is enough to melt the ice between them, they’ve already put their careers on the line for each other once. Can Justin convince Chris that what they had is worth risking their careers and hearts again? This 39,000 word book was previously published.",
