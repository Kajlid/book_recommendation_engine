  "description": "Batta At this stage in my life, I want nothing more than to settle down. I want an Old Lady and I want to start a family. Too bad my gut is telling me the woman I want more than anything is trouble looking for a place to happen. Tatum is my match in every way. She's intelligent, sassy, and isn't afraid to stand toe-to-toe with me. And she’s sexy as sin. Half the time I don't know if I'm infuriated with her or just that turned on. But Tatum has secrets. And I'll be damned if harm will come to my club because of her. Lies and secrets took my mother, but I won't let them take my current family. But none of that stops me from wanting Tatum so bad it hurts. Tatum Part of my job is keeping secrets. That’s nothing new for me and my sister. My career and her lack of luck in love put us smack dab in the middle of a major kidnapping case—leaving the authorities no choice but to relocate us. With new identities in place, we end up in Devil Springs, right next door to a business owned by the local bikers—the Blackwings MC. As much as we need to ignore these men, circumstances beyond our control force us into their orbit, and then into their world. As if that wasn’t enough, the club Enforcer, Batta, sparks a fire in me that I wasn’t expecting. Now, I’m forced to continue lying to someone about who I am and what I do, when all I want to do is tell him the truth. But my honesty could mean blowing the case and putting my sister's life at risk—not to mention jeopardizing his.",
