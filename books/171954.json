  "title": "Gordon, Business as Usual",
  "description": "Gordon Cochran travelled every day by bus and train, convinced that he was a business-man like his dad. Carrying his briefcase, his umbrella and The Irish Times newspaper, he arrived and he set off again. He has an intellectual disability, with almost no speech, and everywhere he went people became his friends. Though he had many problems, the story of his life rings with joy. He had adventures and trips overseas that his family couldn't have dreamed of. The reader may shed some tears, but he will more often chuckle-out-loud with surprised delight.",
