  "description": "The sequel to the much-loved novel True Colours - TJ Meridian is a woman with a pain-filled past. She has no family to speak of. Her mother died when she was little, and her abusive father is now also dead. Her brother was killed in the same robbery that left TJ paralyzed and in a wheelchair. During TJ's recovery, her two friends Paula and Erin were the only \"family\" in her life -- until she moved back to her childhood home and met the town veterinarian, Mare Gillespie. Mare changed TJ's life, and TJ changed hers as well. Without each other, Mare would never have found her father, and TJ might not have ever learned about a half-brother. But the road they travel toward finding family and creating family is not smooth. In this sequel to True Colours, TJ must learn and truly believe that her inability to walk doesn't make her a lesser person. Mare needs to trust that sometimes things can't be fixed, and that all she can do is offer support and be understanding. TJ's dear friends Paula and Erin have to discover that it's okay to let go of people and let them continue on their own journeys. Together, TJ and Mare -- and Paula and Erin as well -- must work through the problems of the past. Can they overcome old ghosts and discover new depths to their relationships? Each has a road of her own to travel. Will they ultimately find ways to journey together?",
