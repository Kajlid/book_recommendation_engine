  "title": "Universalists and Unitarians in America: A People's History",
  "description": "John Buehrens begins his new history with the observation that \"Religion is people.\" While previous accounts of Universalism and Unitarianism have focused on a few great men, this history shines a light on the contributions of many, both exalted and obscure, whose stories illustrate the texture of lived religion. Both faiths are chronicled in parallel development through their consolidation in 1961. Beyond presenting Universalist and Unitarian history in America as more than a list of luminaries, Buehrens weaves a historical tapestry rich in color and meaning that will serve to deepen the faith of modern Unitarian Universalists.",
