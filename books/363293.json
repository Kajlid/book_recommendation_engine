  "title": "Little Altars Everywhere",
  "description": "\"It can wear you to a nub, trying to be a popular person and a good Catholic all at the same time.\" So says Sidda, one of the characters inhabiting Little Altars Everywhere. Author Rebecca Wells uses her considerable acting talent to perform this abridgment, adding even more spark to her already lively characters. Everyone--Shep, Vivi, Willetta, and the rest--is given a distinct voice, and Wells plays each of them to the hilt. More like a recording of a one-woman show than a mere reading, Altars is an excellent example of how entertaining audiobooks can be. --C.B. Delaney",
