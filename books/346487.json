  "description": "Four hundred eighty Madison Avenue, New York, was the home of the Clarence Day family in the 1880s. The times were prosperous and the nation strong, in Clarence Day, Sr.'s view largely because he willed it thus. His prayers reflected this: they turned to shooting matches if God failed to act on schedule. Father Day's presence dominates each scene just as it has since his son began telling tales about him in the magazines of the 1930s.",
