A powerful being who used me, terrorized me, and eventually...broke me. I’d never hated anyone more in my entire life.And I’d never been more determined to kill anyone either.𝔸𝕚𝕕𝕠𝕟𝕖𝕦𝕤He was such a pretty, feisty little thing. His tears brought me pleasure, his fear only excited me. And when he whimpered from the pain I inflicted? It was music to my ears.I’d intended to toy with him and discard him once I was done. But then the truth about him shattered my entire existence.𝑯𝒆 𝒅𝒊𝒅𝒏’𝒕 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘. And I didn’t tell him because it would crush him more than I already had. Even if my silence meant I had to live without him for the rest of my cursed, immortal life.𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: ‘𝐆𝐨𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡’ 𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐌𝐌 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 ‘𝐇𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐩𝐡𝐨𝐧𝐞’.
