  "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of Rumor Has It, Rescue My Heart, and the Lucky Harbor novels...  Statistically speaking, these years are supposed to be the sexual highlight of Dorie Anderson’s life. So where are the highlights already?  One phone call has turned Dorie’s dead-end life into an adventure: she’s won a trip on a singles cruise to Fiji. With her cutest outfits packed and the Love Boat theme in her head, Dorie boards—and soon meets two irresistible men: a pro baseball player with an irresistible Texas drawl, and the ship’s dark and mysterious French doctor, Dr. Christian Montague. She’s sure to fall head-over-heels in no time. She just never expected to do it so quickly, or so literally, tripping over her luggage.  With her foot twisted and her ego deflated, Dorie’s dream vacation is about to take the biggest detour yet. A violent storm has wrecked the ship and cast everyone ashore. A deserted island would be the perfect setting for a steamy romance, if something sinister wasn’t lurking. Whose alluring arms will Dorie run to? Being stuck never felt so…liberating.",
