  "title": "Turn the Stars Upside Down",
  "description": "For more than a decade one man struck fear in the hearts of U.S. soldiers on the frontier: Crazy horse, the great Oglala Sioux leader, who destroyed Custer at Little Big Horn, fought Crook toe-to-toe at the Rosebud, and outwitted and outran the Cavalry across the windswept plains where as a child he had played. Now, on a cloudless day in May, the legendary warrior rode toward the soldiers who had been his enemy for so long. In 1877, Crazy horse surrendered to a young lieutenant, and tale of betrayal and murder began.In this powerful, moving account of the last days of Crazy Horse, Terry C. Johnson weaves a saga of warriors, lovers, peacemakers, traitors, war, and suffering among the innocents on both sides. Most of all, this is the story of one man--a mystic, a fighter, a father and husband--whose last journey was as fateful and dramatic as a life lived without surrender.",
