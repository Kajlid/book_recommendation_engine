  "description": "NEW ADULT/ADULT CROSSOVER ROMANTIC COMEDY NOVELLA   How far would you go to protect the one you love?  The terrors of Colin’s past are revealed and accepted by Natalie. Her doubts about letting him into her life are finally disbanded and replaced by a sense of security and commitment. But Natalie doesn’t know that Colin’s past hides more dark secrets unknown even to him.  When a delusional psychopath threatens Colin’s life, things quickly become complicated. Natalie’s stubborn character and desire to kick ass won’t let her step aside and allow the authorities to handle the danger. She gets herself tangled up with street hoodlums, befriends a Russian mobster’s high-maintenance girlfriend, and becomes expert at picking locks and hiding evidence. ******************************************************** This contemporary romantic comedy/mystery blends humor and sensuality with enough thriller elements to make you clutch the pages with terror. The offbeat characters and witty dialogue from Almost Matched are here to stay.  **Warning: contains sexual situations, profanity, and a high dose of sarcasm. Oh, and the appletini is still the drink of choice. May not be appropriate for readers under 18 years old. Not intended for prigs and sourpusses who get easily affronted**  ***Almost Broken Up is the second installment in the Almost Bad Boys series, and it comes after book one, Almost Matched. The books in this series should be read in order. They are not stand-alone books***",
