  "title": "Philippa's Farm",
  "description": "Philippa Woodcock lives a solitary life, isolated from the world, on her little farm within sight of the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Having abandoned the trappings of city life, she finds contentment in harvesting the fruits of the hedgerows, taking care of her animals and running her own business, Philippa's Pantry. But her isolation is interrupted by the carry-on of the local beau monde and the sudden unwelcome arrival of her wayward brother and sister. In the midst of chaos, while her defences are down, she is captivated by a tall figure in a tweed jacket and attempts to seduce him. The opportunity arises in her little wood where the bluebells are bursting forth and the damp earth offers no impediment to passion ... but something else does, something Philippa could never have dreamt of.",
