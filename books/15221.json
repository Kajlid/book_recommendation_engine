  "description": "47 year old Sandy is a wife and mother of two twenty-something kids. She looks after herself, eating right and exercising everyday. But, even though she looks great for her age, her husband of 25 years has been going on business trips that are not always about business. Nick, who is 27 and one of the owners of the gym that Sandy goes to, can't stop watching her when he sees her there. He likes the way she moves and the way she looks. No other woman has ever made him feel the way she does. When he sees her at a bar one night, he asks her to dance. As their relationship blooms, Sandy is always painfully aware of their age differences. She thinks that everyone is staring at them, wondering why such an \"old\" lady is dating such a young man. He always tells her not to worry about what other people think. Then Sandy introduces Nick to her kids, Jarod and Becky. Will their love for each other survive the introductions, or will the power of family ruin any chance of their love growing further?",
