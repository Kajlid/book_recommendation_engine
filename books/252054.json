  "description": "Poetry. \"Lyn Hejinian's work increasingly explores poetry's relation to knowledge...But rather than abstract frameworks, one finds coyotes, geese, didactic asides, horses, philosophical anecdotes, hawks, intercourse, wasps, goats, pigs, ravens, and a great deal of urinating. It is through this particularity that Hejinian invents a poetic pedagogy at home with its forgiveness to itself, poised both to topple and attain intellectual authority...One of the interesting oddnesses of the book, one that forces us to catch our breath and occasionally to huff, is that quasi-transcendental or a priori insights find their way skillfully and unpredictably into what is otherwise a radically nominalistic, context-dependent intellectual setting\" - Lytle Shaw.",
