  "description": "Part of the Circle of Three Series Dana's job title is scientist not babysitter. She's irritated when her boss slates her to accompany department bad boys, Christopher and Jason, to a meeting in London on her weekend off. Since her job transfer to England, she's hidden her attraction to the much younger men. Unfortunately, the attraction seems to be growing every day and every night she fantasizes about them. Three days virtually alone with them will be no fantasy and might instead be an embarrassing disaster. But... Jason and Christopher have had their eyes on Dana since she joined their department. Through a little finagling, they've arranged for her to be part of this trip. They're sure her project is a spot-on compliment to theirs and her presence will be an ideal addition to their bed. Now all they have to do is convince her that the bad boys will make her perfect boy toys. Forever.
