Kitt's reputation as a successful pirate is matched by the sizeable bounty on his head. Under his leadership, the crew has thrived and become prosperous, now reveling in the pleasures and diversions of this untamed haven. However, discontent seethes among some of the crew as not all are happy with how their armourer runs the ship. All is not as it seems in Khattom where the blue poppy blooms and irresistible music eddies faintly in the air. A mysterious stranger manages to drug Kitt and steal his sword Inoar. This weapon has been his faithful companion since his departure from Isenkliff, and losing it is unthinkable.In the relentless pursuit of the thief, Kitt ascends the desolate mountain range high above Khattom. He comes to a forgotten city lost in time, once the capital of an empire, now held in thrall by a malevolent cosmic predator. With celestial music singing of starlit wonders and interstellar mysteries, this predator ensnares the human mind, devouring thousands.
