  "description": "Tom Tyler, young ward to the mostly beloved superhero Morning Light, takes to the streets each night as the crime-fighting Score. Together they help keep the streets of Sail City safe, despite a lingering, more than justified mistrust of vigilantes and superheroes.  Still growing and still learning about himself, Tom grows resigned to the fact that his work complicates the likelihood of having a normal life. When a chance encounter on the job makes Tom's life much, much more complex, the reality of Tom's situation makes itself known.DRM-free EPUB and PDF copies are available for free at https://www.jondarthur.work/the-victo...",
