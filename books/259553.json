  "description": "I’ve spent the last several years building my company, having zero time for a social life. I preferred it that way. After the mess my ex-wife left me with, I have no interest in anything remotely close to a relationship.  Until I meet my daughter’s new next-door neighbor.  Harley is kind, beautiful, and she’s also an erotic romance writer. To any man, she’s the perfect package. To a gun-shy man like me, she’s a one-way road to disaster.  Unfortunately for me, my daughter’s newfound friendship with Harley means I get to see more of her.  And the more I see her, the more I want her.  But my instincts are telling me there’s a danger lurking around her, following her, waiting for the right moment to strike. And the closer I get, the more I realize there’s only one way I’ll allow any threat to get near her…  and that’s over my dead body.",
