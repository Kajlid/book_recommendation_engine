  "description": "Even now, decades or centuries later, the brilliance of men like Calvin, Hodge and Spurgeon still speaks through the Crossway Classic Commentaries, which present the all-time best, written commentaries on individual books of the Bible. Each volume has been abridged and stylistically adapted for today's readers by series editors J.I. Packer and Mister McGrath, while carefully preserving the meaning and message of the original expositors.",
