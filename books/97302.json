Stressed, bloody and exhausted the three stumble upon a back woods cabin in the middle of nowhere. There is Buck, an aspiring cage fighter and his beautiful fiance Denny. Buck's sister Tammy completes the ensemble from a clan that used to number over a dozen. The remains of the fleeing family desperately need rest and the cabin that the Taylor brothers hold out in seems the safest place they have been in months. Fighting off zombies daily has taken its toll on the three travelers and the reluctant hospitality the brothers offer is a Godsend. Buck soon realizes though that all is not as it seems as the brothers start playing mind games with the group and continue to delay their departure. Is he just being paranoid? Or were they safer on the road with the zombies?Book two in the Tasty Trio series which continues onward from this story is available now. \"A dead horse named Caleb\" is the title of the second story.
