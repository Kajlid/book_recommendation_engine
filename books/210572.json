  "description": "The line between humanity and technology is shrinking.The Service is an internet-like system biologically hardwired into a person's brain. Most consider it essential to modern human life, but for Peter Chardin The Service is the source of a special type of anxiety: His own free will feels like an illusion, dictated by the algorithms of the program. Enter Patrick Whiteside, a genius inventor and leader of a movement that believes The Service is an outdated method for human betterment. When Peter and his friends find themselves locked in Whiteside's remote compound they discover Whiteside is both more ambitious and more sinister than they could've imagined. But what are Whiteside's plans for humanity? And what if he succeeds? From the pages of BRANDON GRAHAM's ISLAND comes the debut science fiction epic by MATT SHEEAN and MALACHI WARD. Collects \"ANCESTOR\" from issues 3, 5, 7 and 9 of ISLAND.",
