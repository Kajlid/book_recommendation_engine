  "description": "Luke Caldwell has three abhorrent qualities to him: 1) He’s a pig-headed jock. 2) He’s a grade A asshole with the biggest, overbearing ego. 3) He’s a manwhore.  These three qualities alone should’ve had me running for the hills. I tried to steer clear of him, I really did, but it was an impossible feat. Luke Caldwell was nothing if not persistent, and the way he bulldozed through my life, not taking no for an answer is proof of it.  I tried to stay away from him.  I wanted to hate him. But I couldn’t. Luke was nothing like the idiot jock I pegged him out to be. He became a friend, a confidant, and after one unforgettable night, he became so much more.  Whatever this is between us, it’s impossible to ignore. I just hope when all is said and done, I won’t be burned by the college bad boy.  Praise of the book: “This book is a page turner for all the college romance lovers out there, I read this book in one sitting and would highly suggest it. S.M Soto brings the perfect amount of angst with sweet.” - USA Today Best Selling Author T.L Smith  “It doesn’t happen very often that I read a book cover to cover until three a.m., Scoring the Quarterback had me on my freaking knees! Kudos to you S.M. Soto!” – Zellie Geustyn (Beta Reader/Reviewer)",
