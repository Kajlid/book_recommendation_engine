  "description": "Lord Hugh de Bar, known as Wolf, has been cursed by a witch and shapeshifts into a wolf at night. He runs across the granddaughter of the man who he has vowed to kill, and she is alone at night in the woods with only her crossbow for protection. Lady Winifred (Red) Chaserton has defied her grandfather's orders, and left the castle in search of a secret door in the knoll she's seen in the woods. But after being stalked by a wolf, a dark lord named Hugh de Bar appears to protect her, but things aren't always as they seem. She is attracted to him, but fears him at the same time for reasons she doesn't understand. Will magical forces come between a lady and a wolf, or bring them together instead? And will the de Bar siblings find redemption from the dark magic that has cursed them and brought turmoil into their lives?",
