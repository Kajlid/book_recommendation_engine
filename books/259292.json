  "description": "HEATHER CORBALLY BRYANT just knew she had to follow in the steps of her grandmother, trail-blazing journalist Irene Kuhn. After all, she grew up listening to the stories of her grandmother, and Irene never let Heather forget that a woman’s place was not in the kitchen or by her husband’s side but in the forefront of adventure as a writer. Like her famous grandmother as well as her mother, Rene Kuhn, Heather was a natural.Heather’s reimagination of her grandmother’s life in glamorous and exotic Shanghai of the 1920s is fascinating in its detail which closely follows the real events of Irene’s career and of her momentous meeting with Heather’s grandfather, Bert Kuhn. It’s not only a memoir of the stories Irene told Heather, but it is the touching story of a fiery passion between fellow adventurers and journalists which ultimately resulted in tragedy as well as great happiness.Read You Can’t Wrap Fire in Paper and you will see that the title is appropriate. Irene Corbally Kuhn was not a woman to be subdued but she was like any woman captured by the fires of obsession and love.To be strong their love had to be more than paper.",
