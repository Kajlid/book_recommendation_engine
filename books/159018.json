  "title": "I: Reality and Subjectivity",
  "description": "This book explains the very essence of consciousness as it evolved from its primordial appearance as life on earth, on up through evolution as the human ego, and hence, the transcendence of the ego as the spiritual Reality of Enlightenment and the Presence of Divinity. The uncommon clarity and lucidity with which the highly evolved subjet matter is presented facilitates the reader's understanding and comprehension. The nature of consciousness is described in terms that recontextualize and simplify the spiritual process. The nonlinear reality of the enlightened sage is thereby made comprehensible to the reasoning mind.",
