  "description": "The Aliens' initial attacks were precise and devastating. Traversing the planet under the cover of darkness, they eliminated most of the Worlds' leaders and crippled their militaries all in one night. The horrific assaults continued unchecked as the thousands of alien craft circled the globe like locust, killing anyone in their path. For those who saw their methods and survived, it was clear that the invaders wanted to do one thing, remove all human life from the planet. Our only recourse was to rely on the Continuity of Government plan, and the people with the background to try and maintain a working government. The surviving leadership would do all they could to try and put things back together and to preserve what they could, but would preservation be enough? After a harrowing escape from the initial Alien attack, with his wife and only a part of his family, it was a different world for Lieutenant General, Michael Patrick, United States Army Reserve. No longer would he be just a small town lawyer, or a tired washed-up former special operator and relic of the Cold War. Now it would fall to General Patrick to piece together the military forces that would stop the onslaught. Together with other old soldiers and the survivors of the various armies and navies from around the globe, they would pull themselves together as a fighting force. Their one thought, their one mission, was not just to preserve life, but to take back the night.",
