  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 9780007350773\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\nAustenâ€²s best-loved tale of love, marriage and society in class-conscious Georgian England still delights modern readers today with its comedy and characters. It follows the feisty, quick-witted Elizabeth Bennet as her parents seek to ensure good marriages for her and her sisters in order to secure their future. Through the irrepressible characters of Mr Collins and Mrs Bennet and the sensitivities and nuances of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen's skill and artistry as a writer shines.",
