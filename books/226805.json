  "description": "In The Science of God, distinguished physicist and biblical scholar Gerlad Schroeder demonstrates the often surprising parallels between a variety of biblical teachings and the findings of biochemists, paleontologists, astrophysicists, and quantum physics. In a brilliant and wide-ranging discussion of key topics that have divided science and religion, such as free will, the development of the universe, the origin of life, and the origin of man, Schroeder argues that the latest science and close reading of the Bible are not just compatible but interdependent. By exploring how religious belief is enhanced by an open-eyed investigation of the world and how honest science demands humility when faced with the extraordinary richness of life's creation, this revealing book reminds us how abounding is our science, how true the Bible - and how the convergence between the two will inspire you to reconsider both your Scripture and your Einstein.",
