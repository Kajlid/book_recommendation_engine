  "description": "Victoria’s asleep. In my arms. And I’m holding her, stroking her, silently hating myself for what she’s turning me into.She says she has to leave, but I need her to stay. Things are getting too complicated between us. Too many secrets, too many lies. I know she’s hiding something from me, but the more I push, the farther she pulls away.  I don’t know how much longer this tether between us can hold. So I’ve done something that I never do. I’ve opened myself up and bared my soul. I told her my secrets in a moment of weakness, and now I have to pay the price. Because if I’m wrong about her, she could destroy me.Please note: This book contains explicit sexual content, including elements of BDSM and dark erotica. Also, a very alpha male who likes to drop the f-bomb frequently. You have been warned!",
