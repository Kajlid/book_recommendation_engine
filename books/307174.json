  "description": "At a competitive trail competition Cat Enright finds the body of one of the riders, which ultimately causes Cat to doubt her closest friends and neighbors. When hunky country music star Keith Carson saves Cat’s life, she struggles to remember details that can point her toward the killer––before the killer comes for her. Aided by her usual eclectic cast, including the (possibly) psychic mare, Sally Blue, if Cat wins in the end, she may lose what she loves the most.",
