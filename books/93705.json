  "title": "White House Call Girl: The Real Watergate Story",
  "description": "Heidi Rikan was an ex-stripper, working for the mob in Washington D.C. White House Call Girl tells how a call girl operation she was running at the time led to the Watergate break-in, which brought down Tricky Dick Nixon himself.Though it's a fully sourced political non-fiction, it reads like a detective novel, full of prostitutes, mobsters, political operatives, and even football team players. And it's got plenty of evidence, including photos of an address book owned by the main call girl in question, chock full of very interesting phone numbers and addresses.For forty years we've only heard the Woodward and Bernstein perspective on Watergate. Now we've got the photos. What's more, we've got Heidi's little black book.",
