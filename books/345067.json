  "description": "Mark Harrison has exactly what Nolan Daniels wants—his signature on a sign-in sheet. Even better that Mark is gay and seriously good-looking. Nolan’s got these one hundred hours of community service nailed, just as soon as he nails the handsome doctor. It’s his pride that takes a hit when Mark rejects his advances in no uncertain terms. What else did Nolan expect from a man of privilege? Certainly not that Nolan would want Mark more than he wanted Mark’s signature. Mark’s the good boy who always plays by the rules, always does what’s expected of him...and secretly chafes at the restrictions of his straight-laced life. Now he’s faced with the leather-jacketed bad boy who arouses the closeted Mark more than he wants to admit. A man he can’t resist. A man who helps him admit other things about his not-so-perfect life. It’s time to take a stand. Time to burst the protective bubble each has built around himself in his own way. Little do they realize that moving forward could also cause them to lose each other and the love that has grown between them.",
