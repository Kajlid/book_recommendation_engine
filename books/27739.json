  "description": "Originally published via World Castle Publishing 2011, revised & re-edited 2012; re-published via Amazon 2014Jane woke up to find several things wrong; she was in a hospital, she'd been in a coma for over four weeks, it wasn't 2007 like she last remembered, it was 2010, and she was married to a man she didn't know. Dreams of a mysterious green building infiltrate her sleep, but are they just dreams or are they memories? As she struggles to recapture a life she doesn't remember she discovers clues to a lost love and dangerous experiments that lead to murder. More flashes of memory and a re-acquaintance with an old scientist lead her to an investigation into the mystery of the green building and the discovery of horrific experiments that end in murder... and something worse than murder. She learns her best friend has betrayed her and the husband she is trying to know and love is not who he says he is. With her trust shattered and her life precariously close to falling apart, she is more dedicated than ever to finding out who is behind the green building and the horrible things that happened there, that happened to her there. The more she learns, the more danger she is in.",
