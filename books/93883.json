  "description": "Between a rock and a hard place.To Sergeant Zeke Hayes, the expression has always been a non-factor. There's never been a situation he can't blast, punch, negotiate or smart-ass his way out of, which makes him the perfect fit for his Special Forces battalion--and a natural-born Dominant who's made a lot of submissives happy from Mt. Rainier to Vancouver.That all changes when Rayna Chestain enters his world.A rock.From the moment Z snatches Rayna from the lair of a South Asian slave trafficker, his inner grizzly roars to life with protective intensity. This is a huge damn problem, because Z isn't wired to be a one-woman man. Growing up an orphan on the streets of Seattle has taught him that beyond a few hours in a dungeon, trust means disappointment and love leads to agony. But here he is, in the remote wilderness escape he'd promised not to share with anyone, harboring Rayna from a fiend who now wants his pound of revenge flesh from her--in the form of her beating heart. Zeke will stop at nothing to keep Rayna safe, even asking his SFG brothers to join him in the fight to hold his fortress secure.A hard place.Sheltering Rayna? Z's never done anything more right in his life. But wanting her? Dreaming of her body beneath him, bound and surrendering to his domination? It's the most forbidden fruit he can crave...and the only thing he can't stop thinking about.A new beginning?This is a dead-end canyon that no rifle, bomb or sweet talk will let Zeke escape from. The only way out is to confront the reality of what Rayna has done to him...the mountain she's moved in his intractable heart.",
