  "description": "Exiled from his province Cobb Ash for a crime he did not commit, Raspail becomes the most wretched of wolves, a ramblefoot. Now he must survive on his own navigating the treacherous outer fringes of the wolf provinces, dangerously close to where the new predator wages war on the wolf. It is here, in an anarchic enclave where meatdrunk ramblefoots plunder the bountiful treasures of man, that Raspail comes to prominence as a legend among wolves. But Raspail has no interest in power, only Kileo, the love he was torn from. With old foes waiting to assassinate him and Cob Ash recently allied with hostile neighbor Draguignon, Raspail will need to unite the lawless ramblefooots and conquer Cob Ash if he is to ever see Kileo again. With a keen eye for the extraordinary in nature, and a portrayal of wolf culture that is both meticulously researched and then fantastically extrapolated on, Ramblefoot is a thrilling adventure that will immerse you in its sprawling mythology from the first sentence.",
