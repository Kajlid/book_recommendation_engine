  "description": "Flynt Porter has been my shadow since freshman year, but despite his intense protectiveness toward me, we've never spoken a word to each other. Until now. We're both seniors and I've damaged my mother's car, leaving me no choice but to bring it to Flynt, who moonlights as a mechanic. I'm prepared to offer him anything in exchange for fixing the vehicle, but he only warns me to keep my distance from him. Unfortunately, as soon as he touches me, staying away is the last thing on my mind.What I want from Ayla is...everything. Now. I want her to be my wife. To carry my baby. But as the product of a broken home, I know how a young pregnancy can destroy a family before it ever gets a chance. I refuse to do that to my Ayla. I've managed to make it four years without letting my hunger overtake me, but now she's hungry, too...and my will is weak.",
