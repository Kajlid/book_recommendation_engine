  "description": "\"No woman will ever be allowed within striking distance of my heart!\"--Simon Hart, iron-hearted, insufferably stubborn Long, Tall TexanHe'd sworn off romantic entanglements forever. But every man had a weakness, and his was the beautiful, beguiling Tira Beck. He'd angrily labeled the flamboyant socialite a shameless flirt with a cavalier attitude about marriage -- until he learned she'd secretly saved all her love for him. Against his will, Simon became entranced by her glorious presence, her every gesture igniting him like a sweet, beckoning caress. Still, he knew the virtuous virgin wasn't about to surrender her nights to him... unless he became her beloved.MAN OF THE MONTH",
