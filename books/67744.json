Instead, her distraught friend reveals that her eleven-year-old son found an abandoned baby on his way to school.As Louise digs deeper into the murder and the mysterious foundling, every uncovered clue points to organized human trafficking from Eastern Europe, run by ruthless gangsters who despise women and won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in their way . . .",
