  "description": "Werewolf prince Alejandro Moretti used to be my bodyguard. But now I know I have to let him go. While he’s able to protect my life, he’s also the one breaking my heart.  Calys Adelardi has found out she’s not really a human monster. And she may not be a pack princess for long, not when the Panthera suspects her of being a murderess.  Alejandro Moretti once thought love was foolish and unreal. But when Calys decides to leave his life for good, he’s forced to confront his fears. Can he find the courage to risk his heart…and if he does, will it be too late to win his princess back?",
