  "title": "'Twas the Night Before Christmas: or Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas",
  "description": "This poem first appeared in a newspaper in Troy, New York, USA, on December 23, 1823, as \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\". No one claimed authorship until 13 years later. Clement Clarke Moore, a professor and poet, said that he wrote the piece for his children. Unbeknownst to him, his housekeeper had sent it to the newspaper to be published. However, the family of Henry Livingston Jr. contended that their father had been reciting “A Visit from St. Nicholas” for 15 years prior to publication. Regardless of the true author, the poem is now a Christmas classic.",
