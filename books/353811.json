  "description": "Sharie Kohler dazzles with the dark, sensual world of the Moon Chasers, where two half-breed lycans are locked in deadly combat over the fate of the world—and their own hearts. Sorcha is no longer the pitiful teenage orphan who roamed the streets of Paris after her pack was destroyed, but despite all she now has—wealth, beauty, strength—she is still haunted by memories of Jonah, her fellow half-breed who broke her innocent young heart years before, and who now believes her dead. Determined to drive Jonah from her dreams forever, Sorcha vows to kill the witch whose curse first condemned the lycans to soulless immortality . . . doomed to be ruled by their dark passions, yet never truly able to love or be loved. Still devastated over the girl he failed, Jonah has found purpose as a demon slayer. When a stranger starts stalking the world’s most powerful demon witch, he is assigned to kill the huntress before her meddling releases an evil that threatens all mankind. Face-to-face again at last, can Sorcha and Jonah put their anger and hurt behind them to defeat the darkness . . . and dare they hope to find a love neither dreamed possible?",
