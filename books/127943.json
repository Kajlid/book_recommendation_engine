  "description": "Mariah Bennett is not a religious person and she doesn't believe in angels, especially after what she’s just been through. Now all that’s about to change. Escaping Manhattan and all its painful memories Mariah heads down to her family's summer home on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Deeply feeling the after effects of being raped Mariah is depressed and in a self-pitied rut. That is until she meets Cam. This unexpected encounter sparks a glimmer of hope back into her life. Cam is a newbie on the island with incredibly flawless good looks, melodic voice, impossibly clear eyes and otherworldly aura, he sweeps Mariah off her feet from the moment she arrives down the shore. Immediately spiraling in love it becomes clear that Cam is no ordinary guy. In fact, she learns through various clues that his identity is truly that of the Archangel Camael and his sole new mission on earth is to love, protect, and heal Mariah. In a world full of celestial beings, where good vs. evil all the time, can Cam and Mariah’s love stand up to the ultimate tests? With the crazed, psychotic fallen angel Azael out for vengeance against Cam and now Mariah, will their love be strong enough to stand up to an army of fallen angels or will they loose everything they’ve finally found in each other, including their lives?",
