  "description": "Spaceships, daring heists, and interstellar intrigue!\nÂ Since murderous AIs drove humanity from Earth more than a century before, people have been rebuilding civilization. That doesn't mean the galaxy is anywhere close to being civilized.\nA liar and a scoundrel - and he's the good guy.\nThe thing that Captain Sebastian Garcia values most of all is his ship, The Wayward Prince, and like most of his possessions, it's something that he stole. Now the ship's original owner has found Sebastian and he's looking to collect what he's owed.\nWhen you want something stolen, call a professional.\nRen is someone Sebastian never expected to see again, and the one he never could forget. But Ren's not offering forgiveness. Unless Sebastian can pull off an impossible heist on a distant planet he'll lose everything - including a second chance with the man he once betrayed and still cares for.",
