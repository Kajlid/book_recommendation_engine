  "title": "The God of Jane: A Psychic Manifesto",
  "description": ". . . The God of Jane, the God of Joe, the God of Lester, the God of Sarah . . . An appeal to that \"God\" would be an appeal to that portion of universal creativity from which we personally emerge . . . It would stand for that otherwise inconceivable intersection between Being and our being . . .(from chapter 7) In The God of Jane, the most personal of her books, Jane Roberts bravely questions the very material she produced (the many volumes of Seth material) as well as her own psychic abilities. \"This book,\" she writes, \"is the story of my efforts to put Seth's material to work in daily life; to free myself from many hampering cultural beliefs; and most of all, to encounter and understand the nature of impulses . . .\" What Roberts discovers is her individual connection to the larger consciousness-or \"God.\" With a new introduction by Susan M. Watkins, author of Conversations with Seth.",
