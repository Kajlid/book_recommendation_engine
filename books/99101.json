  "description": "Fun, sexy romance! Pair a Texas rancher with a smart businesswoman on a reality TV dance show and sparks fly! Find out what happens in Her Forever Cowboy. Stephen walked away from love when a 100 years of ranching was on the line. Underneath a glib exterior, the second eldest of the hardcore McLemore brothers is private, cutthroat, and controlling. Years of sacrifice have taken a toll, but he never forgot the girl of his dreams. A stormy reunion brings Jillian mouth-to-mouth with the cowboy who broke her heart. Lip-locked and up against Stephen's hard body rekindles more than a spark.But Jillian refuses to give into temptation and informs McLemore (and herself), she's moved on. As a dance studio owner, Jill found her footing. Entangled within the town gossip mill and family drama, Stephen and Jillian's verbal sparring turns up the heat. After a round of dirty dancing, their mutual attraction fully ignites. In the midst of rediscovering how sweet love tastes, life throws a curveball into Stephen's plans. Hollywood comes knocking on Jillian's door with an offer to star in a reality TV dance show. Her once in a lifetime opportunity might be this bad boy's undoing. Called to be the man she needs, Stephen makes the ultimate sacrifice and it cuts deep. In a whirlwind, Jillian must decide if all that glitters is gold. Is fame what she hungers for when a Harley-riding rancher has all the right moves? Humor infused, Her Forever Cowboy is a poignant second-chance love story that explores the depth of forgiveness and sacrifice, loyalty and trust. Note previously titled: The Cowboy Rode a Harley",
