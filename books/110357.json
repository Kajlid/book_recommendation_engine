  "description": "Will the pain they feel ever lead to pleasure or will they always be searching for something? Shifting together. Shifting apart. Making lyrical love, dancing wildly in the dark. Author Note: *The Shifting Series is not paranormal. This New Adult Romance trilogy is a love story told in the dual POV of two best friends, Josh and Riley, woven poetically with his music and her dark poetry. It’s not an easy story to tell, but love isn’t always rainbows and sunshine and often times we must travel through the dark to find the light at the end of the tunnel. This is their journey. Torn apart by a tragedy, pushed together by fate. Nothing is coincidence. Riley and Josh have been through it all together, first as best friends and now as a couple. Faced with a decision that will test their relationship, these two learn to fight harder than ever before to keep their hearts intact. Once the decision is made, there is no going back. With the past creeping into their present, and miles between them, they learn nothing is easy. Every moment matters. Can Riley and Josh survive the first year of college apart? Will their love remain strong enough to embrace every moment that belongs to them? Or will someone from the past interfere, take what he wants and ruin them forever?\"For each star in the sky, I have a reason why I love you. When you look up at night, never forget this truth.\" ~Josh ParkerDisclaimer: Not recommended for anyone under the age of 17 due to underage drinking, sexual content and adult language. ***Warning***This is a continuation from the first book in the series, Escape the Doubt.
