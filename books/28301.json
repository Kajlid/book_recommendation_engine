  "description": "When Asa Holbbrook Staggs stepped into the cold-water spring that would later bear his name, he was drunk. The date was November 18, 1914. He pulled himself from the water, sober, cold, and converted to a new life in the Lord. Thus began the legend of Asa's Spring. The Greats of Cuttercane tells the stories of people in Cuttercane, Georgia, the place of Asa's Spring. Written in the edged-in-humor style of caricature, these stories are still shared daily in the South.",
