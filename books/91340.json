  "description": "Rome, 44BC, the great general Julius Caesar arrives home from war as the sole ruler of Rome. The citizens cheer theÂ conquering hero, but not all are pleased to see him return. Many fear that with nobody to oppose him, this military genius will become a cruel dictator. A conspiracy takes shape that ensnares the proud Brutus, one of Caesar's most trusted allies, in an assassination plot that will change the course of history.What is most important, Shakespeare asks, loyalty to your leaders or to your country? Can good ever come of evil actions, and are those who speak of freedom always trustworthy?Now imagined as a thrilling graphic adventure, William Shakespeare's classic retelling of actual historical events is revealed as a timeless political thriller - a bloody saga of friendships betrayed, alliances destroyed, and a nation torn apart by civil war.",
