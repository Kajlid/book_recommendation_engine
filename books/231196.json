  "description": "Cupid she’s not—but she’s pretty darn close.   Nothing in the world feels better than finding her clients the perfect date. Of course finding one for herself might be nice, but creative bill paying is for college students—not for accomplished doctors in their forties. Satisfied customers keep the electricity on.   But wait, according to all the magazines the forties are the new twenties. Now if only she felt twenty…   Everything in Dr. Mariah Bates’ life was perfectly fine until the moment she quit her celebrity radio job to start a dating business. Two years, a cheating ex, and a very ugly divorce later, she’s suddenly homeless and living with her mother. Not exactly how she’d envisioned her life working out. Not that her mom isn’t great, but come on.   With her cop ex-husband doing everything he can to ruin her business, she’s at her wit's end. Throw in another cop who makes her believe in love at first sight—or at least lust—and life is a mess. Interesting, fun and tummy tingling, but a mess. Especially since another cop is the last thing she needs.  Despite a very persistent, want-to-be beau who insists he's protecting her, it’s time for Mariah to take control of the game her ex has been playing. Punt or pass, she’s due for a touchdown.   Everyone deserves the perfect date—even her.",
