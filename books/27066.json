The only good thing to come out of the marriage is the one thing that Angelina loves most in the world; her son, Justin. After being brutally beat and drugged by her husband, Angelina awakens to a nightmare of his doing. Justin is gone, taken by the man she fears most, and Angelina is stuck in the middle of nowhere, forced to face a gang of bikers on her own. As terrified as Angelina is of the group surrounding her, she is more afraid of never seeing her son again. It is this fear of losing her child for good that motivates the young woman to survive the hell she has been thrown into. Angelina will discover though, that motivation alone is not enough to survive the ride of her life. This book contains strong language and mature situations.",
