  "description": "The Ella and Owen series debuts with a fun romp through the world of dragons! Readers can follow twin sibling dragons as they head deep into the forest in search of a wizard who may be able to cure Owen of his fiery cold. In the first book of the Ella and Owen series, the twin siblings are at odds. Owen is happy to stay in bed reading as he nurses his cold, but outgoing Ella wants an adventure. She finally convinces her brother to join her on a quest to find a wizard that will help cure Owen of his flaming cold, as well as add to his ogre toenail collection.  Owen quickly learns that the journey isn't what his sister made it out to be. They run into a dragon-eating ogre, get caught in not one, but two cages, and have to outsmart an evil vegetable wizard, which is Owen's worst nightmare (vegetables + wizards = NO FUN AT ALL!).  This early chapter book series has it all--humor, adventure, a dash of some gross-out stuff, and just the right mixture of sibling rivalry/love. Black and white illustrations on every page add to the enjoyment, with dragon details galore, making Ella and Owen's world pop on each page.",
