He can’t wait to help his best friend, The Man with the Yellow Hat, pick out their holiday tree. At the tree farm, however, amid all the excitement of finding the perfect specimen, George gets carried away, as usual—atop his favorite tree! Hiding in the tree’s branches, George finds himself delivered to the local children’s hospital, where his tree trimming antics cheer the children and he gets to meet a jolly man in a bright red suit.",
