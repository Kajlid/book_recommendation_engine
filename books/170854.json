  "description": "What would you do if one of your closest friends was murdered and the list of suspects looks like your personal address book? This is the dilemma facing Harry Ransom and his beautiful lady friend Eleanor Tyler as they attempt to identify the killer. Along the way they are in constant danger as the trail leads them across the country and eventually to France. Thirty-seven year-old Harry Ransom had led the comfortable, idyllic life of the privileged class. Retiring at age thirty-five to travel the world and collect fine wines, Harry’s life had been peaceful and uneventful, except for the untimely death of his wife fifteen years before. This bucolic existence was shattered when a close friend dies of an apparent heart attack a dinner party where most of Harry’s best friends were present. Also in attendance was Charlie’s cousin, Eleanor Tyler. In the decade since Harry had seen her, she had transformed, phoenix-like, from a mousy, insecure and dowdy housewife into someone scintillating and sexy. Shortly thereafter evidence comes to light that the death might not have been from natural causes. Vowing to find the killer and set things right, Harry, with Eleanor at his side, follows the trail from Cape Cod to Napa Valley and back again and then on to France where the truth comes to light.",
