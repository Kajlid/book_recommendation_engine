While under the influence of the monster, Kristina discovers her sexy alter-ego, Bree: \"there is no perfect daughter, / no gifted high school junior, / no Kristina Georgia Snow. / There is only Bree.\" Bree will do all the things good girl Kristina won't, including attracting the attention of dangerous boys who can provide her with a steady flow of crank.",
