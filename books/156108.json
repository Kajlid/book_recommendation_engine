Download a free sample and see for yourself!And you thought dying once would be hard... On the morning before her 67th death, it is business as usual for agent Jesse Sullivan: meet with the mortician, counsel soon-to-be-dead clients, and have coffee while reading the latest regeneration theory. Jesse dies for a living, literally. Because of a neurological disorder, she is one of the population's rare 2% who can serve as a death surrogate, dying so others don't have to. Although each death replacement is different, the result is the same: a life is saved, and Jesse resurrects days later with sore muscles, new scars, and another hole in her memory. But when Jesse is murdered and becomes the sole suspect in a federal investigation, more than her freedom and sanity are at stake. She must catch the killer herself--or die trying. Dying for a Living is the first book in Kory M. Shrum's gripping fantasy series. If you like page-turning action, tough as nails heroines, and perfectly-paced suspense, then you'll love this \"hilarious\" and \"supernaturally fantastic\" ride. Scroll up and one-click your copy of this award-winning novel today!",
