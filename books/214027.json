  "title": "Life Seemed Good, But....: A collection of short quirky stories",
  "description": "A collection of very short, funny stories with unpredictable endings. Dedicated to all those who watched someone suffer with cancer or any serious illness. It's a picture of life as viewed by a rich array of characters, talking animals, and the author's twisted perception of reality. Rated PG13 for minor drug references, cartoon violence, bad puns, and anti-humor. Contains a wealth of hidden trivia. Richard Bell presents us here with his multi-layered series of short stories and little tips to make our lives more interesting. Follow the journeys of Spud, the evil potato, the author and his misadventures with aluminum foil, a porcupine named Timmy who comes to think he's a doctor, and young brothers Scooter and Biff, to name just a few who live in this hilarious world. Many of the stories come from Bell's magazine column entitled Modern Fables published in Wassup Local Magazine (Lake County, IL). He originally started writing in 2004 when he was laid off from his job shortly after his wife got leukemia, and this was his therapy. A portion of the proceeds from book sales is donated to Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science for cancer research. Get it now.",
