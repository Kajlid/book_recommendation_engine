  "description": "Left for dead by hunters, werewolf Dominic finds refuge at the isolated home of reclusive demon Gage and his human servant Randall. Healing from the attack, physically and mentally, Dominic has no choice but to rely on his grudging host and his enigmatic assistant.Hidden away from humans for decades, the last thing Gage wants is a werewolf bringing trouble to his doorstep. Keeping Randall at arm’s length is problematic enough, but allowing Dominic to stay seems like the safest option--at least until Gage finds himself drawn to Dominic as much as he is to Randall. Randall has his own reasons for driving Dominic into Gage’s arms. It’s only a matter of time until Gage discovers the secrets Randall’s been keeping--secrets that will surely destroy their fragile, undefined relationship. Still, the pull of the powerful desire that binds them all leaves him wishing there was a way to keep them both.But as the outside world encroaches on Gage’s sanctuary, all those secrets are about to collide, unleashing a dangerous tide of betrayal, deception and love, and all three men will have to re-evaluate their priorities, their relationships, and who--or what--they are.",
