  "description": "Thirty years ago, scientists found extra letters in the human genome in a skeleton estimated to be four thousand years old. The letters were considered to be \"junk,\" incapable of forming any biological \"words\" or \"messages.\"Recently, a man calling himself Eloah interrupted Easter Mass at Germany's famous KÃ¶lner Dom by announcing that he had visited our world before and that during his previous visit, he had called himself Yeshua ben Josef. Eloah displayed paranormal abilities that couldn't be explained or ignored until an FBI forensics team discovers that the DNA \"junk\" discovered thirty years earlier and Eloah's matched. These additional letters were not only viable, they could also be the basis for his otherworldly intelligence, psychic abilities and lifespan.Eloah offers the world a peaceful and abundant life for all, free from fear and oppression that has nothing to do with an omniscient god, and everything to do with humanity's innate moral and ethical principles. Global political, religious and corporate leaders eager to maintain the status-quo want him stopped; and they're not alone. An alien being equal to Eloah in superhuman strengths has his own plans for world domination. Can Eloah convince the world's leaders and populations to change the current course that leads to ultimate destruction? Or, will the alien being, hidden among us for thousands of years, fulfill his scheme that would plunge the world into a new \"Dark Ages,\" far worse than the original?",
