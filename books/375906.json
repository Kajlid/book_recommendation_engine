  "description": "Taking place in a kind of \"internal space,\" populated by living ideas, Voices utilizes broken typography within the context of an equally broken narrative to examine an existence in which identity and self have become, themselves, imaginary, but have allowed human thought and feeling to reshape the very nature of perceptual reality. Language is given a new, unfamiliar complete freedom to explore the framework of an intricate semiotic landscape.",
