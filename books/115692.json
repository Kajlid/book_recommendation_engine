Even the world's GPS system, the entire U.S. national grid, and the Internet are not exempt from the threat, at midnight, New Year's Eve, Eastern Time. What happens if a few members of the U.S. Congress, the country's food companies and even major drug companies are in on the Chinese attack; to get their share of the new world?
