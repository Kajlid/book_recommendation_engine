  "description": "Teenage punk, self-taught musician, bandleader, session man, smoker, drinker, multi-millionaire, David Grohl has achieved a rare feat, a rock 'n' roll double crown having been a member of two hugely successful and influential bands - Nirvana and The Foo Fighters.Loaded with candid interviews and hard truths about Grohl's life in music, this is the first comprehensive biography of an icon whose career charts rock and roll's rise and fall over the past two decades.Detailing his drumming and touring with Queens of the Stone Age and Nine Inch Nails and his battle over Nirvana's legacy with Courtney Love, this is a no-holds-barred account of a career and life at the very top. Grohl's powerhouse drumming, anthemic riffing and melodic brilliance have proved both thrilling and enduring, and he remains one of rock's most respected figures.",
