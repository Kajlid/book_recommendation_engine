  "description": "How do you save your family from the secret they are sworn to protect?  After a creepy stranger, with scales instead of skin, comes to their family’s apartment in the middle of the night to deliver an ultimatum—turn over what belongs to him or die— fourteen-year-old Miranda McAdelind and her eleven-year-old brother Justin are sent away to the protective safety of their estranged grandfather’s ranch in rural Colorado.    However, the ranch does not turn out to be the safe haven that their parents believe it to be. Not only do mysterious, near fatal, accidents keep happening but someone is stealing priceless objects from the ranch, objects that if discovered would expose a wondrous secret their family is sworn to protect: that dragons are real.      Can Miranda and Justin find out who is responsible for the thefts before the council of Dragon Lords seizes control of their family’s ranch, or will they be the next victims of whoever, or whatever, is working to destroy them?  The Dragon Rustler, an upper middle-grade modern fantasy novel, is the first book in the Cowboys and Dragons series by Anthony A. Kerr. If you like Percy Jackson and the Last Olympians, The Kane Chronicles, Fablehaven and the Harry Potter series, then you'll love The Dragon Rustler.
