  "description": "A collection of some of the finest and memorable poems to learn by heart \" Paths of glory ,\" \" Theirs not to reason why ,\" \" When you are old and grey and full of sleep ,\" \" A handful of dust ,\" and \" Shall I compare thee to a summer's day \"—these and many others are famous lines of poetry that often occur in everyday speech. However, most people find it difficult to recall the rest of the poem, and that is where this book comes in handy. An anthology to warm the coldest heart or charm the least romantic soul, this is a collection of poems (or in some cases, extracts) that are not only memorable, but allow themselves to be easily imprinted in the mind. This is the perfect book for anyone with even the vaguest interest in poetry, providing a wonderful opportunity to revisit those much-loved lines remembered from earlier days.",
