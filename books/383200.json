  "title": "The Two Towers",
  "description": "Classic hardback edition of the second volume of The Lord of the Rings, featuring Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket design. Includes special packaging and the definitive edition of the text, with fold-out map. Frodo and the Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs. Now they continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin -- alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. Now, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its first publication, the text has been fully restored with almost 400 corrections -- with the full co-operation of Christopher Tolkien -- making it the definitive version, and as close as possible to the version that J.R.R. Tolkien intended. Also included is the original red and black map of Middle-earth as a fold-out sheet. This 50th anniversary hardback features Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket design, which has been reworked to celebrate this special anniversary.",
