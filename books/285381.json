  "description": "When Jiro, son of Hades, shows up to claim her soul--the soul her mother bartered away--Yesenia has no choice but to accompany him to the underworld. Not one to go down without a fight, Yesenia makes a covenant with the devil himself in an attempt to win her soul back. However, her bargain has unforeseen consequences. Now Yesenia must fight in the Olympian Trials and win as Hades's champion. With Demigods for competitors, a reluctant Jiro is her only hope at victory. But when you're Hades' champion, the only thing more deadly than losing the tournament is winning.",
