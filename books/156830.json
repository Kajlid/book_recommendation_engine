To do this Thomas turns on one set of vows and return to his once lofty noble connections. He encounters old friends, a new love, and temptations that will try his conscience. And his very soul.For Thomas is beginning to think that all that he knows may not be true. Faced with mortal love and friendships that he desperately wants and fears, he knows that time is growing short.And the choice that he makes will reshape the world.",
