  "description": "Mystic Caravan Circus is heading to the West Coast, and while everyone is happy for the change of scenery there's a pall settling over the group. Poet and Kade are in a good place and planning for a change, but it's something Poet can't focus on because she feels as if someone is watching â€¦ and whoever it is has evil in his or her heart. The festival location is different, and instead of space, the circus denizens have festival workers and artisans on every side. They're open and exposed, and hiding their secret has never been more important. When one of their own goes missing, Poet is determined to figure out exactly what's going on. The answers won't be easy, though, and there are all different types of evil. A fight is coming, and the enemy is different from anything they've ever faced. They're outnumbered and might find themselves outmaneuvered. Who will survive? More importantly, who will be lost to something even worse than death? Sometimes death really is better.",
