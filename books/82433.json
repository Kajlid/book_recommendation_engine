  "description": "Johathan lives happily on his island when suddenly, an earthquake rocks his world!What happened to his safe island? How will he cope?Based on the concept that a family is a child's island, The Divided Island metaphorically conveys the message that even when the family unit is broken in two, the child's safety and well-being is guaranteed by the creation of two connected units instead of the single unit the child is accustomed to.By indirectly picturing the uncertainties and shocks surrounding divorce time and providing an optimistic resolution, the book focuses on a divorce potential for positive outcome, thus reducing the anxiety during the transition time .The Divided Island follows the tribulations of Jonathan, a happy little boy living on an island with two monkeys. After a mild earthquake, Jonathan notices worrying changes in the monkeys' behavior, changes he does not understand and for which he receives no satisfactory explanation. A second earthquake breaks the island in two, with one of the monkey on the second half, destroying Jonathan's world. Soon, a rope between the two islands used as a bridge brings Jonathan to the severed part of the island where he finds his own special place to mimic the one he had when the island was whole.",
