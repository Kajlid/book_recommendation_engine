  "description": "Uwem Akpan's first published short story, \"An Ex-mas Feast,\" appeared in The New Yorker 's Debut Fiction issue in 2005. The story's portrait of a family living together in a makeshift shanty in urban Kenya, and their attempts to find gifts of any kind for the impending Christmas holiday, gives a matter-of-fact reality to the most extreme circumstances--and signaled the arrival of a breathtakingly talented writer.\"My Parents' Bedroom\" is a Rwandan girl's account of her family's struggles to maintain a facade of normalcy amid unspeakable acts. In \"FatÂ­tening for Gabon,\" a brother and sister cope with their uncle's attempt to sell them into slavery. \"Luxurious Hearses\" creates a microcosm of Africa within a busload of refugees and introduces us to a Muslim boy who summons his faith to bear a treacherous ride through Nigeria. \"What Language Is That?\" reveals the emotional toll of the Christian-Muslim conflict in Ethiopia through the eyes of childhood friends. Every story is a testament to the wisdom and resilience of children, even in the face of the most agonizing situations our planet can offer.",
