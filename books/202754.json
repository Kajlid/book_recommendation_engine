  "description": "Trey Domato is the next big thing in football. A quarterback with a cool head, smoldering eyes, and a cannon for an arm, he's collected awards, trophies, and hearts across the country. He's on every girl's mind. Every coach's dream sheet. Every agent's wishlist. Including Sloane Ashford's. Sloane grew up at her father's side in the Ashford Agency. He built the company from the ground up, representing some of the biggest names in sports, and now Sloane is determined to find her place among its top agents. She's got the knowledge, she's got the drive, and if she can land Trey, she knows she's got her 'in'. But it's hard to keep your eyes on the prize when the sweetest, sexiest smile you've ever seen is constantly on your mind. When the hottest hands in the nation are in your hair. When you're whispering the name thousands of fans are screaming at the top of their lungs. Sleeping with a client is a mistake, but falling in love with him? That's some rookie sh#t right there. *Due to language and sexual content this book is not recommended for readers under 18. Each book in the Offensive Line series is a STANDALONE following a different player every time.",
