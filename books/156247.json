  "description": "The first three books of the Amazon best-selling series!If you like dark epic fantasy with a sci-fi twist, then you'll love Pearseus.On New Year's Eve, the year of 2099, the distinguished guests aboard the Pearseus did not get to countdown seconds. Instead, they counted bodies and survivors after the spaceship's crash landing on another planet.The good news? The planet was seemingly hospitable both in resources and in terms of the natives' attitude towards earthlings.The bad news? They might have come on this planet bare of possessions, but what they hadn't been able to shed were the shortcomings of their human nature. Will that be the sole threat to a unified future, or is the new land and its first inhabitants not as innocent as they look?The bundle contains the three first books in the series. Starting 300 years after the events described in the prequel, Pearseus: Schism, they examine what happens when humanity is forced to start over. Again.Note: The original version of this bundle contained the prequel, Pearseus: Schism. The new version contains Rise of the Prince, Mad Water and Vigil.",
