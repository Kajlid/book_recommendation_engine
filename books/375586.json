  "description": "Sondra's only dream in life is to complete college and make her family proud. But when she moves into an apartment she can barely afford near the University of Southern California, her dreams start changing. After paying for school with an academic scholarship and barely surviving with very little money, her suspicious and somewhat creepy neighbor Vick shows an interest in her. But Sondra still has her mind set on the goal of completing college.After Vick's many attempts to force his attentions on her, she gives in and starts a relationship with him, a relationship filled with domestic and sexual violence. Sondra thinks that if only she could change Vick, their relationship would work and she could finish her education. Will Sondra be able to change Vick's violent behaviors and settle back down into the life she's always wanted for herself, or will Vick end up changing her forever?Many people don't know that domestic violence crosses all walks of life and affects rich and poor alike, young and old, all languages and cultures, and both women and men. Author Alma Hudson wrote The Trouble With Change to let everyone suffering from domestic violence know that there is hope even when you think things are hopeless. Hudson works as a supervisor for a legal department in Lancaster, California, and was motivated to write this book from her own personal experiences with domestic violence.",
