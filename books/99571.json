  "description": "Megan Riley has always lived her life right—right boyfriend, right college, right career…right up until she discovers that her boyfriend is engaged to another woman and “debriefing” her boss was an expected part of her job description. Heartbroken and desperate to start fresh, Megan takes a job as a night manager at a swanky hotel in New York City. But when a wealthy VIP guest checks in, expecting more than a simple turn-down service, Megan has to decide between doing what’s right or finding out just how right something so wrong can feel.Marriage is something hotel-mogul and confirmed bachelor, Preston Strauss, refuses to entertain, until he discovers that he needs a wife in order to maintain controlling interest of his family’s hotel empire. With his sheets still warm from a wild night with the sweet but incredibly sexy Megan, Preston decided marriage wouldn’t be so bad. Not if done right. So he offers Megan five-million dollars for three years of marriage—and three years of sharing his bed. But when their faux-engagement turns real, Megan’s past comes back to haunt them and it might just destroy any chance they had at a real future.This book contains adult content and sexual scenes.
