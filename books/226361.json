  "title": "A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts",
  "description": "The greatest adventure of the twentieth century came with a John F. Kennedy deadline, to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. The race to the moon started in 1961 and was crowned with success in 1969 when Neil Armstrong accomplished his famous moon walk, twenty-five years ago.Through the astronauts' eyes, revealing many previously unknown personal details, Andrew Chaikin chronicles the Apollo missions from their disaster-plagued beginnings, through their spectacular climax, to their premature end.From flamboyant prankster Pete Conrad to shy and remote Neil Armstrong, memorable characters abound. Andrew Chaikin skillfully makes technological details accessible to the lay reader, and gives each aspect of the moon voyage, from a Saturn V lift-off to the euphoria of a moon walk, all the excitement of a minute-by-minute account.Although watched by millions on television, the real impact of Apollo - the experiences of the first men to visit another world - remained until now like the moon itself, beyond our grasp.With its narrative skill and unprecedented characterization, A Man on the Moon brings us closer than ever to understanding those experiences, and will ensure the feats of the astronauts live on in the popular memory.",
