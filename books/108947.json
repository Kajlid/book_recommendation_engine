  "description": "Nicky has a secret. She fled Germany at the age of fifteen, and found sanctuary in the sleepy English town of Maidenhead, where her café, Ruby in the Dust, has become a success. But now, as Maidenhead modernises, and Corporista Coffee engulfs the town, Nicky is falling behind on her rent and facing eviction. With all these worries hammering at her heart, she certainly isn’t looking for love.  When Alex crashes into her life with promises to help turn the business around, Nicky is sceptical. But there’s more to Alex than the waster he’s become. When Nicky’s nasty landlord challenges Alex to save the café in three months, Alex can’t resist, and they lay down a bet that could end up costing the penniless Alex a fortune.  Can Nicky put her pride aside to work with Alex and save Ruby in the Dust, before it becomes yet another corporate coffeehouse? And can she come to terms with her secret, and allow herself to fall in love with Alex, even if it means facing her deepest fears?  Snuggle up with a cuppa, and enjoy the warmth of Ruby in the Dust!",
