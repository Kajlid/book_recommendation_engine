  "title": "The Deepest Dark",
  "description": "Following the deaths of her husband, Corey, and ten year old daughter Ellie in a traffic accident, author Abby Miller sinks ever deeper into depression. She contemplates suicide as a way to be with them, and to end her unrelenting pain. In a last desperate effort to find peace, she drives to Loon Lake where they last vacationed together, wanting to believe they will be waiting for her there. At least in spirit. Barring that, the pills Doctor Gregory gave her to help her sleep, are in her purse. The cabin at Loon Lake was her and Corey's secret hideaway, and not even Abby's sister, Karen, to whom she is close, knows where it is. But someone else does. He is one of three men who have escaped from Pennington prison. They are dangerous predators who will stop at nothing to get what they want - and to keep from going back to prison. Having already committed the worst of crimes, they have nothing to lose. Unknowingly, Abby is on a collision course with evil itself. And the decision of whether to live or die will soon be wrenched from her hands. Ms. Hall Hovey is a superb writer. She is a real story teller. The suspense & tension she creates in her books make them real page turners. Her talent for characterisation involves the reader emotionally in her characters' lives and their stories. Her genuine understanding and empathy for human nature and the human condition pervade her work. Her adept ability to continually surprise make this talented artist and her work extremely compelling. These are the reasons why her fans love her and are extremely faithful, and are always waiting for her next book. (Marion Rand, Kindle Edition)",
