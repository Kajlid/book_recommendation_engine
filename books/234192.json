While Karl works to whip his troops into shape, Parker invades the belly of the beast, and Hannah and Ezekiel head on diverging paths to seek help. \n\nThey’ve made a stand, but can they win the war?\n\n\nRevolution brings the first arc of The Rise of Magic series to an explosive end, finally setting right decades old wrongs and answering the question of good versus evil. It’s an action packed story, filled with heart, humor, and the never ending pursuit of justice.",
