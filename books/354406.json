  "description": "John Fielding was famous not only as cofounder of London's first police force, the Bow Street Runners, but also as a magistrate of keen intellect, fairness and uncommon detective ability. What made this all the remarkable was that he was blind. Now with his young assistant and ward, Jeremy Proctor, Fielding faces a series of crimes that hit shockingly close to home. Prostitutes are being murdered around Covent Garden, and Fielding devises a daring and desperate plan to find the culprit. However, the consequences are unexpected--and more terrible than even Fielding could imagine.\"Historical fiction done this entertainingly is as close to time travel as we're likely to get.\" - Newsday",
