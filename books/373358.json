  "description": "21st Century Bounty Hunter Through the mean streets of a grim 21st Century megalopolis, bounty hunter Rick Deckard stalked, searching out the renegade replicants who were his prey. But this assignment involved Nexus-6 targets and as a result Deckard quickly found himself involved in a nightmare kaleidoscope of violence and subterfuge - and the threat of death for the hunter rather than the hunted... A marvellous and complex book, simply written but leaving all kinds of resonance in the mind - Brian W. Aldiss",
