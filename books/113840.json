This becomes easier to understand when one considers that it was politicians, in 1776, who gave the American people the right to pursue happiness. But when in the history of humankind have people been able to trust politicians?America Never Promised Us Happiness (Only the Right to Pursue It) argues that there is a hidden agenda behind the pursuit of happiness: the American people are the mouse, happiness is the cheese, and the trap is waiting to snap. There is no better way to protect your life and liberty than to wise up to the happiness hype. This book shows you how. is book shows you how.",
