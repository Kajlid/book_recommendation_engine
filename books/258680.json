  "description": "A GIFT TOO TEMPTING TO REFUSE. Billionaire Ashton Blackstone is on top of his game. He's in Vegas to close a major deal, but he ends up dealing with something else, as well, a beautiful, young virgin. A gift. His would-be partners believe that sealing a billion-dollar deal with a virgin's blood brings them good luck. Well, he doesn't believe in that mumbo-jumbo. He made his first million through sheer hard work, cunning and determination and has never been superstitious. Until he lays eyes on his \"gift\". Maybe he's superstitious, after all. Corazon \"Heart\" Alvez has been dealt with bad cards all her life, but this time around, she has a trump card in her hands and she must win, if only to secure her future. She's sold her virginity to the highest bidder. But to be able to collect her money, she must make this man who bought her very happy. But Ashton Blackstone is not an ordinary man, not only because he's very wealthy. He's also devastatingly handsome with an aura that commands her into willing submission with just a look. She may end up losing not only her virginity but her heart, as well. -------- WARNING! This author wants it sweet, hot and dirty. This novella contains graphic language; much older hero/young heroine; cherries and babies. No cheating! Definitely HEA. Enjoy!",
