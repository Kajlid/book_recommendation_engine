  "title": "Colin Preston Rocked And Rolled",
  "description": "With drop dead gorgeous Jasmine from Laguna Beach you never know what will happen next and every date is truly an adventure. Funny as hell with characters that feel completely real and you won't read a better coming of age story about teenage angst and first love than this one. What readers are saying: \"Great Story...I really enjoyed this book. It pulled you in from the first and kept you interested through out. It was well written and made you feel like you were there. The story and the characters were great too. I recommend this author and this book to all.\" \"Stayed up until 3 am reading this...I SO wanted to finish the book last night but only made it until 3 am. It's hard to believe that this is the author's first novel, it's that good. I thought the character development, in part using their taste in music, was enjoyably clever. Reading about Colin's struggles brought back a lot of memories of college. First loves, betrayals, loneliness, friendship, happiness and growing through adversity are such big parts of the those years of our lives...Great book!\"",
