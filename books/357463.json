  "description": "“Diabolical ingenuity and rueful tenderness…a playwright with a particularly pungent and intelligent vision.” –Ben Brantley, New York Times“A vivid panorama of a Lower East Side street scene crammed with grimy tenements, riotous store fronts and packed pushcarts…epic theatre…a fascinating new adaptation of Sholom Asch’s 1906 drama.” –Malcolm Johnson, Hartford CourantJack Chapman runs a brothel on the first floor of his tenement and while he is prosperous, he is not virtuous. For his daughter Rivkele, however, Jack aspires for something more—respectability through her marriage to a religious scholar. But Rivkele’s tender love affair with Manke, one of Jack’s prostitutes, threatens to destroy the upcoming marriage, and with it, Jack’s dream of redemption. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Donald Margulies transforms Sholom Asch’s classic mortality tale into a work of spellbinding power.Donald Margulies received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Dinner with Friends .
