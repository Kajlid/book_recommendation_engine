  "description": "Tyler Washington was never fond of his birthday. It seemed that the day only brought up sad memories and bad realities. His thirty-fifth birthday was going to be no exception. Tyler woke the day of his birthday faced with a dilemma. Stay on the track he was going, or try something new. Always the planner, Tyler hesitantly decided to follow the calculated plans, which included a marriage he certainly was still unsure of. That of course was until he met Willow. Then suddenly his birthday and the path less traveled didn’t seem so scary. Willow McBride prided herself on being unconventional. She lived for the beauty and the thrill of a free uninhibited life. However, her bohemian spirit was starting to play havoc with her love life. After dumping another talented but self-absorbed artist, Willow went looking for a new love. However, she wasn’t expecting to find Tyler. Not only was Tyler older, but the straight-laced businessman was the complete opposite of the men she normally dated. Yet Willow couldn’t deny the attraction. Maybe Tyler was just what she needed. Love never comes without challenges. As Tyler explores a fresh new love and life with Willow, he finds himself faced with some challenges from his past. One of those challenges being a not so happy ex who can’t let go, and the other being the limitations he can’t seem to let go of. Will Tyler be able to open himself to a new and exciting love with Willow, or will old hang-ups and past relationships stand in his way.",
