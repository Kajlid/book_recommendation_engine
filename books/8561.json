  "title": "The Collected Sermons of Fred B. Craddock",
  "description": "This collection of more than fifty of Fred Craddock's sermons provides a glimpse of a master preacher at work. Amazingly, only one of the sermons was preached from a manuscript written in advance, as Craddock considered a sermon to be an event in the world of sound. As a result, the selections here wonderfully reflect and preserve Craddock's \"voice\" and engage readers with all the immediacy of the spoken word.",
