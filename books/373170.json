  "description": "The Cannibal Within (Quotations)Â \"The truth is not beautiful - it stands on cloven hooves - it is covered in coagulated blood - but it is the truth.\"\"Ingestion is the ultimate act of domination. The victim is absorbed by the eater--body and soul are absorbed--and all that remains is excrement.\"\"You must torture it first, she whispered, with perverse logic. \"Terror-stricken animals taste better.\"\"Man needs lies like children need toys.\"\"In this reality of ours, gods are simply expert players who move grotesquely carved pieces in a game without rules.\"\"Self-destruction would be a brief, almost autoerotic free-fall into a great velvet darkness.\"\"Had not the great Yukio Mishima killed himself with a dagger? Thrusting and wet--his hand one with the weapon--Mishima called suicide the 'ultimate masturbation.'\"\"Crawling into your soul, we can brutalize you without even touching you.\"\"Nailed to the crosses were two thieves. Naked except for crowns of thorns, they were called 'Perverted by Wealth\" and 'Degraded by Poverty.'\"'Error is like sin,' hissed a voice in the dream. 'The deeper it is, the less the victim suspects its existence.'\"'In the next world--as in this world--beauty and danger, seduction and torment, are indissolubly linked.\"\"Devoted to wicked science--the hostile domination of nature--the complex is composed of thousands of gloomy laboratories. Here, legions of amoral researchers--greedy for knowledge--commit crimes against bodies and ideas.\"\"In my dreams I kissed her in a playful and amorous way, and then we made love--in the fresh air--the way wild animals do.\"",
