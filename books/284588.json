  "description": "Vivien Jayne Reginald, a.k.a. Reggie, is an enigma. On one hand, she’s a confident, talented artist with an impressive art degree under her belt. On the other, she’s an insecure woman who never got over her dad walking out on her when she was thirteen. Sure, she’s got issues, but Reggie believes the key to happiness is hard work and making art. Not only that, she’s convinced the only man she needs in her life is her best friend, Kai.  Carter Corcoran is a conundrum. The hottest defensive end in the NFL, Carter is big and brawny and has the best sack percentage in the league. Sure, he’s a force on the field but off the field? Let’s just say he’s got a secret. A secret, only his family knows about.  When Carter talks to Reggie at an art exhibit, he meets a kindred spirit; one who understands his need to create. She’s not his type. At. All. She’s all curves and spunk. Nothing like his normal arm candy. But, the more Carter learns about Vivien, the more he realizes something’s been missing in his life. Something real. Now all he has to do is convince Vivien he’s worth the risk.  Due to coarse language and sexual content this book is intended for readers 18+. It is a stand-alone with a sexy hero with no cheating and an HEA.  (And here’s a heads up for those of you who are following the Flynn Family series. Carter Corcoran is Kennedy Corcoran-Flynn’s brother;)",
