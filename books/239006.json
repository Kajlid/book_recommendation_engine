  "description": "TEMPTATION BURNS HOTTER WHEN IT'S FORBIDDEN. Ryland Boyd is a man who knows what he wants and goes after it with single-minded determination. But he’s having an internal tug of war between his code of honor and the desperation to possess the one thing he desires the most in this world, his best friend’s daughter, the precious gem he’d willingly die to protect. He might just ruin her in the end. How can he resist plucking this innocent flower when she’s badly asking for it?  Rizzy Parker has had a crush on her “Uncle” Ry since her pubescent years. He’s her real-life superhero and he’s been starring in her romantic fantasies for so long. But she’s done day-dreaming. She’s done calling him uncle, too. She wants real. She wants Ry to see her as a woman who’s madly in love with him and not the little girl who used to follow him around like a puppy. Then an opportunity presents itself. She has to live with Ry for a few months. She’s ready to be his anything.  NOTE: This is a stand-alone novella with a simple plot written for a quick read. The author asks you to be wanton and forget about your feminist shit and just enjoy this little novel for what it is— sugary-sweet, eye-rolling cheesy and unapologetically smutty in the most purple way. That’s how this author wants it. There’s definitely an HEA, and a lot of baby-making. If that floats your boat, welcome aboard!  STAND-ALONE. NO CLIFFY.",
