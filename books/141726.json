  "title": "My Sister from the Black Lagoon : A Novel of My Life",
  "description": "\"I was born into a mentally ill family. My sister was the officially crazy one, but really we were all nuts.\"So begins My Sister from the Black Lagoon, Laurie Fox's incandescent novel of growing up absurd. Lorna Person's tale is wrested from the shadows cast by her sister, Lonnie, whose rages command the full attention of her parents. Their San Fernando Valley household is off-key and out of kilter, a place where Lonnie sees evil in the morning toast and runs into the Burbank hills to join the animals that seem more like her kin. Lorna, on the other hand, is an acutely sensitive girl who can't relate to Barbie. \"Could Barbie feel sorrow? Could Barbie understand what it's like to be plump, lonely, Jewish?\"My Sister from the Black Lagoon is a wisecracked bell jar, a heartbreaking study of sane and crazy. Laurie Fox's delightful voice is knowing yet wide-eyed, lyrical, and witty.",
