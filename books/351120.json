  "description": "This blooming good story is the 18th book in our popular Disney Fairies chapter book series, which features Tinker Bell's adventures in Never Land with her fairy friends.Lily has always thought of herself as a garden-talent fairy first and foremost. But after Tink challenges the other talents to think up new ideas, Lily discovers she's pretty good at inventing things, too, like her new flowers, the panglories. They grow anywhereâ€”in dirt, on wood, even on rocks! But then little gray spots pop up, first on the panglories, then on other flowers, until all the plants in Pixie Hollow start losing their colors. Can Lily invent a way out of this new fix?",
