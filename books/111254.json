Sandrine always considered herself the shy, retiring type and working in an antiquarian bookshop wasn’t exactly living on the edge. That is, until tall, dark and handsome Jack Lucas walks into her life at just the right time to protect Sandrine and her friends from danger. But is Jack everything he seems? To make matters even more confusing, Jack unlocks a side to Sandrine that she finds as exciting as it is troubling. As she embarks on a voyage of sexual self-discovery, the pair join forces to solve one of the greatest mysteries of the art world and take on a slew of ruthless enemies who will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. Dee Ellis lives in Sydney, Australia, and has more than 30 years’ experience as a journalist and magazine editor. A world traveller, lover of books and music and the finer things in life, this is her first novel. She eagerly anticipates continuing the adventures of Sandrine and Jack. Note to readers: the subject matter and descriptions in this novel are detailed and highly-charged. MasterStroke is suitable only for adults.",
