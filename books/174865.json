The clock is ticking, and Remington is competing against time to save the woman who is fast becoming a part of his soul.But what happens after that? Will she stay, or will his past destroy any chance with her? Love is what remains after our reservations melt away; when we let our demons come out to play.Selene knows it is just a matter of time before all hell breaks loose. Whoever is after them is after blood. Her blood. She should have cut ties with Remington the second she read that first letter, but that is no longer a choice. She has fallen too far, too hard, and she is in too deep, both emotionally and physically. At times secrets unite, and sometimes they destroy lives. Will the secret that binds them be enough to break Selene and Remington, or will it mend shattered bonds and make them stronger?**Reading order**Havoc (Havoc #1)Obliterate (Havoc #2)Mend (Havoc #3)",
