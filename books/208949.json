He’ll definitely make you scream, but he won’t think twice about you when he walks away.Bridger carries the darkest of secrets He’s filled with too much pain.He’s utterly untouchable.Until she came along.**Warning: this book has sex in it. Lots of sex. Dirty sex. The Wicked Horse Series is a bit different than what Sawyer Bennett normally writes.
