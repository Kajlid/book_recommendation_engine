  "description": "You are correct, there is a government conspiracy. But, the conspiracy is to distract people from things our government may or may not be doing. This is achieved by IDIOT, our very own bureaucracy dedicated to distraction via UFO's, entertainment, e-mail chain letters and Bigfoot. Why else would we be so caught up in voting for the best singer on television but cannot be bothered to vote in an actual government election?",
