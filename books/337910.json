  "description": "Talon  I surf. I fuck. I pretend to smile.  Two years ago my life was perfect, until it wasn’t. I scattered my wife’s ashes then walked away from the Marines. I didn’t think I had anything left to lose.  I was wrong.  The blonde showed up on my doorstep beaten and stabbed. I did what I was trained to do — I stitched her up. I didn’t have a clue who she was and I told myself I didn’t care. Until they came looking for her.  I swore I’d take my last breath before I let anyone else hurt her, except I didn’t know she was keeping a deadly secret. Now I had two choices, her life or mine.  Marriage and combat taught me the same thing — I was no one’s hero. And I was about to prove it.   Warning: This book contains offensive language, violence and sexual situations. Mature audiences only.",
