  "description": "The series draws to an explosive conclusion as Kala’s allies clash with Soren’s army, straining bonds and testing friendships. The real enemy, the shadowy Church, led by the cunning Priestess, continues to pull everyone’s strings to orchestrate the Apocalypse. The Priestess has a formidable arsenal of warrior monks, an order of assassins, fearsome ancient weapons, and the support of the Ancients themselves. Caught between forces bent on total destruction, the situation looks hopeless for Kala and those she loves. A final battle is looming in which Kala will have to choose between her humanity and her destiny – a battle that will scorch the earth and her heart. Can one person stop the Apocalypse, even if that person is the Goddess’s Scythe?",
