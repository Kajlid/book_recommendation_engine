  "description": "Beautiful, educated and career-driven Nikki Washington is living the single life and loving every bit of it. She is the epitome of the independent woman. It’s no secret that she’s been hurt in the past, and those around her feel that she is hiding behind her career to divert love. Although she has reservations about giving love a chance again, she is more convinced that she’s only holding out for Mr. Right. She believes that she has a long way to go before she gets to her happily ever after.  Life throws her a curveball when she meets Jamison Cooper. He is as suave as he is sexy. His swag and southern boy charm combined with his go-getter attitude threaten to sweep Nikki off her feet! Will she continue to shun love or can Jamison open her eyes to the possibilities of ever after?",
