  "description": "When an amnesiac girl is rescued from the sea, she finds herself aboard a voyage of the damned. Led by the legendary immortal Charon, the crew must set sail across a vast subterranean ocean to reach Mt. Olympus, home of the gods. Being the only living person on a ship full of deceased criminals, traitors, and murderers, Hope must learn who to trust before her soul joins the ranks of the dead for all eternity. With an array of obstacles before them, sailing across a world so hostile it can kill even the dead, Hope, Charon, and the crew of the Styx are not expected to succeed. But they must try, for the price of failure is beyond imagining. Along the way, they must come to terms with their own difficult pasts, an uncertain future, and what it means to be human.",
