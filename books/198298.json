  "description": "To Anybody Out ThereMy name is Jackie McGee. I am the girl who disappeared. Listen to the news. See if other pieces of paper are scattered nearby. Maybe if you yell really loud I can hear you and yell back. I am not making this up. Please help!Left in an underground cement room by an unknown captor, Jackie has food and water but no light or human contact. She does not know when—or if—her abductor will return.As her desperation mounts, Jackie touch-types to focus her on letters to her family, a story for her English class, and reflections on her life in the past few months. In her isolation and fear, Jackie is forced to test her emotional boundaries, and in doing so she finds new meaning in her past as well as rich reserves of strength and courage within herself.",
