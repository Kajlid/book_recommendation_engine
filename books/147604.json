  "description": "From the world's greatest scientists--the world's greatest science book! With a foreword written by critically acclaimed author Simon Singh (Fermat's Last Theorem) and essays by such major writers as Richard Dawkings, Susan Greenfield, and John Gribbin, it presents 250 of the most significant milestones in the history of scientific discovery. Accompanying this unique perspective on our ever-evolving view of the universe are some of the most visually dramatic illustrations you'll ever see. Short, lucid articles focus on everything from the speculations of the ancient Greeks to today's Nobel Prize winners, from Ptolemy's theory of an Earth-centered universe to the first steps on the moon, and from the dawning of the concept of zero to the cloning of Dolly the sheep. Biology, physics, astronomy, medicine, and the breakthroughs in every field are all here and celebrated, in the first truly accessible, fully illustrated story of science. 9 7/8 X 11 1/2. 300 Color Pages",
