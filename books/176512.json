  "description": "In 1939, after ten years as an expatriate, Henry Miller returned to the United States with a keen desire to see what his native land was really likeâ€”to get to the roots of the American nature and experience. He set out on a journey that was to last three years, visiting many sections of the country and making friends of all descriptions. The Air-Conditioned Nightmare is the result of that odyssey.",
