  "description": "Jess isn't working tonight.  She's there to give her boyfriend, mob boss Nick Roman, owner of Takers Gentlemenâ€™s Club, a private show he won't soon forget. An extremely private show...that's not so private.  She doesn't care who's watching. After all that's part of the fun, isn't it? Exhibitionism at its most wicked. Being as explicit and naughty as you can be, knowing everyone sees.  Welcome to the Girls of Takers, where women grant wishes every night...If the money's right.  Warning: Seriously HOT Book. Contents may explode under pressure. Viewer Discretion is most certainly advised.  ***This erotic short story is approximately 4000 words, and is the first in a series of standalone one night stand erotic short stories. Due to sexual content, occasional scenes and references to/of violence, organized crime, language and frequent illegal drug use, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter, and not offended by graphic depiction of sex between consenting adults. ***",
