  "description": "Meet Rufus Valasay. As a member of Les Croyants des Trois, a powerful clan of telepaths and healers, he is sworn to protect the ordinary world of the Moyenne. But now, with his memory gone and danger approaching, Rufus has nothing to go on but his passionate feelings for the only person he can trust...Make Me Remember/When he wakes, he finds himself in the cold streets of Edinburgh, with no name, no memory, nothing but the strong, hard fear that he has made a terrible mistake and left someone in danger. He shouldn t trust anyone. So why does the stranger with the blue eyes and blonde hair who offers him a warm place to stay seem so trustworthy, so warm, so incredibly right? She says her name is Fabia Fair, and fair she is, from her quick smile to her lush curves. The way she tends to his wounds, the kindness in her voice, stirs a hunger he can t ignore. He hasn t forgotten how a woman s body feels against his, the softness of her skin. He hasn t forgotten how to bring her exquisite pleasure. One thing s for certain: he s never kissed this woman before, because if he had, he d never have forgotten it. Even more alarming, he is able to read her deepest thoughts -- and those thoughts are very interesting, indeed..With each caress and soulful kiss, his memory returns, making him wish he could forget again. For he is no ordinary mortal, but a Croyant, a magic man, and the danger he faces is very real. Someone is coming for him, someone who will harm anyone to get to him and his kind. But he doesn t intend to make the same mistake twice, or let go of his only reason to believe...",
