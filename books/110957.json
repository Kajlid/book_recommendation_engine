Although Sally and Mama are now free from their wealthy but oppressive family in San Francisco, they find that life in a mining town is challenging, even with Murphy by their side. Sally grows to love Nome, despite the threats from wild animals, menacing humans, and harsh weather. So when it seems they may have to return to San Francisco, she and Murphy strike out on their own, hoping to find gold and make a permanent home. But danger awaits, in the form of blizzards, bears and Murphy's original owner, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, whether it is an ill-gotten fortune or a valuable dog.",
