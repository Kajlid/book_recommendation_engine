  "description": "I, Walter is an historical adventure that follows Walter Crofter from his beginnings in London, to his end in Northern Spain. In a country and a time where favor and politics were both deadly, can an honest boy stay true to himself? Especially given his family background? I, Walter is the first in a series of books in a saga which will span continents and time to arrive in present day North America. Each in the series will be connected, though that connection may not be obvious for several more books. It's almost like looking at a menorah (sic).. Many lines, seemingly individual, connect to center at different points.",
