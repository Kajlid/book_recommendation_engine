  "description": "Two classic tales of royal love and palace intrigue by New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts.\nThe Playboy Prince\n When it came to women, Prince Bennett could never refuse a challenge -- and after meeting quiet, lovely Lady Hannah Rothchild, the dashing playboy couldn't rest until he broke through her careful reserve. Love had always been a game to Bennett, but with this elusive, mysterious woman he found his heart was on the line, and he was playing for keeps....\nCordina's Crown Jewel\n For a few blessed weeks, Her Royal Highness Camilla de Cordina could be just plain Camilla MacGee. And working in rural Vermont for archaeologist Delaney Caine -- devastatingly handsome, utterly cantankerous -- offered the perfect refuge. But as her irritation became fascination, then desire, the royal runaway knew she'd have to confess. Would Del see her as a woman to be loved, or dismiss her as a royal pain?",
