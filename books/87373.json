  "title": "The Master's Plan for the Church",
  "description": "It is absolutely essential that a church perceive itself as an institution for the glory of God.And to do that, claims John MacArthur, the local church must adhere unfalteringly to biblical leadership principles. Christ never intended church leadership to be earned by seniority, purchased with money, or inherited through family ties. He never compared church leaders to governing monarchs, but rather to humble shepherds. Not to slick celebrities, but to laboring servants. Drawing from some of the best-received material on church leadership, John MacArthur guides the church with crucial, effective lessons in leadership. This book is valuable not only for pastors and elders, but for anyone else who wants the church to be what God intended it to be.",
