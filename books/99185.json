  "description": "Boss's story.‘Every man is as heaven made him, and sometimes a great deal worse.’ Boss, drummer for the highly accredit rock group Room 103, understands this statement. Only too well.He has been in love with one woman since he was sixteen. She was his soul mate, his lover, his heart and his very essence. But she was never his and yet she was always his.Nine years! Nine long and lonely years since he last saw her, since he last embraced her unique spark of life and nine god damn years since he’d tasted her passion. Then, bang! There she was, stood in front of him like a vision, like a gift presented to him from God.What did he do when he saw her? He ran.He ran because he knew if he touched her once again, then he wouldn't give her the chance to disappear again, to break him all over again or to kill him a little more.But this time he would make it his mission to have her, to hold on to her and to finally make her his. Completely.He would do anything for her, and he does. He does the very thing that loses her. So now he needs to fight; to battle and strive to get her back. With a little help from friends and band mates, his own unique outlook on life and a tiny reprieve from God; he grins widely, begs shamelessly and just plain charms the pants off her, the only way Boss can.Jen belongs to Boss… simple.Stand in his way and he’ll take you down.This book contains explicit sex scenes, domestic abuse, strong language and violence… oh, and one hell of a sweet rocker.",
