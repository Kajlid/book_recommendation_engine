In the bestselling tradition of \"MAD About the Sixties, \" here is a hilarious look back at the \"Disco Decade\" from America's foremost satire magazine.

You'll be grateful for these dead-on paradies as \"The Usual Gange of Idiots\" - the artists, writers, and editors of MAD Magazine - present classic features from their past. So sit back, grab a Billy Beer, and get down, get funky, and get it on with \"Mad About the Seventies.\" And may their farce be with you!",
