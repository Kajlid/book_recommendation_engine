  "description": "Catherine Jewell is going through a Haunted Corn Maze with her brother when a teacher dressed as a vampire is murdered. Maggie Fiest, an art teacher, is going through the maze checking on her students dressed as ghosts, zombies and vampires when she discovers the body. Because she gets blood on her witch costume, she's one of the many suspects. Although the police chief John MacDougal makes it clear to Catherine she is not to take part in the investigation, but of course, she can't help but try to find the real murderer rather than have her best friend remain a suspect. Because the teacher had more people dislike him than liked him, there are a lot of possible suspects. An additional suspense is added when Hannah and Teddy, nine year old twins find the entrance to a tunnel once a part of the Underground Railroad and also find a skeleton.",
