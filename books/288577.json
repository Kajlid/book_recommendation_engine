  "description": "Val and Chloe don't fit in at their fancy private school in Manhattan. Together, they ditch school, visit cemeteries and thrift shops and have sleepovers during which they confide all their secret thoughts. Lately, Val has all kinds of questions. Especially about sex. So Val turns to the two people who have always given her the most honest answers possible: her mother and Chloe. Unfortunately, not even Val's mother--an adult!--has all the answers. Val starts to think that maybe she's not \"normal\" at all. Because she has some other feelings for Chloe. Feelings that she never expected to have. Would Chloe think those feelings were wrong? And her biggest question of all: How do you separate loving someone as a friend and the other kind of love--or do they cross over sometimes?Acclaimed author Deborah Hautzig's 1978 novel is an unforgettable exploration of friendship and love--and all the invisible lines that come with them.",
