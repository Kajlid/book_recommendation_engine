  "description": "Marjolaine’s imagination in 1700’s France got her into more than enough trouble before she met Durante. He became her whole world, whisking her away to see places she had only dreamed of. Forever with him sounded like a fairytale, but the truth was far less attractive. Now, an old rival is using her human attachments as bait for a coup. All their lives hang in the balance while Marjolaine fights to save the boy who reawakened her heart from her own deadly kiss.",
