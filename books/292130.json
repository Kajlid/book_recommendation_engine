  "description": "Dangerous. Unstable. Obsessive.She believes in fairytales and awaits her prince. But I arrive at her doorstep and I’m far from royalty. The shiver down my back tells me he’s there. As if he were touching me. Cold, angry, aloof—he’s everything I don’t need. But I can’t turn off my attraction when he’s near.My sleeping beauty doesn’t realize just how dangerous I am. She trusts so easily, smiles so beautifully. And while she sleeps, I watch. With each passing night, I become more addicted. Until I’m a man obsessed. I feel his gaze on me, watching while I sleep. He pushes me away in the light, but in the dark, he comes to me like a moth to a flame. I crave it. He doesn’t know just how broken I am.I believed she was the light to my darkness. But it turns out my sleeping beauty likes to dive into the shadows alongside me. She’s mine, but that decision could kill us both.",
