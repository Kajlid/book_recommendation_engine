  "description": "Gordon Force only had two weeks to go on his job. He was going to be working with his brother Dallas in keeping their alpha safe. But he had a favor to fulfill, a shop to visit and only a question or two to ask. He never expected four kids, two goofy aunts and his mate to walk into his life.Alexis Dark was hiding. Her brother-in-law was a real piece of work and she knew he’d killed his wife, her sister. But no one wanted to believe that he had done it. The marks on the body were too consistent with that of an animal not a human they’d told her. Well she knew better.When Gordon went to her house to speak to her again she met him at her door smelling like soap, shampoo and oh so lovely sex.She closed her eyes to the almost purr of his voice. It was hypnotic and the most soothing thing she’d ever heard in her life. When she found herself pressed against him she looked up into his eyes suddenly very afraid and very needy.“Don’t,” she said as he lowered his head to hers. “Please, don’t.”“Too late.” He brushed his mouth over hers once then pulled back to look at her again. “Christ, it’s you.” This time when he took her mouth, it was to devour her.",
