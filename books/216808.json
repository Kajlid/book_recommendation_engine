  "description": "I'M PREGNANT, ON THE RUN, AND WEARING HIS RING...HANNAHHow the hell did I get here?Oh, right - Daniel \"Dust\" Grayson. Scariest, sexiest man alive. The only man who's ever stolen my panties, lured me into his bed, and left me begging for more.This isn't what you're thinking. Yes, he's an outlaw. Trouble incarnate on two towering legs and the hottest smirk south of the Mason-Dixon line. But I'm not in a world of hurt because he's President of the Deadly Pistols MC, or because my big brother is his right hand man - hello, drama!No, Dust tried to save me from myself. I can't let my secrets kill him.It's time to forget everything: his love, his kisses, raising the baby he'll never know together.Never wed an outlaw. A broken heart was my wedding present, and now it's my only defense...DUSTHannah was my biggest mistake. Ain't every day a man claims a girl, shoves his ring on her finger, and tells her she's his 'til the end of time. I had it all, blind to the storm approaching.Then she disappeared. She forgot about us.I'll die before I let her. Darlin', I'm coming.Don't care if my best friend is her kin, and he wants to rip my head off.Don't care if she's a hostage to the meanest crew I ever laid eyes on.Don't care if I have to move heaven, hell, and everything in between to bring her home.If Hannah's a mistake, I'm owning up. Every single inch of her, every kiss, every damned day. She made me crave the whole package, a wife and kids, like a man needs air.I can't stop. I won't go back. She's coming back to my arms, or I'll rip this wicked world limb from limb.",
