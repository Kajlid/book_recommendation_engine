  "description": "He lost everything. Then he found her.\n   Anthony  After losing everything that has ever mattered to me, I find myself in a downward spiral with no hope in sight. I'm broken. Battered. And more bitter than I'd like to admit. Then I meet Sway Swenson. She's sexy, fun, spontaneous, has zero inhibitions, and thinks relationships are a waste of time. Just like me. The only problem? She's hiding something, and the longer I hang around her, the more I want to uncover her secret. If only she'd let me.  Sway I don't do relationships. A crippling experience in high school was enough to make me avoid them like the plague. Then I meet Anthony Wright. Everything is fine until he decides to take off his stupid shirt and gives me a glimpse of his washboard abs. When he suggests hot and sweaty sex with no strings attached, I'm stupid enough to jump in with both feet. Yup. I fall for his ludicrous idea, but I refuse to fall for the man himself. Even if he  does  make me curious about what life could be like if I wasn't broken.  *Anthony is a standalone in the Signature Sweethearts series and is a heartfelt second chance contemporary romance with an unlovable hero who decides relationships arenâ€™t for him and an accepting heroine who proves him wrong .*  ****Can be read as a standalone.****",
