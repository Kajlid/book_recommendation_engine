  "title": "Honey Paw and Lightfoot",
  "description": "Following the success of their first book, The Eyes of Gray Wolf, this bestselling author/artist combination has teamed up again to create a compelling story about the endangered grizzly bear. Readers will be entranced by the simple, poetic text, which follows Lightfoot from newborn bear, no bigger than a hamster, to curious cub to adolescent bear, ready to head off on his own. The spectacular illustrations by one of Alaska's premier wildlife artists magnificently portray the intelligence and strength of the grizzly bear. And for readers who want to learn more, there is an afterword providing detailed information at the back of the book.",
