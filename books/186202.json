  "description": "Lewis Carroll's novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (first published in 1865 and 1871, respectively) have entertrained readers young and old for more than a century. Their magical worlds, amusing characters, clever dialogue, and playfully logical illogic epitomize the whit and whimsy of Carroll's writing. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland transports you down the rabbit-hole into a wondrous realm that is home to a White Rabbit, a March Hare, a Mad Hatter, a tea-drinking Dormouse, a grinning Cheshire-Cat, the Queen of Hearts and her playing card retainers, and all manner of marvelous creatures. Through the Looking-Glass is your passport to a topsy-turvy world on the other side of the mirror, where you have to run fast just to stay in place, memory works backwards, and it is possible to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast. Both stories feature the classic illustrations of John Tenniel in full color.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass is one of Barnes & Noble's leatherbound classics for children. It features classic illustrations, an elegant bonded leather binding, a satin-ribbon bookmark, and distinctive gilt edging. It will provide hours of enjoyment for readers of all ages.",
