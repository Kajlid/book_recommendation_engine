Her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend, Camila, finds out she's pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting novel, written as if it were the oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. In Daisy Jones & The Six, Taylor Jenkins Reid brilliantly captures an unforgettable place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.",
