  "description": "Jon Cooper used to think he wanted a life free of complications, but that was before he got involved with his roommate, Leander. Jon knows that the only thing he can't lose is what he doesn't have, but where does that leave him?Leander Thorne, on the other hand, is an easygoing bookworm, with an addiction to books and cooking shows, and a soft spot for Jon, despite Jon's grumpiness. He also happens to be a psychic specializing in finding lost pets and—more recently—lost people. He's good at it. Too good if you ask Jon, Unsolved crimes, missing people and bodies buried in the Mojave Desert make Jon's and Leander's lives anything but uncomplicated. Jon is forced to dig into his soul and find a way to let go of his past if he wants to keep Leander.",
