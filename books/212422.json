  "title": "Bad Habits: A Love Story",
  "description": "Twenty-five-year-old graphic artist Cristy Road embarks on an uncensored and largely autobiographical tour of an underground world, one full of wild characters and personal revolutions. In her circle, drugs are cheap, ubiquitous, and sometimes feel like the only way out, and Roadâ€™s street psychopharmacology results in experiences that are both revelatory and tragic. Writing in a tradition of some of the finest transgressive authors, such as Jean Genet, William S. Burroughs, and Kathy Acker, Road depicts the damaged soul and psyche of her young protagonist with language as violent as the street and sex as raw as the language. Somewhere along this hyperreal tour, our heroine learns to leave her bad habits behind and emerge stronger and more independent, clean and open to love.",
