  "description": "I didn't ask Chase to take me in when my life fell apart. Turns out my BFF has some kind of sick white-knight complex I can't wrap my head around. He told me I could stay with him under one condition: Absolutely no drugs or booze. What a killjoy, right? Despite his bad-boy exterior, Chase has always been my safe haven. The tattooed antidote to my life of crazy. Moving in with him seemed like a great idea but I never expected to start thinking about him the way I have been. Fantasizing. Lusting. Wondering. Until a moment of weakness lands him in my bed. One night of toe-curling, back-bowing passion I'll never forget. And I've tried. It's impossible. Chase didn't fight like hell to get clean and sober just to toss it away on a hot mess like me. I'm a lost cause. Yet, it's a reckless risk he seems willing to take... even if my salvation means his ruin. From USA Today bestselling author, Jane Anthony, comes a stunning, standalone masterpiece about addiction, recovery, and reckless, ugly, never-ending love. **this story is now a full-length standalone",
