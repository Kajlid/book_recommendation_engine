  "description": "Like a cougar on the hunt, Tribal Officer Luca Nakai was one with the wild—steady, steely and fierce. Nothing like the cops Detective Valerie Jonas was used to. He didn't carry the usual accessories, but he was a more formidable force than she'd ever seen. Not to mention gorgeous.They were on the trail of a dangerous skinwalker who'd killed twice before and was pursuing another victim. Luca's Navajo ways were invaluable to the investigation and casting a spell over the no-nonsense Valerie, who'd never believed anything but hard facts. So how could the mystery and magic of this quiet man single-handedly be cracking her protective shield right along with the case?",
