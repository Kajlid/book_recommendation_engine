  "description": "***Offensive/Explicit Language-sexual situations. 18+ Weezie & Keenan's story (Characters from Reviving Haven) Can be read as a stand-alone. For the FULL experience PLEASE read Reviving Haven first! We all have to be superior at one thing. Well, fellatio is my thing-my forte. If they gave out awards for puff chores, I'd win the Nobel. The truth is I love being down on my knees because I know I have the power to bring you to yours. In that moment, I own you and you'll do anything for that pleasure. Then my fantasy came true, and I got a chance to meet him. Keenan Stone. Gorgeous, rich, famous, and young. It is supposed to be a single night of debauchery. But he is a gentleman. He has morals. He has feelings. Three things I abhor in men I want to blow. Ever been refused in a British accent? For the first time in my life, I am brought to my knees. And it isn't for a BJ!",
