  "description": "I'm Antsy Bonano. But you probably already know that - and unless you got, like, memory issues, you'll remember the kid named the Schwa, who I told you about last time. Well, now, there's this other kid, and his story is a whole lot stranger, if such a thing is possible. See, it all started when Gunnar Umlaut and I were watching three airborne bozos struggle with a runaway parade balloon. That's when Gunnar tells me he's only got six months to live. I'm not sure why, maybe because he said he was living on borrowed time, maybe I just wanted to do something meaningful for him; but right then, I decided to give him one month of my life... ... and that's when things began to get seriously weird.",
