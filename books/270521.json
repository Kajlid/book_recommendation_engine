The book was written just after he had returned to Chile after many wanderings and moved to his beloved Isla Negra on the Pacific coast. The collection celebrates this coming to rest, this rediscovery of the sea and the land, and the evolution of a a lyric poetry that is decidedly more personal than Neruda's earlier work. Written in what he called his \"autumnal\" period, the sixty-eight poems range from the wistful to the exultant, combining psalm and speculation, meditation and humorous aside.",
