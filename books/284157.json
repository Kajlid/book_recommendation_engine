  "description": "Amidst the myths and folklore of Tavistock, one tale strikes fear into the hearts of the townspeople above all others: the murders on the Abbot’s Way.One cold winter, many years ago, a young acolyte eager for distraction led a group of fellow novices into stealing their abbot’s wine. Crippled with guilt and fear of discovery, the acolyte committed murder to hide his sins. Legend has it that the devil himself appeared for the acolyte’s soul, and tricked the novices into their deaths upon the Devon moors.In Autumn 1322, it appears that history is repeating, with Abbot Robert discovering an empty wine barrel, and a body found upon the moors. It soon becomes clear that the wine isn’t the only thing missing from the abbey, and the body on the moor isn’t the last. When Baldwin and Simon investigate, they begin to question whether the legends of the past hold the key to the present turmoil.",
