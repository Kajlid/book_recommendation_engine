  "description": "The moment Addison finds a nearly dusted vampire in the garbage outside her building, her screwed up life becomes a lot more dangerous.  She should be safe with him chained to her bed until she decides what to do with him. But if she’d known he's Rhyse — the vampire king and leader of the supernatural world — what she should do is leave him in the garbage until the sun comes up.  In his three-hundred year reign, Rhyse has never needed help, especially from someone as useless as a human. But weakened from his wound and unaware of who tried to kill him, he’ll need more from his captor than just her blood.  He discovers that Addison is capable of more than anyone knew, including her. Within Addison lies enough power to bring down their entire world. That’s when both of their lives become a lot more dangerous.  Two opposites brought together by accident.  Two enemies need each other to survive.  Two people share a love not destined to be.",
