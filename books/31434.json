Seducing the reluctant warrior is harder than she expected, especially when her body turns traitor and melts at his touch. When he flips the situation around and takes her prisoner, he doesn’t just steal her body. He also takes her heart. And she might just have to kill him to get it back.Being the scourge of the galaxy comes with consequences, like women wanting his body, but Jaro’s never had someone kidnap him for his seed. Fighting the female’s allure, the captive becomes the captor, and he learns that not all battles are fought using fists and knives. Although, the sword between his legs gives her its best shot.Through the vastness of space, brothels and unmentionable places in between, can this stubborn pair overlook their pride and past to come together? Or will they forever abduct and pleasurably torture each other?",
