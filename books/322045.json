  "description": "Sometimes, it takes a corset and an island getaway to bounce back from a disastrous breakup.In the winter chill of New York City, Cozette Fay attempts to turn up the heat with a fun and sexy Ms. Claus roleplay. Unfortunately, her aloof boyfriend is more confused than aroused.She says fa-la-la to her fizzled relationship and escapes to the tropics for Christmas where she meets Nico, a van-driving beach-hunk who secretly owns the hotel on private Simona Island. He upgrades her room, takes her on adventures, and can't seem to keep his eyes or his hands off of her despite claiming there's a non-fraternization policy.It shouldn't matter that Nico won't share anything about himself outside of their tropical snow globe—she's there to reunite with herself, after all—but the closer they get, the more it seems he may be the Santa to her Mrs. Claus all year round.Readers who enjoy Christmas with You from Tracy Alverez or The One Night Stand Before Christmas from Jana Aston would enjoy Holiday Hotel.",
