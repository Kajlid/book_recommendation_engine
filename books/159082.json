  "description": "In writing about her life and times, Ashoka Gupta characteristically stresses on what she witnessed rather than on herself. These were decades, as she says, ‘of new beginnings and new learning . . . amidst a constantly expanding stream of relationships that made up my personal life. These were also nine decades of turbulent change in the life of a nation-in-the making eager to find its place in the sun.’ Thus she knits her personal and public life together, relating how her life as a private individual became inexorably linked to voluntary social work. Of particular interest is her help to coordinate relief during the man-made, cataclysmic Bengal Famine In Bankura in 1943. In 1946, she plunged into relief work after the Noakhali communal carnage in 1946, at Gandhiji’s behest. She tells us of the many women pioneers she met through her work, ending the book with her forthright reflections on the status of women and the nature of social work today.",
