  "description": "Come and Get Me Reese Gabriel Ten years ago, college freshman Eleesha Greene played a sorority game called \"Come and Get Me.\" She was chosen for a night of seduction at the hands of Ross Maclean, the gorgeous quarterback of the college football team. The sex was supposed to be no strings attached, but that night young Eleesha gave more than her body. She gave her heart to the handsome athlete. Ross, his eyes set on the NFL, was not ready for a relationship. He left her the next morning and never looked back. The heartbreak of their parting left Eleesha with nothing but bitter memories of their time together. A decade later she is a vice president of a large communications company that is about to be restructured. A hired consultant is called in to recommend staff cuts. When he turns out to be none other than Ross Maclean, Eleesha goes into a tailspin. A sexual sparring match ensues, fueled by increasing passion. Ross made the biggest mistake of his life ten years ago. To fix it, he is going to play \"Come and Get Me\" again. And this time he has no intention of letting Eleesha go.",
