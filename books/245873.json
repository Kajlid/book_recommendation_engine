  "title": "The Doctored Man, and Other Stories",
  "description": "Often hailed as the best French science fiction writer of the early 20th century, Maurice Renard coined the term \"Scientific Marvel Fiction\" to pen a series of gripping, ground-breaking stories that owe as much to Edgar Allan Poe as they do to H.-G. Wells. Until now, Renard was best known to the English-speaking public for his thrice-filmed thriller, The Hands of Orlac. The Doctored Man, a collection of 14 stories written between 1913 and 1939, features a man blinded during WWI who, through the grafting of \"electroscopic\" eyes, can see into other dimensions, the classic The Man Who Wanted To Be Invisible in which Renard exposes the scientific fallacy inherent in Wells' famous novel, as well as other ground-breaking tales of time-travel, prehistoric wing-men, intangibility, robotic cars and interplanetary travel This is the fourth in a series of five volumes, translated and annotated by Brian Stableford, devoted to presenting the classic works of this pioneering giant of French science fiction.",
