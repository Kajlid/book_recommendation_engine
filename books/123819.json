  "description": "Winner of the Prix Femina, one of France’s most prestigious literary prizes, and a finalist for the Prix Goncourt, Nancy Huston’s Fault Lines is a brilliant, affecting novel about the deep secret lying behind one family’s origins.A best seller in France, with over 400,000 copies sold, and currently being translated into eighteen languages, Fault Lines is the new novel from internationally-acclaimed and best-selling author Nancy Huston, a Canadian-born writer who has lived in France for twenty-five years. Huston’s novel is a profound and poetic story that traces four generations of a single family from present-day California to WW II-era Germany.Fault Lines begins with Sol, a gifted, terrifying child whose mother believes he is destined for greatness partly because he has a birthmark like his dad, his grandmother, and his great-grandmother. When Sol’s family makes an unexpected trip to Germany, secrets begin to emerge about their history during World War II. It seems birthmarks are not all that’s been passed down through the bloodlines.Closely observed, lyrically told, and epic in scope, Fault Lines is a touching, fearless, and unusual novel about four generations of children and their parents. The story moves from the West Coast of the United States to the East, from Haifa to Toronto to Munich, as secrets unwind back through time until a devastating truth about the family’s origins is reached. In her award-winning, bestselling novel, Nancy Huston tells a riveting, vigorous tale in which love, music, and faith rage against the shape of evil.",
