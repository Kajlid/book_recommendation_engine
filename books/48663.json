  "description": "Outside of Space is a science-fiction / fantasy novel which encompasses the best of both genres. Set in the far future, it describes the reuniting of the high-technology and magic-using cultures, viewed from the perspectives of a small group of members from each. There are some darker elements in this work as well as some technical details about both the science and magic, all of which make this appealing to a wide range of readers.People have grown to believe only in virtual reality about the vast human-occupied space. Theybecome complacent of their existence that they take everything interesting that space travelersdiscovered for granted; more so, they insult, dislike, and sometimes loath, star farers.There are, however, others who continue to explore the space with hope to discover somethingthat would catch the public’s interest and make them realize their ignorance. One of them isCaptain Markus and his crew of a starship, Zaspar’s Pride.Eventually, Zaspar’s Pride discovers a space artifact analogous to the one discovered by anotherspace craft fifteen years ago. Captain Markus sends another shuttlecraft, the Enterprise,commanded by Tobar, to close in on the artifact in an attempt to further their investigation. Notlong after the Enterprise hovers over the artifact’s horizon, the ship is swallowed by a black holeand vanishes, or so it seems for the Enterprise actually enters a new world where an aliencivilization has long existed.",
