  "description": "Fairy Doll has always been at the top of the Christmas tree, brilliant in her white beaded dress and little silver shoes (which Elizabeth is sure were sewn by fairy mice).Elizabeth is the smallest in the family. She is always getting into trouble and her brothers and sisters are forever leaving her out and ordering her around. She's convinced she's useless. Then Great Grandma gives Fairy Doll to Elizabeth - and it isn't even Christmas! From then on Elizabeth keeps hearing a little 'Ting!' which seems to tell her what to do. Suddenly everything starts going right instead of wrong. Could Fairy Doll be magical?",
