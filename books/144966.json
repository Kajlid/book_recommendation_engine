  "description": "When Marshal Lincoln Hawk rode into the lawless town of Dust Creek, his mission was to clean out its trigger-happy outlaws. In a wave of rightful vengeance, Lincoln’s deadly Peacemaker did just that. But some of the outlaws escaped the marshal’s justice.  Years later, when Lincoln rides into Dust Creek again, the town seems to have been abandoned. But it hasn’t. Mason Black and his ruthless outlaw band are waiting for him. From behind every broken window of the tumbledown ghost town, Mason’s guns are aimed at Lincoln’s head.  To see another dawn, Lincoln must face a desperate battle for survival in a world where he can trust nobody and the only law that matters is the law of the gun.",
