  "description": "This edition was previously published under the ASIN B07772MB7H Friends and family may call her \"Pro,\" but she feels like a bumbling novice at, well, everything. Especially relationships.  On most days, Pro feels like she can't get a win. She's all alone in the big city and fighting to keep her business afloat while trying to find love, and none of these things are going her way. But Pro finally catches a break right before she was going to throw in the towel. She takes herself out to bask in her small success, but her celebration gets sacked when she catches her new guy out on the town with another girl! Hurt, upset, and a hot mess, this is when Pro bumps into David.  Kind, considerate, and absolutely massive, David plays for a local professional football team. Nicknamed \"Meat Mountain,\" he's huge everywhere and has rich brown eyes, a chiseled face, and a heart of gold. It looks like Pro is finally going to score and land the man of her dreams.  Will this be one for the win column? Or will Pro need to go back to the playbook and start from scratch?   What's Going ProÂ About?   Pro is a nickname that stuck for little Prudence from Small Town, USA. Yes, she was a superstar as a kid, but as a young adult by herself in the big city, Pro doesn't always feel like she's living up to her nickname. But she's getting there. Today she may be landing a big client, finally getting her rent paid, and getting to make out with one of the hottest, most famous football players, but what will tomorrow have in store?",
