To help make sure he ends up nothing like his dad, Jason is doing all he can to be as different from him as humanly possible. And that means giving up the one thing he loves karate. His plan to be a non-creep is going well until he meets Tinga, a beautiful girl who tells him that she's testing for her blue belt soon. After sputtering that he's about to test for the same rank, Jason realizes he's in deep trouble. Because there's only one person who can get him ready in time . . .",
