  "title": "The Mitchells: Five for Victory",
  "description": "The five Mitchell children are based on the author's own family. In the first of three books about their adventures, Daddy has just gone off to World War II. One of his final words to his daughter Joan is, \"No dogs!\" She would dearly love such a pet, but life is full and so many new friends—pets as well as people—join the Mitchells, she hardly has time to think about dogs. The children form a club to do their part for the war-effort—first and foremost helping Mother, of course. Humorous and tender incidents combine with delightful illustrations to make the Mitchells truly unforgettable.United States, 1940'sRL5Of read-aloud interest ages 8-up",
