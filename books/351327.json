  "description": "When Dr. Lee Porter returns to his old family homestead for some much-needed R&R from the fugue states that have plagued him and ruined his career as a professor of geology, he finds a sick feral man in the barn one cold night, and nurses him back to health. The attraction once Will recovers is mutual, but Will is more feral than Lee thinks.Will loves his new packmate, even if the poor human can’t grasp what being a pack member means. Then, when Will witnesses what really happens during one of Lee’s fugues, he knows it’s much worse than Lee thinks. He’s shifter sick, and must embrace his heritage as a shifter of an unknown type, and learn to live as a Wild Thing. Or he will die… possibly in the jaws of his lover.",
