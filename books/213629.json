  "description": "Book 6 in the Scarred series. James’ inspiring story  His disabilities had never held him back, but the constant pain consumed him and the nightmares never ceased. There was no remedy, no cure, and no hope. He had to live with it or allow it to defeat him, and he wasn’t the type to surrender so easily.  She had always been there, but being Adam’s daughter put Crystal way out of James’ reach. Although the use of her alternative therapies might do something no one had done before, to cure him meant to touch him and he knew that would be a battle too far.  No other man interested her. How could they when his gentleness captivated her and his courage and bravery enraptured her. Crystal wanted no other, but James’ dedication and unexpected responsibilities, together with her new job, distanced them even further.  The tragedy that drew them together demanded more than his unyielding strength could bear. Reaching out to friends might assist him, but far from helping, going back to the Château in France only complicated their lives so much more.  Why now, amid vile accusations and murderous intentions, had he only just noticed her? His head told him to leave it alone, to put his desires aside, but his heart betrayed him. He wanted her with a passion that tested his fierce loyalty and steely control.  He didn’t think he could live with her when he couldn’t have her, let alone exist without her at all.
