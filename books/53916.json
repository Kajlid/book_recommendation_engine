  "description": "There is a special organisation responsible for the wellbeing of all dogs. Its main goal is to make sure that all dogs are provided with a proper home, a nice warm bed and a cat to chase. This organisation is kept secret from every human being and operates, as you are about to see, right under our very noses. In this children's story, the first of Astro’s Adventures series, Astro learns a valuable lesson about being spoilt, about friendship and about loyalty. At first, he appears to be an embarrassment to The Organisation when they find out he’s not been held prisoner but is in fact, very well looked after. However, things turn when Commander Rocky decides to teach Astro a valuable lesson and Astro’s true character shines. In the end it is Commander Rocky who learns something very important about this scruffy dog. All the dogs in Astro’s Adventure are real and they all play and run together regularly. The cats, Nigel, the twin tabbies and Speed Bump Charlie (yes, that’s his real name) are also alive and living, all be it, reluctantly with the Astro’s Adventures gang. This story will appeal to all the family and to anyone who enjoys the company of a dog.",
