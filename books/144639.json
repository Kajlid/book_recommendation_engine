  "description": "\"I still haven’t figured out how to keep / my shower floor clean or make morning / smoothies or respond to stress calmly. / Same, same, same my friends tell me, a love note of sorts.\"The debut collection from beloved Instagram poet @hannahrowrites, Same is a celebration of one thing we all have in a desire to be seen and understood. With her artful blend of intuitive and wise insights, Hannah’s observations resonate with readers across multiple life stages—girlhood, marriage, motherhood and beyond. Centering friendship and connection, her poems are filled with the kind of recognizable, intimate details described by a relatable, honest voice that make readers nod along and instantly want to share with someone they love.In a world that often aims to make women feel smaller, Same offers an unparalleled feeling of visibility and validation, and a reminder that not only are we not alone, but we’re also all in this together.",
