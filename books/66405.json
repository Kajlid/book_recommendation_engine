  "title": "Stow Away",
  "description": "Benjamin Holt is an average thirteen-year-old streetwise kid living in Lower Manhattan during the 1930's. His world is turned upside down, when a simple case of mistaken identity by the cops has him accidently taking refuge in the belly of the tramp steamer U.S.S. Alexandria bound for the wilds of Africa. Along the way, Benjamin must face the challenges of living at sea, a captain's dream of treasure, and a first mate who would just as soon feed him to the sharks. Ben's troubles are only beginning when he is taken hostage by an evil German colonel. He survives a daring escape, only to find himself on a volcanic island battling bloodthirsty natives. Things go from bad to worse as this explosive adventure unfolds around him. Ben must find it in himself to become the most unlikely hero before it is over if he is to make it home again.",
