Or any other world for that matter.Adam doesn't have much of a choice, and since I love him neither do I. Fighting back is what he was created to do. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure he lives through it, and hope I do too.***\"It's just the right balance of sci-fi, sex, action, sex, humor & oh yeah...sex.\"\"Fifty One is a very enjoyable, fun and thought-provoking adventure...\"",
