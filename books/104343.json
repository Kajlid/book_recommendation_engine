  "description": "Terry \"Gadget\" Anders is a young, brilliant scientist, and the inventor of a technomagical helm that grants him psionic powers like telepathy, telekinesis, and the power to conjure force-fields from thin air. So why isn't he happy? He struggles with relationships, and with bipolar disorder — which he was trying to cure when he invented his psionic weapon. He wants more than anything to meet “the right girl,” and he thinks that — with the help of his cosplaying friends Buffy and Angelus — he can find her at that great gathering of geeks, RetCon XVIII.Desirée “Dizzy” Roentgen has it all: She's a maverick mad scientist, a masked vigilante, and a guitarist in an up-and-coming filk-n-roll band. Like Gadget, Dizzy has come to RetCon to spend a relaxing weekend partying with her own geeky kind. She doesn't expect to do battle with her arch-nemesis, the nefarious Dr. Noonian Harkonnen. She also doesn't expect to meet the inventor who might be — just maybe — the nerd of her dreams.And none of them know that they'll be facing-off against a body-snatching alien invasion! Put on your costumes and tune your guitars, folks, because this is gonna be the best RetCon ever!﻿",
