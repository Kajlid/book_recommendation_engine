  "title": "Suffer The Little Ones: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Children",
  "description": "Until recent years, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated most strongly with military personnel. However, psychologists have realized that combat veterans are not the only population that this disorder develops in. As clinicians become more familiar with the disorder, they have begun diagnosing children and adolescents with the disorder. Prevalence of PTSD in children is startlingly high, so the more we learn about the disorder from their eyes, the more accurately we can diagnose and the safer we can treat those that have it.",
