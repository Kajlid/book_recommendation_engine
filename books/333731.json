  "description": "At Boulder Cove Academy, three things are certain:The Lawless Rule.The games are dangerous.Nothing is as it seems. I came here expecting to face my bullies with an iron fist. I played their games and won. Now that I’ve earned my place, at the academy and in their home, I should have nothing to fear. But with every past there is a shadow and mine is drawing closer with each step I take. I thought The Lawless were the ones I should fear, but someone far more vicious is watching. The games should be over, but it seems they’ve only just begun.",
