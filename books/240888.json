  "description": "Cam Watson is no one special. A bakery owner with an uncanny sense of timing, she has no idea why some idiot kids have decided to make her shop the object of harassment. As the problems escalate, she needs to face facts. There's no avoiding the cops any longer. And when she meets Dom, she wouldn't mind spending some time in the back of his squad car. But she has no idea that he is part of a supernatural world that she never knew existed, even though her fate is linked closely with its survival.  Dom Soto is a shifter cop, on a force of all shifter cops. But even wolf shifters need to take on the simple and boring cases. When he gets a whiff of Cam, thoughts of boring go right out the window. He's heard of the One True Mates, the women sired by an angel and destined for other shiften. Never did he think that he'd find one meant for him.  Even though it can't be true, Dom can't stay away from Cam. He'll defy his boss, his friends, and destiny to keep her, but first he needs to keep her safe. And she has secrets of her own that may tear them apart. Can Cam learn to trust a man who turns into a wolf? Or will the clock tick to zero, leaving her out of time?",
