  "description": "ZorroI've been playing with fire my entire life, so messing with two of my club brother's sister was just up my alley. Ruby, the younger half-sister to Grim and Axel.She and I had been flirting for ages, playfully toying with one another. That is, until she went off to one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States-- Stonewall University.She joined a sorority and did things all the nice girls do. But one day she came flying back here. We thought it was because of Grim's motorcycle accident, but it wasn't. She was attacked on campus by a group of men.I was supposed to wait and let one of our own handle it. One who was starting his term at Stonewall in the fall . . . but I couldn't wait. Seeing her in pain ripped me apart, especially after she told me what happened. I knew right then and there she'd be mine. But I needed to do one thing first-- find her attackers and make them suffer in ways they never imagined.",
