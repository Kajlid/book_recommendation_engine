  "title": "Out of the Storm",
  "description": "Red skies of battle rage through the Mennonite colonies as Red and White factions continue to requisition, recruit and advance their positions. Ongoing strife and accompanying drought result in severe famine and disease, and the worst enemy of all--fear. Johann Suderman works with Benjamin Janz to secure permission for Mennonite emigration, but they are faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles at every turn. Meanwhile, Katarina attempts to sustain her family and friends amid chaos and uncertainty, and Paul Gregorovich Tekanin tries to survive in anonymity. The Mennonites of South Russia face a fierce struggle for faith and survival as their dreams are dashed one by one, yet they cling to the hope that God will yet intervene and speak to them as he did to Job, out of the storm.",
