  "description": "The Ordinary Knight and the Invisible Princess is a young adult, full length fairy tale in two parts. In part one: The Tale of the Ordinary Knight It isn’t that Sir Percy isn’t trying. It is simply difficult for a magical negative to advance himself in a kingdom where you are judged on which fairies attended your christening. In Ithelwaite magical powers can make or break a knight’s career, but without them, Percy finds himself assigned to guard the royal kennels: the guard dogs’ guard. His luck, however, swiftly changes when he catches the eye of the sheltered Princess Matilda. Raised in fear of a fairy attack, Matty is eager to break out of her doorless tower and rescue herself, even if it means dragging Percy along for the ride. In part two: The Invisible Princess Born with a disturbing lack of visibility, Princess Elaina of Thale had a childhood filled with quacks and charlatans, all promising to reverse the curse. When her parents determine that the answer to reversing her invisibility lies in matching her up with a perfect prince, Elaina decides she has finally had enough. She will drive off any suitor who dares to approach her. Nothing, however, has prepared her for the suspiciously ambitious Prince Randolf or for the charming stablehand, Jeff, who wins her friendship. Before she realizes what is happening, Elaina is swept into an adventure with her father’s crown and her very existence at stake. (from Amazon.com)",
