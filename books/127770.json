  "description": "Having been sent back in time to be killed, Soren resolves on retrieving Kai. However, to stabilise the realm and keep Bran at bay in their absence, the most appropriate guardian is also the most unsympathetic. Soren's company breach the past, but are accidentally bonded to the rebellious Tiger-Tail Cause. Constant imperial assaults are the least of their concerns, as the Raven God’s ultimate ambition, to deprive them of The Source’s power, costs those who are a product of it dearly. And whilst trying to defend innocents, they struggle to preserve history. Their most difficult trial comes when allies, critical to both the past and future, are captured by an unforeseen enemy and condemned to death. Back in the present, former enemies make dangerous friends and many doubt Ay’s new guardian is capable of overcoming his penchant for mischief. He also exposes a weakness, one the Raven God intends to exploit, to conquer Ay once and for all.Website: https://sites.google.com/site/destiny...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDestin...Twitter: @acorok and @destinyofdragon",
