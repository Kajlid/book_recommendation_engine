  "title": "The Frog Prince",
  "description": "The youngest daughter of the king lives a very special life, indeed. Her days are spent in lovely gowns, playing happily with her favorite golden ball. When her beloved ball is lost, she strikes a bargain for its return with a thick, green frog—a deal she doesn’t intend to keep! But the ugly frog, refusing to be left behind by the fleeing princess, insists she share her life with him as promised.This Brothers Grimm tale of a spoiled princess finding her handsome prince by breaking a witch’s spell has enchanted readers since it was written in the early 1800s. With enchantingly elegant illustrations, Anne Yvonne Gilbert brings Kathy-jo Wargin’s retelling of the classic to a new generation of readers.",
