  "description": "The story of El Cordobes, the matador who rose to fame in Spain in the early 1960's.Perhaps one of the best biographies I have ever read, this book tells the story of the fabled Spanish bullfighter Manuel Benitez “El Cordobes”! Born in strict poverty, this youngser defied all the odds in becoming perhaps the most famous modern day \"toreador\"!His phenominal rise to fame is truly something out of a novel! El Cordobes, desperate, illiterate, starving had one dream, to become a bullfighter. And the odds were stacked heavily against him. This noble profession certainly had no room for such a peasant! But the heavens were looking out for him and rise he did. With the help of an influential patron, El Cordobes succeeded, and with a fervor almost unparalleled. This is no “dull biography” but a gripping one, complete with all the ingredients of a first-rate novel!",
