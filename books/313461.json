  "description": "The man asked me to valet his damn car.\n Look, I left LA for a reason. I’ve had my fill of big Hollywood stars and their even bigger egos. I want something genuine. Something real. And it doesn’t get any realer than being the new sheriff of Aster Valley, Colorado. That is, until entitled Finn Heller appears on the scene, handing me the keys to his convertible like I’m his personal servant. The former child star and wannabe action hero is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. He’s also a snarky party animal with legions of adoring fans and attitude for days. Or so I thought. The longer the film crew stays in town, the more I begin to wonder if Finn is hiding his true self, one that’s as beautiful inside as out. He’s a star alright, but the kind that shines bright enough to light up the night sky... the kind I want to make a wish on. A wish Finn will find a way to make things work with me, even if it means his next role is my very own leading man.",
