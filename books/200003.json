  "description": "Twenty-four-year-old Nora Cooper wants nothing to do with her family’s money. After watching it tear her parents apart, Nora decides she’d prefer a simple life… until her student loan debt comes knocking and her gas is turned off. Determined not to take a handout Nora accepts a job with a well-to-do fashion designer who is equal parts cruel and domineering. It’s not her dream job, by any means, and soon the pressure starts to wear on her.But when Ian Hart enters the picture her days begin to seem less long and a whole hell of a lot more beautiful. He’s striking, intelligent, and looks at her like no one has before. There’s just one problem. He’s married to her boss. Nora believes some bridges are never meant to be crossed, until Ian tells her a secret that could change everything. Together they must face a point of no return that could emotionally scar them or solidify a love that’s worth the war.",
