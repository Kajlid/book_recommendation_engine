  "title": "Surviving Nikki",
  "description": "Nikki Martin comes from Compton, one of the roughest neighbourhoods in Toronto. She caught a break getting into the U of T, but like everything else, she’s had to bust her ass to stay there, especially when there’s no support from home to help pay for her degree. When her bursary becomes defunct she’s desperate to find work for the summer, even if it means she has to lie on her application to score a job at a resort far from home. Hell, that might be the best part. A summer in the mountains has to be better than bumming around the city. She can figure the whole mountaineering thing out before anyone realizes she’s never so much as climbed a tree—It can’t be as hard as surviving in the inner city.Evan Cade has worked at Stone Cliff Resort as a guide since he was sixteen and loves it to the point where someday he intends to buy the place, or build one just like it. So when a hotshot girl from Toronto is hired on to run one of the survival camps, he decides to take her for a test run and make sure she’s as good as she claims—before some innocent camper pays the price. Out on the mountain he discovers Nikki is nothing like she reads on paper, and while some of that is good, very good, it’s bad news for the camp. It’s either teach her everything he knows, or cancel half the bookings and risk closing the program. He just has to get past his reaction to her and concentrate on the job at hand.Evan has his mind on business but Nikki doesn’t take direction well. Following Evan and trusting him goes against her nature. But this isn’t the city and she needs the job. She can only imagine there is one thing he could want in exchange for the lessons, even if he doesn’t spell it out. Nikki needs this job to survive, but can Evan really imagine surviving Nikki?",
