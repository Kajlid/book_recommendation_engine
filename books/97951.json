  "description": "The characters in Kathleen Wheaton's linked stories are exiles-from their native countries, their families, their objects of desire. Political refugees from Argentina's \"dirty war,\" survivors of a Cuban shipwreck and of Franco's Spain all navigate life as foreigners, whether in Madrid, Buenos Aires or suburban Washington, D.C. With wry, nuanced compassion, Wheaton follows these resilient people as they reconcile the absurdities of contemporary life with a legacy of dislocation, loss and longing.",
