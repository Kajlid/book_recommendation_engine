  "title": "Isabelle the Navigator",
  "description": "In her schoolgirl days, Isabelle Airly mastered the high jump, sailing over the bar, weightless, above it all. She moved like the wind that drove the ships of old, an elusive, invisible force carefully charted by mariners. Now, in her thirties, she's having more trouble staying afloat. Her father, a gentle physician, has taken his own life, and Isabelle is sorting out the facts about his arrest for insurance fraud, his descent into madness - and how much he really knew about what was going on all those years between his wife and his brother. At the same time, she is mourning a loss of her own, and exploring her memories of a childhood that might not have been as idyllic as it seemed. If Isabelle can chart her father's course, maybe she can chart her own. And if she cannot stop the force of the wind - or be that force herself - maybe she can at least hitch a ride on it until she lands safely on solid ground.",
