  "description": "Don’t have a one-night stand in a small town.Not unless you’re real comfortable facing down your bad decisions in the daylight.It’s a lesson Amelie Gable learned the hard way.Which was turning out to be a recurring theme in her life since it was a string of hard lessons that led to her falling into bed with the first blue-eyed cowboy that said, yes ma’am to her.Spending the night with Troy seemed like a great idea at the time. He was charming and handsome and clearly up on his anatomy lessons.Sending him on his way the next morning was harder than it should have been.But it was still easier than finding him shoveling her Grandma Muriel’s front sidewalk, putting a heart-stopping face to the mystery man who’d been helping her grandmother out.Now she has to pretend like he hasn’t seen and touched every inch of her skin.That she doesn’t desperately want him to do it all over again.But staying in Montana was never the plan. She has hopes. Dreams. Aspirations.\nAnd unlike her mother and grandmother, she won’t let a man get in the way of them.",
