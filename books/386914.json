  "description": "Stone Barrington's latest client is no stranger. Arrington Calder isn't just a former lover, this one-time heartthrob may be the mother of Stone's son.Arrington has been recently widowed by her actor husband leaving her as the custodian of a fortune in Hollywood studio stock. Intent on cashing in, his pretty ex asks Stone to handle the dull paperwork involved in the deal. There is nothing dull, however, about what Barrington encounters when he arrives in Bel-Air.It's a sexy action thriller from the author of 'Strategic Moves' and 'Lucid Intervals.'Librarian's note: the author dedicates this volume to Elaine Kaufman (1929-2010) who, as he states, \"loved writers.\" There's a nice photo of Stuart Woods and Elaine inside the front cover. Many scenes in previous entries of the Stone Barrington series take place at her restaurant in New York City, Elaine's.
