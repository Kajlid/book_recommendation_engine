Also in the volume are \"The Land of Sad Oranges\" (1958), \"'If You Were a Horse...'\" (1961), \"A Hand in the Grave\" (1962), \"The Falcon\" (1961), \"Letter from Gaza\" (1956), and an excerpt from Umm Saad (1969).

His novels, short stories, and plays have been published in sixteen languages. He was assassinated in a car-bomb explosion in Beirut in 1972.",
