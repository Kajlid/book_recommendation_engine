  "description": "September 2001: The Sun, a Boca Raton tabloid, receives a love letter addressed to Jennifer Lopez. The newspaper's photo retoucher opens it - and unknowingly inhales thousands of toxic spores. By October 5, he's dead.October 2001: NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw's assistant tests positive for cutaneous anthrax, a result of exposure to a powder in an envelope she inhaled weeks before.October 2001: A tainted letter is delivered to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle in Washington. Four postal workers are infected with inhalation anthrax. Two of them die.In the days that followed, twenty-eight more people tested positive for anthrax, plunging U.S. postal workers - and an entire country - into the front lines of an insidious bioterror. In the midst of a nationwide panic, Cipro antibiotic was stockpiled, Hazmat teams trained, and irradiation machinery utilized for targeted areas. As the chilling evidence mounted, the F.B.I. suspected that this was not the a worldwide terrorist plot, but rather the work of one disturbed man - possibly even an American biodefense researcher.Based in part on information from the F.B.I.'s Amerithrax task force, as well as the author's independent research, and with official photos and transcripts of the anthrax letters, this is the most comprehensive work to date about the plague of terror that arose in the wake of 9/11 - and the relentless scientific manhunt to stop it.",
