  "description": "Everyone has a motive, and no one is telling the truth in this complex mystery of deception and betrayalWhen an eminent art historian is found dead in his study, all the evidence points to his son, Stephen. He was the last person seen with his father, his fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and he was about to be disinherited in his father's will. Stephen's guilt seems undeniable. But as Inspector Trave of the Oxford Police uncovers the stories of the five other people who were also in the house―along with the revelation that the deceased man was involved in a deadly hunt for a priceless relic at the end of World War II―he feels the case begin to unravel. As Stephen's trial unfolds at the Old Bailey, Trave travels to France to find out what really happened in 1944, and the race is on to save Stephen from the gallows.Author Simon Tolkien received widespread critical praise for his first legal thriller, Final Witness . Now, in The Inheritance, Tolkien sharpens his craft even more, deftly weaving psychological suspense and family drama to create a mystery steeped in memories, betrayal, and the long shadow of the past. Part courtroom drama and part historical thriller, The Inheritance is a dark, dynamic mystery that tests the strength of blood ties, loyalty, and the thirst for revenge.",
