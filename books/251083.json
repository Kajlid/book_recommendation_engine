  "description": "When Ralph Linderman returns a stranger's wallet he found during a morning stroll through Greenwich Village, he is entirely unprepared for the complex maze of sexual obsession and disturbing psychological intrigue he is about to be drawn into. Patricia Highsmith, author of 'The Tremor of Forgery', 'Strangers on a Train', and 'The Cry of the Owl' has once again created an unsettling thriller that explores the bleakest alleyways of human desire. Highsmith has been called \"one of the finest crime novelists\" by the New York Times and is now considered one of the most original voices in twentieth-century American fiction.",
