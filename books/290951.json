  "description": "On Aerthe freedom is a lie.  Wrenched from their beds and into another world, three earth women and one man find themselves in an alien, violence-infested land.  Powered by old tech and carrying the captive humans, the immense landships of the Mekkers grind on track and wheel across the countryside. Fern, Gio, and Emery are property and must learn to kneel and beg, open their legs, and to stifle their shame. Pleasure will be their reward.  Even if fated to fall in love, these women fight to the last.  Their weapons may be guns or words, or bots from the tiniest in size to giant war machines, though sometimes running away works best. Only Sawyer, ex-soldier, will never bow, for being the master beckons to him and drums through his blood.  With everyone at war with everyone else, the planet seems ready to implode. Can humans be the healing catalyst?  The journey to peace on Aerthe will be paved with the dead, as well as the screams of women climaxing in the hands, ropes, and chains of their masters. ALL FIVE BOOKS IN THE SERIES IN ONE BOXSET. 350,000 words from NY Times and USA Today bestselling author Cari Silverwood. Featuring Acquired Possession, Claimed Possession, Branded Possession, Exquisite Possession, and the novella, Fated Possession.",
