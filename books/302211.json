  "description": "A Quick Snap Novella. Running Forward is part of Kristen Proby's With Me in Seattle Universe. Nothing annoys Karli Jensen more than her nerdy, condescending neighbor. He smirks at her short skirts, mocks her food delivery choices, and steals her mail. Okay, maybe the pizza coupons had part of the townhouse number cut off and got delivered to him by mistake, but they both know he never orders pizza. It’s infuriating, and so is he. Luckily, she only has to see him at home...until he shows up on the football field she calls her second home.Alec Flynn gave up his shot at an NFL career when his family needed him, choosing to use his brain instead of his braun to succeed in life. He built a tech empire, but then he got bored, and gave it all up. Going to the combine and getting picked up by his friend's team is a dream come true, until it’s not. Turns out the ridiculous neighbor he loves to spar with is not just a ditzy junk foodaholic. Oh no, she’s also his Assistant Coach. Sparks fly on and off the field as these two continue to butt heads, and eventually, hearts. But, giving in to their desires could mean the end of at least one of their careers. Is the risk worth the reward, or will winning the game cause them to lose at love?",
