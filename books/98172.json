  "description": "An apocalypse threatens human kind. A lethal virus is detected that attacks mankind and mammals. The Government must act, and whilst the authorities struggle to find a cure, they have to plan for the worst. As the disease spreads it is not clear how many will, or will not, survive, nor what the survivors will have to do to live. They will have to cope with their grief and loneliness before they can attempt to rebuild society. They will need to find water, food, shelter, and power and then face the other threats to their survival. If they survive, there may be hope for human kind. If they surviveâ€¦This is not horror genre and there are no zombies, and no asteroids, so if you prefer these types of post apocalyptic scenarios, look elsewhere. This is a story about surviving.WARNING The book contains violence, death and some sexual scenes that some readers may find disturbing.",
