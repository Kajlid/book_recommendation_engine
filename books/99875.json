  "description": "\"The night sky is black, shrouded with a fog of soot and toxins. The gears of China's industrial revolution turn, unceasing, manufacturing the wants of an entire world. The consequences soar upwards until the lights of the heavens have dimmed and vanished altogetherâ€¦But there will be stars this night.The Knites have made it their mission bring the stars back to the night in China, hanging from the tails of kites. Some call it foolishness; others will find hope in the Knites' work. Hope that someday the shroud will lift, and people will see beyond the towering monoliths of industry and gaze upon the true stars once more.\"",
