  "description": "Do you believe in the legend of True Springs? \nWith a building to fight over, a goal she won’t budge on, and a need he can’t deny, it will take more than a little True Springs magic… Kalpani has one goal: own the most popular salon in Pittsburgh. She has no room in the workplace for a tenant, let alone a life partner, no matter how attractive and wonderful Jonah seems now. She’s seen the disastrous effects of marriage on too many women of her culture—and that’s a hard no. It’s just bad luck that the tenant she has to kick out of her new building is none other than floundering artist (and ex-flame) Jonah Walker. She can’t allow guilt—or desire—to derail her plans. But Jonah is far more than the laid-back creative type he seems. Even as he fights for his livelihood, he’s determined to prove to Kalpani that he’s worthy of her love and key to her dreams.This is a multi-cultural, opposites-attract, love story centered around family. New beginnings make second chances and forgiveness a necessity!
