  "title": "Travels with Herodotus",
  "description": "Ryszard Kapuściński was the greatest traveller-reporter of our time. Travels with Herodotus depicts his beginnings as an inexperienced young Polish journalist and reveals what drove him throughout his extraordinary life. At every encounter with a new culture - whether Indian, Chinese or African - he plunges in, curious and observant, thirsting to understand its history and its people. Everywhere and always, he has with him his travelling companion, The Histories by Herodotus. Here in his final book the thoughts of Kapuściński and Herodotus, though separated by twenty-five centuries, are intertwined to produce a unique work of reportage and insight.",
