Returning damaged yet stronger—and more determined than ever to prove himself—he was the last pick in the draft. Mr. Irrelevant, they called him.

Now he’s going to prove it.Estelle Harris is engaged to a man she doesn’t love, working in the wrong job, and fooling everyone including herself in the process. Her love of animals is the only thing that gives her purpose. As she shares that love with the Lumberjacks’ reclusive quarterback, and much, much more, it’s only a matter of time until their friendship turns that final, hot, dark and forbidden corner. There’ll be no going back. True love is like football. It’s not always how long you have the ball. It’s what you do when you get it.",
