  "description": "Fiction. Asian Studies. This sometimes disturbing, always illuminating collection of stories centers around China's Cultural Revolution and its aftermath, which, as we learn, continues even today, with both sides still hold out, and with \"apologies forthcoming.\" Xujun Eberlein lived in China during that tumultuous period and now makes her home in America. \"Xujun Eberlein is a fresh voice in American fiction, a Chinese writer with a remarkably shrewd, interesting tongue....There is a richness in her vision that sets it apart\" -- Jay Parini. \"The stories have a subtly addictive momentum\" -- Sven Birkerts.",
