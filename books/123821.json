  "description": "This should be Captain Abram Adoyo's finest hour, as he brokers a treaty with the gentle Khuzoid people of Iarus V. But while the Khuzoid are a peaceful species, they demand that Abe perform an important rite for them as part of their negotiating process. The captain never expected his first officer, Mattys Kriel, to be involved in such an intimate act â€” but he will do anything to complete their mission. No matter how hard it gets. This steamy, aliens-made-them, sassy, outer space M/M romance story originally featured in the anthology Binary Constellations #1 - A Queer Sci Fi Romance Anthology. It has been extended to 6,600 words long with an extra spicy scene at the end.",
