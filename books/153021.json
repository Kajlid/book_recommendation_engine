  "title": "Ten Degrees of Reckoning",
  "description": "This is the true story of a family who fulfilled their lifelong dream, only to have it evolve into everyone's worst nightmare. It takes courage, commitment, passion, and patience to embrace life fully. The Sleavin family, two adults and their two children, possessed those qualities, and realized their dream to sail around the world in their 47-foot boat, the Melinda Lee. They experienced indescribable beauty, rewarding challenges, deep and meaningful encounters, and a wholly shared understanding of the world and of one another during their meticulously planned and crafted out-of-the ordinary family adventure. The author, a veteran sailor herself, uses her personal experience to take the reader on an ocean voyage, and shares the Sleavins' travels while she provides a backdrop of intriguing facts and information. Three years into the circumnavigation, not far from the shores of New Zealand, a ship, thousands of tons of steel, loaded with thousands of tons of timber, altered its course by a mere ten degrees, and everything changed. Every, single, thing. Based upon exclusive interviews with the survivor and other significant individuals, the author takes both an investigational and philosophical approach in order to depict the mystery of the tragedy and its aftermath. This is not a book about sailing, although life at sea is re-created with insight and familiarity. This is a universal tale about love and loss, humanity and inhumanity. This is a story that compels the reader to question and examine one's own behavior when circumstances alter the way we live. This is a story about facing our fears and striving to embrace life, every day.",
