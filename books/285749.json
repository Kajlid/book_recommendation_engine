  "description": "The rulers of the Parvac Empire, Laconian Sector, and Galaxic Expanse have decided to cooperate in a clandestine endeavor to expose the villain behind a nefarious plot designed to instigate a war which would threaten their fragile peace.  Appointed by Emperor Probus as his proxy in matters of interstellar security, Princess Teagan Probus is investigating the disappearance of Katherine Dylan, one of only two known survivors of the Asylum, a merchant ship involved in the testing of a devastatingly powerful alien weapon and the key to a terrifying plot.  The Inquisitors have three unreliable key witnesses in custody, the Mad Ones, the first Laconian hybrids to be successfully created by Dr. Stanley Crispus. They were instrumental to Stig’s suspected plans but were manipulated and used against him. However, should they again attempt to question the criminally insane telepaths, it could have irrevocable consequences, not only for the Imperial family but also for the universe.  Teagan and her team believe Edvard Stig, a sadistic wealthy male with a secret agenda, is behind the escalating criminal activity. Although unproven, they believe Stig is using pirate mercenaries as his own private army, that he ordered the attack on Inquisitor Gordian’s warship, and imprisoned a mysterious telepathic alien lifeform forcing it to manufacture weapons of an advanced technology. Now, they need to learn why Stig is so intent on inciting Galaxic war, what he hopes to gain by doing so, and stop him before it’s too late.",
