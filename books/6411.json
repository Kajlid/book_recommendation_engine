  "description": "Too much of a good thing...With her long ponytail and sparkling green eyes, Tessa Donovan looks more like the girl next door than a businesswoman - or a heartbreaker. Which may explain why Detective Luke Asher barely notices her when he arrives to investigate a break-in at her family's brewery. He's got his own problems - starting with the fact that his partner, Simone, is pregnant and everyone thinks he's the father. Tessa has her hands full, too. Her brother's playboy ways may be threatening the business, and the tension could tear her tight-knit family apart. In fact, the only thing that could unite the Donovan boys is seeing a man come after their \"baby\" sister. Especially a man like Luke Asher. But Tessa sees past the rumors to the man beneath. He's not who people think he is - and neither is she.",
