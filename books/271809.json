Women capable of flying, at the controls of an aircraft, but also handling a camera. Women who make others fly, with their voice and their songs. Women with their fragility, their limits, but also facing the many limitations imposed by conventions, rules, laws.The petit Bessie Coleman, who will become the first African American female pilot, stands above all. How much tenacity, how much unbeatable optimism, how much courage she showed in achieving such a goal!The courage of women.",
