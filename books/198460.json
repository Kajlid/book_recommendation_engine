As the Alpha of New York, Trey placed the needs of his pack above everything-until the mate he's waited centuries for waltzed into his life and gave him a taste of what he'd been missing. Sadie, seductive, beautiful and utterly captivating, is also something shifters avoid at all costs-a vampire. Stunned to learn of her nature, Trey turned his back on the only woman who could complete him. Now, realizing he's thrown away the one thing he can't live without, Trey hunts Sadie down and defies tradition. Their sexual hunger is undeniable, with each sizzling encounter bringing them closer together. Sadie tries to resist but he refuses to allow it, using desire and her need for his blood to keep her close. With danger closing in, it's necessary to announce his mating before the pack. To keep his female, he's willing to lose everything he's ever known.",
