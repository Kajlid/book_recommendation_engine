  "title": "Chicken Every Sunday: My Life with Mother's Boarders",
  "description": "One of the boarders who ate Mother's chicken every Sunday summed it up when he said, \"I was told that in your house I'd have good food and some fun.\" They all had fun, and they all became part of the family -- Jeffrey, who lost his front teeth and won his independence, Rita Vlasak, who loved anything in pants, including Father, Miss Sally, who loved Miss Sally and cold cream, the Lathams, who bought a mine, and even the hell-bent-for-heaven Woolleys, who were sure God had sent the skunk to hide under the house because the family didn't go to church on Sunday. If you have room for some fun and old-fashioned enjoyment, Mother's sure to have room for you.",
