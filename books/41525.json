  "description": "The world she knows has come to an end… When the Black Carriage kidnaps Wilona Bumbridge from the streets of Victorian London, her life immediately appears to improve. She is taken to a place with other children and given a bed of her own and food at every meal, things she’d never been able to count on before. But when it soon becomes apparent that their captor is not as human as he seems, and that even the beds and food disguise his nefarious plans for the children, Wilona realizes that escape is their only hope for survival. From London to the English countryside to a spaceship with a view among the stars, her perilous journey has merely begun. With nothing more than the advice of a little redheaded girl who hides secrets of her own, Wilona and the other children must fight together to defeat a monster whose evil extends across the universe.",
