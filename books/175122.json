  "title": "Make Anything Whole",
  "description": "Brendan Walshâ€™s Make Anything Whole is crafted from the best facets of both travel writing and the poetry of place. Among these pages, readers find the estranged familiarity of coming back to one's home and country after traveling abroad. Taking us on the road as he experiences Laos, Korea, and then re-experiences the United States, Walsh chronicles the characters he meets along the way and ultimately discovers that you can take home with you wherever you go. His life-affirming experiences are set against a backdrop of interactions told through the sociological poetic eye.",
