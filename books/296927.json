And no one reminds me of that more than my brother's best friend.  He’s the walking, talking opposite of my comfort zone, and he sees through my false bravado. Senses my insecurities. I think that's why I feel so vulnerable when he's around. So…under-clothed.  Which is ridiculous. He doesn’t even know me.  Still, every bone in my body senses danger when he’s around. Like he’s always about to push me under a spotlight I'm not ready to squint into, a spotlight that would expose me for the awkward introvert that I am.  Yet he never says more than two words to me. As if he knows that’s the surest way to drive me crazy.  And I hate him for it. Always have.  Always will.
