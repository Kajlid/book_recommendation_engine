  "description": "Use It Or Lose It  You need to be healthy to have good sex—but frequent sex can also make you healthy. If you have a partner who is open enough to let you that your sex life needs help then you should be glade, most couples don’t and in turn destroys your relationship. Sex shouldn’t feel like a house chore like most marriages today, nor does it have to be one-sided. No! No matter how much you and your partner enjoy the old favorites, you might want to have some fun now and then and experiment with something totally new. It’s true that there is only a handful of core positions, but each of these has almost infinite variations. Use It Or Lose It is designed to help you increase blood flow to vital sexual organs through light, healthy exercise and eating. The less you use your sexual muscles the weaker they get thus “Use It Or Lose It”. Your sexual relationship may be used to the common man-on-top, woman-on-top and rear-entry. Being petty with variations may cost your relationship worse without any workout at-all to keep fit-for-sex. This book contains easy workouts with massive sexual gains, explained in details of each workout plan. We do not recommend organ enlargement but vitamins and minerals that create a natural boost to go with the workout plans are recommended. (Explained to detail). The positions we chose range from everyday basic to spice-it-up complex. You can incorporate each exercise into the workouts described in this book by prioritizing one or two each day at the beginning of your workout.  How strong do you have to be for sex? Stronger than you might think—unless your idea of passionate coupling is to imitate one of the stiffs on Six Feet Under. Even when you’re in the passive, man-on- the-bottom position, you need strong abs and hips to push your body upward. Men who are really out of shape often find themselves getting fatigued before the act is done—as well as sore the next day. That’s not very sexy. Or satisfying. And that’s an easy position. Have fun while getting in shape and fit for sex is the core essence of this book. It is your duty to make sure you and your partner are in a good sexual relationship.",
