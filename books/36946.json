  "description": "Can the love of a lifetime be forever changed by one pink line?  Sydney Shephard, a tenacious, sweet-tempered college senior is in love with an exceptional man and ready to start a future with him. Yet, one night, she makes an irrevocable decision that forces her to relinquish her youth, and risk losing the love of her life.Then there's Grace, a fifth grader, who's world is turned upside down when she makes a shocking discovery, leaving her with profound and puzzling questions about who she really is.  Spanning generations and every imaginable emotion, One Pink Line reveals how two points of view can be dramatically at odds, and perhaps ultimately reconciled. Simultaneously deeply felt and lighthearted, the story deftly mines how the choices we make are able to alter so many lives, and how doing the right thing and living honestly can bring unexpected, hard-won happiness.With heart, humor and compassion, this debut work of women's fiction is certain to stir anyone who relishes a good laugh, can stand a good cry, and, above all believes in the redemptive power of love.**WINNER of the 2012 Eric Hoffer da Vinci Eye Award for outstanding cover art****FINALIST in the 2012 Indie Reader Discovery Awards - and selected as a 2012 Indie Reader 'Top Title'**",
