  "description": "In the 1970s, an historian named Pierce Moffett moves to the country to write a book, driven by an idea he dare not believe. That the physical laws of the universe once changed and may change again. That before science defined the modern age, other powers, wondrous and magical, once governed the universe, their lore perfected within a lost capital of hieroglyphs, wizard-kings, and fabulous monuments. Not in Egypt--but AEgypt. Yet the notion is not his alone. Something waits at the locked estate of historical romance author Fellowes Kraft, something for which Pierce and those near him have long sought without knowing it--a key, perhaps, to AEgypt.",
