  "description": "Théoden: There is cause for celebration for many reasons. Dante, my young wolf, has lost some of his bite. My sons take their place as official Generals of the city. I appoint my new Lords into their positions and my rules for both will be revealed. On top of that, I get to spend some more quality time with my son, Dante, before the sun rises. It's great to be me.  Noel: Training with Marco has been hard as hell. I'm actually looking forward to taking a break, even if it means going to the arena for vampire festivities. Théoden has given us the night off after the celebration. I wonder what trouble I could get into?  Deacon: Having claimed my mate, Elijah, I can feel my power increase. I was going to have to let the other Alphas know that I am now elevated and I will have my mate by my side when I do so. I want them to see him with their own eyes. If I’m lucky, it will have the desired effect on Josef, and he’ll make all the moves I need him to.  Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes. The novelettes in this serial will be filled with dark, twisted, raunchy and steamy scenes between powerful, sexy men that will either offend you or get ya revved up. This series will not be pulling any punches, and it won’t apologize for hurting your feelings, either. You’ll find no fluff and ruffles here. The vampires are not misunderstood, hopeless romantics looking for love. The werewolves are not cute and cuddly and the dragons aren’t the ones from your childhood. This is NOT a romance. There are approximately 26600 words in this novelette.",
