  "title": "Her Destiny is Change",
  "description": "A new wave of feminist utopian and dystopian stories are upon us. Beth Cohen’s imaginary world stakes out all the necessary grounds for why women are driven to recreate the world they might live in, and who the women need to become in order for such worlds to exist. Her cast of bold and memorable characters include the warrior, the healer, the negotiator, the lovers, and more -- those who create new ways of living and working to make a new society as it splits from the old. There can be no going back once women have found their destiny, and their “destinies are change.”",
