  "description": "“You’re in my head, Lexi. I’ve done my damnedest to make it seem like I couldn’t care less about you, but I’m standing here now, ready to throw it all away for one night.”  By all appearances, Lexi has the perfect boyfriend. Rich. Smart. Chivalrous. And he isn’t bad to look at, either. But Lexi has never felt the sort of uncontrollable urge to rip his clothes off and jump him that she’d seen in the movies.  Still, the brat is beyond ready for her first time. So she plans a secret weekend at her family's cabin - just her, her boyfriend and her first glimpse into womanhood.  But when she arrives at the cabin to find the irresistible man of the house - the one who dominates her forbidden fantasies - is already there, Lexi throws her plans out the window.  Because what self-respecting princess would settle for a mediocre weekend with a boring boyfriend, when the man of the house is ready and willing to step up and take her without protection?   *** This is an erotic short story with taboo language too naughty to share here. \"Look Inside\" for a taste of what's to come! ***",
