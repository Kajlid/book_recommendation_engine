The CIA’s new director sets Agent Kyle Achilles on an intercept course, surveilling the daughter of a British politician. Then Ivan pulls off a masterful con, and Emily vanishes.With Emily’s life, his career, and America’s reputation at stake, Achilles partners with an unlikely new agent he meets in France.
