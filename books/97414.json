  "description": "Tattooed on My Skin is a dark collection of poetry that takes you into the mind of Zoey Sweete and the memories she shares on her skin. Around each dark corner of her mind she marked a story, a chapter of her life on her skin to tell a story of its own. Each line, each drop of ink will show you a peek into the madness she survived. From demons to dark angels, each tattoo weaves a story that made her the woman she is today. Are you ready to read the madness within? Are you ready to feel each tear that rolled down her cheek, each bruise that left a scar on her soul, each memory left tattooed on her skin?",
