  "description": "I can tell him that \"he’s crazy.” Two words. And, he’ll never speak of it again. One lie. That’s all it will take.  I spent twenty years hiding my crush on Isaac Adams. Not a single person knew - not my family, not my friends, and certainly not Isaac.  …Well, he didn’t.  Until I just blurted it out thirty seconds ago. Now it’s out there. Lingering in the air between us. And I have a choice to make.  I can tell Isaac that he’s \"crazy\" to think there’s something more than just friendship between us - the convenient escape plan he just handed me on a silver platter.  ...Or, I can put it all on the line, risk everything, and tell him that for me, it’s always been more.",
