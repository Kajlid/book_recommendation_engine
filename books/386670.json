  "description": "A \"marvelous, courageous and above all, thoughtful\" memoir ( The Washington Post) about a Catholic boy raised in a loving family who is haunted by the sexual abuse he experienced at summer camp.  Raised in a loving Catholic family in Denver, Martin Moran was a star student who imagined that he’d one day become a U.S. senator. When he was twelve years old, a camp counselor seduced him, initiating a sexual relationship that would last three years–and haunt Moran’s life for decades. He discovered a passion for acting and built a career that would take him to Broadway, but only when Moran finally tracked down and confronted his abuser thirty years later could he finally forgive himself for someone’s else trespass.Funny and tender about growing up Catholic and gay, The Tricky Part never oversimplifies either the abuse or the vexing work of recovering from it. This powerful story carries us to the heart of a that what we think of as damage may be the very thing that gives rise to transformation, even grace.",
