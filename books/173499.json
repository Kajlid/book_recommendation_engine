  "description": "“I loved her and she left. Maybe I wasn’t enough. Maybe I’ll never be enough.” I’ve been thinking these words since before we even got together.  Everything is new. The old no longer has a place here. Physical items are easy to replace. I'm constantly battling the ones that aren't.  Every thought and memory I have is stained.  By you.  You weren't even there for half of them.  How is she still present even though she left?  I can do this. I’m going to survive losing her.",
