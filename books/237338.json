  "title": "Final Arrangements 101: How and Why to Plan A Meaningful Funeral or Memorial Service, Before It's Too Late",
  "description": "Death is not a popular subject for many people. The thought of making end of life plans can be very scary. This fear prevents too many people from making decisions, leaving instructions, or even thinking about what will happen to their survivor's after they die. The best time to make plans is now, while you still can. Not doing so will pass the burden to your family. Do they know what your wishes are? Do you, or they, have enough funds and other resources to take care of your final arrangements in addition to their other obligations? There are so many things to consider and plan for. Simply choosing between burial and cremation is just the beginning. Final Arrangements 101 discusses many issues and situations, that if not handled appropriately and timely, can leave your survivor's in a tornado of emotional, legal, and financial entanglements that can last for months, even years. Topics include myths and misconceptions, reasons to pre-plan, veteran issues and options, burial, cremation, life insurance, choosing the right funeral home and many horror stories about what happens to families when someone dies without taking care of these matters beforehand. Don't wait until it's too late! Do it now. You will be glad you did and so will your family.",
