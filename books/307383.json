  "description": "After their harrowing journey to escape persecution, Silas, Zack, Hilde, and Zoe have found a sense of belonging in Sanctuary, a mountain refuge for scaled hybrids. But \"lizard-hating\" vigilantes threaten their security. Lonely and confined, Zoe ventures outside the protective walls of the compound, eager to find friendship like a normal girl. As she nears puberty, she is torn by a painful choice. Should she accept the onset of the glittering scales and come to resemble everyone she loves? Or should she get the vaccine that will block her transformation and allow her to be accepted in the outside world?",
