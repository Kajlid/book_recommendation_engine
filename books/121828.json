  "description": "Blue McCoy was once the hero of Lucy Tait's teenaged dreams--quiet, dark and dangerous. After high school he left Hatboro Creek, South Carolina, to join the military. Years later, now a Navy SEAL, Blue was a man who embodied all of Lucy's fantasies. Now Blue is back in town, and Lucy is not the person he remembered. She's a no-nonsense police officer--and a woman Blue can't take his eyes off. But then Blue is accused of murder. And Lucy is assigned his case. Now their brief affair has become part of an extensive investigation, where what's at stake is critical--Blue's future...and maybe Lucy's heart. Is her hero still the man she remembered?",
