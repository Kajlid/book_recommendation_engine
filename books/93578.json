  "description": "Twenty years past, the governors plotted murder. Ruled by avarice, they imprisoned the winged dragons in the black cells of a stone lair. Tormented by spine and spur the once peaceful creatures howl, immense webbed wings beating against iron bars. Those who raised their voices in protest were banished--skyriders, the men who rode dragons--vanished to the distant mountains of the Mirror.Now,Treasa, the daughter of exiles, seeker of secrets, dreams with the lair's dragons, her heart torn by her love for the winged creatures and a man who masters them. She must choose her path with care. The lair's black-garbed riders sense the dragons' growing savagery. Yet Conall longs to grasp their power, subdue them and soar, unaware that winged flight, merged in harmony, is his for the asking. A curved talon rends flesh and dragon scale, rattling against white ribs and the world shifts. As hearts once parted bind, Treasa and Conall join forces to fight for the dragon's freedom. Alliances form, old myths are revealed and new myths are born.",
