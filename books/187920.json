  "description": "Josh has a plan: get through uni with a good degree and no debt. Focused on his goals, he pays his way by working as an escort. He enjoys the no-strings sex because he doesn't have time for a relationship. Falling in love definitely isn't part of the deal-especially not with a client. When Rupert meets Josh in a bar, he's smitten on sight. He's never paid for sex, but when Josh propositions him, he can't resist. He should've known one night would never be enough. Luckily for him he has an inheritance to fund his addiction to Josh, because his job in IT support wouldn't cover the cost. With each encounter the lines get blurred, creating something that feels more like a relationship than a business transaction. But they come from different worlds, and to go from client-and-escort to lovers seems impossible. If they want a future together, Josh and Rupert have a lot to overcome.",
