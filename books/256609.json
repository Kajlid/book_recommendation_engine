  "description": "A highly entertaining fable of squirrels reliving the history of the United States. Will they solve our problems – faster?  After the Great Disastrous Flood recedes, squirrel greats George Squirrelton and Benjamin Franknut convince the surviving squirrels that they have to organize themselves to survive under the difficult conditions. They form the Sciurus States on the Eastern Seaboard.  However, due to excessive storms, life is difficult until squirrel influencer Steve I’Squirrel discovers that the weird boxes the squirrels find in deserted human dwellings can be used to communicate with other burrows.  The Sciurus States, and especially its capital, Nuttington, begin to flourish. Still, over time, problems arise.  The Tribe Council, which is supposed to protect all squirrels, is favoring their own interests more than the interests of all squirrels. Some residents notice.  Young Harry, a descendant of president Theo Roosquirrel, his Great-Grandpa, the gray eminence of Nuttington burrow, and Gary Logisquir, the Sciurus States’ nut-checkers champion, all discover reasons to be unhappy with The Council’s activities.  Meanwhile, one of the Sciurus States’ residents tries to find the nerve to become a whistleblower because, in truth, The Council has an even bigger secret than Harry, Great-Grandpa, and Gary Logisquir can guess.  Then, one day, Harry finds a rare raspberry. Great-Grandpa tells him that finding a raspberry means that an extraordinary thing might be happening.  Will Harry and his Great-Grandpa discover the Big Secret?",
