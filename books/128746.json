  "description": "Something happened to the earth. Inexplicable. Not a product of man, but of nature.  Now Flex Sheridan and Gem Cardoza must do all they can to protect Flex's six-year-old neice Trina and find ways to survive a massive outbreak that has caused most of humankind to metamorphose into the walking dead.  Enter Hemphill \"Hemp\" Chatsworth. He is a scientist who has expertise in epidemics, as well as a mechanical engineering degree. He's doing all the important work, setting up a mobile lab in which to experiment on the zombies and learn what drives them. But he must also learn what will defeat them.  Charlene \"Charlie\" Sanders is a punk rock-loving, crossbow-wielding firecracker who rivals only Gem Cardoza in her sharp wit and fighting capability. She'll join with Hemp in his lab to help him learn what they all need to know in order to stay safe.  \"Amazing! Heart-wrenching! Non-stop action!\" ~ Amazon Reader D. Zeman  \"I would definitely recommend this series to my family and friends and everyone else!\" ~ Amazon Reader C. DeAndrea  \"Eric has a way to make his characters so believable that you feel that you are sitting with your friends.\" ~ Amazon Reader T. Gascon",
