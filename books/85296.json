  "description": "Lilaâ€™s friend claims that submitting to a Dom in bed is a wonderful stress-reliever, but Lila is skeptical. So when she opens the door and finds her old crush Theo waiting on the other side, she doesn't know what to do. Since he fails to recognize her, she lets him in, accepting his offer to help her relax. After he explains that Abby sent him, Lila reconsiders her misgivings about dominant men. When Theo ties her up and woos her with origami doves, she reconsiders her fear of letting go. When he makes love to her, she learns to fly.",
