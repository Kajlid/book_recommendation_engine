  "title": "Modern Real Estate Investing: The Delaware Statutory Trust",
  "description": "Modern Real Estate Investing introduces the nation to a new concept in real estate investment known as the Delaware Statutory Trust (DST). The DST is a synthesis of one hundred years of real estate, securities, and tax laws that provide an investment entity that allows the modern real estate investor to build a diversified portfolio of institutional grade real estate under protective securities regulations and enjoy the tax advantages of gain nonrecognition using IRC section 1031 like-kind exchanges. The book not only introduces the DST but also guides the reader through the investment process by providing perspective in the choosing of brokers, sponsors, and properties as well as a more in-depth analysis of the DST offering (John Harvey, CPA, MBT, author). The book provides a clear explanation of DST's and how they provide opportunities for smaller investors access to institutional properties otherwise not available to them, because of the large equity requirements and access to reasonable financing. The 1031 exchange is linked very nicely, explaining the DST opportunity for diversification in more than one investment that helps balance overall risk in the 1031 exchange. Trump tax plan is expertly explained and its impact on the DST structure. Book describes clear example of the tax savings of a 1031 exchange and the benefit of compounding on deferred taxes avoided at time sale. Good examples of dos and don'ts in the 1031 exchange (Kosmas G. Toskos, DST investor).",
