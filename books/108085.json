Four trillionaires, Travis, Austin, Cody, and Bo decide they will form a partnership to purchase one of the few breeding females that are left. They plan to treat her like a queen, but they knew they must insist on her loyalty.Erin is told one week before her auction that she, like her friend April, will be sold to the highest bidders.

She’s more reluctant than ever!",
