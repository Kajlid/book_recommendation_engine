  "description": "An exciting new urban fantasy series...   What if everything you've been told is a lie?   Fifteen years ago the war demolished Arrow's family. Lied to and betrayed, she's driven to shatter the conspiracy concealing how her parents and thousands of others died. But to go up against the powerful government she'll need to align herself with the strangest and most dangerous criminals in Victory City: the Specials.    They are not what they seem...   They are magic misfits and criminals, recruited and blackmailed to fill ordinary positions within the Sinistera Hotel. But for those who are greedy enough--or desperate like Arrow--there are opportunities to earn big money doing illegal magic jobs. The danger and the risks are high. Magic assassination, kidnapping, assault--there's a good chance Arrow and the others could be killed or wish they had been. But though the Specials each have agendas of their own, they are determined to rewrite history...if they can survive that long.  Demon Leap is the first book in The Specials series. Check out this imaginative paranormal thriller that will grab you from page one and keep you at the edge of your seat!",
