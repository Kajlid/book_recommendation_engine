  "title": "The Words of My Father",
  "description": "\"The Words of My Father\" captures the nightly dialogue between a father and son before the boy falls asleep. Every evening, before tucking him in, Giuseppe tells his son stories, some from his own life, some fictional, which serve to illustrate the phrases which make up the Lord’s prayer. “Pappa, I don’t understand!” the boy protests. So his father, step by step, illustrates what the words mean for him in the light of his life and imagination before his son dozes off.The stories transport the boy into far off kingdoms or into his father’s childhood where he learns to reflect on the meaning of words and experiences captured by the Lord’s Prayer rather than simply passing over them. Little by little both son and father reach a deeper understanding of fatherhood, kinship, faith and gratitude.",
