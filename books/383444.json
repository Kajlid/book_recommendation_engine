  "title": "Socrates: The Man and His Thought",
  "description": "Professor Taylor's biography provides the best short life of the world's greatest philosopher and an excellent introduction to Socratic thought. The author, whose monumental volume— Plato: The Man and His Work— earned him a leading place in leading modern Platonic scholarship, assembles in this present book all that we can claim to know about the life and death of the man whose mind towers over the long course of Western thought.He reveals Socrates as \"the man who created the intellectual and moral tradition by which Europe has ever since lived\" and he presents him in all his fullness as \"an original genius in whose character there was a unique blend of the passionate lover, the religious mystic, the eager rationalist, and the humorist.\"We are to reconstruct,\" Professor Taylor writes, \"as far as we can on the surviving records, the reaction upon such a character of the intense intellectual life of the Periclean age.\"",
