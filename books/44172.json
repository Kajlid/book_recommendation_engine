  "description": "\"MEN PLAN, GOD LAUGHS.\"Those words should have been tattooed on Nicky's forehead at birth. If they had maybe he wouldn't be in this fix. It was supposed to be so simple: just scam the local Russian mobster out of some money and drugs, then skip out of town before he knows he's been fleeced.It looked good on paper. It sounded good when he talked it out but, as usual with Nicky, the minute he brought his dream grift into the real world things went straight to hell. His partner seems to have pulled a double cross, his girlfriend is totally useless, the Russians are coming for their property and all Nicky's got to get himself out of this are his wits and his mouth. And that's before Max showed up with his hard guy attitude and quick fists. Yeah, things are going to Hell, all right. Seems like Nicky forgot the first rule of survival on the mean streets of GRAY HARBOR: Always make sure the guy holding the gun is you.",
