He's staring down the barrel of the biggest gamble of his career, and can't afford the distractions of a glamorous city or desirable women; neither of which excite him much anyway.Until he meets Audrey.Brilliant, ruthless, and set on conquering the finance world, the young exec would rather be catching a London red-eye, than a mangled wedding bouquet.

They're from different cities and different worlds--it would never work.And yet she's haunted by the brush of his lips against her throat, the delicious press of his body...But Theo is keeping secrets that could break Audrey's heart and destroy everything she's worked for. In this careful dance of power and seduction, has Theo finally met his match?Conflicted Interest is the first steamy installment of the sensual contemporary romance Conflicted Series, intended for ages 18+.",
