  "description": "It's November 3, 2020, and Emma McMasters has just been elected the 46th president of the United States. She's facing a divided Congress and nation, allies that no longer trust America, enemies that have been emboldened, and the legacy of destruction left by the last administration. She must rebuild and reestablish trust in government, in the media, and in the electoral system, all the while carrying the mantle of first female president, and along with it, the hopes and dreams of millions of women and little girls who need her to prove that a woman can get the job done. Palmer Estes has devoted her life and her career to the military, rising to become the highest-ranking female officer in the US Army. An enigmatic, battle-tested hero, she's the perfect choice to brief the new president on one last, urgent, highly sensitive mission before she retires. Two strong women, both driven to serve the country they love, neither prepared for the sparks that fly between them.",
