It was in that moment that I realized how thankful I was for the life she gave me.\" Varsha Wilson, an aspiring American journalist who was adopted from Kolkata, spends her childhood trying to escape her past and integrate into American society. However, when she receives an unexpected assignment from her journalism professor, she finds herself searching for a winning story in the city where she was born.
