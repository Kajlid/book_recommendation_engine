  "description": "\"What an incredible gift this book will be for countless children. Having it fifty-plus years ago would have been a kind of salvation for me and would have helped me grow into a healthier and infinitely less frightened person.\"—Anne Lamott\"She's in a better place now,\" adults say again and again. But it doesn't seem better, it seems stupid.This forthright exploration of grief and mourning recognizes the anger, confusion, and fear that we feel about death—but refuses to succumb to banalities when talking about it. Necessary and beautiful, Death Is Stupid is an invaluable tool for talking about death, but also the possibilities for celebrating life and love.Anastasia Higginbotham's books about ordinary, terrible things tell stories of children who navigate trouble with their senses on alert and their souls intact. The books take on divorce, death, bullying, illness, confusion about sex, and sexual abuse—for starters. Her essays have appeared in Ms., Bitch, Glamour, and in anthologies like Listen Up and Yes Means Yes.",
