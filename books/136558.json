  "description": "Early one morning, a little bear found a little box. He looked inside. Then he exclaimed, “Why, it’s the greatest thing ever! Mouse will love this.” Bear’s friends aren’t so sure of his newfound treasure, however. “That’s not so great,” says Monkey. “I’ve seen those before,” says Owl. And by the time Bear finds Mouse, his own doubts have grown. But Mouse has the last say when he looks inside the little box. “It is the greatest thing ever,” he tells his friend. “Thank you, Bear.” Part mystery, part fable, this deceptively simple story of true friendship is perfect for the very youngest reader. It is sure to tug at your heart.Good Luck Bear is the 2008 winner of the Charlotte Zolotow Award.",
