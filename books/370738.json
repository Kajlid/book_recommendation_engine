  "description": "Now that she is turning thirteen, Maria Peterson envisions new adult prestige and responsibility, like attending abolitionist meetings and listening to inspiring speakers such as Sojourner Truth. The year also brings trials and tribulations for her family and friends, however. The City of New York wants to turn her community's settlement into a park. Now that Maria has made a new friend, she's even more determined to stay put. But soon Maria discovers that her friend has a problem even more dire than being thrown out of her home. Will Maria be able to help her? And what will happen to her own family's home?Filled with vivid period detail, action, and pathos, Home is with Our Family draws on the talents of two Coretta Scott King Award-winners to create a complete picture of a little known settlement in nineteenth century New York City. Like Little House on the Prairie and The Birch Bark House , Home Is with Our Family provides an intimate view of daily life in a time gone by.",
