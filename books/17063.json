  "description": "TO BE CONSUMED BY LOVE...Ironcross Castle was called cursed by the Highlanders. Its most recent lairds had perished in accidents, falls, or fires. The newest owner, Gavin Kerr, did not fear death. It was feeling he dreaded--the pain of betrayal and loss. Now he arrived at the castle to hear of hauntings and cults and to be drawn to the portrait of beautiful Joanna Maclnnes, who died here amid a furnace of flame. And looking at her, Gavin desired her, feeling an impossible longing to take her in his arms.OR TO BURN...The real Joanna Maclnnes had escaped the fire that claimed her kin. For months she had walked Ironcross by night, hiding in its passageways, searching for the truth behind the castle's curse. Now she feared it would claim Gavin Kerr. Yet warning him, touching him in the darkness, soon ignited another kind of burning. And even as her lips opened beneath his, she knew time was running out before they faced a heartless villain ... a terrifying secret ... and a struggle between eternal darkness and the power of undying love.",
