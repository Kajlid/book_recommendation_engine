  "title": "A Maiden of Mercy",
  "description": "When the handsome dragon fighter knight in the castle next door returns home after a long absence, Lady Juliette Lindhurst pursues her childhood love with the determination to obtain the husband she wants before her father arranges her marriage to someone else. Sir Kilburn Pembroke's inconsolable mood changes the moment he sees Juliette again. When she helps him heal from the emotional pains of his past by offering him her unbridled affections, he fears he's not worthy of this Maiden of Mercy. To My Readers: In continuation of my fascination with the gallantry of ladies and knights, I've written the story of dragon fighter and the lady that rescues him from depression. Kilburn suffers from a harrowing ordeal of saving his kidnapped cousin. When he returns home to live in seclusion, Juliette, the childhood friend that has always loved him refuses to give up on pulling Kilburn out of his surly mood. This is a story that shows the power of a woman's faith, and I hope once in everyone's life, you get to experience the true depths of love.",
