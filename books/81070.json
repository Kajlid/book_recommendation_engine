  "description": "The best-selling erotic romance series from Delilah Fawkes is now available in one delicious volume! Isabeau Willcox is just the temp at the front desk, so when the mysterious, sexy and notoriously ill-tempered CEO, Chase Drake asks her to be his executive assistant, she's sure there's been some sort of mistake. However, Mr. Drake wants her, and Mr. Drake always gets what he wants. When she enters his employ, she agrees to be at his beck and call, to be his, but what exactly does that entail? When he punishes her for breaking his rules by bending her over his desk, she realizes she may be in for more than she bargained for. Isabeau is introduced into Chase Drake's world, learning about his darker side, including his secret sex dungeon and deliciously naughty toys that spark her imagination and make her knees weak. He shackles her and makes her his slave, bringing her to heights she never imagined. But when he asks to make their arrangement more permanent, she remembers how quickly he's dismissed previous assistants, and wonders if she can give him the trust he craves. A bad boy business partner, a dangerous secret, and Isabeau's conflicted heart threaten to end it all before it's even begun. Suspenseful action and a romance that will leave your heart, and other places, aching for more weave throughout this story of two different lovers from two very different worlds. This complete version of The Billionaire's Beck and Call series comes with a bonus story: My Best Friend's Brother. Happy reading!",
