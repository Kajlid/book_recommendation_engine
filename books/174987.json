  "title": "Perfect Peace: in Imperfect Times",
  "description": "Dan Walsh, bestselling fiction author of novels like The Unfinished Gift and The Reunion, has penned his first non-fiction book. Perfect Peace is a 31-Day Devotional crafted from the pages of Dan's personal journal, written over the last several years.  Here's an excerpt from Day 2: “If you’re like me, you’ve known moments of real peace. Moments when you’ve trusted God fully for your life, for everything going on in your life. In those moments, you knew real peace. The problem is, the word ‘moments.’ The moments didn’t last. The promise of Isaiah 26:3 is not to have moments of peace in our lives. The promise is that God would keep us in Perfect Peace.”  In Perfect Peace, Dan shares the Scriptural life-lessons he's learned during some of the more challenging times in his life, hoping to encourage other Christians wrestling with things like stress, worry or fear.",
