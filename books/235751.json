  "description": "Fire Meet Gasoline. . .  When Jess packed up her belongings and fled her small hometown in Indiana, she never looked back. Free from her family’s dark past she was finally able to pursue her lifelong dream as a professional dancer. She never expected to find herself at his door. . . or at his club.  Nick was unlike any other man she had ever met. Sexy…Alluring…Predatory. Dangerous. The kind of man with more secrets than even she had.  Every instinct warned Jess against knowing him further, but she always did like playing with fire…  Nick Roman took one look at Jess and knew she was trouble from the very start. But something about the defiant twist of her mouth and the wide, haunted eyes of a damaged soul touched him in places he'd long ago thought dead.  He knew he needed to stay far away from her for his own sanity, but like a moth to a flame he was helpless to resist…  Working at Takers Gentleman's Club was the last place Jess thought she would find herself, but she quickly learned how the game was played.  See what you want, take what you can get…but at what cost?  ***Due to sexual content, implied and actual scenes of abuse, violence, organized crime, language and frequent illegal drug use, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter. ***",
