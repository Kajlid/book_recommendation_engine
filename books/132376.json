  "description": "Trapped in the Sierra Nevada without food, The Donner Party are led to the slaughter. After being manipulated and coerced into a string of bad decisions, the travelers, frozen and abandoned, find themselves unable to go forward or back, and are preyed upon by werewolves in their midst––the very people they thought were friends.  A tale of resilience, horror, and betrayal, the survivors of the expedition are hunted. But the human spirit endures.  As the creatures grow hungry and desperate, a showdown is born between the people struggling to retain their humanity, and the creatures seeking a massacre.  Told from the diaries of young Virginia Reed and others in the party, the truth is finally revealed.  “Duncan McGeary is an accomplished writer who knows how to tell a great story. Led to the Slaughter is a riveting tale sure to please the most discerning reader.” ~ Mike Richardson, Emmy award winning producer and founder of Dark Horse Comics  “If you like your history with a sprinkling of killer lycanthropes, have I got a book for you. Duncan McGeary’s new novel, Led to the Slaughter: The Donner Party Werewolves, offers an alternate explanation for the cannibalism in the Donner Party, and is a welcome addition to the ranks of alternative histories.” ~ Steve Perry, New York Times Bestselling Author of Men in Black, The Mask, and Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire",
