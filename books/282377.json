  "description": "Claudine’s House, the first of Colette’s best-selling Claudine novels, is a tender and heartfelt portrayal of childhood and memory. On its first publication, its popularity was such that the Claudine series gave rise to a musical stage play and an entire range of related merchandise. In an idyllic setting of countryside and woods, Colette spent her childhood surrounded by a warm and loving family. Years later, her memories and experiences inspired her to create a series of snapshots of the innocence of provincial life. At once poignant and vividly alive, her recollections portray a magical world, filled with the beauty and the warmth of human relationships—and, above all, the lasting impressions made by her wonderful mother. French novelist Colette is most famous for her portraits of childhood in the Claudine books and for Gigi.",
