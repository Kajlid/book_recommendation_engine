And if the doctors are right about her cancer, she'll never have the chance. So when she's told she needs a miracle, her family moves 1,500 miles north to Promise, Maine--a place where amazing, unexplainable events are said to occur--like it or not. And when a mysterious envelope arrives, containing a list of things for Cam to do before she dies, she finally learns to believe--in love, in herself . . . and maybe even in miracles, as improbable as they may seem. \"Wonderfully bittersweet, with just as much humor as sadness.\"-- Seventeen.com",
