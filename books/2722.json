And they're not the only ones who want to keep it. \nThe Danger\n In 1665, a British vessel named the Griffin sank with a priceless amount of gold on board. Now, centuries later, four kids are trying to raise the Griffin's treasure from the sea. Kaz, Dante, Adriana, and Star must take the biggest risks of their lives...and discover that they won't be able to trust anybody - even themselves.",
