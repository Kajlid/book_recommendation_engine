  "description": "Book 5 in the Unrivalled Regency Series  She had been banished to avoid the scandal, but now an even worse horror lurks. Running was Annabel’s only choice, her last chance to escape evil’s loathsome clutches. If only she had accepted Lord Latham’s generous offer, but her heart would not allow her to accept anything less than a marriage founded on love. And he didn’t love her.  He had missed his chance to have her once before. He wasn’t about to allow this second opportunity slip though his fingers. If it meant he had to beat off all other contenders for her heart, to chase her down, and insist that she accept his offer, Charles would go to any lengths to do it.  But with dread and foreboding inching closer every day, Annabel’s luck is running out. Will she be caught in terror’s vile grasp, or will she accomplish another Elusive Escape?  An Elusive Escape contains some sensual love scenes and is an endearing love story suitable for anyone age 16 and upwards. As part of the Unrivalled Regency series, An Elusive Escape is a stand-alone story, but the series is best read in order to fully appreciate the depth of the characters and previous situations.
