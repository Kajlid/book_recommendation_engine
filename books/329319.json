  "description": "I love my job as a cop but after being passed up for another promotion, I Iet it rip…ending in my suspension. I’m ready to drown my anger in coffee and donuts when I see her . I don’t know where she came from or why she’s here, but I sure as hell know where she’s going and why. My bed, to give me babies. I want her thoroughly marked as mine. Her entire body proof of the claim I laid on her. I sound like a complete and utter maniac, but it’s what she does to me. I like that she’s a bit feisty, that she’s trying to make it in this world alone. I can relate. I recognize and respect it. And want to help her. And help myself to her. She will be mine and any man who even thinks they have a chance with her will meet the end of my boot and my fists. She will. Never. Escape. Me.",
