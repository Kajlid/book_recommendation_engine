  "description": "Every story comes to an end eventually. Maybe ours was never meant to have a happy ending.I was back in my hometown at last, surrounded by the boys I’ve loved for my entire life, and I’d finally had everything I’d ever wanted. But fate never was kind to this dead girl and we aren’t done fighting to claim our happily ever after.This might not be a fairy tale, but I swear on all I am that I’ll defeat the villain of our story before it’s done. The only question left to answer is whether or not we’ll all live to see him die.I’ll do whatever it takes to get revenge for everything Shawn has taken from us and claim the ending we deserve. But it’s gonna be one hell of a ride to get there.This is the final book in the Harlequin Crew series. Beware of dark themes, devious villains and beautiful men with blackened souls. This series is part of the United States of Anarchy universe and there are some characters which cross over with other series in this world including Kings of Quarantine and The Death CLub but each dark and twisted tale can be read independently.",
