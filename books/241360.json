  "description": "He’s been dead for centuries. But to historian Anna Viatorem, Prince Audax Leonis is still very much alive. His legend lives on in his words. His journals, a living testimony to the man he was and could have been. His blue eyes stare out from his only portrait. His stern yet handsome face…frozen in time. Orphaned at a young age, Anna feels an inexplicable connection to Dax. His voice seems to echo in her head. \"I am a stranger in my own world.\" Every Terran knows the story. It’s the mystery that cannot be solved. But to Anna, the betrayal and murder of Prince Audax is an obsession, the subject of her doctoral dissertation, and the catalyst that could jump start her career. Unbeknownst to Anna, her destiny has already been rewritten. The descendants of the Leonis family are protected by a powerful immortal promise and the goddess Iustitia has much in store for the young doctoral student. Including a trip through time, and a face- to- face encounter with the man himself.",
