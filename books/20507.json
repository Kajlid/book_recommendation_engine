  "title": "Cherry Grove, Fire Island: Sixty Years in America's First Gay and Lesbian Town",
  "description": "For thousands of gay men and lesbians in America, Cherry Grove -- the oldest continuously inhabited resort on Fire Island -- has meant freedom. Not simply the leisure-time freedoms from work and noise and pollution, but the far rarer freedom to socialize in public without risking a beating, to stroll arm in arm without hesitation, to leave the curtains open without fear -- in short, to live the American dream that was denied to gay men and lesbians on the U.S. mainland. In her rich and detailed cultural history of Cherry Grove, Esther Newton tells for the first time the full story of this unique community, the oldest gay and lesbian town in America.",
