  "title": "Jazz: A Listener's Guide",
  "description": "Drawn from the author's on-air and in-person seminar, this introduction to jazz is written in a personal, informal style and requires no musical background. Focuses on guiding the beginning listener's ear, not on memorizing musical facts. Introduces musical terms and concepts only as needed, and always in connection to specific musical compositions. Discusses \"what happens\" and \"when it happens\" to alert listeners to various musical features. Offers almost 200 musical selections—many new to the Third Edition—compiled from Smithsonian anthologies like The Jazz Singers and from currently available commercial recordings. Perfect for musicians looking to brush up on jazz history, or for any music/jazz enthusiast who wants to learn more about the subject.",
