  "description": "From the Authors of 'Nate Grisham' and 'A Southern Moon Rising'The year is 1861 and the United States is on the eve of the bloodiest war in our nation's short history. This is the story of two cousins, on opposite sides of the conflict, that must fight their bloody war of principles and suffer its terrible price. Leaving behind their farms to an uncertain survival, both families face their own horrendous task; staying alive through uncertainty and strife as soldiers, from either side, strip civilians of their food in an effort to feed their armies. Rapes, murders, and petty crimes often plagued those left at home. The Southerners suffer, as the North smashes the rebellion with the force of their industrial-based power. Resisting mainly on pure guts and determination, Southern civilians still would die of hunger or disease. Once the war ends bad times get worse as the carpetbaggers arrive, often buying up huge plantations for what was owed in back taxes, and for pennies on the dollar. The Southern economy was in shambles, with no jobs, and much of its manpower killed in four years of intense struggle. This is the story of two such families and the men they sent to war.",
