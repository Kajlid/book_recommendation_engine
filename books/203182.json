  "description": "I, Derek Rosewood, am never going to marry.Ever. Again.Fresh off the heels of a bitter divorce, there are only three things I give a sh*t about: my daughter, my career, and my bachelorhood.An attorney by trade and happily married to my job, I save the drama for the courtroom and keep women at an arm’s length. Their fragile, sequined hearts are safer that way. And besides, I’m not in any condition to offer them the love and attention they so foolishly seek from me.Believe me, I’m not what they need. Not after what I’ve been through.It’s not until I’m assigned as the financial conservatorship for an aloof, enigmatic heiress that I find my professional – and personal – boundaries pushed to the wayside. We’re all wrong for each other. Emotionally unavailable. Bitter. Jaded. And I’m supposed to look out for her best interests. Protect her.But *this* wasn’t supposed to happen. And for that reason, I plead the fifth.",
