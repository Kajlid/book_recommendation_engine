  "title": "Grains Friend Or Foe?",
  "description": "Cereal/true grains are members of the Grass Family. Commonly used true grains include barley, corn, millet, oats, rice, rye, sorghum, and wheat. Grain consumption in human diets is controversial, and more people are reporting difficulty eating all grains, particularly those that contain gluten. Gluten elimination from their diet makes them feel better. Other people feel better if they eat no grains. Common problems associated with grain allergy include arthritic symptoms, asthma, \"candida,\" depression, fatigue, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), migraine headaches, and skin disorders. A comprehensive discussion of all grains, pseudograins (amaranth, buckwheat, ka√±iwa, and quinoa), grain allergy and symptoms, and celiac disease is included in this book. Also included are lists of where grains and pseudograins may be found, as well as possible grain flour substitutes and recipes for alternative breads.",
