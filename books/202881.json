Although his kill rate is the highest ever recorded, it is his cold, unfeeling approach to his missions that catches the eye of a secret group known as \"The Council\" who are on a mission to exact justice where the legal and judicial systems have failed. They recruit Pennington for the sole purpose of assassinating specific people they have targeted.Pennington executes his missions with precision and is one of the world's most lethal men--that is, until he meets Dr. Sherri Fergusson. Pennington's chance meeting with Fergusson will change the course of both their lives as he learns too late that The Council takes no prisoners and will share their warrior commodity with no one. Deception, confinement, betrayal, revenge, and love all combine to create a journey of deadly unpredictability as Douglas Pennington and The Council collide, each seeking out their own type of justice.",
