  "description": "\"Welcome to Hell,\" was not what Lacy expected to hear on the day she died...  Lacy lived her human life under the thumb of an abusive husband. She freed herself from that life and started a new one as a high school teacher. When a group of terrorists tried to take over the school and use it for their own evil purpose, Lacy could not stand by and watch her students being threatened. That was how her human life ended and her new life as an Elite Guard began. The new leader of Hell offered her a job she couldn't refuse, helping those who need her, keeping both Hell and Earth safe. Evil forces are gathering and Lacy must get her training done and be ready to fight when the time comes. There is just one tiny distraction. Liam has been a resident of Greed for more years than he cared to admit. He earned his way out though, and Lacy knows that he belongs to her. He is just the right man to give her hope and make her have faith in love once again.",
