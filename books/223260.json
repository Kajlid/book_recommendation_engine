  "description": "An inner-city high-school teacher and trailer-park resident named Frank struggles to feed the homeless cats which surround him, despite constant threats of eviction. When he spies Annie, a stunning nineteen-year-old beauty in a catalog of Ukrainian and Russian women, he decides to write to her. As Frank attempts to survive the school year, he and his friend Eddie embark on a series of strip-club adventures. Frank becomes increasingly disillusioned and disgusted with his own life as well as the state of romance in modern America, until he meets a charming and seemingly innocent dancer named Emma. Will Frank and Emma find lasting romance in a society that makes romantic love nearly impossible, or will Frank chase his dream all the way to the Ukraine? In the meantime, a bubbly ninth-grader named Jazz and an aging hawk-like Math teacher but heads and compete for Frank's affection as the trailer-park manager vows to catch and evict whoever has been feeding the park cats. Will Frank make it across the land-mine of ludicrous and dangerous situations known as his life to achieve a life of passion and compassion?",
