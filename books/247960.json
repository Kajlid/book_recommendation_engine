  "description": "New York Times BestsellerNamed one of the Best Books of the Year by NPR, the Washington Post , Kirkus Reviews , and Library JournalWinner of the Audie Award The New York Times bestseller from the author of Watchmen and V for Vendetta finally appears in a one-volume paperback. Begging comparisons to Tolstoy and Joyce, this “magnificent, sprawling cosmic epic” ( Guardian ) by Alan Moore―the genre-defying, “groundbreaking, hairy genius of our generation” (NPR)―takes its place among the most notable works of contemporary English literature. In decaying Northampton, eternity loiters between housing projects. Among saints, kings, prostitutes, and derelicts, a timeline unravels: second-century fiends wait in urine-scented stairwells, delinquent specters undermine a century with tunnels, and in upstairs parlors, laborers with golden blood reduce fate to a snooker tournament. Through the labyrinthine streets and pages of Jerusalem tread ghosts singing hymns of wealth and poverty. They celebrate the English language, challenge mortality post-Einstein, and insist upon their slum as Blake’s eternal holy city in “Moore’s apotheosis, a fourth-dimensional symphony” ( Entertainment Weekly ). This “brilliant . . . monumentally ambitious” tale from the gutter is “a massive literary achievement for our time―and maybe for all times simultaneously” ( Washington Post ). 1 map; 3 illustrations",
