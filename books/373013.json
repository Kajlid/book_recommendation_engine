  "description": "A woman convinced she must choose between the sensual and the sensible, between romance and reality. A man who settled for nothing less than having it all. A powerful novel of second chances, last chances, and a relationship that almost wasn’t—by New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann…It was the chance Molly Cassidy was waiting for and she wasn’t letting it slip away. She’d unexpectedly inherited the Kirk Estate and was determined to restore the historic house as one of Sunrise Key’s finest bed-and-breakfasts. Of all the obstacles she faced, the biggest challenge was the man determined to buy the roof from over her head. Sexy billionaire Preston Seaholm owned the biggest resort in the little Florida community. But Molly knew well that the best things in life couldn’t be bought or sold. She had come to Sunrise Key with a dream, her ten-year-old son, and no intention of falling for a thrill-seeking adventurer. But from the moment they met, when he risked his own neck to save hers, Pres Seaholm proved he wasn’t the man Molly thought he was. Now, with something even more precious on the line, was she too late to recognize that he was the man she’d given up ever finding?From the Paperback edition.",
