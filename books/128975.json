  "description": "A war was fought in the Jinn world between the Shaitans and the Amin. The Shaitans won, leaving the evil King Iblis as primary ruler over five Jinn kingdoms. This first book of the trilogy begins years later. Five humans are taken to the Jinn world after being attacked by a group of ghouls. In a hidden mountain city the humans are told that they are in fact Jinn, and now they must shed their human bodies and become Jinn once again. After this they can lead the Amin army to victory, and destroy Iblis and his army of ghouls once and for all. Inevitably, it will not be their external enemies that are their greatest danger, but instead a traitor from within. The World of Jinn trilogy will explore the best and worst of humankind. Its purpose is to challenge our ideas of love, morality, forgiveness and the meaning of faith. Although centered on creatures mentioned in Islam, this book examines many paths of faith and argues that regardless of where our beliefs originate, it is our actions that define us.",
