  "description": "Malyn Reed meets and quickly falls in love with Beau Brogan, who seems to be perfect in every way... except for the fact that he died in 1910. Malyn Reed has been able to see spirits her entire life. Now that sheâ€™s almost seventeen, she has learned to differentiate between the living and the dead, making her gift feel less like an evil curse. She ignores the spirits she encounters on a daily basis, which has made living side by side with them slightly easier...until she moves to Dandridge, the second oldest town in Tennessee. Beau Brogan has been dead for a hundred years. In life, he was a hard working country boy who loved his family and stole the hearts of many southern belles. But all of that came to a tragic halt at the age of nineteen when his life came to an untimely end. In death, his spirit has been entombed in a ghostly life of loneliness and misery that he wishes would just end...until the Reeds move in.",
