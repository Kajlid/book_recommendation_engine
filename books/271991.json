  "description": "Dallas Van Zant…Water polo god.Shameless flirt.Beautiful disaster in the most literal sense of that label.Trust me, it’s not hyperbole. He’s in big trouble with the law. What does this have to do with me, you ask? Unfortunately, a lot. For some reason, which I still can’t quite wrap my brain around, I’ve been talked into driving him around as part of his plea deal. Problem is, he makes me nervous. I’m not good with people, men in particular, popular athletes especially. I’ve worked really hard to get my disability under control and one minute in his company and all my hard work flies out the window.To top it all off, I promised myself that I was going to make some serious changes this year. I’m tired of feeling awkward around boys. I’m tired of never having had a boyfriend. I’m tired of being lonely. And he’s wrecking my plans.But I’m also not the type to turn away a person in need. So I’ll do what I must to help him out. I’ll just pretend that I’m not enjoying his company. And I’ll ignore the fact that he’s sweet and funny. And I’ll tell myself every day that he’s out of my league.Because I’m as inexperienced as they come. And Dallas Van Zant is nothing but wild.",
