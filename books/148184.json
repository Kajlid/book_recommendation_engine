  "description": "Valerie Gunnar thought her days working as Odin’s Chooser of the Slain were over. A successful college professor in the mortal world, this Valkyrie would have been happy never getting involved in the business of the supernatural again. But someone’s trying to bring about the fall of Asgard and Valerie must return to her natural form of Gunnr (“Battle”), sword-wielding Valkyrie.  Along the way she picks up a partner in the form of Detective Jace Heffernan, who’s not as human as he seems. He’s looking for a little revenge for the death of his partner. Together the two of them must find the missing Thunder God Thor and restore order to Valhalla, while a very powerful enemy stands in their way.  Once Gunnr is stripped of her powers, she must decide between finally having her mortality and freedom back and the family she left behind a long time ago.",
