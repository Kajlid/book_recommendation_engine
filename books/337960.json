  "description": "'Damaged by her past, Morgan Fletcher moved to a quiet cottage in rural Montana wanting solitude, tranquility, and a fresh start. A refuge where she could heal from the brutality inflicted upon her by her late husband. The very last thing on her mind while starting life over was allowing someone new in. Ex-convict, Nick Evanoff didn't need anyone. At least he never had in the past. After his time in prison, all he wanted from life was to train horses, and rescue the ones he could. Other than the company of the animals and of his brother, Jake, Nick was fine with life alone. But the moment he spots Morgan sitting in a copse of trees, trespassing on his land, the temptation he feels overwhelms him. The pure need just one glimpse of her arouses in him explodes into something he could never have imagined. Could Nick work the same magic on the beautiful, Morgan as he did on the abused horses he rescues? Could he teach her that it was safe to trust?",
