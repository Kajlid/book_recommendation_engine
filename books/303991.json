  "description": "When associate attorney Kara Hayes wakes up in a hospital bed on Saturday night, the last thing she wants to hear from detectives is that she’s possibly a victim of assault. That, and they think she's a prostitute. All Kara knows is that she's not a victim. She pushes the very notion away into a mental box with all her other bad memories that she doesn’t care to entertain.Only, this dark memory that she doesn’t recall won’t let her be.When she’s put on a high-profile case with one of the named partners at her firm, their opposing counsel throws her life off-balance. He looks at Kara like he knows a dirty secret and she doesn’t understand why.That is, until he corners her in a bar alone later that night and tries to buy her silence with a smirk on his perfect face.This is not a love story. Kara doesn’t believe in love and a man like Nicholas Havenwood-Calais is the worst sort of self-harm she can imagine. What he wants is far worse.**WARNING: This book is for sale to ADULT AUDIENCES ONLY. It contains sexually explicit scenes and graphic language which may be considered offensive to some readers.
