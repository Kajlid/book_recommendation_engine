  "title": "Fourth Day",
  "description": "The cult calling itself Fourth Day is well-funded and fiercely guards its privacy. Five years ago, Thomas Witney went in to try and get the evidence that the cult's charismatic leader, Randall Bane, was responsible for the death of Witney's son, Liam. Witney never came out. Now, ex-Special Forces soldier turned bodyguard, Charlie Fox, and her partner, Sean Meyer, have been tasked to get Witney out, whether he's willing or not. But planning and executing a clean, surgical snatch is only the beginning. Five years is a long time to be on the inside and the man who comes out has changed beyond all recognition. Can Witney be trusted when he says he now believes Bane is innocent of the crime and, if he is, who was behind his son's demise? And what happened to the safety net - the people who were supposed to extract Witney, by force if necessary, after less than a year? With Witney's ex-wife demanding answers, Charlie agrees to go undercover into Fourth Day's California stronghold. A fast covert op - there is no real danger for someone with her mind set and training. But Charlie has her own secrets, even from Sean, and she's not prepared for the lure of Randall Bane, or how easily he will pinpoint her weaknesses.",
