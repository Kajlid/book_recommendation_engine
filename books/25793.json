  "description": "How long does it take to move forward from the loss of the love of your life? An inspirational back and forth journey through the joys and hardships of life, Moving Forward, Looking Back is a week by week catalog of Beth Ann’s first year after her husband Tom’s death, written in real time. Each of the 52 chapters is broken into two parts, starting with the present and then reflecting back on the thirty-two year tumultuous relationship between two Type A people, from its rocky beginning to its heartbreaking end. Winding its way through the dusty plains of West Texas oil country, Nixon-era dirty politics, high stakes courtroom battles and medical setbacks, Moving Forward, Looking Back tells in unflinching detail Beth Ann’s efforts to withstand her black hole of grief over Tom’s death by looking back at their imperfect, passionate love story and using every tool available to move forward into her new, unasked for, present. Part love story, part lamentation, part tentative hope, Moving Forward, Looking Back will resonate with anyone who has experienced devastating loss.",
