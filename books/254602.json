  "description": "Socrates' parents have been snatched up by the dogcatcher, leaving him an orphan alone on the streets. Abandoned, hungry, and shunned by the other street dogs, Socrates wonders if he'll ever have a home of his very own. And even more importantly, he wonders if he'll ever have a friend. Then one day Socrates finds a curious object, and from that moment on, everyone looks at him quite differently. Heartwarming and uplifting, the simple text is magnificently complemented by bold, textured oil paintings in this story of the universal search for friendship and acceptance that also works to initiate discussions on topics such as loneliness and homelessness.",
