  "description": "I had a great life. Not perfect, but really good. I was happy. I had a husband and two children. But now I've got Red. He’s using me but, that’s okay, because I’m using him too, only for a different reason. He wants sex and leverage. I want numb. But then Luke came back. Don’t be stupid. Luke’s not my husband. My husband is dead, like my children. Luke came back and things have started changing. And I think, maybe, that I’m okay with change, but I’m worried it’s too late, that I might be too far down the Rabbit Hole. I’m Maggie Cartwright, and this is my story. But be warned, it may not be the happy ever after you dream of.",
