  "description": "This edition is no longer available for purchase.Sam Keller knows he'll never find the excitement he craves in Middleton, Iowa-not while he's busting his ass in nursing school and paying rent by slaving away in a pharmacy stockroom. But before his mother died, he promised her he'd grow up to be a good man, so he needs a stable career and a good husband, not a dead-end job and empty sex.Then Sam meets Mitch Tedsoe, an independent trucker who makes a delivery to a shop across the alley. Innocent flirting quickly leads to an affair, and when Mitch offers to take Sam on a road trip west, Sam jumps at the chance for adventure with his fantasy man... but Mitch also comes with a past. A threesome with the other man in Mitch's life would have been just another kinky ride, but somewhere between the Mississippi River and the Colorado Rockies, Sam falls in love.But can a relationship born out of escape and indulgence become something that lasts? Will a fantasy man be willing to settle down into reality, or is the adventure and excitement Sam finds with Mitch just another stop on a delivery man's journey? For better or for worse, eventually Sam is going to discover the answer, because no matter how far away he travels, eventually all roads lead home.",
