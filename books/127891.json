  "description": "Welcome to the world of Vampire Assassin League, where the contract is just the beginning. In VAL there’s no line a vampire won’t cross to secure a true mate…once they finally find theirs.  Set Four: Eternity contains the following novellas:  LET THEM SPEAK: New Orleans' vampire, Devereaux Castillion, likes his afterlife. He's gorgeous. Muscled. Silver-tongued. He loves flirting with the ladies, and they seem to enjoy his company just fine. Except this studio location scout, Sydney. She’s a difficult woman to sweet talk. And he wants so much more…  NOW OR FOREVER: Leonard Griggins knows vampires. As VAL's Covert Op Specialist, he's used to their idiosyncrasies. Anything they need a human for, Len is their man. Anything to do with a vampire, he's not touching. The last thing he wants is a vampire mate, regardless of how his entire body craves her…  HOLD THEIR PEACE: Thanos of Macedon is pure warrior. Victory is the only option. Mortal life in Alexander the Great’s army molded Thanos into a war machine. Centuries of afterlife haven’t done a thing to alter it. And yet, his Amazonian-tall mate thinks he’s simply her personal fantasy come to life…  DO YOU TAKE: Lucien survived the Inquisition and their medieval tortures. Not without scars. Some show. Some don’t. He likes his solitude as VAL’s resident chemist. The last thing he needs is a 21st century mate who wants to use his space and needs his help. But this partnership needs a warning label…",
