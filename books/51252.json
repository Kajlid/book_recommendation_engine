  "description": "The common theme of the 18 short stories in this book is that money - or wealth of some kind - is found, not earned. It can be as little as a single coin, or as massive as a win on the lottery. The subjects jostle for attention, from the aristocrat who made his fortune in the South Sea Bubble, to a baker struggling to turn a financial corner in the midst of a popular uprising in this present time. There are two boy heroes, and a fluffy rabbit in a children's tale. There is a nun wondering if the picture in the attic is worth anything. The tales show the best and bravest of us and those we could well do without. And then there is love - there had to be including the love of money, of course..",
