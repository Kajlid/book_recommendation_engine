  "description": "A STANDALONE FULL-LENGTH EROTIC ROMANCEEnigmatic, wealthy and wickedly handsome, Jack Willow is more than just a talented musician.He's a man with a sordid past.And a man of many dark secrets.When he meets a seemingly innocent girl by the name of Leah, he pulls her into a secret sexual world, a world that will both test their limits and bring them together.But Leah is not who she seems.Neither is Jack.WARNING: This book contains the POV of a very abrasive male protagonist. There are RAW and explicit scenes of sexual nature, including dubious consent, BDSM, etc and this book is not intended for sensitive readers. This book is ALSO very tongue-in cheek. Special Note:  The first half of this book was previously published as \"House of Sin\" by author Vince Stark. It has since been re-edited and is now combined with the second half to make Sex, Love and Rock n' Roll.",
