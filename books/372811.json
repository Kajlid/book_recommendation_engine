  "title": "Second Degree One Crazy Year At IIM-A",
  "description": "\"Second Degree\" is about life in that giant sprawling pressure-cooker called the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad. Baked by the hot Gujarat Sun, and under constant bombardment of examinations, assigment submissions, quizzes - life can be \"interesting\" for the unprepared within the hallowed hallways of the great institute. This is exactly what happens to Prashant, as he discovers that the glory of getting admission to IIM-A is short lived and quite useless, when the heat is really turned on by the faculty. He struggles with everything from Finance and Quantitative Techniques to Interpersonal Relationships in his stint on campus. He emerges from the course, richer by a few great friends, wiser by several notches and poorer by several lakhs in terms of the education loans he needs to payback. Follow the life of a twenty eight year old misfit as he stumbles from one mess to the next in the unforgiving and scorching pace at IIM-A!",
