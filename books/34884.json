  "description": "** 2011 Cybils Book Award Nominee in Poetry ** In this long-awaited sequel to her first Barking Spiders book, CJ Heck continues her journey to help children experience life through poetry with her unique blend of humor, insight and with an understanding that, like adults, children wish to make sense of the world they live in. And when it still doesn't make sense she helps them see, that's okay, too, because it doesn't always make sense. \"This is magical -- children's poetry at its very best.\"~Karen Lynn Vidra (Texas) \"CJ has the innate gift of seeing the world through the eyes of a child.\"~Jude Forese \"CJ gets right into kids' minds with her wonderful writes.\"~George Carroll \"CJ's understanding of, and ability to enter into, the mind of a child is apparent in every page of her children's poetry. Her devotion to and expertise in writing poetry is in my opinion, second to none.\"~Russell Daily (Co-founder and co-owner of FX Signalmaster LLC) \"CJ Heck is a marvelous writer with the ability to capture the imagination of children of all ages. Her work is a delightful blend of realism and whimsy that is always a pleasure to read and share with others.\"~Felix Perry (Author) \"CJ provides great entertainment to our clients and their families through her books. We share them with our real estate clients who have young children.\"~Chip & Sue Parrish (Owners, Keller Williams Classic Properties, Columbus OH) \"When I was a child I thought as a child and I spoke as a child. CJ Heck has never forgotten what it is like to be a child. She writes for children so they can understand, learn and enjoy the imagination given to them and grow.\"~John A. Roof (Artist, Author)",
