  "description": "As picturesque Longley, New York, gets ready to ring in the holiday season, caterers Bernadette and Libby Simmons are coping with their busiest time of year. If that's not enough to make them run around like crazed elves, they're recruited for a cooking show contest that pits celebrity chefs against each other--and gives rise to murder. . .Visions of sugar plums are most decidedly not dancing in Libby's head--especially since she and her sister are set to appear on the Hortense Calabash Cooking Show. The premise is to give six professional caterers random ingredients and have them whip up a holiday meal. The icing on the fruitcake is that Hortense Calabash is a grinch of year-round proportions. And the other contestants are some of the most demanding--and difficult--chefs in the business.Bernie and Libby are thrown into the mix as arguments and accusations simmer on the set. Holiday spirit has left the building--and leaves a body--when Hortense, all dressed up as Santa Claus for the opening sequence, is killed by an exploding oven.With the holiday rush in full swing and a killer still on the loose, Bernie and Libby have no choice but to wrap up the mystery before their geese are well and fully cooked. . .Includes Scrumptious Holiday Recipes for You to Try!",
