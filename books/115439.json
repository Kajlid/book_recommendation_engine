  "description": "With a single decision, Olivia Germaine’s fantasy has become a reality. Now, she’s faced with two commitments—one she must make, and one she must break. But in order to accept a love she never thought possible, Olivia will have to let go of the broken past that defines her…and of deeply rooted fears that could ruin everything. Everything is what David Dylan wants to give her, and it’s what he demands in return. He’ll do anything to prove to Olivia that despite his playboy ways, he’s worth leaving behind the stable future her husband can offer her. But even though he’s a man who always gets what he wants...this time, David may be fighting for something unattainable.",
