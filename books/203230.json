  "description": "From its earliest days to the present, Ann and Dave Finnin have been at the center of the Pagan community in Southern California. Here is the story of the groups and covens that came and went, and those that grew into thriving Traditions. In particular, this is the story of the Roebuck, how it came to be, and the influences that led to its creation. Ann writes about all the 'Big Names' in the Craft from Los Angeles and beyond from personal experience - she was there, working with and interacting with the people and the groups that are legendary in Craft circles. With foreword by Ed Fitch.",
