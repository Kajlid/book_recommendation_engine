  "description": "INTRODUCING THE ADRIAN MOLE OF BC'S WILD WEST COAST!Myles Cook, 14, is having a rough time. Not only has his mother run off with her yoga instructor, but Myles and his dad have moved to a tiny rural island on BC's west coast to live in a log cabin. Garcia Island is nothing like Myles' old home in the city; there are no stores, the WiFi is sketchy, and let's face it, the people are strange. There's Clyde, the old guy in the silver airstream trailer who carves erotic demon sculptures from wood, Daisy Archibald, the island's high priestess (whom Myles secretly believes is a hack), and Axel Jespersenâ€”a recumbent cyclist and angora goat farmer who is just plain nasty! Finally, there is Norm next door, a man who teaches Myles a little about llamas and a lot about life. Factor in a taxidermy raccoon (with superpowers), a first crush, and a whole lot of growing pains, and Myles quickly discovers that truth really is stranger than fiction. But people are full of surprises, and as the saying goes, you can't always judge a book by its cover. And sometimes, when things are out of your control, the best thing you can do is stand tall, take a deep breath, and go with the flow.",
