His kiss awakens Queen Akasha, once the Queen of the Nile, from her 6,000-year sleep. Furious about male violence, she immediately begins a wholesale slaughter of most of the world's vampires, sparing only a small group (including Lestat), who she expects will join her in a crazed crusade against male mortals.",
