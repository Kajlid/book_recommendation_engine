  "title": "Warrior Queen of Ha-Ran-Fel",
  "description": "Dead. All dead. Her father and mother. Their loyal servants. Her countrymen. Killed by her cousin Mordarius and his ilk, followers of the dark lord Ryadok. Though beaten down in the following years, hatred fuels Merewyn, keeping her alive. And then it an opportunity to escape. Aided by four strangers she doesn't entirely trust, Merewyn directs her steps to Ha-Ran-Fel, land of the savage Horse Lords, where she hopes to gain the strength to come back for her cousin's head. Once the journey is underway, however, complications arise. The band of strangers are hunting Lord Ryadok's beast, the Baugonril, a monster born of magic, created to be impervious to attack. If successfully bred, the Baugonril would mean the ruin of every nation still fighting Ryadok's yoke. Merewyn's quest must expand beyond revenge to the salvation of her world, but there is little room left in her heart for anything but hate. So she thinks. The longer she spends time with the companions, the more her suspicions turn from them to her reactions to their care and protection. Could she weaken so easily? Dogged by the sorcerer's soldiers and her own inner demons, she survives maelstroms, near starvation, and the dangerous crossing of the raging Ashgard River only to arrive at her destination, what she thinks is the end of her quest, and be treated with suspicion and condescension. She must prove her worth and fight for the right to avenge her family and the honor of saving her world as The Warrior Queen of Ha-Ran-Fel.",
