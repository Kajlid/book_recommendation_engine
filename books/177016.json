  "description": "Keys of Blood is the second book in the continuing story of Lord Lane DeLuca and his family, both mortal and immortal. This occult novel delves into Lane's past, uncovering more of his clan's history, and introduces two new types of vampires. His story is riddled with adventure, the paranormal, and mythology. It is 1730, seventeen years after we last saw Lane, Blayne, Relisys, Sacha, and the infant Rykael in the first book Strigoi. Lane DeLuca has cared for his mortal sister and the mortal child in Greece, and is now ready to bring her to meet her birth mother Relisys, who is staying with her husband Sacha in Lane's family villa in Umbria, Italy. Lane was turned into a Strigoi seventeen years previously, after the love of his life was murdered by the same vampire who made him immortal, the evil Kesar. After a long journey, Lane begins to unravel the sinister plot that changed his family's destiny. His lover's twin sister Relisys fell in love with Sacha, a count who is also Kesar's brother.",
