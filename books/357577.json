  "title": "The Gem Merchants",
  "description": "2010 IPPY Award winner for Popular Fiction Mark Branson, a young gem trader, knows that emeralds are mined, bought, stolen, coveted, and even killed for--knowledge that weighs heavy on his mind as he journeys from the sedate, gentlemanly world of London's Center for Precious Stone Trading to the deep bush of Africa in search for the glittering green gems. Mark also knows all too well that anyone caught trading emeralds can end up in jail with little or no recourse to any embassy . . . When he's given an emerald by an African mine owner, he has to quickly learn whom to trust, whom to bribe, and whom to avoid completely. In a world where jewels are expensive and life is expendable, Mark must navigate hard-drinking Irish missionaries, double-dealing Indian traders, hostile Afrikaners, and sex-starved girls, not to mention the trigger-happy Zambian police. After experiencing The Gem Merchants , readers will never look at an emerald the same way again.",
