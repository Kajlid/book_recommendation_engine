  "description": "Keeping the identity of your crush a secret is hard enough work in the gossip mill of a hospital. But when your crush happens to be your boss - and the Chief of Staff - it's even harder to keep a lid on things...from the gossip mill and from the man himself. Rookie nurse Brynn has managed to separate her personal and professional lives, despite her smoldering desire for the handsome Dr. Hitchens...until now. When news goes public that the good doctor has put himself up for bid at the hospital's annual Christmas Charity Ball auction, Brynn finds herself in an impossible situation. The harder she tries to straddle the line between work and play, the farther she falls for Sam Hitchens...and the more complicated things become every day they report to work, as the big night draws ever nearer... HIS BIDDING is the start of Ella Blythe's new Erotic Romance/New Adult serial, \"The Best Medicine.\" Introduce yourselves to the characters at Mercy Hospital, and settle in for the deliciously slow burn, inevitably building toward an explosive chain of events that will change both Brynn's and Dr. Hitchens's lives forever.",
