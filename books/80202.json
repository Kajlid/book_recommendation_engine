Her first acquaintance is Becky, an ex-Amish teenager looking for a new home.While driving Chloe’s car, Becky collides with a buggy, killing an Amish elder. But what looks like an accident is soon labeled murder when police discover the car’s cut brake line.Now, Chloe must take on the role of amateur sleuth to discover who the real intended victim was before the murderer makes a second attempt.
