  "description": "Sometimes we meet people but not to share the rest of our lives with them, but merely for them to guide us onto a different path.Set in London and Dublin we follow the life of Beth, a young mother of two who is married to Shane, an actor whose work requires him to be in Los Angeles. When Beth meets Daniel, a fun-loving, spontaneous man from Ireland, she realises how much joy and passion are missing from her marriage, and consequently her life. Beth is torn between her marriage to Shane and her love for this Irish charmer.",
