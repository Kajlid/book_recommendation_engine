  "description": "Like Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad and Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Kevin Clouther's Maximum Speed moves across time and point of view to dramatize youth's aftershocks. The unifying presence in three characters' lives is Billy, an apprentice drug dealer in South Florida. His improbable appearance twenty years after his death reconnects Nick, Andrea, and Jim with each other and with the shared secret of their past.",
