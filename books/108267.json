Moving from one continent to another every other year helps a teenage girl learn 4 different languages in record time. But it’s also killing her social life. And when a totally hot guy in her new hometown gives her hell, because she’s the cousin of a girl he once dated and who then spurned him, the prospect of the coming school year makes Sam want to call it quits. There’s just one thing even more unnerving than all that put together. For some strange reason, she can’t seem to stop daydreaming about this impossible guy.",
