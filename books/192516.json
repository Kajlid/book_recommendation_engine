  "title": "Brothers",
  "description": "Mike witnesses the unthinkable when he was six years old: the sight of his dead brother, cold and pale, already being feasted on by vermin—a possum. The scene haunts him into adulthood, and, although married with his own children, it eats into his mind and dreams. But there is another story, another side, and the telling is bone-chilling.Burris’s first published novel is a clever construct of two stories told in alternating chapters. The first is the journal documenting a young boy's descent into terrifying darkness and the sacrifices of those who put their lives on the line to save him. The second is an unfolding present day tale of a man who finds he must face the same horrors to protect those he loves.",
