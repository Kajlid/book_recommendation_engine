  "description": "\"I knew there were problems in our marriage. We hardly spoke anymore, other than to argue, and I often volunteered for all the overtime work my boss could throw my direction to help keep me out of the house. Our failing relationship was a two way thing. I do love her though. It's just...We're going through a rough patch at the moment. I figured every couple has them. I decided to use my overtime money to take her on holiday. Just the two of us. Somewhere hot and exotic. Somewhere we could rediscover our love for each other. I just never knew she had already moved on. I never knew about him. Not until a friend told me...I don't know if I can win her back. I don't know if I want to either. First things first, though...I need to go and drag her away from his house.\"* * * * *A Short Story of love and betrayal from Matt Shaw - the author of 'Buried', 'Smile' and 'The Peter Chronicles'.",
