  "description": "I’ve never believed in fate, until her.OmenI met her on a whim, paid a hell of a lot just to get access to the second floor in Night’s Bliss. I came down for work with the club, but I got more than I bargained for. Instead, I met a kinky brat. A woman I haven’t been able to get out of my mind, no matter who I’ve had under me.Gemini.The woman is a physical piece of art. Tattoos marking almost every inch of her body. Every tattoo with a meaning, and when she explained them to me her eyes lit up with excitement, but I didn’t miss what was underneath the ink.Scars.In the forms of charred flesh, deep impacts, and much more.Whatever she’s survived, it was damning.It’s been months and I still haven’t thought about another. Luckily for me, I have a reason to go down to Virginia and check in again. I know the woman’s been through the darkness, but it’s something I know all too well.",
