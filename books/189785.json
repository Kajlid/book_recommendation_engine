  "description": "It was the end of summer party and Holden just wanted to have some fun with his buddies Nate and Danny. But on the way home, they cover up an accident. Or so they thought. Weeks later, they all receive haunting threats from an anonymous source who intends to make them pay. Holden distracts himself by striking up a friendship that could prove treacherous to his perfect academic record if he isn’t careful… Danny may be the smartest dealer on campus but with the latest OD on Adderall, the principal is cracking down—and he’s not the only one watching Danny’s every move. Nate just wants to be a Navy man. It doesn’t matter that his heart flutters for Alec every time he walks in a room—even if he’s got a girlfriend. What will it take to keep Holden, Danny, and Nate’s secrets in the dark? Who’s demented enough to want to see them harmed, frightened, or worse?",
