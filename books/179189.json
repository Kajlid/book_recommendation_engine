  "description": "September 1942. The few surviving members of the Sturmpionierbataillon deployed in North Africa are have now assigned to the eastern front. Throughout the crucial fight for Stalingrad, a battle which claimed two million victims, human tolerance is tested beyond all limits. There is trench warfare, hand-to-hand combat for every single building, hunger and cold. Madness becomes the last place of refuge before deathâ€¦ Under these conditions, young lieutenant von Wetzland is forced to accept that he cannot possibly keep up even the most basic of moral standards. And that applies to himself, as well as to his men.",
