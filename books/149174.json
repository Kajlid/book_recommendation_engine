  "title": "My Other Ex: Women's True Stories of Losing and Leaving Friends",
  "description": "Have you ever lost a friend? Was that loss in some ways more painful than the end of a love affair?Womenâ€™s friendships so often come to a crossroads at which time two women can try to hold on to the friendship, staying connected, or the friends can take two completely separate paths without each other.Many of the essays in this book are about this moment in time, when both rupture and new beginnings are possible. There are so many ways that friendships can end, and this book describes 35 of them, from talented and accomplished contributors. At the heart of each essay is the recognition from each writer that she has lost something very real and very personal, a connection that will never be forgotten.",
