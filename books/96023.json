  "description": "Having survived the Kintala and liberated her father, Camryn knows two things: 1) her feelings about Ohar or Dagger can't be trusted; and 2) her newly found magical powers are darn scary and out of control. Though she has learned how to manage when she changes into other people, now she has the added burden of controlling her magic before she kills someone by accident.The first step is to bond with the most powerful creature in the universe, a thunder dragon. They are the only ones who can take her to the void. They are the only ones who can answer her questions about her gifts. They are the only ones who understand the burdens of life and death--of balance and control. The choosing is never easy, and only the worthy are chosen.Camryn is committed to stopping the lichen mutations that are killing the Forest People. She knows that her gift as a Chameleon will allow her to discover why the Agnoses experiments are being escalated and how they use the lichen to enhance powers of both Forest People and Agnoses.In her first battle of control, Camryn comes face-to-face with her own inner demons. What price is she willing to pay in order to save the Forest People? Camryn can see the war coming. Her gifts have the power to save both worlds, but in the process she may end up destroying everyone and everything she loves.",
