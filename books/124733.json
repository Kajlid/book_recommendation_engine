  "description": "All Callista Ramirez wanted to do on her two week Thanksgiving break was sleep in and read a good book. Her twin sister Clara had other ideas. An accident on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, causes Clara to spend 2.9 million dollars on a diamond ring. In a panic she finds an ad for a search in Muzo, Colombia for the last uncut emerald on Earth. The prize being 3 million dollars, Clara drags Callista and her best friend Odessa all the way to Colombia for the search. When they get there it’s anything but expected. Eli Wrie, the one who conducted the search, assigns his son, Easton to be their guide around town. Easton acts very strange and secretive around the girls, and it leaves Callista with a feeling of dread in her stomach. Odessa gets an overwhelming sense of déjà vu wherever she goes and has dreams of a mysterious savior. But when they all finally get into the mines to search, Odessa’s dreams come true, and she realizes that everyone that they've met in Colombia has been lying to them about their identities. When Callista and Clara finally find the Emerald they find out that there’s a reason that no one has gotten the emerald out and why. Sacrifices must be made, and the sisters have to work together to save everyone.",
