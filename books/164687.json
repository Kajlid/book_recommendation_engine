  "description": "At 30, Paula, a technician at a radio station, feels a bit ridiculous for having a big crush on Dr. Christine Graham, host of the late-night radio show The Midnight Couch. Every night when midnight approaches, she vows that this will be the day when she asks Christine on a date—only to chicken out every time. But when Christine hosts a special show about revealing secret love on Valentine’s Day, Paula suddenly finds herself on The Midnight Couch.",
