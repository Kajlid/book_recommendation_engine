  "description": "Veronica (Ronnie) Martin wasn’t planning on helping a stranded motorist on her way out of Snow Valley. But, as one of the small town’s two mechanics, she couldn’t leave a neighbor stranded. When that neighbor turns out to be Grady Owens, her older brother’s best friend and business partner on his way into town for a short visit. Ronnie’s long-time crush waves her over to the side of the road. Neither one of the small business owners has been back to Snow Valley in years. After a few minutes of flirting, Grady asks her out. Ronnie is ecstatic, until she realizes he doesn’t recognize her. She accepts his invitation, but when he finds out who she is and tries to cancel, she makes a one-date deal.  Grady Owens has been burning the candle at both ends for years to get a trucking business off the ground. He’s worn out and isolated by the long hours and lonely nights. Which is probably why he agreed to a one-date deal with Ronnie. But when he starts seeing her as more than his best friend’s little sister, he’s torn between loyalty to his business partner and the woman his heart says is his perfect match.",
