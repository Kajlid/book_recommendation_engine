  "title": "The Libertines Bound Together: The Definitive Story of Peter Doherty and Carl Barat and How They Changed British Music",
  "description": "In the short time they existed, the indie rock band The Libertines kick-started a music Renaissance. Their grungy rock sound and such stunts as giving away albums for free erased the barrier with fans and inspired thousands. Yet for all their musical acumen, the band made the most headlines for their apparent “live fast, die young” lifestyle and for lead man Pete Doherty’s drug addictions and ongoing relationship with fashion model Kate Moss. This insightful new look at The Libertines goes behind the headlines to document the band’s true history, tracing its extraordinary highs and lows through the breakup and fallout between Doherty and the rest of the group. Lushly illustrated with rare photos, this is the authentic story of the band that defined a generation.",
