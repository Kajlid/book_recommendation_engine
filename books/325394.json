  "description": "Seeing through the eyes of others brings new perspective on the place we call home. In Land of Many Shores, writers share their essays about life in Newfoundland and Labrador from often-neglected viewpoints. In this collection, Indigenous people, cultural minorities, LGBTQ+, people living with mental or physical disabilities and other undervalued and hidden voices are coming to the forefront, with personal, poignant, celebratory and critical visions of the land we live on.From workers in the sex industry to non-Christian faithful, from the descendants of settlers from other lands to the Indigenous people of this land, the variety of experience against the backdrop of Newfoundland and Labrador provides food for thought--and celebration of diversity.",
