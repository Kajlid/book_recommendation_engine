She has left her hectic city life for a quieter one, where she can heal her broken heart, while taking care of her comatose patient. But things are not quite as idyllic as she had imagined. Nothing turns out to be as it seems. Tensions grow at her arrival at Deer Hollow, and when she finds herself enmeshed in danger, she becomes determined to find out why someone does not want her there.
