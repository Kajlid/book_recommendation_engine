  "description": "A Flower in the Heart of the Painting is a collection of short stories by award-winning author Amy Krohn. Set almost exclusively in the rural heart of the Midwest, this book is populated by a cast of quiet characters whose land and interior lives are brought into full relief. Like Tolstoi and Cather, Krohn draws us into unassuming, ordinary dramas in order to reveal that, in spite of our best efforts to live compartmentalized, comfortable lives loosened from the transcendent, everything is at stake.The heart of the collection is \"A Portrait of Happiness and Love,\" a hundred page novella modeled after Tolstoi's short novel Family Happiness. In both the former and the latter, idealized marriages are tested, drained of false romanticism but, as Krohn's narrator notes, \"What love we shared had suffered blows, and yet, bent and wounded, it grew upward, fiercer than before.\"",
