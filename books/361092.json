  "description": "Back Cover TextTo Chicago Trib reporter Miles Fischer, it was just another rape and murder trial, until the two convicted felons are found dead in the muddy parking lot of a rundown bar just days after their surprising acquittal. His curiosity turns to suspicion after searching the archives where he discovers two more cases similar to the one in Tweeksbury. Is it a coincidence? Miles doesnâ€™t think so. In fact, he believes he knows who the killer is after a chance encounter. Miles draws the ire of the FBI and becomes tight-lipped when confronted to disclose what he knows. He wants the story and the glory that goes with it, and believes he is the only one who can identify the killer. He sets his sights on Seattle and creates a game of cat-and-mouse with the FBI and an ex-cop turned private investigator. What he and the private investigator don't realize is just how deadly this game is about to become.Don't forget to view the book trailer.The manuscript which created this novel uses the Chicago style of writing, which is \"one of the most widely used and respected style guides in the United States,\" and is considered the de facto guide for American English style, grammer, and punctuation. It's been stated in a recent review that there are missing hyphens and wrongly placed apostrophes when in fact these are part of the Chicago style. You can read my review on his website under reviews, editor.Jessica",
