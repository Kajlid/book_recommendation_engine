  "title": "Image Yourself: Clarity, Release and Connection",
  "description": "IMAGE YOURSELF is the logical continuation of Marilyn Holzmannâ€™s previous main book CREATION FORMULA and challenges the reader to advance further on the path to self-awareness. The information stands on its own without frills or story-telling and, combined with the powerful mantras by Tirza Schaefer at the end of each chapter, makes it not only an efficient, but highly profound, challenging and life-changing read. Thus, IMAGE YOURSELF is a distillation in deep wisdom, holding a mirror before our eyes from which there is no escape as we are confronted with our innermost being. The letters to the reader at the end of the book by Holzmann and Schaefer are deeply personal messages that are heart-touching and encouraging in their authenticity and loving intent. This book is nothing short of a revolution in spiritual literature.",
