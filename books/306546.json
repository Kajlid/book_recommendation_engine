  "description": "I close my long fingers around her delicate ankle, “You need to get a life, Sabrina.”\n\n\n\n Darren: I like control, sue me. In fact, don’t, it usually works the other way around.I have to say, my life is on tracks:✓ I make decent money with a job I love,✓ my house looks good✓ I have spare to help Ma.\n Well, the pink-haired devil begs to differ.  \n My assistant, Sabrina Rubio, (a.k.a., the bane of my existence) has an opinion about everything, particularly about my dating life. She thinks I can fall in love just like those men in the romance books she devours. But that’s one more thing we have to disagree.Sabrina can call me a grumpy boss as much as she likes. There will be no office flirting going on at number 34, Main Street - Yellow Meadows. Between her steamy romance books and her crass humour, I’m pretty sure her main goal is to drive me insane.\n\n  Sabrina: His lips curls inside his mouth, nostrils flare. Janey, I made him angry, didn’t I?Oops.\n\n\n\n*This sweet romantic comedy is an absolute treat for fans of Sally Thorne’s THE HATING GAME, Jo Watson's LOVE TO HATE YOU or Lucy Score’s BY A THREAD.\n\n\nOr for anyone who’s looking for a spicy new book, an opinionated heroine, a grumpy and protective hero. Fighting as foreplay and the beloved enemy to lovers trope.",
