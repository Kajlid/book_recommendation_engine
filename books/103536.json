  "description": "What a prince wants…he takes. \n\nSoulgirls, Book 3\nWho can blame Richard for his half-century-long bad mood? For fifty years he’s been waiting for his bride to get over the spat that sent her storming away from the safety of his territory. For fifty years, he’s missed everything about her—even her whimsical challenges to his authority. It’s time for her to come home, but when he gets a lead on her whereabouts, he’s stunned. She’s dancing in a glitzy, gaudy Las Vegas show. And her memory of him has been wiped clean. Kiki finally has the opportunity to headline at the Arcana Royale, but she’s not sure she’s happy about it. Especially when a dark, handsome stranger arouses forbidden passions from deep inside the fog of her lost past. Richard has been granted only three days in hostile territory to free his Kiki from the curse binding her mind. Only one problem. When Kiki remembers Richard, she may not forgive him, but if she never remembers, she’ll never be free.  Contains an arrogant-as-hell vampire prince who will stop at nothing to get the girl he loves, an unpredictable showgirl who loves to party, and scorching sex that drives them both wild.",
