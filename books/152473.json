When famous explorer Amos Tence* shows up at his front door, life gets considerably more exciting. Before long, he's speeding off in a taxi to the mountains of Chilistan in search of the hairiest, most mysterious monster ever known - an ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN! A fantastically funny short story from the collection Dragons at Crumbling Castle. [*Yes, that Amos Tence - the same man who punted from Brighton to Bombay in the bath. It's true.]",
