  "description": "This book contains communications from a young musician named Sigwart to his sister after his death in 1915. After experiencing an inner unrest leading to the feeling that her brother was trying to contact her, she gradually achieved conscious contact with him, receiving the remarkable messages included here, messages that she shared with Rudolf Steiner. She relates his “For an hour and three quarters, he scrutinized page after page in my presence; he cast light on some, for me, incomprehensible passages, explained what Sigwart meant by them, and asked me questions. Many times, Rudolf Steiner nodded and exclaimed approvingly, ‘Very well described! Well expressed! Characterized exactly! Yes, those musical performances, they are realities!’ I waited in vain for the negation of any of the messages; none came! As a parting word, Dr. Steiner said, ‘Yes, these are exceptionally clear, absolutely authentic communications from the spiritual world. I see no reason for dissuading you from listening to them further.’ He added that transmissions of this kind are very rare.” Containing prayers, meditations, insights, advice, and a view of the world born aloft by love, it will comfort, enlighten, and speak to hearts of all persuasions.",
