  "description": "The idea of permanent chastity takes on a new meaning for one middle-aged gay man from Atlanta, Georgia. A casual kink leads to a year-long pursuit to learn what it means to truly serve as a subordinate for a dominant. His sexual services will be on full display as he learns to endure the expectations of his trainer and contemplates the idea that he may never see himself out of chastity again. What new relationships will he forge and will he be successful in achieving the permanent collar of a true master? Set in the years 2015 and 2016, Southern Chastity is loosely based on the real life experiences of the author who goes by the pseudonym L. D. Cub.",
