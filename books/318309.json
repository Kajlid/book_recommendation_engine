  "description": "Hughes's last collection of poems commemorates the experience of Black Americans in a voice that no reader could fail to hear—the last testament of a great American writer who grappled fearlessly and artfully with the most compelling issues of his time.“Langston Hughes is a titanic figure in 20th-century American literature ... a powerful interpreter of the American experience.” — The Philadelphia InquirerFrom the publication of his first book in 1926, Langston Hughes was America's acknowledged poet of color. Here, Hughes's voice—sometimes ironic, sometimes bitter, always powerful—is more pointed than ever before, as he explicitly addresses the racial politics of the sixties in such pieces as \"Prime,\" \"Motto,\" \"Dream Deferred,\" \"Frederick 1817-1895,\" \"Still Here,\" \"Birmingham Sunday.\" \" History,\" \"Slave,\" \"Warning,\" and \"Daybreak in Alabama.\"",
