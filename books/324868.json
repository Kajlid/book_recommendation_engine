Trying to explain to their mothers where they've been all day is a bit more tricky.Navigating the complexities of seventh-grade can be hard, but luckily best friends, Marcy and Sara, have each other to help along the way. After a long day of classes and snide remarks from Sara’s ex-bff, Brittany, nothing seems better than heading to their secret hideout. Safe and alone, they imagine magical worlds and talk about the beings that might live in such fantastical places. But they don’t have to play make-believe for long! Marcy notices a perfectly round, black spot on her left forearm one morning after waking up from a terrifying dream. With Sara’s help, they discover that the strange new mole is really a magic portal. Now, with a simple “I wish,” they can travel anywhere.Sneaking out of the house is just the beginning. After trips to Machu Pichu and Hawai’i, Earth isn’t enough. They decide it’s time to put their dreams to the test and meet the magical creatures they have always hoped they would. Marcy and Sara leave this universe entirely.The only problem is, once they start adventuring around this new planet, with two suns and three moons in the sky, the portal stops working! All of the sudden, Marcy and Sara start to wonder where exactly this magic mole came from. Maybe it isn’t the answer to all of their dreams because it keeps leading them into their worst nightmares.",
