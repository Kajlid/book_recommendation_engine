  "description": "After the devastating Dark Destruction, peace came to Ay in the form of a single man, Kai Canarbis. However, some didn’t welcome peace and, for six-and-ten winters, Bran, the Raven Lord of Life and Death, has waged an unconscionable war against Kai's empire of righteousness. After the imperial heirs are abducted, a diabolical trap is set for Kai and sprung. Bran delights in sabotaging the empire’s guardians and condemning the realm, until a long absent hero returns in all force, to oppose him with incredible power akin to a god’s. It might be too late though, for with the empire smarting from incessant war and ill prepared to defend herself, and the realm responding furiously to Kai’s sore absence, a quick conquest seems inevitable. With too many refugees flooding High Infinity, when the spells which created her begin to break down, a desperate search for Ay’s strongest guardian unveils the distressing truth on his fate.",
