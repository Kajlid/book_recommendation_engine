  "description": "The third book in the Savage Series...They say all is fair in love and war, but I really don’t give a damn about fair. In fact, when protecting those I love, fair is the last thing on my mind. Because they also say all is fair in love and war. Now that I’m back in Candace’s life, those who have used her to try to control me, may well put up a final fight, but they will not win. They will lose and badly.",
