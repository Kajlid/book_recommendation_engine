  "description": "I, Rose Hawthorne, have crap taste in men.  But, who could blame me, really?  When the stories of how your dad and uncles raised hell before settling down are legendary, it was all too easy to see Prince Charming everywhere, believing that if a man loved me enough, heâ€™d change.  What a load of garbage.  I was tired of the game, almost as tired as I was of being the only single adult at every family barbecue.  But you know what they say, the moment you stop looking, the right one finds you.",
