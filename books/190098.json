  "title": "The New Machiavelli: The Art of Politics in Business",
  "description": "Ignore the latest buzz about the kinder, gentler world of new age, team-based management. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and the sooner you realize it, the better. The New Machiavelli mines Machiavelli's The Prince for the timeless rules and stratagems that can help today's business rulers survive and prosper in the jungle of greed and treachery that is commerce. Alistair McAlpine enriches Machiavelli's text with scenarios from modern business, offering keen new insight into what motivates people. You'll learn the reasons why:* Loyalty is not a reliable factor in the workplace* Great power is held by the \"little people\" in a business* It is better to spread power than to centralize it* You should never believe your own publicityFail to read it at your peril.\"For most of my lifetime politicians have been trying to tell businessmen how to go about their tasks ... Both groups, however, will enjoy this shrewd commentary on Machiavelli's timeless principles of skullduggery.\"-Margaret Thatcher\"Anyone working in corporate America who doesn't find, read, and master Alistair McAlpine's amazing new guidebook to the art of politics in business may soon find themselves self-employed.\" -Charles Saatchi, Partner, M&C Saatchi\"Written in a style, like Machiavelli's own, at once didactic and charming... A work which is a standing satirical reproof to the various management manuals which promise corporate success.\"-Times Literary Supplement",
