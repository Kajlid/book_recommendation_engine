  "description": "Fans of Fangirl and Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda will love this book! Paige has always been scared to be herself. The real Paige- the nerdy Paige- who just wants to have real friends, talk about anime, lose her virginity, and share her art- doesn’t exist at school or to her friends. Only quiet Paige does. Her new school in Bowden is full of opportunity. There’s Revolution Recognition where she can share her art. There’s confident and enigmatic Shawn who she just feels drawn to. The anime club poster is only icing on the cake. She sees her chance! If only she can reach out and take it. And the cute boy she keeps running into is definitely on her radar. Insightful, bold, relatable, and raw. This twenty-first century, coming-of-age story brilliantly explores the anxiety of standing out and the thrill of fearlessness. Featuring an aromantic protagonist! No romance here!",
