One straight out of a sci-fi flick. But when the sexy hero who saves her needs a little rescue of his own, Shayla can’t kick him out. Especially after he reveals he’s from the future, and his ride home has been stolen. How’s a girl supposed to say no to that line? Creed Donovan, Sustain drug enforcer for the Federation of Americas, is on the trail of a fugitive. The chase through time has landed him in the year 2015. More than six hundred years into the past.

Without the libido-inhibiting drug, Creed’s long repressed arousal will soon stir, untethering carnal urges he’s never experienced. Stuck with a beautiful new roommate and on the verge of detox, he struggles to stifle the raging desire in his blood. For her sake and his.",
