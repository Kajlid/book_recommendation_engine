  "description": "No. 1 Satire on Amazon (Top 100 Free Books in Kindle Store – April 10 –11, 2013 and again on July 26 - 27, 2013).If you enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, Catch-22, Chuck Palahniuk, the Illuminatus trilogy or the Fu Manchu novels of Sax Rohmer, you might enjoy THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD - a post-modern comic fantasy that defies categorization. Now only $0.99. The year is 1978. China is an isolated empire of conspiracy, deception and delusion. From Radio Beijing comes the astonishing announcement: China will unilaterally disarm. Is this a Great Leap Forward for mankind—or a plot to take over the world?Into this surreal landscape steps Number Five, a master spy of undisclosed nationality. What he finds in China is so shocking, so strange, so far beyond the usual categories of fact or fiction, that the story of his mission must be passed off as fantasy for the next thirty-five years. It’s as if Kafka, Borges and Wittgenstein, after binging on Fu Manchu novels and the Illuminatus trilogy, had decided to write a spy novel, with a little help from Lewis Carroll. Die-hard fans of thrillers and spy novels beware: Don’t buy this book unless you’re prepared to suspend your expectations in favor of a story that’s funny, literary, and trans-genre’d!",
