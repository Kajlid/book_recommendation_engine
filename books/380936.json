  "description": "High school is tough enough without throwing a hijab into the mix... What's my class going to say on Monday when I walk in wearing a muslim veil for the first time? Oh boy, wil they freak out. Shawling up? It would be easier to wlk in naked. What am I doing being all holy and stuff? Covering my hair will officially label me the biggest loser of all time. And what will Adam say? Amal's decision to wear the hijab full-time takes a lot of guts. Can she cope with the prejudice, keep her friends and still attract the cutest boy in school?",
