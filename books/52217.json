But the little girl with the big sword can't help but attract attention. Perhaps it is because of the secret she carries--a powerful secret about her own astonishing identity.

She trusts no one--least of all Roder. Yet she finds herself strangely drawn to him. Finally, marooned on a planet of untamed magic, with their enemies one step behind, there is only one chance left. The renegades must somehow harness enough magic to move an entire world--before Enforcement wipes it out altogether.Only Malka has the power. But will she pay the terrifying price?",
