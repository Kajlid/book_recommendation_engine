  "description": "Trip is the last of the Coulter sons to find love. He’s smart…he’s handsome…he’s a shadow op. He’s a man with all the skills a spy needs. But when it comes to relationships, he misses the target. Jane is sweet…she’s beautiful…she’s a cleaning lady. She’s a woman with all the skills a lady needs to sweep a man’s heart right into her hands. She may be wanted for murder, but she has her sights set on Trip. Trip sees her every day, but he never really sees her at all until fate and his bitchy girlfriend bring them together. Nothing about Olivia is average. Not her looks, her body, nor her obnoxiousness. When Olivia turns her full fury on Jane, it’s Trip to the emotional rescue. For him, it’s an opportunity to make amends. For Jane, it’s an opportunity to make dreams come true…to make reality as it was intended to be.",
