  "description": "After a recent death leaves her with no remaining family, Myra Sommers, a young copy editor living in Philadelphia, inherits her childhood home in Nyssa, Oregon. When a painful revelation concerning her ex-boyfriend, Trent, is revealed, she makes the tough decision to move back to her small hometown to heal and regroup there.Myra parts ways with her only friend, Susie O’Connor, a loyal, slightly crazed woman. In Nyssa, Myra finds little immediate comfort in her “new” home which is literally falling apart around her. She sinks into a deep depression, exacerbated by her feelings of loneliness and isolation in the small town. Jim, Myra’s neighbor, gives her the name of a local contractor, Dylan Lawson, who has done work for him in the past. Myra is astounded by the man’s gruff, surly demeanor, but she trusts Jim and there are few other options in the small town. Despite Dylan’s rough edges, Myra - and every other woman in the small town it seems - finds the scowling man with unkempt hair and scruffy beard to be undeniably attractive.Dylan is there for one thing: to get the job done and move on. Withdrawn and bitter, his past demons have calloused him and left him barely resembling the man he used to be. Having no interest in starting a relationship, Dylan fights against the draw he feels towards the quiet, lonely woman with the sad, dark eyes.A slow but reluctant friendship develops between the pair, followed by romantic feelings which neither of them can deny. But will Dylan’s secrets and Myra’s past experiences tear them apart before they can even begin? Will they be able to move beyond their despair and open their hearts to love?",
