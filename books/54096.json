  "description": "APPEALING TO EVERY TASTE AND TYPE OF SEXUAL ARRANGEMENT, NOTHING IS TABOO AND ANYTHING GOES IN THIS CUTTING-EDGE COLLECTION EDITED BY SUSIE BRIGHT -- AMERICA'S TASTEMAKER OF EROTICA\n Book Magazine called her \"America's ranking connoisseur of sex, porn, and freedom of physical expression.\" Tristan Taormino exalted, \"The absolute bomb\" in The Village Voice. More discerning than any judge and far ahead of the curve, Susie Bright plucks the best stories from every genre to create her much-anticipated annual collection.  In The Best American Erotica 2004, Broadway superstar Alan Cumming tells of the deep knowing offered by one stranger to another after casual sex; in science fiction hotshot Geoffrey Landis's bawdy fairy tale, we learn about the very first penis; Touré's breathless prose poem sets us up with an evening's worth of erotic visitors; and in Jerry Stahl's story, a man recalls his boyhood fascination with his mother's friends and their elaborate undergarments.  Always taking her readers to undiscovered places, Bright never disappoints in giving them an uninhibited, something-for-everyone collection of the year's most divine erotica.
