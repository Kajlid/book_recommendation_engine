  "description": "A FLORIDA KEYS DOUBLE SHOT (Box Set) – two bestselling novels by Florida author Tom Winton. A SECOND CHANCE IN PARADISE After New York salesman Sonny Raines loses his job and his wife on the same day he’s had it. With little in his pocket and the weight of the world on his mind, he soon drives his aging van to the Florida Keys. Although he only hopes to find peace and serenity that doesn’t happen. He’s not long in the land of warm sunshine and tropical breezes before he gets involved in a romance he’s not ready for. But that’s not all. He also finds himself face to face with danger—the worst kind of evil, sinister, you-better-run-for-your-life danger. FOUR DAYS WITH HEMINGWAY’S GHOST After big-time Hemingway fan Jack Phelan falls into a coma following an accident, he somehow finds himself in Key West, Florida, literally rubbing shoulders with his longtime hero. The legendary author has been sent down by “The Main Man in the clouds” to see if Jack has what it takes to write a book for Him. And though Hemingway knows that his findings may very well determine whether Jack lives or dies, he doesn’t have a clue that the book is going to be about him. Over the next four days, Jack and Hem not only knock around Key West but they also travel to some more of the legendary author’s old haunts. Together the two meet up with many of Hemingway’s long gone friends and have some rollicking good times. But during their journey they are also forced to go nose to nose with some things that are not at all fun and games. They both face highly-emotional tests of strength as well. But wait. That’s not all. After their time together ends is when things really get out of hand.",
