  "description": "When the influential, if not well-liked, owner of an art gallery and chairwoman of the Art Council, Elizabeth Rhodes, is found murdered at Greene Fields Gardening Center the crime puts everyone who works there under suspicion. The last thing Leo Solomon wants to do after returning to his hometown is arrest the woman he loves or her cousin, but all the evidence keeps pointing to it being an inside job. Why would anyone commit a crime and then phone 911? Why is everyone so interested in the missing black book last seen in the victim's possession? Rumors swirl as everyone in town decides to weigh in on who they think killed Elizabeth and why. Penelope refuses to sit by and let the people she loves or her family business be put through the mud to protect a killer. Can Penelope and Leo get to the bottom of the crime before anyone else gets hurt?",
