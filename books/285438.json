  "description": "Forget everything you think you know about leadership, its time for a new lesson. Disabled Leadership is a new leadership theory that inspires everyone, from disabled veterans to senior executives, to build their leadership from a foundation of resilience. Disabled Leadership is a persons ability to gain self-awareness of their greatest weakness, and develop it into a platform to conceive, believe, and achieve life goals through empowerment built from a foundation of resilience. Fifty-four million Americans suffer from diagnosed disabilities. Tom is one of them. During the course of his twenty-year career, he has been blessed with the opportunity to be inspired by Disabled Leaders, both in the operational environment and in the classroom. Over the past several years Dr. Wiggins has conceptualized what he refers to as “Disabled Leadership”. This concept proves how Disabled Leaders demonstrate leadership traits better than the general population. Disabled Leadership also serves to teach disabled leaders how they may emulate many fundamental characteristics to improve their leadership abilities. Disabled Leadership provides readers with self awareness, teaches leaders how to build platforms for success, and investigates the key traits of Disabled Desire, Dedication, and Discipline. Dr. Wiggins shares personal stories and others inspirations in detailing his theory. Disabled Leadership covers a wide range of disabilities from deafness to blindness and from autism to cerebral palsy. Dr. Wiggins invites leaders to conceive, believe, and achieve any aspiration.",
