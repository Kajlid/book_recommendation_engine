  "description": "When Charlotte escapes her abusive relationship, she flees in the middle of the night with nothing but the cash in her pocket, and the paper map leading her north to Alaska. She sheds her old self along the way―dying her hair, scrubbing off her fake California tan, pawning all the jewelry her ex, Nate, bought her over the years. None of it was worth anything if she couldn’t stay alive.Alone in the Alaskan forest, Charlotte feels safe at last. Even if she’s lost. Even if she’s only got a burner phone that lost its last bar miles ago, and even if she missed her turn and can’t find the cabin she was promised by a friend. Tucked into a sleeping bag in the backseat of “Ted”―her ancient 4-Runner―she’s finally living life on her own terms.But that feeling is short-lived. In the middle of the woods, Charlotte’s attacked, brutally, and unforgivingly―and a lone wolf bites her leg. And it’s a bite that will change her life forever.",
