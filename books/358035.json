  "description": "What was considered courteous table manner in Medieval England? Would children delight in playing hide-and-seek, follow-the-leader, and blind mans bluff? Harkening back to a time when men wore close-fitting bonnets tied under the chin and women adorned themselves with purses suspended from their belts with small daggers attached to the outside, Pleasures & Pastimes in Medieval England takes an enlightening look at how people from all classes of medieval society enjoyed themselves. Despite presumptions to the contrary, the daily life of men and women in late medieval England was not entirely one of toil. Author Compton Reeves presents a fascinating and highly readable survey of the entertainments and pursuits with which people of the time filled their leisure hours. From the rough and tumble activities of wrestling and jousting to the more sedate pastimes of chess and cards, from gardening to prostitution, and from cock-fighting to religious festivals Reeves describes with entertaining detail activities which remain popular today, though often in different guises. With its many beautifully reproduced illustrations, Pleasures & Pastimes in Medieval England offers a sumptuous overview of the delights of medieval life.",
