  "description": "Falling in love is a beautiful thing. Unless you fall for the wrong person. Finally settled after a tragedy-laden life, 24-year-old Caleb has found security in his faith, his friends, and his career. It’s the life he’s always wanted—simple, predictable, and safe. Enter Kate Hawkins, the attractive 21-year-old stranger he rescues from a bar fight who has an odd affinity for the color pink and a unique sense of humor. It doesn’t take long to realize their connection is intense, but after only a handful of dates, a shocking revelation surfaces. Lines are drawn, sides are taken, and loyalties are decided as their newfound relationship is brought to a sudden halt. But unlike most couples who split, avoiding each other is impossible. As daily interactions become unbearable, one realization becomes they’ve both fallen hard for the absolute wrong person, which leaves both scrambling for a way to make it right.",
