  "description": "I spend my life in the fast lane, and I like it that way.One night stands are waiting for me at the finish line. I don’t lose. I don’t love. And I never saw her coming. Nothing could have prepared me for Haelee Pearson speeding into my life, and I certainly wasn’t ready for her to knock me back to reality. My life has been in a constant state of traction, until she glanced my way. She hates me. I want her. And like I said, I never lose.She’s tougher than any race I’ve ever driven. Claiming her would mean leaving my arrogance at the door, and handing my heart over on a silver platter. And I’m just not sure I can do it. Or can I?",
