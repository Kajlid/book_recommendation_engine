  "description": "Artemi is a quiet little town in the Arizona desert. The town's inhabitants have all lived in Artemi their whole lives, as far as they can remember, and nothing out of the ordinary has happened. But when a stranger in a tan trench-coat and boots shows up declaring an impending doom, Aaron Hochstett is plunged into a strange new reality that makes him question everything he believes. As the town is affected by supernatural forces, Aaron struggles with vivid dreams that threaten his reality. The stranger, naming himself as Dagon Dracson, tells him it's the work of a powerful psychic whose aim is to manipulate the powerful spiritual forces in Artemi for his own evil gain. But how can he be certain of the truth? Aaron has always desired to see the world beyond Artemi.",
