  "description": "What happens when you live across the street from the workplace of the hottest new member of New York’s Bravest?What starts as a few stolen glances from a sixth story window of Fireman Paul’s bare-chested beauty—as he uses a fistful of sponge and an elegantly long thick hose to make the big truck all shiny, red, and clean—turns into a wonderful imagined fantasy when alone in bed. But that’s not enough. And it isn’t long before Fireman Paul extends an invitation for a very personal tour of the firehouse, one that turns fantasy into reality, one that explodes on the page, sets off all alarms, and creates a connection that is completely hot, raw, naughty and breathtaking.",
