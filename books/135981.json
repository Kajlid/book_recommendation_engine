  "description": "In Italy in 1943, British soldiers found themselves in the firing line of a bombing raid from their American allies unless they could call off the assault. With no radio available, the day was saved by a carrier pigeon who covered the 30 km to the air base in under 20 minutes, and arrived when the bombers were about to take off. This book compiles more than 30 such tales of animal heroism.",
