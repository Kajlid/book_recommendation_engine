  "title": "The Phoenix Letters: Letters to my Younger Self",
  "description": "The Phoenix Letters is a compilation of fifty letters written to the younger self. The phoenix is an embodiment of fierce change and growth. It has the capability of experiencing rebirth, and at every stage we are very much a like the phoenix with its grace. We burn away a little of what was previously there and replace it with something new as we embrace growth in our veins. The Phoenix Letters is written with a very different way of viewing aspects of the younger life through an older mind and tends to make connections with the universal and earthly worlds.",
