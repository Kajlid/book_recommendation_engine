  "description": "After years of feeling numb to the world, Ava is finally ready to move on with her life. A spontaneous trip to Thailand with her best friend, Olivia, goes horribly wrong when Ava is kidnapped and held against her will in a secluded house deep within the Thailand forest. Her only contact is with the Thai men who kidnapped her and the mysterious Australian man who insists she has information that he needs, information he will do anything to secure. Hayden knows from the moment he first met Ava that the assignment wasn’t as black-and-white as he had expected it to be. He was sent to Thailand to retrieve the information from a suspect—Ava—who was linked to a known terrorist. But Ava isn’t like any of the other suspects he’s dealt with before, and as every day passes, his suspicions that there is more to the story than he is being led to believe continue to grow. When Ava and Hayden are faced with the real possibility that the reason for her kidnapping goes beyond what either of them could have ever imagined, they must move past their differences and find a way to work together if they want any hope and chance of survival.",
