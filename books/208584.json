  "description": "A kidnapped child. A drugged politician. A bludgeoned realtor. A conniving fiancé. A no-nonsense private investigator, building a new life for herself in Miami while dealing with unspeakable tragedy. Two years ago Reno Hart was a hot shot corporate security executive with dreams of fame and fortune. Now she wants nothing more than to help her clients and build a different kind of life. The Soaring Snapper takes Reno and her friend Joe Terry to the west coast of Florida, where a relaxing weekend of fishing turns deadly. The Flying Monkey draws Reno into the Heart of Miami politics, where nothing is off limits. The Dish Served Hot lands Reno in the middle of a high-stakes con game, where love The Man Who Wasn't leads Reno on a breakneck chase through the streets of Miami. Her client not only wants the child back, he wants the ransom money back as well. Buy this book and get to know Reno Hart before her first full-length adventure comes out later this summer.",
