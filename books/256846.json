  "description": "Five young men whose paths cross in their late teens continue their life's journey in different directions. But there is a constant, continuing thread, well at least for four of them. The other becomes something of an outsider. For the four, the picture is confused - they think they understand their relationship but only one of them knows the reality - he should, he's masterminding it. Tragic consequences arise as greed meets political ambition in a marriage of convenience.",
