  "description": "From the author of Sweet Restraint comes a story about one woman's island-under another man's rules... To most people, Hawaii's crystal blue shores are an inviting opportunity to escape reality. But for Lana Rodriguez, who grew up there, the picture-perfect vacation getaway disguises the bitter truths she escaped years ago, and not without some emotional scars. Now a successful blues singer, Lana's returning to Waikiki to control her own destiny, with a bold defiance when it comes to men, romance, and sex. A local celebrity, businessman, and island god, Jason Koa is every woman's dream-but for Lana, it's not love at first sight. Though their start is rocky, they can't deny the passions they arouse in each other. Jason decides it's time to show Lana who makes the rules on this island-and in the bedroom. But will Jason's attempt at breaking Lana's shell reveal secrets that neither are prepared to face, or will they allow themselves to get swept away by a tidal wave of desire?",
