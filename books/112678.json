  "description": "Grace is haunted by the events of that night at the mansion, the night when her whole world changed. She's battling her guilt while trying to support Chase, the man she loves, while he deals with his grief - a grief she imparted on him. Cain had fled, hiding out of town and trying to scratch a living working in a bar. He soon gets sucked into the world of underground fighting, a world that proves more lucrative and exciting that he might have imagined. But there are loose ends he needs to tie up, things he needs to do back home, people he needs to see. When he returns home a shadow from his past begins to haunt him, putting his life, and the lives of those he cares for most, in danger. As Grace battles with her guilt, a revelation about the past comes out, sending her, Cain, Chase, and Emily all on a course that will lead them into peril.",
