  "description": "Onyx is a 24 page, 7,000 word short story, plus bonus first chapters from some of my other books. Onyx was originally published in Tantalizing Tidbits, an anthology of short stories.  Madison Monroe thinks she has everything in life figured out. A boyfriend who she’s sure will propose any minute and a white picket fence in her future, until one ill-fated camping trip has her running for her life through the woods being chased by two wolves—both eager to claim her. Onyx Greyson has vowed to never love again, after losing his first mate long ago. He’s the second born son and leader to half the werewolves in his father’s court. Unfortunately, King Greyson is dying. Unwilling to leave his pack in the hands of his first son, Frost—a werewolf more defined by his sexual exploits and wild parties than leadership skills—the King issues a challenge: the first son to find a mate and secure an heir will ascend to the throne. Onyx is willing to walk away—until he meets Madison. Waking up in the hospital is only the first of Madison’s problems—King Greyson’s edict puts her front and center, leaving Madison to question whose mate she’s intended to be, when at first glance she wants neither male. Will Onyx win her love and convince her to stay? Or will her stubbornness force her to bow to Frost instead?",
