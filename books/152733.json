  "description": "You don’t belong with us.These are the words that echo through the minds of all immune Americans—those suffering the so-called adverse effects of an experimental vaccine, including perfect recall, body manipulation, telepathy, precognition, levitation, mind-control, and the ability to change one’s appearance at will.When great numbers of immune individuals begin to disappear, fear and tension mount, and unrest begins to brew across the country. Through separate channels, super-powered teenagers Ciere, Daniel, and Devon find themselves on the case; supercriminals and government agents working side-by-side. It’s an effort that will ultimately define them all, for better or for worse.Pairing high-stakes action with a compelling cast of superhuman characters, Emily Lloyd-Jones’s thrilling sequel to Illusive will have readers on the edge of their seats.",
