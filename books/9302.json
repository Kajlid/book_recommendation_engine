  "description": "Another masterpiece of suspense from the author of the acclaimed The House of Lost Souls It's the perfect seaside village—no crime, no one from the city. When things start to go badly wrong for James Greer in London, Brodmaw Bay seems to be calling him and his family. There's a perfect house, excellent schools—and welcoming neighbors who assure the Greers that they'd be delighted to have some new blood in the Bay. But perhaps the village isn't so much welcoming them as luring them, to something ancient and evil.",
