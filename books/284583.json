  "description": "Here’s what I know. Being a cupid is hard work.  Love Matches, Lust Breath, Flirt Touches, not to mention having to meet my quotas every month. And hitting your target with arrows? That shit is not easy.  But all of that I could handle. Gladly. If only my cupid powers would actually work. But nope. Turns out, I’m a dud.  Unless I want to get sucked out of existence, I need to spread some love around fast. The clock is ticking, but I have the perfect candidate to start with.  Warren Knight. Smart, hot as hell, rich, bachelor-dud extraordinaire. No matter how many dates he goes on, he just won’t seal the deal. It’s time I fix him. And fix me too.  Of course, the asshole doesn’t want to fall in love, so I have my work cut out for me.  They say there’s no rest for the wicked. Well, they should try being a cupid, because this shit is exhausting. Here goes nothing.",
