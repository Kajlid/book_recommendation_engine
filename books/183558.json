  "description": "In a world that was meant to be perfect, a threat rises. The peaceful, magical utopia is crumbling as the heart of the world dies, poisoned by one who was once considered a friend. Dak was born to a life of privilege and honor as a Mage in a place made of magick. But now he is an Outcast, condemned by society. He is fighting desperately to keep the magick alive when ancient foes want it dead. Amber was born on Earth and longed for an escape her whole life. One day she got it, pulled by a Rift through time and space to the world she truly belonged in and the men whose souls are bound to hers. But in a place where fairies are real, goblins are too. Malice can be as strong as love, and it feeds a dark magick. Can Dak and Amber restore the world to the perfection it was meant to be? Not alone, they canâ€™t. They need faithful friends and lovers, helpful strangers, and divine intervention.",
