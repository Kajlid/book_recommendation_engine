  "description": "I’m no Sleeping Beauty. I’m not a princess and I have no prince. There are no fairy godmothers for me.But what if a girl could have three Godfathers instead?The course of my life wasn’t changed by a curse. It was lies, betrayal, and the powerful families that run Sinhaven.I think I’m immune, safe, tucked away at Mike’s Garage with Memaw and the Castenellas, rewriting my beloved fairytales and dreaming of far, far away.But what do you do when your love is rejected, and nothing turns out like you wish? What do you do when the spindle isn’t something you reach for, but something that comes from behind, leaving your body battered and broken? When one letter destroys everything you thought you knew about yourself? What if every single person you love lies?I’ll tell you what you do: you leave. In the dead of the night with no goodbyes.That was six years ago. The truth may be lost to the grave, but Toc, Luca, and Rafe still run the garage.Surprise fellas. I’m coming back. I’m going to take what’s mine and wreak my vengeance. All of Sinhaven will feel my Wrath.**WARNING** This book contains some scenes of graphic violence that may be disturbing for some readers, and there is mention of sexual assault, though it is not seen on the page.",
