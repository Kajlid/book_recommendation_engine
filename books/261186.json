Written by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Kirk, in 1691, and not committed to print until the early 19th century, The Secret Commonwealth is an unusually sympathetic account of the denizens of fairyland, and a complex of still mysterious extrasensory phenomena including poltergeists, clairvoyance and doppelgangers (here called 'co-walkers').\" (Quote from sacred-texts.com)Table of Contents: Publisher's Preface; Dedication To Robert Louis Stevenson; Introduction; Chapter 1.
