  "title": "Nothing About This Is Easy And Here Is Why: Life Through the Eyes of a Woman on the Autism Spectrum",
  "description": "\"Nothing About This is Easy and Here is Why\" is a short book that has taken a lifetime to write. It is filled with little stories from Mari Stein's \"Autistic Brain.\" When she was a child there was no diagnosis for her, and her parents would not have spent the money on testing even if there was. This memoir is a testament to a misunderstood life and will help others recognize that they are not alone. Stories written from as early as 1985 chronicle the workings of an Autistic mind. For many people with Autism loneliness is a daily struggle, this book will help them remember that there are millions of people just like them.",
