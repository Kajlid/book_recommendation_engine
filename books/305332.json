  "description": "Do we ever get to the point in our lives where we feel stuck and there seem to not be much progress in sight? There’s got to be that one moment you got so stressed and thought you were done living life and just maybe many things weren’t worth the struggle. There are many valleys you surely would arrive that would question your back pack. You would need to ask certain questions and seek sincere answers. I wrote this book to take you through the different windows of life and teach you how to open and close them by engaging the principles of timing, priority and utility. Each chapter is dedicated to a window and discussed extensively including self-assessment questions to bring clarity to your personal life and experiences. I hope that as you read through the pages of this book, you learn to appreciate your process and take advantage of the principles outlined to your greatest advantage.",
