  "description": "The warrior priests intend to rule Pantogan and they will stop at nothing; not even by releasing the Elementals to wreak havoc and destruction across the kingdom in order to rediscover the truth of the beginning and gain domination. Yet the tribe of the Elementals – hailing of people embodied with the spirits of the four purist elements – can only be stopped by people who have the gift of the Craft: a healing force of magic. As the much vaunted Pantogan armies are casually swept aside by the Elementals, the battle lines between physical, magical and spiritual forces are drawn.",
