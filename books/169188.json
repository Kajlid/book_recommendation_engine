  "description": "**Only intended for mature audience. Contains sex and (some) foul language** Everything about me is a lie, except that my name is Dean. I don’t want to be the person I feel I have to show the world anymore. I’m sick of living a lie. What I want is to be free. Free to love who I want, not who people think I should. When you’re not living your life on your own terms, everything suffers. My happiness, personal relationships and even my music. My music has suffered greatly. I sit down to write and—nothing. My manager is pushing me to get back on the road to create a buzz about the songs I actually have been able to write. He says we’re picking someone up along the way to collaborate with who will help me write again. Ayden is everything I’m not. He’s comfortable in his own skin. Not afraid to show his true self. He’s also a talented song writer. Not only is he insanely gorgeous overall, but he has the deepest blue eyes I’ve ever seen. He’s beautiful and makes me question everything. Can I be my true self? What would happen if my label found out about whom I really am? What would happen after the gig was up? What would happen if I took that chance? Is love worth the fight in the end?",
