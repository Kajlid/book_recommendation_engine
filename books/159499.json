  "description": "When therapist and mediator Grace McDonald returns to Kansas after a ten-year hiatus in Alaska to be with her daughter and autistic grandson, she expects a tough adjustment. But what Grace cannot anticipate is being assigned the mediation case from hell.Not just about parental rights and custody, the case becomes a battle for the heart and soul of a child. Mike is a combat vet who was never told he had a son. Becca is a member of the gay-bashing, funeral-picketing Westboro Baptist Church and what is often labeled the “most hated family in America.”David, eleven years old, is their son.Meticulously researched, All God’s Children moves fluidly between verifiable facts and the What if? of fiction. Kraus takes readers behind the closed doors of mediation and locked gates of the Westboro Baptist Church compound. When a brutal assault leaves the community reeling, Grace is pushed to uncover the truth.More Jodi Picoult than Sue Grafton, All God’s Children challenges readers to find humanity in the most despised of bigots. It explores what happens when beliefs become more precious than the people we love while moving inexorably to an “I-never-saw-it-coming” ending that will leave book groups arguing for weeks.",
