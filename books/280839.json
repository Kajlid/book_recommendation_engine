  "description": "Stella Woods has just quit her job. And there’s nothing like a little vacation at her sister’s Floridian mansion to contemplate her future. Unfortunately, Stella’s brother-in-law mixed up her arrival date and has already offered the pool house to his best friend. Brooks Larsen wasn’t looking for anything but a good time when he came to visit his old college friend. Only, he hadn’t expected his buddy would have a gorgeous woman waiting for him—in nothing but a towel—just minutes after he arrives. Realizing things could be worse, Stella agrees to make the best of a bad situation. As the days go by, Brooks and Stella can’t fight their budding attraction. And when the end of their time together approaches, the pair are left frustrated. He thinks she’s the one. She wishes he wanted more. But neither shares their feelings. Because this was only supposed to be just a fling.",
