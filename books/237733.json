  "description": "This is the second and final work of Bruno Schulz, the acclaimed Polish writer killed by the Nazis during World War II. In the words of Isaac Bashevis Singer, \"What he did in his short life was enough to make him one of the most remarkable writers who ever lived.\" Weaving myth, fantasy, and reality, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, is, to quote Schulz, \"an attempt at eliciting the history of a certain family . . . by a search for the mythical sense, the essential core of that history.\"",
