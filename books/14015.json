  "description": "On the rack of romance. And also in the oven of luuurve . And possibly on my way to the bakery of pain . And maybe even going to stop along the way to get a little cake at the cakeshop of agony. Shut up , brain, shut up. Georgia is in quite a predicament. Dave the Laugh has declared his love for her (at least she thinks he was talking about her), leaving her in a state of confusiosity. And then when she finally decides to give Masimo an ultimatum -- to be her one and only -- he tells her he needs to think about it. To distract herself from her romantic woes, Georgia throws herself into Mac-Useless play rehearsals and planning a Viking wedding, and tries to avoid all thoughts of boy decoys, Italian-American dreamboats . . . and letâ€™s not forget guitar-plucking Sex Gods!",
