  "description": "Just before her sixteenth birthday, Kristi's world implodes when her parents divorce, and remarry others who she cannot tolerate. Life for her will never be the same, and her only hope of escape is to leave both homes where she no longer feels a part. Her Amish pen-pal, Betty, sends a letter and Kristi decides to run away from her father's house in Batesville, Indian. On her journey to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, she overcomes many challenges. What will happen when she arrives in a community where no cars, electricity, or worldly clothes are allowed? From a background with no religious instruction, will she fit in where God and separated living dominate the Amish? Will her plain wish for a new family become a reality for Kristi?",
