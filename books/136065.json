  "description": "Mark McLaughlin's darkest tales of the bizarre have been compiled in HIDEOUS FACES, BEAUTIFUL SKULLS from Wildside Press. Impossible love is a major theme in this collection: relationships that should not be, and yet they happen because these strong attractions cannot be denied.  In “Adroitly Wrapped,” the shape-shifting witch Athena Moth tries to help a friend to fulfill his need for love … but what about her own needs? “Eye Dew” explores the institution of marriage and how it changes the participants, and so often, not for the better. “You Shall Have This Delicacy” tells of a magical woman who can have any lover she desires, yet she wants only one: someone who has been taken from her in a fashion that most would consider irreversible. “ascloseasthis” is about a wildly unlikely pair … their sexual orientations don’t even match. But the lovers learn to change – in startling ways. “Claws of the Internet Witches” and “Prince of the Dark Green Sea” both concern supernatural creatures longing for love … and really, don’t all living things deserve love? Even monsters? Those are just a few of the stories in HIDEOUS FACES, BEAUTIFUL SKULLS, available as a trade paperback or as a Kindle download.",
