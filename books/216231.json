Amkaya’s dungeon is loneliness, because her proximity is fatal. A half-blood vampire, she cannot control the beast inside and long since gave up hope of a love affair - until she meets Noah, a Nephilim, whose embrace is also fatal. They cannot escape their extraordinary attraction to one another; they quickly and unexpectedly grow close - but is it a fateful encounter or fatal recklessness?",
