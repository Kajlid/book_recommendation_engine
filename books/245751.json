  "title": "Love and Bravery: Sixteen Stories",
  "description": "From the award-winning author of The Fish Tales and the Venery series comes sixteen short stories that are smart and softly hardcore.  If a novel is a banquet, Laqueur's anthology is a tapas course. Literal love bites that that focus on isolated moments in time. Microfiction that captures the middle of the action without worrying much where things started or where they'll end up. Each vignette touches on the notion of bravery. Because love is always worth the risk.  From a joyful retiree in Bali to a chance encounter on a train, Laqueur explores erotic courage. A blind date in Manhattan. A secret crush in Canada. An ancient aphrodisiac in St. Lucia. A Brazilian street block during Carnival. A box seat at the Paris Opera. A swim with dolphins in New Zealand.  How far will you go for your heart's desire? How passionate a chance will you take?",
