  "description": "Ten years ago, federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, a typical soccer mom with a minivan and suburban home. Then the unthinkable happens, an attack that changes her life forever. And forever is a very long time for a vampire.  Now in VAMPIRE FIRE, private investigator Samantha Moon’s new client asks her to find a dead guy—a dead guy she knew. It doesn’t take Sam very long to figure out that something wicked this way comes—very, very wicked—but there’s no way she can walk away from this case…  However, Sam’s client doesn’t want the guy’s body—he wants his soul. And if Sam fails, then two others will die. Now Sam must track down the spirit of a dead man who’s hiding from his destiny and hand him over. She doesn’t even know who else is at risk, but she has to choose whether to protect the soul of a dead man or protect others whose lives are at stake. Worst of all, she’s forced to work for someone who may just be evil incarnate.  When tragedy strikes, Sam has only until sunset to save a life. As Sam races to find the victim before it’s too late, it will take all she has in her to beat the devil at his own game…  VAMPIRE FIRE (Vampire for Hire #12) is J.R. Rain’s first exciting novel in The Devil's Triangle, a paranormal thriller trilogy within the Vampire for Hire series in which Samantha Moon must risk everything to battle the greatest evil the world has ever known.",
