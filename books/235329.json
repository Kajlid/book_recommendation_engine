  "title": "Juneau to Kenai",
  "description": "Brent fell in love when he and a group of humans were pulled through an interdimensional rift, but he’s the Alpha of the Juneau Pack and she’s a trauma surgeon from Seattle on vacation in Alaska. His responsibilities make relocation impossible, and he can’t imagine she’d want to leave her friends, family, and career to be the Alpha’s mate in a werewolf pack.  Kennedy found there was more to Alaska than beautiful scenery: angels, monsters with laser weaponry, and werewolves. One werewolf in particular has occupied her every thought since they returned home from the other side of an interdimensional rift. But five minutes after their rescue, Brent walked away, leaving her to continue her vacation of hiking and climbing in the Kenai wilderness with a werewolf guide.  But a group of shifter hunters has Kennedy’s guide in their crosshairs—and they don’t care if a human becomes collateral damage. Suddenly love isn’t the only thing on the line as Brent races to find Kennedy and get both her and her guide out of Kenai before the hunters can track them down.",
