  "description": "A true graphic milestone: the epic trilogy that began with X'ed Out, continued in The Hive,  and concluded in Sugar Skull--now in one volume.The long strange trip of Doug in all its mind-bending, heartbreaking totality. The fragments of the past collide with the reality of the present, nightmarish dreams evolve into an even more dreadful reality, and when you finally find out where all of this has been going, and what it means . . . it will make you go right back to the first page and read it all again with new eyes. Just like Doug.(With full-color illustrations throughout)",
