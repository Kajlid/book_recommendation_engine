  "title": "End Times and 2019: The End of the Mayan Calendar and the Countdown to Judgment Day",
  "description": "End Times and 2019 reviews the evidence suggesting that the end of the world as we know it will occur in December 2019 - progressing through astronomical clues given by the Maya, Egyptian pyramids, world mythology, and especially the Bible - leading readers to a timeline of events for our civilization's final years. Prophets saw the night skies in their visions of the future and described those skies to us in their prophecies. With modern computers and astronomical software we can succeed where Isaac Newton gave up, and calculate WHEN the prophets' future visions occur. Hundreds of documented citations and Bible verses point to the same events in 2019.",
