  "description": "Sophia Morganthal’s senior year is full of surprises. A family she never knew existed, magical powers she never even dreamed of, and a legacy she’s not sure she wants. Amidst all of the upheaval in her life, Sophia also finds one source of happiness – Connor. The last thing she needs is more complications, but Connor is the only person who makes her feel wanted for herself and not for what she stands for. As Sophia learns more about herself, and what being initiated into Blackthorne coven really means, she discovers more questions than answers. After a devastating revelation, Sophia knows she needs to make a choice—support her family or follow her heart. Either could have deadly consequences. Will she play it safe or play to win?",
