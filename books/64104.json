  "description": "Woo a young lady with a fishing rod and a bucket of worms? Oh-so dashing - but untitled - Everett Markham seeks a bride, and he has charged the field of Miss Sabrina Douglas, a woman who prefers trout to truffles. But, sometimes, even when both hearts are engaged, happily ever after isn't so smooth a journey.Unabashed and unapologetic, Sabrina sets her cap for a second son, one who will smile patiently when he comes home to find she's misplaced their children. But marriage changes her in ways she could never have imagined, as the awkward debutante surrenders to a very real, very womanly, all-consuming love.An irresistibly handsome English rogue, Everett plots his future with ruthless detail, but his future wife is anything but predictable, resulting in the zaniest courtship London society has ever seen. When a family tragedy upends his life, on his wedding day, no less, he must chart a slippery course with his most unlikely lady - as the new Earl and Countess of Woverton.",
