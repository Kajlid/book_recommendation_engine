A hard, vicious man of many quarrels, Sir Ralph could have been killed by almost anyone.

And as family secrets are dragged out into the light, Dame Frevisse realizes that there is a murderer among them who will not rest until the Woderove legacy has been settled once and for all...\"Beautifully written and captures the essence of the characters in a way that's bittersweet as well as accurate.\" - The Best Reviews\"Frazer's latest will please both Frevisse afficionados and historical mystery readers new to the series.\" - Booklist",
