The perfect read while you're waiting for Season 4 to drop on Netflix!\nHigh school is a monster, and it's eating everyone Robin knows. As sophomore year starts, Robin's Odd Squad friends have decided to try to be just like everyone else. Her best friends couple up and expect her to come along for the ride. They can't stop talking about school and college and careers. But Robin has bigger problems--she's been hiding out with the band kids since middle school, hoping nobody would notice that she's something even stranger than a French horn player who can speak four languages: she's gay.She's convinced the only way she can learn to be herself is by fleeing to Europe for a summer to experience real life. But she has no money, no permission, and no one to share the adventure with. How is she supposed to be her true self in Hawkins, Indiana? The weirdest girl in Hawkins has spent her whole life trying to fit in. Now, she's going to break out.Sprinkled with Easter eggs that reference our favorite Stranger Things characters, this contemporary coming-of-age story set in the '80s is about one girl's realization that the only person she needs to be accepted by is herself.",
