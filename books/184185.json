Salinger.It is the story of a young LA gang member named East, who is sent by his uncle along with some other teenage boys—including East's hothead younger brother—to kill a key witness hiding out in Wisconsin. The journey takes East out of a city he's never left and into an America that is entirely alien to him, ultimately forcing him to grapple with his place in the world and decide what kind of man he wants to become. Written in stark and unforgettable prose and featuring an array of surprising and memorable characters rendered with empathy and wit, Dodgers heralds the arrival of a major new voice in American fiction.WINNER OF THE LA TIMES BOOK PRIZE 2017 FOR BEST MYSTERY/THRILLERWINNER OF THE CWA GOLDSBORO GOLD DAGGER 2016 FOR BEST CRIME NOVEL OF THE YEARWINNER OF THE CWA JOHN CREASEY NEW BLOOD DAGGER 2016 FOR BEST DEBUT CRIME NOVELWINNER OF THE MARK TWAIN AMERICAN VOICE IN LITERATURE AWARDFINALIST FOR THE PEN/HEMINGWAY AWARD 2017 FOR DEBUT FICTIONLONGLISTED FOR ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL 2017 FOR EXCELLENCE IN FICTIONNOMINATED FOR THE EDGAR AWARD 2017 FOR BEST FIRST NOVEL",
