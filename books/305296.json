  "description": "Welcome to the Dollhouse, where devils rule. I used to be a good girl. I did everything right. But then I came home and found my boyfriend in bed with my sister, so I left, eventually finding myself at the Dollhouse—a strip club. No good girl would be caught dead at the Dollhouse, but like I said, that was the old me. The new me? The new me likes it dirty. Likes it rough. I like being put on display and watched… and he likes watching. He will do anything to take me as his own and make me his in every sick way possible. He wants to own me. To control me. Roman is a devil in a suit, the kind of dangerous man who can bend anyone to his will. Together, with his partner in crime, Carter, he dominates me the moment we meet. But I still have a mind of my own, my own wants and desires that include a sweet, kind, and dangerously cute neighbor of mine. If Roman wants to keep me, he’ll either have to cage me or bow to me once in a while. Even devils can break. Voyeur is a dark RH/Why Choose romance, recommended 18+. It is a standalone novel full of graphic sex scenes and a bit of violence.",
