  "description": "This is a book full of chocolate, mocha and pecans, gourmand sundaes and gourmet sorbets. The recipes range from the deliciously complex and ornate, like the Chocolate Voodoo Cake, to triumphantly reinvented, no-longer-ordinary old favorites such as fruit cake, jelly rolls, and sticky buns.With his foolproof instructions, Desaulniers takes the home cook by the hand and, in step-by-step detail, shows how even the most extravagant of these desserts can easily be made at home.",
