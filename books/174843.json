  "description": "Armed now with his precious Symphogram, William Muldoon must depart Lán Cúrdhal and make for the eastern canyons, to where a dark Wrythunn lurks.  As times grow ever treacherous, you will see how the road takes its toll upon our brave young hero and his newfound friends. How some bonds will blossom, while others deteriorate.  Here the faerietale ends, horrors stir in shadow and young Muldoon will need his wits about him. For there are far worse things in the darker reaches of Lythiann than Gremlins or Devil-Hounds. Not to mention the deeper, more sinister, revelations which have yet to be revealed to him.",
