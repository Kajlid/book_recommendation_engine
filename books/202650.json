  "description": "It is hard to maintain a witty equilibrium in the realm of manners in cultured society. If one ignores social conventions, one runs the risk of being perceived as uneducated; however, following all common protocol pegs one as a nerd. With tongue in cheek, Potter reveals how to confound those who like to practice their one-upmanship.Â What's a one-upmanship? An angle of vision, a way of life, a series of gambits, ploys and devices - all of these and more, upmanship is an individual talent. Remember one final overwhelming truth: If you're not one up, you're one down.",
