  "description": "Incineration is an exhilarating story about a post-outbreak, future society. Running water and electricity are a thing of the past. The streets of New York are lined with deteriorating cars and the bones of bodies long decayed. The main character, Phee, was just ten when everyone died. The handful of survivors left, are completely altered by the Avian Rodentia virus, leaving behind an unhinged and violent society. Phee herself has been scarred, unable to handle any touch from another human. \tTired of barely living life and succumbing to invasive assaults, Phee leaves the mild safety of her group behind in search of a better life. In her pursuit, death nearly finds her before a group of men intervene. \tTheir intentions seem well, but can she trust the men that seem to be helping her? \tEverything in Phee’s life becomes questionable. She doesn’t know who to trust or if she can open her heart to love. She doesn’t know who to fight for when traitors emerge. \tWhen her new life is threatened with Phee at the center of it all, will she survive in one piece, or will she burn from the inside out?",
