  "description": "Your family has a huge responsibility, and they need you. \tNow.\tIn all of her eighteen years, normal has never been a word you could apply to Jess Gardner’s life. She is a medium, making her living by communicating with the dead. Even had she been a psychic, she couldn’t have predicted the drama about to be brought to her door. The messenger, Aaron Thorne, enters her world with the news that the mother she’d thought dead is still alive. Suddenly, her maternal family is in desperate need of her help. Should Jess give up everything she knows to help a family she never knew existed? Also, a mysterious evil force is draining the life from the present Priestess, and Jess may be the only one who can save this newfound clan. Will the promise of uncovering more about herself, and a chance with a new family be enough to draw her into a potentially deadly situation?",
