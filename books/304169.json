  "description": "Look, all Joshua Deering wanted was to pass his final photography project. It should have been find a subject, take some photos, get an A, and get his dad off his back. But that’s not what happened.And, okay, maybe he should’ve known better than to befriend a guy chilling out in a cemetery. Maybe he should’ve taken the hint when a mysterious girl stepped out of the mist and announced that there might be hunters after the cemetery guy. And maybe he should’ve studied more for his other exams instead of panicking about his project.But hindsight is 20/20, and now creepy cemetery guy Adrian, Josh, and Josh’s two friends are being stalked by nameless, violent strangers. Their only defence is a heavy bookbag, an expensive camera, Adrian’s big secret (that actually might be the reason behind this mess), and a lot of optimism.…This is probably going to get messy.",
