  "title": "Imposter",
  "description": "Three trials. Three weeks. Three Royal Princes.  It should have been an easy task, for a skilled mercenary like Rybet Waise. Simply break into the royal palace, and rescue her friend from the executioner's block. But when Rybet accidentally qualifies for the Trials, she finds herself with little choice but to see them through.  A thin veil of etiquette, elegance and glamour hides the true nature of the Trials. Behind closed doors, they are brutal and bloody, and to fail means to forfeit her life.  Thrust into the limelight and forced to compete with the Kingdom's elite sweethearts, unlikely allies emerge and bonds are formed. But someone will stop at nothing to see her fail.  After all, she's nothing but a dirty pond-dweller.  Rybet will do whatever it takes to survive until the Golden Ball, Princes be damned.",
