  "description": "Broke parents? Abusive Step-dad? A secret boyfriend? Anti-LGBTQ+ family? Fair-weather friends? Troye has it all. It’s the summer before high school, and Troye Cameron’s life is in tatters. His boyfriend Max just moved away, his mother has been spiraling into depression since her abusive husband left her for another woman, and all his friends decided to turn on him at the same time. When he leaves to spend the summer with his dad, everything changes. Follow Troye along as he stumbles down this path. He’ll find a love he never imagined, he’ll feel pain like nothing before, he’ll grow, suffer abuse, meet new people, experience things he thought were over, and he’ll find that rock bottom is so much lower than he thought. Troye will make mistakes, who doesn’t? He will find himself lost in love, but the question is, will he find his way out?",
