  "description": "Claire Vessia's been sentenced to death. The last survivor of a ship of would-be-pirates captured by the navy, she's been accused of all of their crimes. She will die for it. Determined to go out with her head held high, her plans for a stoic execution are thrown out the window when a highborn lady offers her a chance to escape the noose... if she pays in vials of her own blood. But she is betrayed. Hung from the gallows and buried at sea, she rises amidst the waves as a Vampyri, an undead monster. Without a clue of where, or even what she is, and only a terrible hunger to guide her, it's only when she consumes a person trying to help her that she begins to understands what's been done to her. Swearing revenge against the noble woman that turned her, the nation that accused her, and its people that killed her, Claire makes an oath that she will hunt down anyone under the navy's flag, and carve a blood-strewn path on her quest for vengeance. But when the perfect chance to strike takes the form of the child of her maker - Claire must ask herself how far she's willing to go for justice.",
