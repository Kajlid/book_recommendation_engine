  "description": "Jim Hawkins has a bad attitude. What's more, he enjoys having a bad attitude about everything--especially about church. Garth Plimpton is a fanatic. He's spent so much time studying the scriptures and thick books on archaeology that that he can't carry on a normal conversation with other kids. That's why they consider him a nerd. Through an unusual chain of events, these two opposites become fast friends. It all began when Garth told Jim a simple \"They really existed once, you know.\" \"Who?\" Jim asked. \"Nephites,\" Garth replied. \"Every character in the Book of Mormon ate, slept, died, was buried . . .\" That statement, taken for granted before, would soon echo deeply in the two boys' minds--because they were on the trail of a chilling secret.",
