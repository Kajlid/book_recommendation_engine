Life is short, so explore a multitude of fascinating historical, biographical, scientific, political, and financial topics in only an hour each. Leland Stanford retains a double legacy as both a robber baron and a great philanthropist. He got his start in business as a merchant during the California Gold Rush, but he worked his way up to president of both the Central and Southern Pacific Railroad companies by 1861. He became a railroad mogul, a leading force in an underregulated industry wherein he gained a reputation for corrupt and greedy practices. Yet, he and his wife benevolently founded Stanford University in memory of their deceased son. This biography unravels the complicated threads of Stanfordâ€™s life, showing how in some ways the man operated just like the machines of his business empire, and in others, he was as human as the rest of us.",
