  "title": "Reclaiming Ter Chadain: Protector of Ter Chadain",
  "description": "“If the true bloodline does not rule Ter Chadain, the Protector shall appear and reclaim the throne for the rightful Queen.” King Englewood reads the prophecy every day since he murdered the royal family, all of them. Or so he thought. The three year old twins escaped that night thirteen years ago, but his men are closing in to finish the job before they can turn sixteen and activate the magic spell making his worst fears a reality. A Protector in Ter Chadain and a royal heir with claims to the throne he now held. Logan and Teah Lassain witness the violent murder of their family and narrowly escape. They now find themselves not only thrust into the revolution, but the keys to the reunification of Ter Chadain. Bestowed with the powers and spirits of past Protectors, Logan must learn to control both before their memories destroy him. Wrenched with anger and the desire for revenge on the man responsible for decimating his life, King Englewood, Logan must keep to the path of greater good and gather support for the revolution from the dukes and duchesses of Ter Chadain. Teah is trained by the Zele Magus, an order of sorceresses, to control and accept her newly discovered magical powers enabling her to take the throne. Struggling, she must also ask the question…what happens when there are two Protectors of Ter Chadain? Two Protectors are not foretold in the prophecies….",
