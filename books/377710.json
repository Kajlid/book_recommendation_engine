  "title": "Second Wind: One Woman's Midlife Quest to Run Seven Marathons on Seven Continents",
  "description": "Second Wind is the story of an unlikely athlete and an unlikely Cami Ostman, a woman edging toward midlife who decides to take on a challenge that stretches her way outside of her comfort zone. That challenge presents itself when an old friend suggests she go for a run to distract her from the grief of her recent divorce.  Excited by the clarity of mind and breathing space running offers her, she keeps it up—albeit slowly—and she decides to run seven marathons on seven continents; this becomes Ostman’s vision quest, the thing she turns to during the ups and downs of a new romance and during the hard months and years of redefining herself in the aftermath of the very restrictive, religious-based marriage and life she led up until her divorce. Insightful and uplifting, Second Wind carries the reader along for the ride as Ostman runs her way out of compliance with the patriarchal rules about \"being a woman” that long held her captive and into authenticity and self-love. Her adventures—and the personal revelations that accompany them—inspire readers to take chances, find truth in their lives, and learn to listen to the voice inside them that’s been there all along.",
