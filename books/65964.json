Yet now the evil of desperate circumstances threatens him. A vampire knight torments him by taking away the love of his wife and offering him a choice which strikes at the very heart of who he is: give up everything that remains to him in order to get back all he has lost. An unholy bargain with his vampyric host gives him hope and teaches him more than he expects about life and love, but also hate. Time is short, and horror tells his story.Will love or hate win through?",
