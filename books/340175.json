  "description": "To the outside world, thirty-seven-year-old Scott Daven has the perfect life. He's handsome, rich, a successful businessman and politician with a wife and three sons who adore him. When his father hires a young architect to be his assistant, Scott fights his attraction to the young man. Losing this struggle would mean the destruction of his life and his political career. Neil Phalen's marriage crashed and burned when a hustler tried to blackmail him. After the divorce, he moved to a new town to start life over as a gay man. The next-to-last thing he expected was to fall in love with his married boss. The last thing was that his boss would fall in love with him. Determined to protect Scott and his family, Neil offers to remain in the background and in the closet, but that becomes impossible when Neil's ex-wife reveals his secret to Scott's wife and father. As the conflicts escalate around them, the men have to decide which price is too high - the cost of personal honesty or the cost of a destroyed life.",
