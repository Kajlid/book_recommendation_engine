  "description": "Callahan's Place is open for business, and all of the \"regulars\" are here--a talking dog, an alcoholic vampire, and two telepaths--enhancing their joys by drowning their sorrows. Everyone, that is, but Mickey Finn, a seven-foot tall alien in danger of enslavement at the hands of a traveller from across the galaxy....Come inside, pull up a chair, order a drink, make a toast, and let Spider Robinson introduce you to the most unique patrons to frequent any establishment, at a bar where the most important law is \"shared pain is lessened; shared joy is increased.\" And if there's time left at the end of the night, just maybe they'll save the world....",
