  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover for ISBN-10 0140442391In Troilus and Criseyde, Chacer is meditating on the nature of love and on human love in particular.During the great siege of Troy, Troilus, the son of Priam, sees Criseyde and fall in love with her. Later, with the help of Pandarus—one of the first great character studies in our literature—Troilus wins her love, only to be betrayed.Cecil Day Lewis considered Troilus's betrayal was so painful that no one “without reluctance reads it twice”. Nevertheless, Chaucer's depiction of passionate sexual love, his grasp of tragedy and the unpredictability of Fate, and his wonderful sense of the ridiculous often contained in the sublime make it “one of the most beautiful long poems in the English language.”",
