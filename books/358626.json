But once she crosses the threshold of Haroon's family home, Jhumur finds she is expected to be the traditional Muslim wife: head covered, eyes averted, and unable to leave the house without an escort.

Readers from every walk of life will be stunned by this tale of love, lust, and blood ties.Taslima Nasrin, an award-winning writer and human rights activist, is known for her powerful writing on women's oppression and unflinching criticisms of Islam, despite forced exile and multiple fatwa calling for her death.
