  "description": "Raised to kill by her father, a convicted serial killer, Morgan’s problems aren’t those of the average teen. She wants only one to protect her freedom and not get locked away. So, despite ongoing temptation and a bloody past, Morgan swears off murder. Seeking to tame her sociopathic instincts, Morgan cons her way into working with security consultants Jenna Galloway and Andre Stone. For their first case, Morgan goes undercover to infiltrate ReNew, a treatment center for troubled teens, to investigate the suicide of a fourteen-year-old girl sent there by her wealthy parents. While Jenna and Andre search for evidence from the outside, Morgan endures her own worst nightmare posing as an inmate. It isn’t long before she discovers that ReNew’s unstable patients are the ones who are really in charge―and that some of their psychopathic tendencies rival her own. Even if Morgan can discover the truth behind the girl’s death and escape ReNew alive, what―or who―might be waiting for her on the outside?",
