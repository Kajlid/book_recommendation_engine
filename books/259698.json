  "description": "‘Don’t Let the Kitten Drive the Car!’ is a heart warming, slice-of-life tale about a ten-year-old girl, Akriti and her pet kitten, Simba.

Her life is full of both rainbows and dark clouds, as makes new friends and learns how to stand up to the class bullies. Three month old Simba is a cute, white ball of fluff with a pink button nose. He thinks that he is the most intelligent kitten in the whole world and that humans are not as brainy as cats. Simba’s adorable antics win over the members of the Gupta household. He even manages to melt the heart of crusty old Dadaji, who used to think that cats were a bad omen. Pick up this book and follow the dynamic duo of Akriti and Simba along on their adventures. Peep into their little world as they learn unexpected and delightful lessons from each other. If you are someone who loves to curl up with a book on a rainy day, then you will love ‘Don’t Let the Kitten Drive the Car!’.",
