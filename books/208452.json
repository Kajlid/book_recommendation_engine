  "description": "Don't believe in the Sandman? Neither did 11-year-old twins, Josh and Jenna. That is, until one night when something moved in the corner of Jenna's bedroom. That event started a chain reaction that catapulted the twins across a threshold into a mystical realm, \"the place of dreams where nothing is quite the way it seems, where that which is, perhaps is not and what is not just might be.\"  Josh and Jenna are shocked to learn that they are the key to fulfilling an ancient prophecy:  Now the Dreamstone has been lost Waiting who knows where? Like a ball between two players tossed ’Tis neither here nor there. Two children from the Outer World Together shall come alone. They must be twins, a boy and girl To find the lost Dreamstone.  If the prophecy is not fulfilled then everyone, everywhere, will suffer horrible nightmares every sleeping moment of their lives for as long as they live.  Tasked with finding the Dreamstone in a realm populated by Dreamons and Drangels and Skrids––not to mention those annoying things called Weedles––the twins are met with dangers and strangers beyond their wildest dreams.  Josh, the adventurous one, will find this adventure to be almost more than he can handle. And Jenna will find her practical nature challenged by the sheer weirdness of nearly everything at nearly every turn.  Failure to succeed in their quest is not an option––at least not if they ever want to return to their home and to the comfortable lives they once knew. D'rath Kahn, the Dark Lord of Nightmares has declared it so.  The Lost Dreamstone, complete with colorful illustrations by the author, is geared toward Middle Grade readers (as well as adults) with a thirst for action and adventure and a touch of weirdness. There is much to be discovered in the place of dreams. Like Shamara the Sorceress told the twins, \"Future fortune is often lost because a threshold is left uncrossed.\"  The door is open. Won't you come on in?",
