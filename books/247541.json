And he just left me all his money.The catch?Of course there's a catch.I get the money if Iâ€™m 25 years old (check), and married (not checked; not by a landslide). And--I only have 30 days to pull this off.But when I meet Nat, Linc, Win, and Brose, I've found what every girl dreams of, multiplied by four. The millions were within reach. I could pay off my student loans, move out of my roach-infested dump of an apartment, and maybe even take a vacation with my best gay boyfriend Matty.But four guys?That wasn't part of the deal.I had to choose.And decide it if was worth it.",
