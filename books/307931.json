Then Nathan (the guy I pined over for weeks) decided that was ok to serenate me exactly thirty minutes into our non-date.As he was up in a stage singing the tackiest song in the world, the only logical course of action was to flee, of course.  And sure, it wasn’t the safest thing to do; I know that. I don’t have my phone and my only companion is a stranger named Augusto, and he’s too good looking for his own good.But hey, it’s Christmas in New York and I have twelve parties to go until I can find my friends again. And if Augusto wants to follow me around? Well, he better keep up.\n\n*This charming YA romance novella is perfect for the fans of Rachel Cohn and David Levithan’s DASH AND LILY’S BOOK OF DARES.",
