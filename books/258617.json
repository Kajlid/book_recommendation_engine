  "description": "Fix Marcosa is at war.  The battlefield: New York City.  He knows every street like the back of his hand. The darkened alleyways and back streets conceal secrets only he knows.  Somewhere out there, an unknown element is threatening the life of the woman he loves.  Fix doesn’t mind shedding a little blood to get protect those close to him, though.  He doesn’t mind getting his hands dirty.  And when he goes to war…he sure as hell doesn’t lose.      Sera Lafferty knows what it’s like to run.  She’s been running her whole damn life.  With death now looming over her, it seems as though she must run again if she wants to survive.  The dark, storm-kissed stranger she met in a motel room offers another solution, however.  Fix is a challenge. An enigma. A savage force of nature. He will be her shield against the coming darkness, if only she will let him.  But can she trust the tortured ex-priest to keep her safe?  Should she run from New York as fast as possible?  Or should she stand and fight?      Freaks is the final instalment of the Dirty Nasty Freaks series.    Prepare for blood.    Prepare for betrayal.    Prepare for war.",
