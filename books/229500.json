  "description": "EllieQuick recap. My dad died leaving me an orphan. Jake stepped in and married me rather than letting me go to a foster home. Did I mention I was only sixteen at the time?It was okay for a while until it wasn’t. Because those feelings that I had for Jake as my oldest friend slowly turned into something else over the years. Feelings he could NOT deal with. So I did the right thing and divorced him. It was the right thing. I’m pretty sure it was the right thing.Okay it was probably the wrong thing… but I don’t think either of us know where we go from here.JakeI had to let her go. I had to let her see there was more to the world than the ranch. Than me. She’s never had a choice really, in any of this. I think I did the right thing. I know I did the right thing. Did I do the right thing? More importantly if I didn’t… how do I get her back?",
