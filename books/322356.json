As Liam and Scarlet grow closer, threats from their families, warlocks and their own employer have them questioning whether or not their relationship is meant to be. Before Liam and Scarlet can share their truths, Liam is the victim of a vicious attack that leaves him trapped in wolf form. Now Scarlet must face down not only warlocks, but Liam’s own pack in order to save him. This Little Red Riding Hood is truly lost in the woods, but the Wolf is depending on her to survive, and Scarlet must call on resources and magic she didn’t know she had in order to get her happily ever after.",
