The dean informed him that his father had been murdered in a hideous fashion in St. Louis.When Grip left Ann Arbor, he wasn’t returning to seek vengeance on those who had killed his father. He was going to return and dismantle every bit of his father’s business empire and when he left the city far behind, the only place where anyone could read the name of Lawrence Preston Taylor would be on his gravestone.",
