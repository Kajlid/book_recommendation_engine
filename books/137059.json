  "description": "Saint-Gaudens Cypher glimpses into a world of mystery and secrets… but at what price? In the nineteenth century, secret societies and covert communication were an integral part of sharing information and accomplishing political and religious missions. It was a critical time when certain friendships in America and Europe were perilous and correspondence was intertwined with cyphers, art, and cryptic codes. From 1870–1910, the greatest mass immigration to the United States occurred with an estimated forty-million people. Five million of this wave made New York City their home where a new city emerged from their hard work.A contemporary story with history, Saint-Gaudens Cypher tells a tale of NYU grad student Gwen Young, whose life is suddenly changed forever when she inherits a rare family heirloom—a gold medallion—and the task of deciphering its meaning. With the help of her former love interest, the two venture to Paris, Rome, and Washington D.C. where the world of art, history, religion, and politics converge—and one of America’s most best kept secrets is revealed.",
