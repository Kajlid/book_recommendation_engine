While Darcy isn’t able to grant wishes for herself, she does possess a certain knack for solving problems—including the occasional murder…When Darcy is hired by Elodie Keaton to clean up her missing mother’s disorderly home, the Wishcrafter is certainly up for the task. After all, the motto of her Aunt Ve’s personal concierge service As You Wish is “No Job Impossible.” But beneath the piles of old newspapers and knickknacks Darcy discovers something much more disturbing—Patrice Keaton’s body.Darcy’s determined to give Elodie peace of mind by investigating her mother’s disappearance and death.

Now Darcy has to not only find a killer, she has to find the Anicula—before the power of ultimate wish fulfillment falls into the wrong hands...",
