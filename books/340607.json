Now he's come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchuks, a hell-bent-for-leather attitude and one dark secret, to find nothing much has changed on \"the Rez\"--short of a glimmering new casino, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime. Is he here to set things right or just get a piece of the action?In this volume, we see the landscape of the Prairie Rose reservation through the eyes of a newcomer--a card shark and con man--whose presence could spell doom for one of our main characters.Collects: Scalped #25-29.",
