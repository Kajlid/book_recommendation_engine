  "description": "The Rapture or The Great Tribulation, which will be first? Think you know the answer? Well, hope you are correct because many have it all wrong. The Rapture and the Great Tribulation are two of the major end time prophesies in the Bible yet to be fulfilled. Others are the War of Armageddon and the final Judgment.Today, if the question should be asked of many, “ The Rapture and the Great Tribulation, which is first?” The answers would vary. Some would even say, “Its world without end. Amen. None will ever happen.” The answer to this remarkable question is outline inside, supported by biblical scriptures for your enlightening. The entire book will bring a wide awakening to some facts and clarification of the bible on a whole, and its relationship to man.Some Preachers, Scholars, Theologians and ordinary Christians are saying that we are currently going through the Great Tribulation and the Rapture will be coming soon. The other theory is that currently we are not going through the Great Tribulation, but eventually it will come and the Rapture will follow. Others are saying that Jesus will Rapture the Christians anytime now and the Great Tribulation will follow thereafter. The scriptures that were analyzed will be used to determine which of the two events, whether the Rapture or the Great Tribulation will come first. This will clearly set the record straight and end the debate concerning the two events.",
