His job is manhunting, and he and his crew at Quiet Ops do it better than anyone in the land. When billionaire Grenwald Stanton calls to report his beautiful twin daughters have been 'ruffied' and hooked on heronie by rapper Jo Jo Bling and that he'll pay large for their return, Brad and his boys, T-Rex and Cocoa are on the hunt, and his main lady bounty hunter, Monique, is in the middle of it all. Then when Stanton is kidnapped without paying, ka ka hits the fan. From gold plated Montecito to the gator and snake filled swamps of Florida, it's a manhunt.",
