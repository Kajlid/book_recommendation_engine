  "description": "In this hot new angsty romance from USA Today bestselling author BJ Harvey, the once-burned-forever-commitment-shy best friend from One Shot faces her own moral dilemma of the heart  When life gives me lemons, I always make lemonade.  Living every day like it could be my last, I'm content with the choices I've made and do so unapologetically. With a relationship that makes me happy, and a job that I love, life is good.  But when the man I've just agreed to marry, has his estranged wife and four-year-old daughter turn up on his doorstep, I'm not the only one reevaluating things.  He didn’t plan for that—and I didn’t plan for my childhood sweetheart to return, wanting me back.  Sometimes lemons can be sour, sometimes they can be sweet, and sometimes, all it takes is a second chance to make things right again.  You just need to get that second chance in the first place.",
