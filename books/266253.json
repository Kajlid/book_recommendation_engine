  "description": "\"All I want for Christmas is you.\"   As the youngest son of a Christmas-obsessed family, Micah Winters knows he can't show up to the holiday festivities without a date. So when his long-time crush volunteers to be his fake boyfriend for a week, it's nothing short of a miracle.  Brandon Harris just wants to give his daughter the best Christmas possible, even if it means borrowing his friend's family for a week of holiday zaniness. He just has to find some way to not fall for his sweet, perfect pretend boyfriend.  One fateful kiss under the mistletoe is all it takes to turn Micah and Brandon's fake relationship into something real. But when the holidays are over and their secret is revealed, they'll need more than a little Christmas magic to make it work.  Welcome to Hidden Creek, Texas, where the heart knows what it wants, and where true love lives happily ever after. Every Men of Hidden Creek novel can be read on its own, but keep an eye out for familiar faces around town! This book contains an all-up-in-your-business Southern mama, a Santa with plenty of dad jokes, and a pinch of holiday magic under the mistletoe.",
