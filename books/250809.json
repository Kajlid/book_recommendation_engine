  "description": "I’m a reporter, and I’ve got the best assignment in the world–get dirt on the hottest country star on the charts, Keith Perkins. The sexy beast who rocks those tight jeans like nobody’s business. I’m supposed to learn all of his Dirty Laundry, his deepest and darkest secrets. Without sleeping with him. Easy enough, right? Wrong.  I mean, just looking at him makes me wonder what those big, rough hands could do to me. With a voice that’s one part velvet and one part growl, it’s hard for me to sass him when he melts me into a puddle with a single look.  And when he sings? All bets are off. He owns the stage . . . and maybe some naughty parts of my body too.  But he’s notoriously single and notoriously private.  Given his status as a walking sex god, neither makes sense. Something is amiss, and I’m going to figure out exactly what it is.  But if I’m not careful, I might just become his dirty little secret.  Dirty Talk is a full-length Romance with a happy ever after, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
