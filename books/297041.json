  "description": "There are many ways to be a heroine.Princess and swordswoman, lawyer and motorcyclist, scholar and barbarian: there are many ways to be a heroine. In this anthology, seventeen authors find new ways to pair one weapon-wielding woman and one whose strengths lie in softer skills.“Which is more powerful, the warrior or the gentlewoman?” these stories ask. And the answer is inevitably, “Both, working together!”Herein, you’ll find duels and smugglers, dance battles and danger noodles, and even a new Swordspoint story!From big names and bold new voices, these stories are fun, clever, and always positive about the power of love.Contents:“Margo Lai’s Guide To Dueling Unprepared” by Alison Tam“Princess, Shieldmaiden, Witch and Wolf” by Neon Yang“Elinor Jones vs. the Ruritanian Multiverse” by Freya Marske“Plan Z” by Django Wexler“Little Birds” by Cara Patterson\"Positively Medieval\" by Kaitlyn Zivanovich“Book and Hammer, Blade and Bone” by Ann LeBlanc“What Finds You in the Deep” by K.A.
