  "description": "Her name is Mila. Her adoptive parents have always told her she’s special, but Mila soon realizes that “special” is the understatement of the century. On the last day of school, she notices a glow coming from her body that only she can see. She spends most of that summer at the beach trying to figure out what it means. One afternoon she meets a mysterious old man who gives her a watch. More than just a simple timepiece, the watch ushers her through a doorway into another realm where Mila discovers she is not just an ordinary 11-year old girl from Maryland. Through her adventures, Mila learns that she is gifted, courageous and more powerful than she ever imagined. Under the guidance of the wise and kindly Thornhill and a band of elite warriors, Mila joins the quest to fight the Dark One and return King Jonas to the throne of the Land of Verde.",
