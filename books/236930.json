  "description": "Come share Christmas with your friends at the Vinyl CafeChristmas has always been a special time at the Vinyl Cafe. For two decades, Stuart McLean travelled across the country every December with The Vinyl Cafe Christmas tour, bringing the gift of laughter and light during the darkest days of the year. The hilarious world of Dave and Morley was even more real—more vibrant—during the holidays. For many, the Vinyl Cafe Christmas stories became beloved family traditions. Now, for the first time, they have been brought together in this special collection—including the classic \"Dave Cooks the Turkey,\" as well as five new, never before published Christmas stories. From mishaps with the Turlingtons and the tale of a young Dave's first holiday disaster to the surprising \"Christmas Ferret\" and the touching sign off in \"The Christmas Card,\" these wonderful new stories will delight for years to come.    Brimming with charm and humour (often at Dave's expense), these twelve stories entertain on every page, reminding us what the holidays are all about.",
