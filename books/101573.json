  "description": "Saffron finally has the one thing he's always wanted: a chance to attend school. To be able to do so alongside Prince Cylvan, even while glamoured as a high fey and pretending not to know one another, Saffron is eager to finally experience the education he's always dreamed of.But the expectations of being a perfect fey lord are suffocating enough, and are only made more difficult as the unfettered rowan magic in his body runs wild. Outside of the emotionally-charged nosebleeds that come whenever he's overwhelmed, he's able to keep the magic subdued--until one unfortunate confrontation outside of the school, where it manifests in the form of a nightmare he never thought he'd have to witness again. He desperately needs help understanding how to control his new magic, but there's only one person he knows who can offer mentorship: the stranger who appeared in his hospital room after the events on Ostara.Between acting a high fey, pretending to be courted by Cylvan as strangers, the unexpected difficulties of attending school for the first time, and managing the ancient magic running wild in his veins, Saffron has no choice but to trust Ryder Kyteler who can skip through the veil with ease, and who has been gathering disenfranchised humans to teach them arid magic on the outskirts of Avren for years. Otherwise, the new, violent manifestation of Saffron's magic may hurt the people he cares about most.",
