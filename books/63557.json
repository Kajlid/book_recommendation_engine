  "description": "'Look after the dead', said the priests, 'and the dead will look after you.'Â Wise words in all probability, but a tall order when you have just become the pharaoh of a small and penniless country whose largesse -- and indeed treasury -- is unlikely to stretch to the building of a monumental pyramid to honour your dead father. And particularly when your only visible means of support is a recently acquired qualification from the Guild of Assassins where running a kingdom and basic financial acumen were not prerequisites for course entry.",
