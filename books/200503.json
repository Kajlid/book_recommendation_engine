We do this for they bring us happiness.We do this because they have no defense, nowhere else to go and no one to care for them.We do this in order so that they may teach us what it means to be different, and for us to embrace that difference. Karen Fox, sixteen and recovering from a terrible car crash that claimed the lives of her parents, dreams only of becoming physically able once more. Hearing a strange voice that comes from somewhere near her hospital, she investigates and is kidnapped by an automated ship transporting interstellar animals to a safe haven. Knowing nothing about how to take care of them and disliking animals to begin with, Karen learns the value of caring for interstellar life. And when a marauding band of poachers attacks the vessel intending to seize all the animals, Karen is forced to fight for her own life as well as those animals she has come to care about.",
