  "description": "Welcome to Sarah’s Eatery: serving hot breakfast daily, with complimentary curbside murder!\nWhen Cameron Caldwell, infamously bad waiter and known womanizer, is found dead on the doorstep of Sarah’s Eatery, new owner Kylie Berry yet again becomes the talk of the town.  After very publically rejecting Cam’s amorous advances the day before his death, Zoey Jin, Kylie’s regular customer and fledgling best friend, becomes the prime suspect in his murder. To complicate matters, Zoey’s estranged ex, Max, breezes back into town to exonerate the woman he not long ago abandoned…   \"Winters will have you giggling into your book!\"  Is Zoey, who stuck by Kylie thick-and-thin, truly capable of killing Cam? Was the killer a slighted customer, or a heartbroken woman on his path of emotional destruction? A jealous boyfriend whose girl he stole blazing that path?  Kylie learns the basics of the kitchen, while she and Zoey, with some help from her kitten, Sage, sift through the facts to learn the truth about Cam’s murder!  A Berry Murderous Kitten is the second book in the Kylie Berry Mystery Series. Though it can be read as a standalone, it's best read in series order.  This is a laugh-out-loud cozy mystery featuring a strong female protagonist, some unusual friends and family, and a mystery that needs solving! It has no graphic gore, bad language or sex.   Praise for A.R. Winters:  \"The perfect balance of being lighthearted, but still a serious page-turning mystery.\" - Jaycie D, Amazon.com   \"A fun cozy mystery with engaging and entertaining characters\" - lq, Amazon.com  \"A cute light read with a final twist at the end.\" - Stacey Puleio, Amazon.com",
