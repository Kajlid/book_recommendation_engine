  "description": "'UniverSoul Reflections' is a collection of 5 previously published works: 'A Nonentity With Identity', 'Epistles of Poetic Purity', 'Missives From Within', 'Silent Voice' and 'Verses For The Next Generation' and also includes 6 previously unpublished poems. Peter Mutanda is an artist and cultural activist whose works are inspired by his day to day life experiences, from his humble beginnings in Zimbabwe to living in the USA and Europe. His poetry raises awareness of maladies ravaging the lives of the poor and the corruption committed by elitist members of the ‘big society’. He also questions racial bigotry and explores the current global political and social turbulence.",
