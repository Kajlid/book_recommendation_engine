He sets the stage in Florence for the opening act of a magnificent cultural flowering spread across Europe & continued thru time. Even more than its artistic awakening, the Renaissance stands as a declaration of mental freedom. It was a great contribution to the progress of humankind. \"Dr. Durant has a keen and mordant wit that flashes forth frequently to enliven his pages...he is an artist in words.\"--Saturday Review",
