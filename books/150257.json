  "description": "This is the third book in The Holy Flame Trilogy, which follows the life-changing events that surround Casey Carter (a firefighter/paramedic from Engine Company Fifteen of Denver, Colorado) and an elite, special operations unit called A.N.G.E.L. (Available to Nurture God’s Eternal Love).  With help from a unique band of characters in the Outback, Casey Carter was able to work through her past. However, would it prepare her for what was to come? The battle is forming. Both sides are amassing their troops as allies align, but will there be enough remaining Angels for them to win? Without knowing the day nor the hour, will they be prepared?  What kind of battle would this be if the Angels of flesh and blood were battling against the unseen powers of darkness? This may be the deciding factor in Casey’s struggle for freedom, but will the remaining Angels survive or will it be their final battle?  Revelation 12:12 12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! For the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.",
