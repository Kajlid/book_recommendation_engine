  "description": "\"Just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it can't exist,\" I pointed out. \"You just haven't been in the right place or time before.\"\"Being in the right place and time with Sirenali sounds crazy and scary as hell,\" Jayson breathed. \"Why can't it be some of those short, friendly guys?\"\"There are short, friendly guys, but they don't have any desire to invade somebody else's planet,\" I said, thinking of the Amterean Dwarves. The only thing they might want to invade was Earth's libraries and information systems. Information was more valuable than precious metals on Amterea.\"We're screwed,\" Jayson muttered. Opal stifled a snicker.* * *Earth has been invaded, and those who have made a difference throughout time are targeted. The enemy's goal? Change things in their favor. The General and his servants still have hopes of finding the Mighty, and luring at least one of them into a trap. Will Love, Strength and Wisdom survive, as they struggle to save those who are important to their cause? Only time will tell.",
