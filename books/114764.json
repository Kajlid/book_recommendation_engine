Fifteen years later, Joey La Torre, the Don's brother himself, shows up unannounced at her massage studio and wheedles his way into a date.

As she explores her physical desires to be dominated, she tries to keep Joey at arm's length emotionally.Joey knows he wants Sophie for keeps from the moment he walks into her life. She is hot, classy and full of fire, even though submission turns her on.

Can he reconcile his duty to the organization and his growing need for Sophie to remain in his life permanently?Publisher's Note: The Bossman contains graphic sexual scenes, consensual and non-consensual adult spanking, anal play, elements of BDSM.
