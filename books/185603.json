  "description": "Kip Paxton may be the perfect man. He's a sexy, tattooed, foul-mouthed, drummer god for Broken Access, and if that wasn't enough he’s snagged the Guitar Goddess herself.But in life, where one door opens… another closes, and sometimes the other door bursts wide f---ing open.Finding out he’s been lied to his entire life—and that all his noble deeds were done in vain—sends him spiraling out-of-control. The secrets suck the life right out of him.This time Henley and Kip’s entire crew will have to find a way to put him back together again before they lose him forever.This book is not a stand-alone novel. Books 1-3 in the Guitar Face Series should be read first. If you are looking for a story of redemption with comic relief and a heavy sexual tone, you've found it. If you are offended by hot, tattooed rock stars, who are vulgar then this is not the book for you. Please be warned, this book is not for anyone below the age of 18. The book has sex, death, violence, and harsh language.SERIES REVIEWS: On Broken (Guitar Face, Book 1) “Sasha Marshall created a true-to-life rock-n-roll world that makes you want to quit your job and go on tour with the gang! The friendships are so real, the characters are well-developed, and the music is more than a passing reference… Marshall's characters are complex, flawed, and interesting—and that leads to trouble. The book ends and leaves you aching for more.
