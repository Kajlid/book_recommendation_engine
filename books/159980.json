  "description": "Abigail’s life hung in the balance after Tommy’s vicious attack on her and her unborn babies during a drug induced rage. Abigail had done everything she could to get away from Tommy. She moved out of his house, broke off their relationship, even started to fall in love with Jason but Tommy would not let her go. She wouldn’t be allowed to live a happy life without him in it. As she awakens in a hospital bed, just days after the brutal attack, her life has been irrevocably changed. A life was lost while another struggles. Though she has support from her family and friends, she continues to fall down the rabbit hole of self-loathing.  Jason won’t leave her side, but will their relationship be strong enough to make it through the pain and turmoil of Abby’s ordeal? Will their love be enough to hold them together when a stalker threatens to destroy everything they have? Will Abby and Jason survive?",
