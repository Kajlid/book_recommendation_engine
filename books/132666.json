  "title": "Night is Falling",
  "description": "In a place far from the cruelty and injustice of our world, a group of islanders who had been hidden for many centuries live. Their island is called Al Salam, meaning peace; for they know nothing of the corrupted minds and souls of those beyond the ocean. On this island lives a doubtful boy named Adam, who discloses a shocking secret about his island. No sooner had he started to understand the truth, that dozens of ships locate his dear island and make their way to invade his home. Adam and the islanders have no choice but to fight back. They witness the barbarism that conquers the spirits of those who came from beyond. They watch as their home slowly turns into ruin. Adam's loyalty, pride, and dignity were not to fall to the ground. He knows that Al Salam is the only pure place left in the world, and he isnt prepared to let it fall into the hands of such pitiless creatures. The fact is, before any of us can judge this book, we must ponder upon a very important matter. Is this story exaggerated? Is it really that far from the truth?",
