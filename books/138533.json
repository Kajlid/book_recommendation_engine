  "description": "My twin brother is a people pleaser. A total fucking pushover. A doormat who lets any asshole with an attitude problem walk all over him, and it’s done nothing but piss me the fuck off all of our lives. Especially because I’m usually the asshole who treats him the worst… or at least I used to be before I realized it’s healthier for the both of us, no matter how badly I fucking miss him, if I keep my distance. Which is why it makes no fucking sense at all that I agree to stay with him while my apartment is being repaired.Of course, it makes even less sense that I catch him sleeping on a dog bed once I’m at his place, but making him wear an actual dog collar to go along with it once I do find out? That’s totally on brand for me. It’s exactly the kind of cruel bullshit I can’t seem to stop pulling on him, even if I can’t ever admit to myself why.What I don’t expect, what neither of us do, is how much we both end up liking this twisted little role play we fall into. Because it’s not just the dog bed and the collar. I start calling him my puppy, and he starts acting like he really is one. And that’s not the only thing we find out we like to do together…",
