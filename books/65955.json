  "description": "Hiroko Yuasa, a Japanese traditional dancer, sways and turns in one of her dances, and Simon Fraser thinks he might not have enough film to capture her. He deems himself lucky -- it has taken him months to find her again in Tokyo, after their chance meet at Narita. An American architectural photographer on contract in Japan, he plans already an exhibition with their work together. They take their time in their love. Before any words of a formal proposal are spoken though, her father gets wind of their palpable closeness. Here is a man thought to have killed with a single Katana slash her mother's lover once. Also certifiably known to have risen to be a Japanese Mafia godfather years after pushing the car of a gang of made men into the moat of the Imperial palace. A teenager then. And Kazuhiro Yuasa has for this misalliance of his daughter only the eyes of a man whose father was a Kamikaze pilot who died by throwing his plane against an American warship during WWII. An ocean proves too small for Kazuhiro to fail to get understanding from Simon's parents to do together whatever it takes to keep the young couple separate. And close-to-the-heart history has a huge bearing. Simon and Hiroko are not aware of the secret agreement, and they decide to visit each the family of the other. Their \"Sakura\" space of love should help them keep in touch. They believe things are going to be OK. Only they're not, for when evil is started it has a mind of its own.",
