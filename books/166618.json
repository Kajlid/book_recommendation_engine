Trungpa teaches us to let go of the urge to make meditationserve our ambition; thus we can relax into openness. We are shown how thedeliberate practice of mindfulness develops into contrived awareness, and wediscover the world of insight that awareness reveals. We learn of a subtlepsychological stage set that we carry with us everywhere and unwittingly use tostructure all our experience—and we find that meditation gradually carries usbeyond this and beyond ego altogether to the experience of unconditionedfreedom.",
