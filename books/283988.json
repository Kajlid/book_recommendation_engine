  "title": "Brown River: A Novel",
  "description": "Brown River is the story of Constance Gonzalez, an uncanny tomboy raised on the eastern shore of Maryland, as she journeys to become a charter boat captain on the Chesapeake Bay.  Evocative of Marilynne Robinson's Gilead and Housekeeping, and Wendell Berry's Jayber Crow, Brown River is both a tribute to the power of kinship, and a celebration of the hidden graces found in ordinary life.  Weaving together family history, boating lore, and mystery, Constance's story uncovers the meaning of memory, the frailty of relationships, the struggle and dignity of honest work.  Told in language colorful and meditative, Brown River is one woman's story of home- finding it, keeping it, and sharing it as an inheritance.",
