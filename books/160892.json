His mother is two years in the grave and his father fights an ongoing battle with shell shock and drink.Before Malcolm can make a decision, someone dear to him is murdered. Soon thereafter, a mysterious young woman offers her help to find the killer and the alliance complicates his life even further. His only real support comes from his friend Sid Shapiro and a Chinese urchin called Jun. Together, they discover the connection between the murder and the looming crisis.Fear of a vicious policeman prevents Malcolm from reporting those facts to the authorities. It becomes a race against time as the alleyways of Stepney, Whitechapel and Limehouse become even more dangerous. Will Malcolm and his mates prove themselves up to the challenge?",
