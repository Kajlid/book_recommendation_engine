  "description": "1898. Most of Shaw's early plays were either banned by the censor or refused production. With Plays: Pleasant and Unpleasant he sought a reading audience. He also began the practice of writing the challenging, mocking, eloquent prefaces to his plays, which were sometimes longer than the play itself. This volume contains the Unpleasant: Widowers' Houses; The Philanderer; and Mrs. Warren's Profession.",
