She attends Hamilton Prep, Washington D.C.’s most prestigious high school, where everyone is related to someone in power, except her. When Hamilton Prep receives a flood of new students, Carter’s role as social outcast changes when she makes two unexpected friends. Friends who are hiding a secret.  As Carter uncovers the truth, she confronts challenges she is unequipped to handle and eventually finds herself in a dangerous situation.  For a girl trained to see everything, Carter never saw this coming.",
