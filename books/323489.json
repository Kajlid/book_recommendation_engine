  "description": "HudsonI didn’t plan on kissing my best friend’s twin sister… or falling for her. But it happened all the same. It’s always been Riley, but after I finally get the chance to taste her lips, she ghosts me.Not exactly the response I was hoping for. Getting out of town for a while, and giving her space, seemed like the best thing for us both. Until the night before my year overseas, and she ended up in my bed.I thought leaving her was the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced, but returning home to find her with a newborn and knowing she’s moved on is a sucker punch to the gut. She can push me away all she wants, but the sexy single mom better get used to me being around, because I’m home to stay.RileyI’ve had a thing for Hudson Fleming for as long as I can remember. But I couldn’t get past his friendship with my sister. When I hear that he’s planning on leaving town, I know it’s now or never. Spending the night with him changes my life¾in more ways than one.Now he’s halfway around the world, and I’m pregnant. Having this baby alone doesn’t scare me half as much as my feelings for Hudson.When he returns to town, I’m torn between loving and hating him. How can I not since he gave me the greatest gift, then walked away from us both? And now he wants to be a family… like he didn’t break my heart into a million pieces.",
