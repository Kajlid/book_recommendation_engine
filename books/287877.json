  "description": "LiamFamily, soccer, and friends, it’s what I’m best at.And after Lucy left seven months ago, it’s all I’ve focused on.The last year of college is here, and aside from soccer, I don’t know what I want.Especially after screwing my best friend, the girl with ripped jeans, Doc Martens, and a spicy attitude. Since then, Vanessa’s attitude isn’t the only thing spicing up between us either.Do I take the risk, knowing I could lose my best friend?Or stay friends and miss out on the greatest love of my life?I’m bound to screw something up.After all, I’m Liam Raynolds.VanessaI’m always hiding under my laptop or books, bidding in digital currency, hacking, or getting lost with the month’s current read, anything to keep everyone at an arm’s length and my armor intact from becoming someone’s second in life.Because somehow, I always am.And the last thing I expected as an international student was finding a best friend who easily chipped away and closed that distance without a trail.I never planned for Liam; it just happened.I know what I want, but the clock is ticking, and once I graduate in the fall, I’ll be gone.Decisions need to be made.But who’s flipping the coin?",
