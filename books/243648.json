  "description": "Warren isn't what you'd call \"cool.\" He doesn't have a lot of what you'd call \"friends.\" Or any friends at all, actually. But being a high school outcast doesn't bother Warren much. He has enough fun playing Call of Duty and trolling the most popular girl at school. However, when Kid, a chiseled Greek god of a high school football player, moves into the neighborhood, Warren suddenly finds himself with a social life. Eager to dangle his handsome new acquaintance in front of the popular girl, Warren makes a misstep that jeopardizes his first friendship in years. Kid was his friend, right? Do friends conspire to play practical jokes that trick their whole school into believing a ruse? Do friends have this many rules? Do friends... kiss?",
