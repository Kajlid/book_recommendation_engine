Shots are poured, a question asked, and only absolute truth can be the answer. Kylie Halston has been playing the game with her roommates, Colt and Heath, since their freshmen year of college.On his twenty-fifth birthday, Heath poses a question: What is your ultimate sex fantasy? While Colt and Heath s fantasies are too hot for words, it s Kylie s sex dream that hits a little too close to home for all of them. Her wish? For a menage a trois with two men, complete with bondage and a bit of spanking for good measure.Colt and Heath are only too willing to make Kylie s fantasies come true and they make a proposal one no-holds-barred, sexed-up weekend where nothing is off the menu. The only question is, come Monday, will their platonic relationship survive the passion?\"",
