  "description": "Time is relative. You’re born. You live, and you die, your lifespan predisposed by your species, your health, and your luck. But what if there were a species who colored outside the lines?In Back Bay, Massachusetts, dwells such a person. She goes about her life wanting nothing more than to run her business, right some wrongs, and never love again. She keeps her footprint small and her circle of acquaintances even smaller, and she’s an expert at it. So, when her neighbor, Ruby Miller, makes her interest known, it falls on ears deafened by centuries of life.Betrayal leaves scars. Imprinted on your heart and in your mind, they simmer under the surface of every hour of every day of every year, constant reminders of pain, sadness, and loss. Some handle those wounds with retaliation, paying back the hurt with hurt of their own, while others use the ache of a fractured heart like a talisman. Forever holding onto a keepsake filled with the ruins of love gone wrong, they erect walls and promise themselves they’ll never love again.Just because you deny it, doesn’t make it go away. Just because you put others in its path, doesn’t weaken its hold. And just because you’ve loved and lost countless times, doesn’t mean the right love won’t come along. Love is not ruled by the brain, but rather the heart…and even the most damaged is not immune to its sway.",
