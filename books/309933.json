  "title": "Litost: Sliced Stories",
  "description": "'Litost' is an untranslatable Czech word, that loosely means a state of being in an inexplicable mix of remorse and misery that someone has brought upon oneself by her / his own actions.This collection of short stories or rather slice stories have been chosen to be compiled under this particular title because each of these stories deals with the way emotional urges change the course of human lives and lead the characters into a state of ‘litost’.Individual urges have the power to bind our destinies together across the labyrinth of human connections; across national, religious and ideological divides. Through these pages, you will meet some characters and some remains of characters, some stories and some abstractions. There are a few stories from this side of life and a few from the other side. The enormous upheavals that occur in our lives are too miniscule on the immense atlas of emotional energies, which don’t just keep the world going through evolution towards its own end, but also bind the other dimensions of this world around us, that’s inaccessible to senses of the living.At this very moment, while you are reading the summary of this book, somewhere in this world, souls are leaving the bodies they inhabited – some willfully, many unwillingly. Somewhere new lives are entering this world – almost all crying, while people around them smile, and those who are born with no tears in their eyes or wails in their throats, are surrounded by anxious eyes. All this is happening within thick layers of emotions, while you settle down to get lost in these pages full of stories.After all, we are just products of one urge or another!",
