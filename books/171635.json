  "description": "Jake Mitchell has spent his whole life tied at the hip with his best friend and twin brother Jax. They’ve shared everything, except for women, which was easy since their tastes were so different. From the moment she walked into the room Jake knew she was special, with her flowing brown locks, supple body, and a smile that could brighten any day. An accident leaves her vulnerable and in the arms of his brother. From that moment she’s in awe of Jax. Jake tries his best to keep away from Reese Miller. He disrespects her and tells everyone how much she annoys him to make sure she stays at a distance. Reese can’t stand that Jake hates her. She’s determined to change his mind, not knowing he’s desperately trying to protect his relationship with his brother, and his family. When the two find themselves alone during a winter storm all bets are off, and what happens next could change everything, including the bond between two brothers.",
