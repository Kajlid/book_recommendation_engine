  "description": "It Takes a Thief to Catch a Sunrise is a re-issue of the previously released 'The Northern Sunrise'. It is a stand alone book by the author of The Ties that Bind trilogy. Set in a new world of corruption, deceit and thievery; mixing magical fantasy and alchemypunk with a healthy smattering of airshippery.  \"There comes a point in every thief's life where one has to take stock of all that they have achieved. We have stolen almost everything there is worth stealing: Prince Henri's Jadefire ring, the Marquisse d'Bola's collection of prized toy soldiers, Elize Gion's Living Autumn, the very first airship schematic, and who could forget we definitely made off with Baron Rivette's pride.  The trick, I find, is not to break in. No. The trick is to convince the mark to invite you in.\"",
