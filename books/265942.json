  "description": "In part one, Stanley has a life changing road trip with Jeff. The two of them have a large number of strange experiences with people from many walks of life and then they drive away to get Stanley to his new job on time. While Stanley is at his new job in part 2, he is too busy learning and growing to spend time reflecting on that trip. But, the short term contract is just a short term contract and ends, leaving his future uncertain but hopeful. Now it is time for the trip back home and Jeff offers to keep him company on the trip. Stanley knows this means it wonâ€™t be a simple road trip but also knows his time with Jeff is not over. He knows there is more to learn and more vertical growth in store for him.",
