  "description": "Sometimes it looked like spilt milk, but it wasn't spilt milk... What was it?Sometimes it looked like a rabbit and sometimes it looked like a birthday cake. Sometimes it looked like a tree. It was really most interesting. It looked like so many things. And such different things, too. As different as a mitten and a Great Horned Owl. Sometimes it looked like spilt milk, but it wasn't spilt milk... What was it?This is the question that will keep small children engaged, guessing and curious, through the pages of It Looked Like Spilt Milk until the very end, when they learn that it wasn't spilt milk but... what it was.The intriguing form of the book, and the ending itself, will present a delightful idea to children, one that will probably not end with the closing of the book. Mr. Shaw has done it in a simple pattern that children will catch on to easily. It is something they can take part in themselves, and that is what they like best of all.",
