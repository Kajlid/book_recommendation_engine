  "description": "THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER.Lil Marchette, vampire extraordinaire and owner of Manhattan's hottest hook-up service, is an expert at matching up the lonely and desperate (and sometimes dead). And thanks to the popular local reality dating show Manhattan's Most Wanted, Lil has plenty of fresh blood to add to the mix-including the biggest, baddest vampire in the Big Apple. Vinnie Balducci, Brooklyn representative for the Snipers of Otherworldly Beings, is making Lil an offer she can't refuse: find him the perfect woman or she's going to be swimming with the fishes.But Lil may not be the only one taking the plunge. The three hunky demon Prince brothers are poking around Lil's office-hot on the trail of a rogue spirit trying to escape the land down under (not Australia) by possessing some poor, clueless human soul. Then Lil makes a startling discovery: The oblivious human vessel is none other than her loyal assistant, Evie. Between saving Evie from eternal damnation and saving herself from Vinnie's lethal ultimatum, Lil is sure to be in for the most hellish ride of her afterlife.\"Lil is a likable mix of Bridget Jones, Carrie Bradshaw and Dracula-charming, sweet, stylish, with just a hint of fang.\"-Parkersburg News and Sentinel",
