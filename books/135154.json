Sometimes shocking and always moving, there is also warmth and humour as Susan creates a gripping picture of the conflict and tells of her familyï¿½s survival when many of her friends and neighbouring farmers didnï¿½t.The book is a testament to the courage displayed by so many people who were tested day after day by almost unimaginable horrors.",
