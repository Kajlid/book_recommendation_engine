  "description": "This is the third book in a series of 4 adventure/fantasy novels concerning two teenage boys, Eddie and Len. The first, 'The Fantastic Journey' was published by Arima in August 2008(ISBN 978-1-84549-311-0) and is available from their website, www.arimapublishing.co.uk or from Amazon. The second, 'Anywhere and Nowhere' (ISBN 978-0-9559872-0-5)is available from www.Lulu.com. 'The Haunting of Eddie Compton' continues the fantastic adventures of the first two books and delves also into the ghost world. Like the first two books, 'The Haunting of Eddie Compton', is suitable for all ages and is a good family read for grandparents and grandchildren alike, particularly for the nostalgia generated by the setting of 1960s East Anglia where boys still dreamed of traditional adventure and Ipods hadn't been invented. The fourth and final book: 'Heaven on Earth' is also now available to buy from www.Lulu.com",
