  "description": "Savannah Aries is a passionate, contemporary woman of a certain age, who discovered that a healthy sense of humor and adventure is required to \"stay in the game\" of love. Savannah decided to claim and advocate Pleasure As A Higher Calling. In this first collection of intimate short stories, she invites us into her world and shares her thoughts and feelings about the lusty new lease on life she discovers when she begins to Wake Up. From the first story of becoming an inadvertent cougar, to her humorous forays into the virtual online dating world of love and sex, and her inventive ways of coping with the annoyances of air travel, Savannah entertains us with both the details of her amorous encounters and the unique philosophy she has come to embrace.",
