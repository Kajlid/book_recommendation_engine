  "description": "A book of laughter and regretting Magicov the Magnificent, great illusionist, earns his living entertaining the geriatrics of Lotus House Care-home. But Mr Magicov (also known as Peter) envies them - they've mastered a trick that eludes him. They can forget. There are so many things Peter yearns to the shameful moment an eight-year-old wrecked his life; the FBI agent who hunted him like a dog; that suitcase stuffed with a million pounds. More than anything Peter wants to forget Kate, the expert con woman. The one he loved and left. For renowned brain-scientist Dr Chris Tavasligh, Peter's craving to escape makes him the perfect candidate for his bold experiment in changing minds - forever. Faced with such an opportunity, will Peter go through with it? And if he does, who will he become?",
