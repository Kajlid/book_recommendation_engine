  "description": "I’m certain If your heart could sing me a song it would leave me in awe As a child and a kid to a mature adult What you’ve accomplished, seen, and learn from your dreams Can only be digested through song So to break the ice I'll sing first Take a seat Pour a drink And as SOARH plays the strings you can sing along -edú",
