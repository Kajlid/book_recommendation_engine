  "description": "An epic fantasy novel by Marie BrowneWhen the archangel Metatron offers his incompetent human assistant Joe, one final chance to cleanse his sullied soul, he jumps at the chance. But with Armageddon looming, Joe had better find out what's really going on, because, once Lucifer is released, any human will have missed their chance to pick a side.However, as he prepares to deliver Graham Latimer, Lucifer's unwilling and confused human host to the angels, Joe discovers that all may not be as it seems. Hell is no longer the realm of eternal torment and Metatron's actions are not divinely inspired. Pursued by the very angels with whom he has worked for so long, Joe travels with a diverse group of 'demons' through what is left of the seven circles in an attempt to keep Graham safe and stop Metatron from fooling the other angels into destroying the world. Facing his own personal demons, which are far more dangerous than those creatures around him and trying to find the 'truth' amongst the varying shades of grey that make up 'good' and 'evil', Joe has just one chance to make a difference. However any change is going to come at a cost and nobody, demon, angel or human, wants to pay the price.",
