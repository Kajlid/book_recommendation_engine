  "description": "The Enneagram—an ancient Sufi nine-pointed diagram—can help readers discover their own personality type as well as the personalities of the important people in their lives. Whether a perfectionist, a giver, a performer, an epicure, a mediator, a boss, or any one of nine basic types, readers of Mary Horsley's fascinating self-help guide can use this unique method as an important step in making the most of their skills and talents. Her handsomely illustrated book opens with a history of the Enneagram, then focuses on each of the nine Enneagram types. Employing both yoga and chakra techniques, she recommends postures and exercises to activate the knowledge her reader gains from the Enneagram and thus transform and improve all aspects of everyday life. Here is a fascinating way for readers to make the most of their personality traits, emphasize their strengths, and eradicate their weaknesses. The intriguing text is complemented with approximately 100 color photos.",
