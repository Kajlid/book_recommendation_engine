Well, FORGET IT!Dozens of hilarious family situations in “Memoirs of a Trumpet Teacher” include lessons being taught in a car and a car hood flying up while on the highway. Animals even abound, with dogs ‘losing control’ on feet, Beagles singing along, and a Chihuahua biting family members in awkward places.You’ll discover a slithering salamander sneaking into a trumpet, and talking birds that repeat embarrassing comments. You’ll also find maniacal musical colleagues, with a toilet plunger and even a trip to the hospital described in detail.",
