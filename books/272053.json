  "description": "Betrayal has taken Taylor far beyond my reach.\n\nI can feel the bond stretched and twisted until itâ€™s on the verge of snapping. But I will find her. She is mine as I am hers, and nothing will stop me from recovering my queen. I will always come for her. If she is hurt, I will heal her. If she is scared, I will wrap my arms around her, my embrace her safe harbor.\n\nAnd as for the ones who took her?\n\nI will destroy them all. Crossing the frozen heart of winter will be their final mistake. My fury will end the king beyond the mountain, and I will return to the winter realm with my queen by my side. A solid plan. One that would have worked. But when I reach the Gray Mountains, nothing is as it seems, and my mate faces a danger from the most insidious of foes - herself.",
