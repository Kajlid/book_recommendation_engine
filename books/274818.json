  "description": "I woke up in the hospital with no memories of who I was or how I'd ended up there. I thought that information about my life before the hospital would be easy to find, but all I've hit are dead ends. Now I’m moving back to the island where we spent summers I don't remember. And what’s worse, they are forcing me to go back to high school for another year to help me \"adjust\". Hopefully I’ll find some answers to my past there, while I try to figure out what to do with my future. Warning: This series will cover sensitive topics and may not be for everyone. Reader discretion is advised. The Magic Catalyst Chronicles is a series that will cross from young adult to new adult content.",
