  "description": "One abandoned, one unfinished, these short works show Austen equally at home with romance and social change. A widowed clergyman with four daughters must needs be in search of a husband or two, in The Watsons, as three badly behaved daughters search for husbands with the help of a recently reunited sister. In Sanditon, the recently arrived Charlotte Heywood becomes enthralled with a new, commercial seaside resort's scandalous residents.Typically touching, funny, charming and sharp.4 hrs 29 min",
