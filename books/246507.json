  "description": "***** \"I wrote this book, and the person quoting me here is taking credit for it.\"--- Randall Monroe, creator of XKCDPeter Bolton is just a normal, middle-aged guy looking to buy a home for him and his wife, and he eventually finds one in the quirky Hispanic neighborhood of Little Peru. Almost immediately, though, Peter reconsiders his decision of buying a condo in a recently gentrified building of comical lunatics. If that wasnâ€™t enough, he also begins to have serious concerns about this locale after a number of his immigrant neighbors go missing and after encountering a number of strange incidents, least of which is a female apparition that seems to haunt his stairwell. His investigations of these streets (both above ground and below) uncover a shady cast of unlikely friends and sinister foes. Facing threats to his life and well-being, he must now figure out how to save his new neighborhood and himself. In the end, though, Peter can only overcome if he reconciles his current life with a dark chapter of his past in West Virginia.",
