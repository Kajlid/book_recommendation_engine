  "description": "In book No. 1, an otherworld omen pays Derek a visit, haunting the ex-salesman with his past and the whip cracking witch he left behind. This new romance series follows two passionate pagans. Soulmates since birth, Derek and Faith were never lovers...just two driven spirits headed down two separate paths. Derek always dreamed of having a big warm family and falling in love with a woman nothing like his cold corporate mother. Faith had her practical heart set on landing a top floor executive suite by the time she turned thirty, hoping to settle down with a man completely opposite from Derek and her stir-crazy father. Heartbreak and betrayal forced the two friends apart, but it turns out they didn’t need each other to achieve their greatest goals. Now three years later and miles of unspoken distance between them, they’ve both dead-ended in the aftermath of finally getting what they always wanted. This new romance series is about addiction and loss. About walking on the edge without falling off, and never giving up on pursuing eternal happiness. After the High No. 1 features adult topics, layered around a passionate love story, a heartwarming plot and a touch of twisted humor. No. 2 coming soon - feel free to follow me or visit my blog for updates & more.18+ only",
