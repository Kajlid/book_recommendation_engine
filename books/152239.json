Conversely, things that are too near and attached and, therefore, defy perception, may become perceptible with detachment from a distance, putting aside the stereotypes thrust by the external world upon the internal psyche. Kit, the protagonist, takes his friend Doctor Adam Smith, the narrator, to this alien planet Hoola, millions of light years away from Earth. Hoola is a unique multi-coloured planet, and so is the alien Hoo race that lives on it. Kit vows to harmonise the Hoo race fragmented by their colour differences. The odds are heavily against him.A Sword of honour has to be recovered from the enemy. Ages old anomalies have to be set right. Kit’s unifying efforts inevitably produce ugly reactions from the divisive forces. He is abducted by a ruthless cunning despot. Death is the order for Kit. What happens then?In the end, was it all Doctor Adam’s dream or did he actually visit the planet Hoola?",
