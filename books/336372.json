  "description": "Tatsuya Ishida's daily strip has become one of the world's most-read and longest-running webcomics. Drawing on wide-ranging influences--most notably Bill Watterson's remarkable Calvin and Hobbes--Sinfest xplores religion, advertising, sex, and politics in a way fleen.com calls \"both brutally funny and devastatingly on-target.\" In an era when most newspaper strips have become watered down and uninspired, Sinfest comes as a breath of fresh air!This volume collects nearly six hundred Sinfest strips--including the first installments of Ninja Theatre, beat poetry, calligraphy lessons, and the irresistible Pooch & Percival strips--with an introduction by Dirk Deppey of the Comics Journal and a peak at Sinfest's college-newspaper origins.",
