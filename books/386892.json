  "title": "When Tito Loved Clara",
  "description": "Clara Lugo grew up in a home that would have rattled the most grounded of children. Through brains and determination, she has long since slipped the bonds of her confining Dominican neighborhood in the northern reaches of Manhattan. Now she tries to live a settled professional life with her American husband and son in the suburbs of New Jersey―often thwarted by her constellation of relatives who don’t understand her gringa ways.Her mostly happy life is disrupted, however, when Tito, a former boyfriend from fifteen years earlier, reappears. Something has impeded his passage into adulthood. His mother calls him an Unfinished Man. He still carries a torch for Clara; and she harbors a secret from their past. Their reacquaintance sets in motion an unraveling of both of their lives and reveals what the cost of assimilation―or the absence of it―has meant for each of them.This immensely entertaining novel―filled with wit and compassion―marks the debut of a fine writer.",
