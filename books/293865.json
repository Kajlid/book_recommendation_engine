  "description": "Graham Wyatt is 6'2 of muscled, tattooed, angsty Alpha male (don't forget the man bun) . . . but sorry, ladies! He's a one-woman man. Specifically, Mackenzie Thatcher, the love of his life whose heart he broke five years ago. Now that he's out of prison (yes, prison . . . it's a long story) he's determined to redeem himself and prove he's reformed his bad boy ways so she'll give him a second chance. Mackenzie Thatcher has vowed off love forever. She's already experienced excruciating heartbreak, and she has no intention of ever getting near that particular fire again . . . especially with the very man who burned her in the first place. She's perfectly happy being a badass independent woman, thank you very much. That is, until seeing Graham again stirs up feelings she doesn't know what to do with (besides a little quality time with her B.O.B.). She's not going to give in easily, but he isn't afraid to play a little dirty. (Like that time he showed up to her yoga class and took off his shirt . . . ) Graham will do whatever it takes to win her back, even when some drug-dealing demons from his past show up and threaten to ruin everything. Contains mature themes.",
