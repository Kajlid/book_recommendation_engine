  "title": "Bloodletting: Book 3.1 - Danny",
  "description": "Danny's story is one that I nailed down a long time ago and had to go back and reread and make a lot of adjustments for to fit with more recent stuff I've written. She was also meant to be a disturbing, tragic character, but man, I must have been in a weird place when I wrote this initially, because it's pretty dark. I can't promise that the series will or won't get this dark again, but it's certainly an example of how cruel the world these characters live in can get.Â Like so many of these first books, there's no real chronological importance. Technically, it's a part of book 3 (this being Book 3, volume 1) so if were were reading it all as one big story, it would come later. But I felt like putting it out sooner, just because it teases us a bit more on who Charlie and Vickie, our lead vampires are. And who Beth was.",
