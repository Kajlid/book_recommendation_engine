  "description": "Introducing Jessi Klein, a Nora Ephron for a new generation. Both a tomboy and a late bloomer, she grew up always feeling like more of an observer than a participant in the rites of modern femininity. You'll Grow Out of It is a funny and incisive collection of real life stories in which Klein explores the milestones of the twenty-first century woman: from trying to sculpt the perfect butt (one that looks like two floating tennis balls), to attempting to find watchable porn (the kind where no one cries), and deconstructing Oprah's obsession with taking baths (there's no place on dry land where women are left alone). Throughout the journey, Klein's voice is both hilariously relatable and raw.",
