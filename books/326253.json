  "description": "I moved to Chicago six months ago, determined to finally open my own bakery. My landlady was this sweet woman who treated me like her granddaughter.Then she sold the house. Now the devil himself is my landlord and neighbor since I live in the guesthouse on his property. Declan Maxwell is moody, unreasonable, and takes himself far too seriously. Unfortunately for me, he’s also damn sexy.When he shows up on my doorstep in the middle of the night ordering me to turn down the music, I give him hell. Secretly, I’m also checking him out. We go toe to toe like this almost every night.The man is impossible. But here’s the thing. I need a place to stay while I save for my business and this place is a steal. So, I need to put up with this handsome devil, though from a distance—because he’s far too gorgeous.Then one day I come home injured from work and he surprises me by taking care of me.And kissing me.And just like that, all my best intentions go up in smoke.",
