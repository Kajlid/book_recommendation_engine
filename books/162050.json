  "description": "Dave Logan, the owner of Deep Six Security, is stunned when Dallas FBI head, Susan Whitmore, darkens his doorstep accusing him of being the cause of her losing her job, and demanding he hire her. Even as his brain says no way, the Barracuda is a woman nobody can work with, his white-knight complex forces him to offer her a job as his very overqualified temporary secretary.  A wealthy couple who ordered a designer baby which wasn’t delivered contacts Dave for help. To get answers for them, Dave has to get inside an overly-fortified fertility clinic going undercover with Susan as his temporary wife. The situation inside is worse than they imagined, and soon their pretend ‘til death do us part’ could become very real unless the two alpha personalities learn to work together to stay alive.  Till Death is the first book in a brand new erotic romantic suspense series, Deep Six Security, by New York Times, USA Today and Amazon Bestselling Author Becky McGraw.",
