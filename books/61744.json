  "description": "Overview With her latest sizzling release, Vampire, Vampire, New York Times and USA Today bestselling paranormal romance author Heather Killough-Walden shares two scorchingly hot, sweet and savage stand-alone vampire romance novellas. (Total word count approx. 70,000 words) In Relentless: The Patrick Sinclaire Story, readers are treated to the re-visioned and border-line erotic telling of the tale of a handsome, world-weary vampire sovereign and the woman he would literally do anything to claim as his queen. Intensely arousing, stimulating, and both emotionally and physically provoking - this is not a story for the shy. In Thorn and Grace, an old tale of historical romance is given a very dark make-over. The story of knight meets maiden becomes twisted and shadowed, befanged and fallen. A prince turned predator hunts for the one who has betrayed him, in turn becoming a king corrupted by the bitterness within. Will the one he his hunting escape him? And if she doesn't, will she be able to reach the man inside the monster before it's too late?",
