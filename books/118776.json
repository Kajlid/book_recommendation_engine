  "description": "Rachel Silver is independent and likes it that way. It hardly bothers her that she hasnâ€™t even had a relationship in over a year. Her goals are firmly set on her career. That was until her love of hockey, and her best friend, crossed paths with Max Crawford.  Even though Max Crawford has had a wild side, there was something about Rachel when he saw her for the first time. Maybe it was her smart mouth, or her sexy lips? Nonetheless, he wanted her.  Finally, Max is able to start a relationship with her, but will her stubborn attitude be the downfall of their relationship? Or could Max break the ice that hold her firm?",
