  "description": "Impulse control is not my darling puppy’s strong suit. Most of the time, I find that endearing. It certainly helps us find willing partners to join us for a scene or two. As long as it doesn’t put Quent in a position to get hurt, I’m on board. But when their spontaneity combined with their huge heart results in them offering to be their brother’s surrogate, let’s just say, I have my doubts.Quent refuses to be deterred from their path despite the risks. As their mommy, my number one job is to take care of them, no matter my misgivings. That includes arranging the details and supporting them through the pregnancy and beyond. If we’re both lucky, I might just get to give them every kinky desire of their heart along the way.Quent and I have learned over the years that we can resolve most of our problems with clear communication. I just hope that includes the bumps along the way to helping my brothers-in-law grow their family.Puppy Love is an F/X puppy play romance between an established couple. Kylee is a transgender web designer and mommy to Quent, a nonbinary pharmacy tech and pup. It includes puppy play, surrogacy, pregnancy (and related gender dysphoria and anxiety around medical care), ethical non-monogamy, light medical/veterinary kink, breeding kink, and boot worship.",
