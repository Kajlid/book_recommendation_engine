  "description": "Olivia Lockhart-Griffin Cedar Cove, Washington Dear Reader, Do you remember Teri Miller? She works at Get Nailed, the beauty salon here in town. Well, Teri got married a little while ago—to Bobby Polgar, the famous chess champion. They've moved into a beautiful house, 74 Seaside Avenue, which has a spectacular view of Puget Sound. Teri's my hairdresser, and she confided that something seems to be worrying Bobby. When she asked him about it, he told her he was \"protecting his queen,\" and she got the oddest feeling that he wasn't talking about chess, but about her. Rachel Pendergast also works at Get Nailed, and I've heard that she has two men seriously interested in her. I also wanted to tell you that Linnette McAfee, who's Roy and Corrie's daughter, recently left town because her love life fell apart. We all know about that kind of trouble. Oh, by the way, Teri says we should come in soon for a manicure and a chat…. Olivia",
