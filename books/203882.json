  "description": "Seventeen-year-old November Lonergan spent her whole life feeling like an outsider. She was right. She’s a reaper like her mother and like her two cousins, Kai and Tristin. The supernatural world believes the three teens are part of a prophecy to save them from an evil known as the Grove. Ember just wants to survive high school and fix the fallout from bringing back her friend. Old enemies are lurking, waiting for their opportunity to strike, but the pack has a new problem. A group of legendary hunters has resurfaced, threatening the reapers and anybody who stands with them. They are making good on their threats, too, attacking those closest to the pack. Their only hope of defeating the Legionaries involves trusting a stranger to perform a dangerous spell to advance Ember’s and her cousins’ powers. But Ember has a secret; a secret she can’t tell the pack. One that leaves the pack vulnerable.An attack on pack allies leaves one member of the group injured and another missing, and then there’s a mysterious girl named Evangeline, who may play a bigger part in this than any of them realize. As the Legionaries close in, the pack must trust their enemies, enter hostile territories, and play a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a psychopath. Their entire plan lynches on a dangerous bargain, but rescuing one member of the pack could mean losing another in their place…possibly forever.",
