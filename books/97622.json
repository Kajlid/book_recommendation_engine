  "description": "Lena hates everything about being a vampireâ€”the dull, torch-lit castle she lives in, her meddling immortal family, and especially her stalker-like sire Declan. After two decades of being miserable in this pseudo-life she can't remember choosing, Lena discovers her escape has been within her reach all along. As Lena runs from the only reality she knows and tries to survive in the modern human world, she learns the real reason she was made immortal and that nothing about her existence, her family, or her sire is as simple as she thought. One day on the outside begins a chain of events that will change Lena in ways she could never have imagined.",
