  "description": "As the Netherlands descends into the chaos of religious and political civil war, Crazy Greta runs her tavern, keeping order among the drinkers with her skillet. But when the Dead rise from their graves to slaughter the living, Greta faces a far greater challenge. Crazy Gretaâ€™s journeys take her across a land torn by war between life and death, through Hell itself, and even to the besieged gates of Heaven. Greta must confront Death, Satan, God, and her own madness before she can return home.",
