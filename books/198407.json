  "description": "On the centennial of Joseph Mitchell's birth, here is a new edition of the classic collection containing his most celebrated pieces about New York City. Fifty years after its original publication, \"TheBottom of the Harbor\" is still considered a fundamental New York book. Every story Mitchell tells, every person he introduces, every scene he describes is illuminated by his passion for the eccentrics andeccentricities of his beloved adopted city.All of the pieces here are connected in one way or another--some directly, some with a kind of mysterious circuitousness--to New York's fabled waterfront, theterrain that Mitchell brilliantly made his own. They tell of a life that has passed--of vacant hotel rooms, deserted communities, once-thriving fishing areas that are now polluted and studded with wrecks. Included are\"Up in the Old Hotel,\" a portrait of Louis Morino, the proprietor of a restaurant called (to his disgust) Sloppy Louie's; \"The Rats on the Waterfront,\" which has inspired countlesswriters to attempt portraits of these most demonized New Yorkers; and \"Mr. Hunter's Grave,\" widely considered to be the finest single piece of nonfiction to have ever appeared in the pages of \"TheNew Yorker.\"Here is the essential work of a legendary writer. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",
