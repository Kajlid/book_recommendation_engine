  "description": "Arabella They call me The Cursed Widow. After the luck I’ve had lately I’m starting to really believe I am cursed. I have always played pretend, always pretended everything was okay when my own life was spiraling out of my control. I’ve pretended my demons weren’t sucking the life out of me. Now that my second husband is dead, I am enjoying her newfound freedom. Except now Chicago isn’t a safe place for me anymore. Marco Ricci’s men are angry and they won’t stop until every last Moretti is dead. I am forced to leave Chicago and be with my brother, Lazzaro, in Italy, permanently. I’m not ready to say goodbye to my friends, not ready to leave my family or my home. Italy is my new future and when I find out the purpose of my presence there...things change forever.",
