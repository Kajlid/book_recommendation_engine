  "description": "This Christmas Eve, Sadie’s determined to stay on the Nice List by helping to save Christmas… but no one said she couldn’t have some naughty fun along the way!Stranded in the city on Christmas Eve when all I want is to go home and be with my family, it was shaping up to be the worst Christmas ever.That is until a sleigh crashed in the dingy parking lot behind my building. But it wasn’t Santa stumbling out of the wreckage – don’t be silly! It was three magical Christmas elves.These elves were not the cute, short, pointy-eared creatures I’d always imagined. El, Tin and Max were tall, charming and, under their elaborate green coats, muscled and gorgeous.When they begged me to help them find some Christmas cheer to recharge their sleigh so countless children wouldn’t wake up disappointed on Christmas Day, how could I say no?But with only a few hours until midnight, I wasn’t sure we could get the sleigh moving in time – especially if my naughty new friends kept distracting me with flirtatious looks and stolen kisses.",
