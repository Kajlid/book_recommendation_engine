  "description": "They say there is happiness at the end of every love story, but they never truly mention the hardships it takes to get there. With Cane, I’d been through hell and back, and now, I was going to be walking up the alter, promising my life to a man that I’d gambled everything for. Some would call me dumb. Some would deem me insane. Others would say I was a fool in love.But I knew what we were, and I knew what we had was real. With every marriage, there is always something that can hold you back or make you think twice, and this something was going to be one of our biggest wars yet, or our greatest victory ever.",
