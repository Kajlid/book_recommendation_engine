  "description": "Word from the \"I feel both enjoyment and embarassment seeing this fiction of mine on Goodreads. This work of fiction has been a challenge since it was my first try at writing a story in English, since my first language is French, and some kind of a pleasurable experience because of the opportunity given to gay fiction authors by Nifty. I understand that this work is far from being perfect, the purpose of my writing Hate was not on that level. I couldn't have imagined that fiction to find a fanbase this large and to find a way into databases like the one of Goodreads of all the places. It was a bad idea of me to write this story under my real name because I couldn't have imagined that when my name would surface, this piece of work would find its way to the surface yet again. Fortunately, all the other books I have written professionally have been signed with pen names.\"Martin Cl√©ment, author.Lucas has been living a desolate life for the last five years since he was eleven years old and everyone found out he was gay. His best friend who he had been caught kissing turned against him, his father pretends he is dead, and he is constantly harrased in school. Then suddenly his best friend wants to talk to him again.
