  "description": "If someone you love disappeared, how far would you go to forget? When Brannagh's boyfriend, Nikki, disappears on a bird count in Northern Ontario, she reluctantly agrees to return to the east coast for a reunion of the childhood all-girls club Tuatha-de-Dananns. Brannagh hides out at her Grandmother's cottage which is far too close to the woods where her mother was murdered fifteen years ago. As Brannagh struggles to solve the mystery of Nikki's vanishing, she uncovers the secrets behind the most startling disappearance of all. \"Sadly rich and beautiful writing....\" The Hamilton Spectator \"LET THE SHADOWS FALL BEHIND YOU is a haunting story of disappearance and loss and, ultimately, redemption. Weaving together a world of family loyalties and family lies, of broken bonds and of those that endure, it combines the nuance of poetry with all the suspense of a thriller.\" Nino Ricci Author of The Origin of Species \"Leveille knows character...\" The Globe and Mail",
