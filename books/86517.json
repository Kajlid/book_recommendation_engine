  "description": "Ella Taylor has been longing for freedom since the fateful day her father died, leaving her with Coco, the step-bitch from the West, and Brooke, the wickedest of wicked stepsisters. There’s little time for a love life when Ella has to earn her keep while paying her way through college. That doesn't stop her from swooning over Killian Ward, Mr. Gorgeous, Irish, and very off-limits. If only Brooke didn't already have her cat claws sunk into him.  With Killian off limits, Ella is sure that all she can do is dream, until the opportunity of a lifetime arises. If she can’t have Killian in real life, maybe she can have him for three days of Midsummer, the annual Greek campus tradition. Three days of parties. Three days in masks. Will Ella find her secret Cinderella ending? Or in the real world, does the evil stepsister always win?",
