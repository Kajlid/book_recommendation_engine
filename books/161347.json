  "title": "Chasing the Dragon",
  "description": "Coming of age seventeen-year-old Holden Caulfield—yes, that is her real name thanks to a drug-addicted mother and an unusually cruel father—is more lost and confused than the typical teenager. With cut-scarred arms and an abuse-damaged psyche, she runs away from her parents, only to find herself admitted to a psychiatric hospital, following a homicidal rampage. Gradually recalling the days leading up to her hospitalization, she convinces herself redemption is not an option for a cold-blooded killer like herself. And she believes just that until Jude, a man she’s loved for years in a way that can only be considered inappropriate and unrequited, shows her unconditional kindness and reminds her love and forgiveness comes when you slay dragons, not when you chase them.",
