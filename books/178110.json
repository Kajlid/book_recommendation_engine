  "description": "Imagine the scene. You receive a DVD in the post. You do not know who it is from. You put it into your player and settle down to see what it is about. Your partner is in the shot. They're tied to what appears to be a dentist chair in the middle of an abandoned looking warehouse. They look scared. They tell you they love you and the screen goes dark. The words appear stating that you can report your partner as missing and her captors will kill her immediately but her suffering is over... Or... Each day you will receive a new DVD of what they're doing to her right up until the day they release her...... Put them out of their misery and live with the grief and knowledge it was your decision if help can't reach them before they're killed or wait and see what shows up in the post, hopeful that they'll get bored and release them back to your loving arms? From Matt Shaw (Sick B*stards) and Michael Bray (Whisper), the authors behind MONSTER and ART, comes a new horror to push your boundaries of comfort...",
