For incubus Alexis, shark-shifter Morgan is both, and so much more. But when Alexis is severely disfigured, Morgan also becomes a dream beyond his reach. After all, Alexis is a sex demon. The only thing he has to offer is his beauty, and with that gone, so is Morgan's incentive to stay by his side. Morgan knows how hard it was for Alexis to surpass the trauma of his scarring. His love for Alexis goes beyond appearances. Torn between his natural instinct to claim his mate and the desire to protect fragile Alexis, he refuses to leave the incubus. But there are still those who don't agree with the coupling between a shifter and a magical creature, and Alexis still has many secrets to reveal. Can Morgan convince Alexis of his own worth, or will they be parted by their own fears and the machinations of others? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
