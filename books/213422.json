  "description": "For Hilary Scanlon a holiday to the Med is the last throw of the dice. She's done everything for her husband Sean since his accident, but he only seems to grow more reclusive. Timmy Williams is one of the Three Amigos - the other two, Beer and Jethro, know what they want from their holiday: drink, women, and song. Timmy is more interested in the polite woman doing t'ai chi by the pool. While Hilary does her exercises, Sean curses the thoughtless vacationers who crash around at five in the morning in the room above. He wants retribution. Lindy MacLaren is a holiday rep who tries to stop naive British girls from falling prey to the local gigolos. When Lindy sees Sean Scanlon spreading jam on his neighbours' balcony to attract insects, she thinks she's found a soulmate. For anyone who has experienced the brash vulgarity, the rampant xenophobia and the effusive humanity of a package trip, this hilarious, touching and beautifully observed book is a must.",
