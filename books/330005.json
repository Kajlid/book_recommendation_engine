  "description": "Who knew starting over could be so dangerous?\n StellaYou know what’s worse than turning forty? Knowing the last time you had sex was with your ex. Ten years ago. So when my best friend takes me out to celebrate my new job, I let the sexy twenty-something flirt with me. And take me home. Because I deserved that one-night stand. I regret nothing. Except, as it turns out, he’s one of the partners at the security firm I now work for. Fan-f*cking-tastic. TrevorI do not need any distractions right now. And Stella? She has distraction written all over her. She’s an employee. She’s also a single mom who needs romantic drama even less than I do. I should stay away. But I don’t. Because every forbidden, stolen moment makes me want more. I want forever. Now all I have to do is convince her I’m worth the risk. Oh, and I also need to catch the deadly cyber-terrorist who targeted her to get to me. But, hey, no pressure, right? Savor is a standalone romantic suspense novel with a hot, protective former SEAL, a heroine who is about to realize that 40 is the prime (and time) of her life, and a guaranteed happily ever after.",
