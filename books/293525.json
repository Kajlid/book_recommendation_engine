  "description": "STEEL DOGS tells the hilarious but somewhat unbelievable true story of a business deal in China gone totally wrong. This action-packed tale follows Chris and Matthew Bracey (of London's renowned God's Own Junkyard Neon Museum) on a farcical and disturbing journey to bag a million quid. As the day of the deal approaches and the deal commences, everything that can go wrong, goes wrong. This is bad luck at its worst. The humiliating truth of what went on in China, Matthew and Chris made a pact to not spill the beans, saying “what happened in China, stays in China.” But now after one last request from his dying fathers deathbed to write the book, that is now not the case. Matthew lifts the lid on the untold story.",
