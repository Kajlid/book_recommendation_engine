  "description": "Who is Edwin Sterling's Mystery Woman?  Enquiring minds want to know, and so does Edwin Sterling.  Made famous by his character, a medical doctor who solves crimes, Edwin Sterling is stuck in a media frenzy that reports every aspect of his life. He longs for a relationship based on reality, not fantasy. He also secretly feels dwarfed by the brave, intelligent image of his famous character, and wishes he could be more like him in real life. While the tabloids falsely accuse Edwin of having a mystery girlfriend, he meets Adriana, a beautiful American doing research at the British Museum. But strange things happen around her. Is it coincidence, or is she a cold-blooded killer? Edwin refuses to believe she is anything but perfect, but when she disappears, he will have to cross the world to find out the truth.",
