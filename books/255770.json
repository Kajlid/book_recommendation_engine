  "description": "Luke Hartwell's second novel, Who You Are and Where You Come From, is his most autobiographical. Ironically, it is also his only work of fiction to be written from third person point of view. The award-winning novel follows Arkansas country boy Ben Goodman through childhood and adolescence, focusing on Ben's life after he crosses paths with the bookâ€™s other protagonists, Pennsylvania-raised brothers Ethan and Daniel Henry. Each boy has a compelling story, and when the sad stories of their separate lives merge into the warm stories of their time spent together, the result is both heartwarming and hopeful. The book is both a coming of age novel and a love story told in fine, understated Southern tradition.",
