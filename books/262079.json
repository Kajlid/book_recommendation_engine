  "description": "\"Someday I'm going to teach these greedy people a lesson,\" said Judge Dee, a tall broad-shouldered man with a foot-long black beard and matching side-whiskers. The legendary figure comes back! He continues to solve baffling cases in 7th century China, but at a faster pace. Tales of Judge Dee is Zhu Xiao Di's debut in fiction. His other books Thirty Years in a Red House, a Memoir of Childhood and Youth in Communist China (University of Massachusetts Press, 1998, paperback from the same press, 1999, new edition by Penguin Books India, 2000) and Famous Writers Celebrate the Bond between Father and Child (Pocket Books, 2000, contributing along with John Updike, Annie Proulx, Dean Koontz, Calvin Trillin, and others.) Boston Globe calls his memoir 'a splendid lesson in 20th-century Chinese history,\" and Library Journal says it is 'engrossing and engaging.\"",
