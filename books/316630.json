  "description": "Time stamps.Our life is marked by them. Significant milestones to the seemingly mundane. All of them have a place. A purpose. Moments and chapters stacking on each other, building scars and memories. Creating stories that are only ours to tell.But those stamps are finite, pre-determined. And eventually our allotment runs out.From the first moment Roth laid eyes on Laurel, he was done for. She is sarcastic and clumsy and the most whimsically alluring creature he has ever met. And as he sat across the table from her in a café on their first date, he fell head over heels in love. He couldn't imagine his life without her. Their romance is a whirlwind. Their love, deep and unrivaled.But life doesn’t often follow our pre-scripted playbook, and after ten short years together Laurel receives devastating, life-altering news that will change everything. Time Stamps is a heartwarming and heartbreaking epic love story about life, hope and loss. Told in the past through Laurel's eyes and the present through Roth's, you will embark on a beautiful, intimate journey into a couple's lives where ultimately what matters most is not only how we live each day, but the memories we leave behind.",
