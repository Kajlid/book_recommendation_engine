  "description": "I blinked rapidly, the intense white of the explosion still hovering, ghost-like, in my vision. It all seemed unreal. Whoever was in that car was dead. Right before my eyes… Clearly I had no monopoly on death, this evening. DON’T GET CAUGHT. Joe Whitelow is 13. ‘K’ is 18. Joe’s small for his age. K’s tall and strong. Joe’s almost blond. K’s hair is dark. He’s a Believer. Joe’s a bit vague about what that even means. But they do have one thing in common. They both need to get out of the EuroBloc. Or die.",
