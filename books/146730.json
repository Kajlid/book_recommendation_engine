  "description": "After months of living with a biker gang in Rio, Manuel recruits a feisty heiress named Reya to help him unite the shifter tribes living in the Amazon jungle and drive the humans from their home. Their passion for freedom turns into lust for each other, and after a hot night of sex, he fantasizes about telling her all of the kinky secrets he learned during his time in Rio. Unfortunately, Manuel could never give the sexy Reya so much power over him, for if she knew his secrets, she could single handedly destroy everything he had worked so hard to gain.In Manuel, Reya sees an escape from her routine and oppressive lifestyle. She loves to push his buttons, but as she starts to peel back the complex layers of his personality, she starts to change her views about the world—and herself. The more she learns about the sexy off-road motorcyclist, the more intrigued she becomes, and as their connection deepens, she hopes that their fragile relationship won’t fall victim to the deep-rooted prejudice and war that will result from their indiscretions.",
