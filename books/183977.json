  "description": "Rosanna is an ordinary girl -- unlike the beautiful Sari Roberts who looks like an exotic princess (and expects to be treated like one) -- but she has a special power. She calls it simagining -- the power to be able to imagine and see. Sari manipulates Rosanna to create a world where she could rule ... a world called Celadon ... Now a handful of people are trapped in Celadon and the outcome could be deadly. Rosanna has to realise her own power before it's too late!",
