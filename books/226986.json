  "description": "Gabriel has had a long life of loneliness. Not only was he different as a human but he is also a very different vampire. Some call him the stoic vampire because he seldom shows emotions. What they do not know is that he feels emotions just like anyone else, he just has a hard time expressing them.  Olivia is alone in this world ever since her father died a year ago. She was raised as a military brat, never staying in the same place long and never forming attachments. She is now trapped in a home that is far from a home, with men who seek to use her. She must escape to survive.  Gabriel has found his mate. She is everything he ever dreamed of but can he keep her safe as they draw closer to their enemy, a vampire who has been creating vampires and leaving them to create mayhem. They soon realize that all is not what it seems. Can love conquer all?  Not suitable for those under 18. Graphic sexual content and language.",
