  "description": "A cryptic message from her brother leaves Rina Devargas with a secret and no one to trust... Carrying the fate of a nation in a locket next to her heart, Rina's life is turned upside down as her brother's partner, McCall, moves into her home under the guise of keeping her safe. Though she surrenders her body to his dark desires, someone betrayed John, and until McCall gives her a sign, Rina can't be certain that someone isn't him. Assigned to protect her, Connor McCall must gain Rina's confidence the only way he knows how... Having once shared a night of forbidden pleasure, McCall reawakens her submissive appetite for dominance. However, keeping his mind on the job and his hands off Rina proves difficult--remaining aloof from his feelings for her, even more so. He's been down that road and paid a handsome price for it-the life of a fellow agent. With an assassination plot brewing and killers after Rina, will McCall gain her trust before it's too late? Or will their dangerous desires ultimately destroy them all?",
