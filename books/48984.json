So Amy decides to become Logan's secret admirer, sending him sensual love letters steamy enough to unseal their own envelopes.After a tragedy on the job, firefighter Logan is battling demons. Thank goodness Amy is there for him. But when a woman from Logan's past resurfaces right as some anonymous letters send Logan's pulse hammering, suddenly he doesn't know what he needs.
