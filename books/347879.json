  "title": "Time : From Micro-Seconds to Millennia - The Search for the Right Time",
  "description": "In the vein of popular science successes such as THE CALENDAR and FERMAT'S LAST THEOREM, TIME looks at man's obsessive and ingenious efforts to measure and label the dimension that dominates our lives. Waugh looks at every aspect of time - from the Big Bang, through clock time and calendars to the end of time. Drawing on Waugh's polymathic knowledge of art, music, literature, science and social history, this is a hugely entertaining examination of the big questions about time: how were seconds, minutes and hours agreed; how were the various calendars arrived at and why are there twelve months in a year and seven days in a week?",
