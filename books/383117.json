  "description": "From the sentimental to the soulful, this book explores, in absolutely no depth whatsoever (yet with a number of lively and perhaps profound illustrations), the many and curious modes of love. Also it rhymes.This lovely volume is a terrific gifty object (hey, have you ever tried to write book jacket copy?) as varied and delightful as a fine box of chocolates, yet with the decided advantage that there arenÂ¹t any of those icky little pineapple jelly things.",
