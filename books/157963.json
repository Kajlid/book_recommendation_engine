  "description": "I ran away thinking a new location would be the answer to all my problems, all it did was open up a whole world of new ones. Too much happened and I found myself running back to the town I tried so desperately to get away from. Now I’m back at square one, where my story began. There are questions I need answered; maybe once I get them, I can finally stop running. Or if I can’t maybe that running is just me, Getting Closer to my happy ending.",
