I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\nWhen the dust settles, my heart feels as though it will never be pieced back together. But there are too many lives riding on my ability to function at my best.So I push through. And I find that I still have some fight left in me. Now I have one last task before I can rest: to find the simple ingredients of a spell. A spell that will help heal much of my wounds. But it is not only my injuries that I have to stitch closed. My sister's wounds have broken open . . . and perhaps most surprising of all so do another vampire's.Faris.",
