  "description": "All roads lead to the homeworlds, to the timeless cities of ancient worlds - dark, corrupt. For the outsider - stranger, colonial, mutoid - it's alien and dangerous. For the 'Earther' headed back after many years, it's not what you expected, nor where you want to be. Chicago, Marsport, Sequoia ... the skycities of the Jupiter system are the new worlds on the old high frontier, new battlefields were Death wears the same old face. Aerosports, Angelwar - politics gone mad - the launch of a supercarrier - the death of a friend. Nothing is as it seems; enemies and allies trade places. Trust only those you know, believe only what you see. This volume repeats the dazzling form of SCORPIO. Jarrat and Stone are back with a vengeance in a pivotal novel taking the Athena to the heart of humanity's old home. It's a thrill-a-page ride, rich with action, intrigue and sensuality, set against a background of real worlds. Read SEVEN chapters online: www.melkeegan.com.",
