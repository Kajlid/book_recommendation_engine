  "description": "The battered corpse in a clothing chest dumped in an Amsterdam canal should not have caused a stir -- one death among millions during World War II. The killers certainly hoped the crime would vanish in the fog of war, but a police detective took an interest in the case, as did a legendary Resistance leader, and a powerful crime boss â€¦ and the Gestapo. In fact, the killing would affect many lives before the police investigation was over and the fallout would continue long after the war.The Culture Chamber is a story of murder and heroism, fear and greed, love and ruthlessness, all woven around a central act of bravery.",
