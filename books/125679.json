  "description": "Violet:What’s worse than being accidentally stuck in a conscious state during a month-long trip in a stasis pod aboard your abductors’ spaceship? Ending up in a cage room with nine other captives—bizarre and dangerous aliens who are not looking at you in ways that suggest your best interests. And why are you feeling a strange connection with that furry, amber-eyed, and charmingly naïve guard outside your cage?Bahbi:Standing in the cage room, I don’t know which creature terrifies me more, although I’m leaning heavily in the direction of the human female after hearing about how she went berserk during the offloading process and chopped one of her abductors to bits. Then she includes me in the escape plans of the caged alien group and gently runs her hand over my fur where I am injured, and I am lost forever to her.Chorus:And then there’s the taking over of the asteroid (oh, didn’t we mention they’re on an asteroid?), the plan to drive slavery from the galaxy, that whole “Queen of Oz” bit, and parading around naked on galactic TV with a royal party of giant snakes. Oh, yeah, and the unpleasantness at the brothel.Maizy:Nothing in life is guaranteed, but how bitter and jaded would one have to be to not love HEAs? That said, my books are full of triggers of every variety—too many to list in a content warning; if this is troubling to you, please skip my books altogether. Also, sexually explicit content for readers 18+ only and meant to be read as a series.",
