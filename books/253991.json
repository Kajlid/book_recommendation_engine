  "title": "Lizzie Borden:  The Untold Story",
  "description": "On a hot August morning in 1892, Mrs. Abby Borden was tidying up the guest room in her house in Fall River, Massachusetts. Someone entered, carrying an ax. An hour and a half later her husband, Andrew J. Borden, lay down to take a nap on the sitting room sofa. Again someone entered, ax in hand.The two violent, brutal murders shocked the country. And when, a week later, police arrested Lizzie Borden, a Sunday-school teacher and ardent church worker, and charged her with having killed her father and stepmother, interest in the crimes became worldwide. It stands today as the most famous of all American murder cases.At the end of a sensational trial, the jury acquitted Lizzie, and no one else was ever charged with the murders. Was Lizzie innocent or guilty? After nearly three years of research, Mr. Radin presents a fascinating picture of the real Lizzie Borden, her life and times, her trial and its aftermath--a picture which casts a new light on the murders and turns most of the opinions on the case upside down.",
