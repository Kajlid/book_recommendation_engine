  "description": "Mya’s one and only long-term relationship taught her not to trust — and she was a quick learner. Never one to make the same mistake twice, she knew that no one could hurt her behind the barriers she put up. She felt nothing and preferred it that way. Mya’s life was fine — just fine. Until Asher Dawson, the most notorious rock star in the world, came crashing into her life. One day with him and her walls came tumbling down... But how could she take a chance on him, of all people? He was a known bad-boy and she had been burnt before. His past was littered with terrible decisions that he revealed with unrepentant honesty… But he would tell her nothing about his origins, or how he came to be in foster care along with what would later become his band mates. Dark secrets aside, Asher made her heart sing. Emotion restored and heart on the line, would her choice end in disaster for them both?",
