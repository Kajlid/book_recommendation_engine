  "description": "The unconscious man wheeled into Dr. Rebecca Dahlman's ER is sexy-devilishly sexy-and injured. This isn't just any patient in need of medical help. He is the only man she's ever loved-the one who still haunts her dreams. Black Phoenix bassist Dominic Price made a mistake three years ago when he walked out on Rebecca. A mistake he plans to rectify. But first he has to convince her to open her heart to him again. One touch of his calloused hands reignites their passion. Can they rekindle their trust as easily, or will her fears cause her to lose him again...this time to a man bent on revenge?",
