An extraordinary opportunity for most, the highly-regimented United States Military Academy was a life-changer for him. Enduring culture shock and surviving rude awakenings hardened the rigorous West Point Experience. And, Third World politics after West Point - because of West Point - tested it severely. The truth-is-stranger-than-fiction memoir has a simple proposition. Fly-or-die!\"PATH to FREEDOM: My Story of Perseverance\" describes what happened upon Taylor's return to a government turned repressive, anti-American, and paranoid - overnight.

His was the impossible task of proving that he was not - or else!The historically-accurate, coming-of-age book provides a unique prism through which to see the cultural trauma of emigration, the unique experience that is West Point, the personal side of Cold-War-era geopolitics, and the mayhem of Third World politics. The view will be nostalgic for some, shocking to many, and enlightening for others. Its subtly-threaded love story will enchant - at the very least.The Smithsonian Institute displays PATH to FREEDOM: My Story of Perseverance in its Anacostia Museum Library.
