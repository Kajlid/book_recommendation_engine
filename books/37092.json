  "description": "Every Night, Josephine!, originally published in 1963, may not have nearly as much pill-popping and sex as Valley of the Dolls, the book that made its author a sensation. But it is definitely Jacqueline Susann all the way—witty and full of dead-on observations.  After exploring the crazy world of pedigree dogs, Susann finally acquires a magnificent poodle, Josephine. The pampered poodle soon secures the dominant role in this budding relationship—and as our hirsute heroine dances through a ballet of network TV appearances, sidewalk encounters with Garbo, and doggy-bags from Sardi’s, even Susann’s dog-hating husband submits to her canine charms. Fans of Jacqueline Susann, kitsch lovers, and pet pamperers alike will be helpless to resist this laugh- out-loud classic.",
