  "description": "There is no choosing… only begging.The Lords own me, and they are never going to let me go. At least, that’s what they tell me. Lord Alaric Cross. Lord Gideon St. Claire. Lord Sterling Beauchamp. Lord Theodore Wolf. Four brooding men who make my worst nightmares seem tame. To the public, they are titled aristocrats with royal lineage. In secret, they make up the Lords of Darkness—an ancient order that rules the underbelly of England with a lethal, iron fist, leaving skeletons in their wake. And as fate would have it, my father was the fifth Lord of Darkness. His sudden death means I am now a Lady of Darkness. I refuse to go along with their sick, twisted games. I will never fall to my knees before them, even when they insist on breaking me for pleasure. But like all predators hunting their prey, they sink their vicious fangs in, possessing my mind, body, and soul. They may think they can win, but all they’ve done is awaken a beast that’s capable of breaking them. Deep down, I’ve always been my father’s daughter—a Lady of Darkness.After all, it’s in my blood.Lords of Darkness is book one in a dark reverse harem romance duet. It does not end on a cliffhanger, but there will be unanswered questions. Please note: this book is dark. You will love the heroes, and then you will hate them before you love them again. If you’re looking for villains who eventually turn good, that doesn’t happen in this book. They are the antithesis to a romantic hero in every way. Proceed with caution. A list of triggers can be found in the author's note.",
