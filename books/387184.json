  "description": "Locked in his dank, underground cell King Erich is feverish and dying. Running out of time and running out of hope he sends his daughter, the beautiful Princess Ursula, on a seemingly impossible quest. She must find the lost and ruined Temple of Life and secure the key that may mean the difference between freedom and slavery for the Kingdoms of Kaynos. Meanwhile his son, the young druid Slade, continues his own quest to find his beloved father and stop the evil witch Shallendara in her plans for conquest. Betrayed by those they thought were friends and hunted from all directions Slade's quest seems as impossible as Ursula's. With more questions than answers Slade and his companions seek out the great Dragon Clans to the north for assistance. Yet Shallendara's quest for ultimate power will not be stopped so easily. Already her forces are gathering and war, once hoped to be avoided, is now imminent. Her allies the Oz'ke'lati and their psychic warriors seem almost unstoppable and the Kingdoms fate hangs in the balance.",
