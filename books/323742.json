  "description": "An army of shadows has been amassed. Its one goal: to destroy the Pirate Lords for their Shadow Lord-an alchemist who has created a special gold that grants him unfathomable power. But the soothsayer Tia Dalma has other plans for the Lords and cannot allow them to be destroyed. So she calls on the one man who can turn the tide-Captain Jack Sparrow... In the midway point of the epic LEGENDS series, Jack Sparrow finds himself lost in the peaks of the Himalayas. How did a pirate captain wind up atop some of the world's taller mountains? That's exactly what his crew would like to know. And the only man who can answer that question is the Pirate Lord Sri Sumbaji of the Indian Ocean!",
