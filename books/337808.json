  "description": "Monkey Punch's Lupin III franchise follows the exploits of master thief, Lupin III, and his fellow partners-in-crime, Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko. Over the 35 years since the first installment of Lupin's exploits appeared in print in Japan, the franchise has spun off a total of 3 separate manga series (comprising dozens of volumes) and hundreds of animated TV episodes, theatrical features, and original video productions. Take a healthy dose of James Bond, add a splash of The Thomas Crown Affair, filter through the warped prism of Mad magazine... stir throughly... and multiply by about 12... the resulting cocktail might just begin to capture the irrepressible lunacy of Lupin III.",
