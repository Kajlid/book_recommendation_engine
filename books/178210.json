  "description": "She wouldn’t take no for an answer. Until he said yes.   Carly Anderson is tired of playing it safe, and a big, brooding MMA fighter seems like the perfect cure for her tendency to stay on the straight and narrow. But Giovanni Costas is battling demons she’ll never understand and has needs she’s never been confronted with before. Maybe just one night will be enough to change her life—change her—for good.  Unless he gives her no choice but to run right back to the security she’s always known…   This teaser novella in the Tapped Out series occurs shortly after the end of SHADOWBOXER and hints at the events to come for Carly and Giovanni in ON THE ROPES, coming July 1st, 2015 and up for preorder now. If cliffhangers and short teaser novellas aren’t your thing, check out ON THE ROPES for the rest of the Carly and Giovanni’s story (including a Happily Ever After!)",
