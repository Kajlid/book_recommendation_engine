  "description": "Escaping from the clutches of a sadistic torturer is only the start of a terrifying ordeal for human/dakaran hybrid Chesara. Hunted through the wilds of Kalzir and the depths of her own mind, hard truths about her own abilities and the people she has always trusted become overwhelming. Watching the woman he loves, locked within herself is heart-breaking for Connor Temple, particularly with the added guilt that he is as responsible for exploiting her as the rest of humanity. Releasing her from slavery would mean turning his back on his entire way of life, if it were even possible. Resigned to becoming merely her captor again, the return of a man from the grave sparks hope for all three of them. Contains Reverse Harem scenes m/f/m and some violence. It is intended for a mature audience only.",
