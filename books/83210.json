  "description": "At some point in life, when we are looking into the chasm, facing a conundrum without good options, we stare into the darkness and ask, “How did we get here?” Meet Rafi, Dimitri, and Anna. Rafi and Dimitri have been friends for a quarter century. Now they love the same woman. But it’s not that simple… 3 Through History: Love in the Time of Republicans explores the question no one asks. It develops each character in context of the fall of an ideology, socialism, and the rise of radical Islam. Rafi, a child of the Israeli Kibbutz, is glued to these events. Dimitri, conceived in the Soviet Union, ignores them, and Frida, a Mexican beauty-cum-empresaria, exploits the opportunities created by them. Then 9/11 happens, reordering Dimitri’s life and setting off a chain of events that lead the protagonists to their collision course. Frida meets both men at her nadir. Who will fill the gaping hole in her soul? Who will get her body, Are they the same? Love and History buy front-row seats in this character-driven, 89,000-word drama - I am the same author that explores the only question that matters - What Love Is.",
