But when dealing with warlocks under a blood moon, love trumps revenge…every time.Regan Riley has come to town for a little revenge. Before the Starr brothers become too powerful to take down, she’s going to bully the bullies. But when the tables are turned, she finds it hard to deny the sexy warlocks who need her more than they know.Ten years ago Regan Riley left town to save herself from the scourge of the Starrs. Twin brothers Chance and Warrick tormented her one too many times, so her father ships her away to safety. But when he asks her to return to celebrate a once in a lifetime event, she’s all for it. Before the twins ascend and grow more powerful than she can handle, she’s going to show them what it’s like to be bullied.Chance and Warrick have been looking for the shapeshifting beauty for years. Some out of control magic in their youth made her miserable, and they want her back. But when the tricky cat tries pranking them, they decide on another way of apologizing. In bed. Sure, they need a familiar or a bonded lover to help them survive their Becoming during the blood moon. But no way in hell they’ll ask Regan for help and risk hurting her. They lost her once before. They can’t do it again. They’d rather die knowing she’s safe than lose her to vampires when the blood moon takes hold. But when Regan wrestles the decision from their hands, it’s do or die. Because this time, losing her isn’t an option.",
