  "title": "The Sisters Club",
  "description": "From the author of the Judy Moody books, this exciting novel captures the warmth, humor — and squabbles — of three spunky sisters.\nMeet the Sisters Club: twelve-year-old Alex, aspiring actress and born drama queen; eight-year-old Joey, homework lover and pioneer wannabe; and smack in the middle, ten-year-old Stevie, the glue that holds them together — through dinner disasters, disputes over stolen lucky sweaters, and Alex’s going gaga over her leading man. Playfully weaving Stevie’s narration with Alex’s scripts, Joey’s notebook entries, and hilarious elements such as \"How to Swear in Shakespeare\" and \"Dear Sock Monkey\" letters, this hugely engaging novel showcases Megan McDonald’s ear for dialogue, comic timing, and insight into the ever-changing dynamics of sisterhood.",
