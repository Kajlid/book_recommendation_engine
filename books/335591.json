  "description": "When the Mahoney Tower Tulsa’s general manager disappears, Jillian Fox calls headquarters for help. What she gets is a hotshot corporate investigator—and an inexplicable craving for things that are very, very bad for her. Something besides his monogram and size sixteen shoes tells her Barrett George could be BIG trouble, but resisting his aggressive pursuit turns out to be even harder than keeping her fingers out of the candy bowl. Barrett knows the skittish little accountant is probably smart not to trust him, especially if she’s looking for crappily ever after. But it’s been months since he got laid and her avoidance tactics only inflame his inner predator. Barrett’s sexual domination sparks Jillian’s complete sensual surrender and a primal attraction that puts both their hearts at risk. But even as he tests the limits of her trust, the investigation heats up, exposing a conspiracy that places Jillian in harm’s way—and forces Barrett to face his greatest fear. Is ménage a trois your fantasy? Find out what happens to Jillian when one of her most secret fantasies becomes a reality. Steamy doesn’t even come close. We should all be so lucky.",
