  "description": "An exposé…or just exposed? Anything for the sake of the story. That explains why journalist Emma Gideon is participating in a large-scale nude photo shoot.

These unique circumstances are creating a sizzling complication to their rivalry…. Despite her boss’s rule of “no hanky-panky,” Emma ends up in Kyle’s shower…with him! And that’s hotter than she ever imagined. When he suggests a continuation, how can she refuse? But has Emma risked her career for a sexy new development…or is this a severe case of overexposure?",
