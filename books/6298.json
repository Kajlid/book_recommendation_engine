  "description": "I’ve been rejected by my mate and banished from the fae realm. But nothing will keep me from my princes…. And nothing will keep them from me.I was living the most ordinary life… until I found myself in the fae realm, imprisoned in an enchanted castle by four princes who turn into deadly beasts at night. As I grew to understand them and their world, I couldn’t stop myself from falling for them. But living in a fairy tale isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Especially when Keldarion, the prince I know to be my fated mate, forces me back to the human realm. I don’t know what he’s hiding, but I’ll do everything I can to get back to him and my other beasts.And I have to hurry, because my princes need me. When Ezryn, Dayton, and Farron discover Keldarion lied to them about my disappearance, fur will fly. And we have to be united to face the coming challenges. A frost has fallen over the Autumn Realm and the blame is placed on Keldarion. Farron, the High Prince of Autumn, has been accused as a conspirator and lost all control of his lands and people. Unless the four High Princes can stop the terrible winter and prove Keldarion is not to blame, open war will tear across the Enchanted Vale. Throw in a wicked bargain with the Prince of Thorns (who won’t stop talking in my head), my jerky ex-fiancé who doesn’t understand the word ‘no’, and the terrible curse that gets worse each day… Yeah, we’ve got problems. Not to mention that every day that passes, I’m losing more of my heart to each of the princes, despite the fact I know it only puts me in danger.Now, more than ever, I will need to find my courage and help Farron, the High Prince of Autumn, stop this war. And I will be right by his side… as long as he doesn’t kill me first.WOVEN BY GOLD is the second book in a steamy adult Beauty and the Beast retelling multi-book series set in a fantasy fae realm. In this version, our beautiful bookworm doesn't have to choose between the four sexy fae princes. It is a full-length novel that ends on a cliffhanger. It includes MF, MM, and MMFMM content. It is intended for mature readers only.",
