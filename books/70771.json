  "description": "Act Locally is a twisted little jaunt through a small southern town that plays kick-the-can with all things sacred. Sera wants to change the world, so she starts a chapter of Save the Earth’s Natural Resources (SENR) in her small hometown of Limax Trace. Pet wants to change her life, so she joins SENR against her evangelist father’s wishes. Johnny and Darcy want to change the fact that there's nothing to do in this backwater town, so they start playing eco-ninja.Limax Trace has had quite enough of change, thank you very much, and just wants it all to stop.An ensemble story told in alternating scenes featuring Walker, a one-armed blues guitarist; Cesar, his autocratic Manx cat; Walker’s brother Jackson, a right-wing judge; and an intrepid band of eco-warriors, Act Locally is part Zen, part Dada, and completely hilarious!",
