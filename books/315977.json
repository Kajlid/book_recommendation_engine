  "description": "A road trip with your best friends sounds like a great idea... until someone catches feelings. Just after I got home from my first year of university, I found a bucket list that I wanted to complete before I turned twenty. I wrote it years ago and forgot all about it, which means half the stuff on the list hasn’t been completed yet. With my twentieth birthday only a couple of months away, the clock is ticking on finishing everything. Skinny dipping. Camp in Algonquin Park. Fall in Love. How am I supposed to manage all that in time?When my best friends suggest that we go on a road trip to complete everything on the list, it seems like the perfect solution. There’s only one problem: one of those friends is Bree. Beautiful and sweet Bree, who I’m quickly developing a hopeless crush on.I don’t want to ruin our friendship by admitting my feelings, so I’ve vowed to keep everything to myself. With that plan in mind, I thought I could make it through the whole road trip without any trouble. But between being around Bree all the time, and my crush that seems to be growing bigger everyday, I’m not sure if I can’t manage it.Will I be able to keep my feelings a secret for the whole trip, or will I risk ruining the best friendship I’ve ever had? Scarlet Sun is a best-friends-to-lovers lesbian romance, with a Happily Ever After ending. Filled with hilarious banter and hijinks, it is sure to put a smile on your face.",
