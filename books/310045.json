Instead, they turned to his brother, saying, 'Dagner, you are a spare no more'.Mourning his brother, forced to be the heir, Dagner is torn between carrying on his family's legacy, and his desire to turn his back on the cursed city of death and decay forever. But before he makes his choice, a sinister plot begins to unfold, and he learns just how deep the rot runs deep in Sacara.",
