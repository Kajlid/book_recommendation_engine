  "description": "Publisher's Note Clad in a doeskin, alone and unafraid, she stood straight and proud before the onrushing forces of America's Sacajawea, child of a Shoshoni chief, lone woman on Lewis and Clark's historic trek -- beautiful spear of a dying nation. She knew many men, walked many miles. From the whispering prairies, across the Great Divide to the crystal capped Rockies and on to the emerald promise of the Pacific Northwest, her story over flows with emotion and action ripped from the bursting fabric of a raw new land. Ten years in the writing, SACAJAWEA unfolds an immense canvas of people and events, and captures the eternal longings of a woman who always yearned for one great passion -- and always it lay beyond the next mountain. Recreates the life and legend of the Shoshoni Indian as she struggles to survive among hostile tribes, is forced to become the wife of a French trader, and plays a pivotal role in the journeys of Lewis and Clark",
