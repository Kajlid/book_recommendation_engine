  "description": "Cold wars. Hot babes. Cool spies. Warm flesh. Good vibes. Resist authority. Remain nonchalant. \"VideoHound’s Groovy Movies\" is an enlightening, entertaining, eye-opening excursion to more than 200 of the most intriguing and extreme works in cinematic history—films so weird, so wacky, so cool, they’re guaranteed to make jaws drop even today. More than very complicated espionage with arresting cleavage was in the air. Much more. It was a renaissance era for art in general, and these celluloid time capsules from the Age of Aquarius are mind-blowing in their diversity. To this labor of love, Irv Slifkin brings his years of movie reviewing expertise as co-editor of the massive \"Movies Unlimited Video Catalog.\" With 125 extremely cool photos, \"Groovy Movies\" is organized in 20 arresting chapters, from Criminal Elements to England Swings to Don’t Bogart That Trip to Bond and Beyond. Oh ya, and Do They Make You Horny, Baby? Foreword contributor Roger Corman surveys his classic films from the era, including his first-hand research for \"The Trip.\"",
