  "description": "Find your wild.A young environmentalist’s coming-of-age story about learning, discovery, and survival, Wolf Girl: Finding Myself in the Wild takes readers on Doniga’s journey: from the wilderness immersion school where she was taught by Indigenous elders and wildlife trackers, to hitchhiking across the Pacific Northwest, to Alaska, where she fell in love with tracking wolves. These experiences shaped and inspired Doniga to become the leader in the regenerative agriculture movement that she is today.Doniga’s relatable past as a troubled teen gives way to renewed purpose when she begins to focus on the natural world around her, and what she can do to become a steward of the earth. Today’s youth are at the forefront of climate change activism, and will see themselves in Doniga’s story, in the message that you can find yourself by finding―and fighting for―your place within the world at large.",
