  "title": "The World's Best Karlson",
  "description": "One day Smidge reads a dreadful headline in the paper: “Flying barrel – or what?” The paper is offering a reward of 10,000 kronor to whoever catches that mysterious rotund thing! Who or what that refers to is, of course, none other than Karlsson-on-the-Roof, a handsome, exceedingly wise, all-round hero in the prime of his life. But Smidge, who now has to watch out for Karlsson, is having a very busy time. And it certainly doesn’t get any easier when Creepy-Crawly and Uncle Julius get mixed up in the wild merry-go-round.",
