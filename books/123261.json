  "description": "In February of 1997, Walter Schifter was dying of cancer. During the final three weeks of his life, RuthAnn Hogue visited him frequently and reported his thoughts and fears in a series of articles for the [i]Daily News-Sun[/i], a newspaper serving the Sun Cities in Arizona. Walter's pain and misery put him on the verge of suicide, but compassionate hospice care reawakens his zest for life as he teaches us how to care for the dying and shows us the dignity and worth of every individual. Ms. Hogue's encounters with Walter touched her so, that she experienced a spiritual awakening and a re-commitment to the relationships in her own life. Join them on their journey to the edge of life in this remarkable and inspiring story.",
