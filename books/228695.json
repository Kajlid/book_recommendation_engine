  "title": "The Girl in the Tower",
  "description": "Starling wants what any seventeen-year-old girl friends, fun, maybe even a boyfriend. She doesn't want to be trapped in a tower. She doesn't want to have no memories of her childhood other than shadows. She doesn't want to have been raised from the dead. But hey, no one always gets everything they want, and Starling makes the best of it, from fashion parties with her adopted mother, the immortal Vere, to painting with her one and only friend, Dante (when he's not too busy making fun of her).Then Vere grants one of Starling's wishes, by kidnapping Cole Payne to be Stars's boyfriend. He is WAY too attractive for a girl in a tower, and it only get worse when Dante appoints himself as \"chaperone.\"Things really start rolling when Dante and Cole agree to help Stars escape her tower to find out the secrets of her past, which puts the trio on a dangerous path leading far from what Stars wanted . . .",
