  "description": "All I wanted to do was run away, I never expected to crash into his arms...After leaving the city life behind to escape my loveless marriage, I moved to small town Havenbarrow for a fresh start.What I didn’t expect was to find myself drawn to the town’s black sheep.They called him troubled. Cold. A man with a dark past. What everyone seemed to miss about Jax was the splashes of light in his eyes. The random acts of kindness he performed when no one was watching. The way he made me smile and laugh.Jax helped unpack the baggage I’d been carrying around with me. He was patient with my pain and gentle with my scars. He was the stillness during my hurricane.Yet when both of our pasts came back to haunt our present days, we realized quickly that sometimes love stories didn’t end the way we’d hoped. Sometimes you were left with only the damage from the storm.*Book One in New Compass Series of Standalone Novels.Coming April 2nd, 2020.*",
