  "title": "Nikola Tesla: Renewable Energy Ahead of Its Time",
  "description": "Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American scientist and inventor who beat Thomas Edison in the “War of the Currents,” designed the complete alternating current system that are the basis for today’s electricity grid, and invented wireless communication, i.e., radio, long before Guglielmo Marconi became rich and famous exploiting Tesla’s patents. He also invented radio-controlled robotics, a form of X-rays, neon and fluorescent lighting, the basic principles of radar, the rotary engine, bladeless turbines, and much, much more.Above all, Tesla's greatest desire was to harness the forces of nature for the benefit of mankind. He sought to derive energy from natural, sustainable sources. In essence, Tesla was into renewable energy long before it became cool to be into renewable energy, and he was doing this a hundred years ago.Nikola Tesla: Renewable Energy Ahead of Its Time explores the motivations of Nikola Tesla and some of his contributions that predate our current efforts to harness the power of nature. The book is intended as an overview rather than a comprehensive treatise on renewable energy then or now. The primary goal is to show that Nikola Tesla, and others, were already seeing the need for renewable resources long before the current resurgence in interest. This e-book expands on a concept briefly addressed in my earlier book, Tesla: The Wizard of Electricity, published by Fall River Press (2013).",
