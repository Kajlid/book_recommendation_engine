  "description": "New Yorker Daniel Stephenson had made a name for himself with his drag persona, Princess 2Di4, when the sudden death of the real Princess Di drained all the pleasure from his performances. Taking the advice (and financial support) of a wealthy aunt, he decides to \"toss the tiara and get a life.\" Unfortunately, Daniel's only degrees are in \"extensive show tune knowledge, advanced lip-synch, and how to cover up a five o'clock shadow.\" With his best friend beginning to die from AIDS, his ex-boyfriend prowling around, and his ex-boyfriend's new boyfriend making a pass at Daniel, what's a boy to do but throw himself into intensive weeding and planting of his new apartment garden? And if a handsome stranger should smile down at him from a nearby window, so much the better. Timothy James Beck's debut novel is detailed, realistic, and continually interesting. His main character spends so much energy exhaustively \"processing\" what happens to him, however, that this might as well have been a lesbian novel. With a little editing, It Had to Be You would have been a much stronger book, but patient readers will agree that Beck shows great promise along the lines of Felice Picano and Neal Drinnan. --Regina Marler",
