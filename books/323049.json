  "description": "The richest man in the world invites a trio of mediocre golfers to play at a secret course in Scotland. The result of their efforts will somehow affect the fate of the world. Can golf save the world?Fore? No, nine. That's how many literary grand masters each contribute a chapter and together bring you a blistering drive of a story that beats par with every page.To the inauguration of the state-of-the-art course in Scotland come three notoriously hard-luck golfers--not to mention peace-seeking world leaders, havoc-wreaking eco-terrorists, a naked golfer in quest of a hole in one, and, in the putt to end all putts, enough plastique to turn the world into a giant sand trap. Will things get rough in the rough? Will the green run red? Where, exactly, is the mysterious nineteenth hole? With this suspenseful and hilarious ensemble tour de force of sex, money, and mayhem on the links, the \"good walk\" have never been more fun.",
