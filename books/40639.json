  "description": "Jack Jackson’s Comanche Moon is the extraordinary story of Cynthia Ann Parker, a white settler child kidnapped by a band of Comanche Indians in 1836 in Texas. Brought up as a Comanche, she became the wife of a feared Comanche warrior and gave birth to Quanah, a warrior-son who became chief of the Comanches and eventually led them in their last great battles against the relentlessly encroaching white settlers. This is the story of their defeat and the end of the Comanche Nation’s dominance of the Texas plains. Jackson is one of the original figures of the American underground comics movement of the 1960s. Unlike his peers, whose comics celebrated the counterculture, Jackson instead created lively, detailed and historically accurate works that chronicle the bloody, fascinating history around the founding of Texas. Told against a rich backdrop of 19th century life and the complex historical and political conflicts that fueled the brutal wars between Native Americans and settlers, the story of Naduah the white Comanche represents non-fiction comics at its best.",
