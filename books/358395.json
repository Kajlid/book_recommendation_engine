  "description": "For a bored vampire, a charity ‘service’ auction seems as good a place as any to pick up his next meal. For Gwyneth Reilly, unwilling participant, it’s all horribly embarrassing. Being sold? Ewww.But how bad could it possibly be? After all, it was only dinner with a handsome stranger. Nothing else! The way he kept nuzzling at her neck may have been a little strange, but Gwyneth certainly didn’t realise that she was slated to be the main course!",
