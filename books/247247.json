  "description": "Doctor de Soto, a dentist who also happens to be a mouse, is the best dentist in town. He treats animals of all shapes and sizes - that is, except for \"cats and other dangerous animals\". When a fox appears in his surgery with bad toothache, kind-hearted Doctor de Soto agrees to help. But is he foolish to trust a fox? Could a small mouse outwit the foxiest of animals? This modern classic is full of mischief, warmth and humour.",
