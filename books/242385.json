  "description": "Jerk. Angry bastard. That’s how people describe me. Everyone in this small town knows to steer clear of me. Thing is, they don’t know me. They don’t know what I’ve seen, what I’ve done. So I’ve learned to put up a shield to protect both me and them. When everything gets to be too much, I escape on my beloved Harley, the wind in my face calming my soul. But my new neighbor hasn’t gotten the memo about me. She’s a walking, talking firecracker, and I can’t help but imagine what that feistiness is like in bed. She’s full of dangerous curves and a smart mouth that draws me to her like nothing I’ve ever felt. We couldn’t be more different. I’m a grumpy asshole and she’s a sassy princess, but somehow, she sees through me and our spark is undeniable. The question is… will we light up like pretty fireworks or a devastating explosion? I should warn her that’s she’s not safe with me, but I’m tempted to take her for a ride. A ride neither of us will ever forget. Motorhead is a full-length Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger! **Each book in the Irresistible Bachelors features a different couple with their own Happily Ever After. You can read them in any order but there are some interconnecting side characters.",
