  "description": "A dark, brooding fantasy from the critically acclaimed author of THE PILO FAMILY CIRCUSAden awakens naked in a bath tub, knowing only that he is dead. His new world is Nightfall, a place filled with characters bizarre, grotesque and magical: Julius the duke, the monstrous Gorr family, the goddess Muse, Slythe the deadly assassin. On the night Aden awakens, the Forgetting closes in, erasing everything it touches. Aden has little time to discover why this world and its characters seem so familiar to him, and why they call his grandfather the Worldmaker... and he must work out if he is here to save this world, or to help destroy it. An intensely written story in a wonderfully strange fantasy world... it leads us into thinking about the nature of storytelling and structure, reality and imagination, and gives us a wildly entertaining story with some unusual and endearing characters. 'Laugh-out-loud funny' COURIER MAIL 'NIGHtFALL is a remarkable feat of imagination and storytelling that will cement Elliott's reputation as a leading writer of fantasy and horror' WEEKEND AUStRALIAN",
