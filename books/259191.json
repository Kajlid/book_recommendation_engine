  "description": "We were best friends at ten. Lovers at sixteen. Going to be married at nineteen. Until she woke up one day and couldn't remember me. Leaving the small town was easy. Leaving her was my only regret. Ten years later, with a resume that said I had the perfect kill shot, I landed a job at a Security firm. Finding my way in the civilian life, I never thought it would be her I would find. She still owned my heart. She still looked at me like I was a stranger. I wasn't leaving her again. This time, we were playing by my rules. I'd been given a second chance to right my wrongs and I was going to start by claiming what was mine. We were lovers at twenty-eight. Getting married at twenty-nine. Until she woke up and remembered me.",
