  "description": "The Reverend Dr. C. P. Randollph is asked to serve on a committee investigating a local evangelist for ordination, while he is interim minister at Chicago's Church of the Good Shepherd. Administrative tasks seem overwhelming as he balances congregational responsibilities with committee work and a search for a new pastor- in-training for Good Shepherd. Then a murder occurs, followed closely by a second, both with implications for the investigating committee. The third in a series of Reverend Randollph novels, this is an entertaining but undistinguished formula mystery.",
