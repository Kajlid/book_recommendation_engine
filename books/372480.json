  "description": "\"Joseph Mills is a poet who understands that Love's great nemesis isn't Hate but Time. Time and again, the poems in Love and Other Collisions explore the inherent pain created when Love and Time meet. This book stands as a chronicle of the speaker's growth from a hopeful youth to a father carving out the best life he can for his own children to a man who is a helpless witness to his mother's battle with Alzheimer's disease. In the words of one poem, Mills \"show[s] how you [can] make something of your life if only you [can] stand enough punishment over the years.\" Love and Other Collisions is at once ambitious, unflinching, and tender-It is definitely a must-read.\" - Shaindel Beers, author of A Brief History of Time",
