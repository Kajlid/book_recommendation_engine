  "description": "Enter the darkness in Book One of this intriguing dark fantasy. Meet johnny: a seductive, vampiric, magical, time-bending being who wreaks chaos on earth. For over nine hundred years he has answered the conscious and unconscious call for destruction. Meanwhile, the Shen, Jens a, a na ve embodied angel (who believes herself merely human), is tormented by her compulsion to paint violent scenes, which unbeknownst to her, are premonitions of her future. Bored from lack of challenge, johnny invites himself to be her guardian devil to help her survive what is to come, and to teach her about her angel power. He is challenged at last, for her power, when activated, could burn him to oblivion. Confusing matters are the changes they incite in each other, including a magnetizing romantic love.Told from Jens a's point of view, this is a story about life's gentler side unconsciously seeking balance with the tougher aspects of being. Thrown into a fantastic adventure with her diametric opposite, Jens a begins to learn the deeper meaning of life, surpassing everything she ever deemed true. Contrary to conventional plots that pit good against evil, this plot unites good and evil to transform both. This brilliant tale touches the deepest yearnings in every human, yearnings that are lifted to a startling resolution.",
