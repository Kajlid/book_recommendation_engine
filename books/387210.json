  "description": "This touching, funny, heartwarming and true story will become an instant Christmas Classic. In the late sixties, New York Times bestselling author Andy Andrews thought he was having a very good Christmas. He got the Incredible Edible Machine and the G.I. Joe he asked for. He even got a white belt. He also got socks from his Aunt Jane--unarguably a very lousy Christmas gift. How could he know that those lousy socks would change Christmas and him forever. Includes a CD with the author's performance of Socks.",
