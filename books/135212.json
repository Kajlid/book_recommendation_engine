  "description": "The diverse characters in Pool-Hopping -- many of whom are gay, lesbian or queer -- come from different generations and backgrounds, but all sense disorder rippling beneath the fragile surface of existence. This compels them to act in curious ways. Pool-Hopping is about the messy chaos of contemporary uban life and the attempt to stave off confusion with risky, often brave, and sometimes plain wrong-headed gestures of generosity.",
