  "description": "One unexpected and wild weekend with Weston King, and I'm a new woman. He, on the other hand, is the same rich, notorious playboy he's always been. In other words, not the commitment type. So even though we had fun those two days and nights, I moved on quickly from our horizontal time together. Or I thought I did until he offered me a job a month later at his firm in NYC. Can you blame a girl for thinking we might have a chance together? What I didn't anticipate was Donovan Kincaid, Weston's best friend and business partner. He's dangerous and dominant and gets under my skin in ways that no other man has. The worst part? I like it. From NYT Bestselling author Laurelin Paige, discover a whole new world filled with sex, love, power, romance and dirty, filthy rich men.",
