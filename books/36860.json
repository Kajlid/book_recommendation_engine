  "description": "I thought my fated mate would cherish me. Mine kills me in cold blood.\nAfter a decade of bullying me, the Alpha Heir discovers I’m his predestined mate. But just because he rejects me in front of the whole pack doesn’t mean he’s going to let me go.When I flee my fated mate, he gives chase. The Alpha Heir would sooner murder me than let me live out of his reach.Only death isn’t the end for me. The afterlife is a bit more fiery than I pictured, but that’s fine. I’m used to fighting to survive, and literal Hell just might be a step up from what I’ve been dealing with.Even if that means facing off against minotaurs and murderous mermaids.Even if, when I find refuge in a seemingly abandoned castle, I find the most dangerous creature in the underworld. The good news: He agrees to train me, so I’ll never be left weak and at the mercy of another.The bad news: His training methods involve a variety of unconventional methods, such as infiltrating my dreams and pinning me beneath him when we spar.The worst news: He’s never going to let me leave his castle.Forsaken Mate is a fresh retelling of Hades and Persephone with shifters, betrayal, and spice.",
