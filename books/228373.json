  "description": "A LEGENDARY WAR. BETRAYAL. LOVE. HATE. FAITH.In times of war things change. Friends and loved ones will turn their back on you, betray you. In times of war love becomes a weakness that will blind you from the truth. Hate will drive you in the path of vengeance. Faith, faith will keep you alive as it envelops you within the shadows. \"I skidded to a halt a few meters from the cliff, my eyes focused on the giant dragon that descended from the skies and slowly made its way towards me. It reminded me of a giant crocodile- with wings. Its foul odor of burnt flesh and fire engulfed me as it stare into my eyes with its big round green eyes. I looked at it and saw numerous swords embedded in its tough scaly skin, the swords from the knights that perished under its presence. \"You want to roast me?\" I yelled as I took a step back toward the cliff. If I was going to die, I was going to die my way. \"You want to grill me like a steak or do you prefer me roasted like a marshmallow on a stick?\" I snarled allowing my fear and anger to take hold of me. The voice inside my head had abandoned me but its qualities had not. The beast growled and snapped its jaws at me, whatever it tried to say, it probably wasn't something I wanted to hear.\"",
