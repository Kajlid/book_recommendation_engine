  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B017FCM1QGIt turns out, werewolves are aroused by everything—and allergic to polyester. Hives are the least of Leslie Kingmaker’s concerns when she enters her first trial and is transformed overnight into a wolf and the mate of pack leader Ben. Successful, brawny, overbearing and sexy, he’s as intense as he is moody and has never heard of personal space. Complete submission isn’t a sex game to him; it’s a requirement to be by his side. Heart, body, mind. They’re all his—no matter where that leaves Leslie at the end of the week.  But something about the muscular alpha with a dark streak keeps her coming back, and it’s not just her duty as a Kingmaker charged with choosing the next leader of the supernatural community. Ben is dangerous and smart, a predator in every sense with the capacity for both mercy and violence—and an absolute animal in bed. Is he leadership material? Husband material? The danger her father’s final letter warns her about?  The deeper Leslie dives into his life, the more complicated the alpha becomes, and the harder it is for her to remember she’s only a werewolf for a week.  *** The Kingmaker code: Choose wisely—or else.  One to love, one to lead, one to fear. To understand them, she must become one of them. Wolf – Fae – Vampire  Three weeks, three transformations. One ultimate decision.",
