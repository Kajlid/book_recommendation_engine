  "description": "Evil forces were on the rise, and lo was part of a secret association dedicated to stopping them. Lutins were replacing society's bigwigs and no one was safe. The only solution was to infiltrate the menace, travel beneath the Motor City into the hordes thronging Goblin Town, rendezvous with Jack Frost and uncover the plot.The quest would lead to the monster band SEXXX and then to Horroban, the goblins' never-before-seen king. It would force lo through labyrinths of vice; challenge every aspect of her incomplete training. And if enemies weren't enough, her ally would imperil her heart. Arcane power was a matter of course in Goblin Town, but Jack Frost was much more than a simple sorcerer: He ruled the realms of love and death.Yet in Jack's hands, a little death could be a very, very good thing.",
