  "description": "She wanted to settle down. But he was on his way up ... A normal life? Bethany Miller has no idea what that is, but she wants it. After spending too much time on an ex-boyfriend only interested in pinning his crimes on her, she accepts a loathsome roadie job from her road manager father. Still running from her chaotic past, she meets an altogether new thing to avoid-a gorgeous brown-eyed man who seems about as far from \"normal\" as she can imagine. Teetering on the edge of stardom, guitarist Tom Crowley makes music his number one priority now that his band's first major tour is underway. So why is more and more of his attention sidetracked by his less than friendly crew member? Can't a love life coexist with a life on the road? When Beth's vengeful ex escapes police custody, Tom's protective nature and attraction know no bounds-if only he can get Beth to stop running. Reviews and Other Information: \"LOVE'S ROAD HOME is an upbeat romance full of fun characters, clear descriptions and realistic dialogue. If you like rock and roll love stories, this book is for you.\" -Working Girl Reviews",
