Confucius arrives and allies with Chao, thus raising the stakes for control of the dynasty culminating in a venomous clash between Taoism and Confucianism. With the King ailing and war imminent, Lao Tzu is betrayed and accused of spying. The Master Philosopher must cast aside his naivete and idealism to fight for his life.",
