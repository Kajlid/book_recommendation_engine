  "description": "Succumb to Cole Manchester—talented, witty, charming, sexy and oh-so flawed—a womanizing rock star whose shallow life is transformed when he experiences love for the first time.  From the outside, Cole Manchester seems to have it all: looks, fame, money, awards and women. When tragedy strikes, he realizes how hollow his life is, and opens the door to the one thing he’s never considered … finding love. He’s inexplicably drawn to the quiet wallflower who works on his team, a line he knows he shouldn’t cross.  After devastating heartbreaks, all Rose Morgan wants is to blend into the background. Working at her dream job as a publicist, she’s safely hiding in plain sight. Until her client, the irresistible Cole Manchester, notices her. Rose must ignore her desires in order to protect her bruised heart … and keep her prized career.  Cole needs Rose to teach him how to love. Rose needs Cole to teach her how to trust. Together, they form a bond ignited by passion but fueled by insecurities. When her mother’s interference collides with his fan’s twisted plot, Cole and Rose may find themselves with No One To Hold.  ***WARNING: Due to strong language and sexual situations, this book is intended for mature audiences. This book ends with a cliffhanger; Cole and Rose’s entire trilogy in The Hold series is available now.***",
