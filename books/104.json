Rebel leader Etienne Grant kidnaps his wife and vows to punish her disobedience. Once retribution is paid, Auria will command his army in a most ambitious venture—defeating all the angels in heaven.  Auria can do nothing but surrender for the safety of her sons. Once in Grant's clutches, she realizes he wields an even greater whip as he fights for her heart and loyalty.  Enemy alliances are forged as they prepare to bring down the Kingdom of God. But the archangels won't let victory slip from their grasp so easily.
