As a professional marriage counsellor, I have the knowledge of the tools and techniques to help me cope, yet I find myself unable to use any of them effectively, plunging into a wide range of self-destructing behaviours, instead.A lifelong enemy of my family, the dangerously irresistible Raim, promises to be the most devastatingly destructive of them all. Yet he appears to be the only one capable of saving me from my pain and from myself.Neither of us knows that there is so much more that connects us all, more than even the former Grand Master of the Incubi Council who lived for a millennium could be aware of.Now, everyone with demons’ blood in them will need to get together, before the apocalypse, masterminded by a man with nothing to lose, will end the Incubi's millennium-long existence in our world.The Last Unforgiven—Freed is the final book and the conclusion of Marina Simcoe’s Demons series.Warning: The Last Unforgiven—Freed is a Paranormal Romance that contains graphic descriptions of intimacy and some violence.
