  "description": "A Stirring Novel Of Early America.Lizzie Weldon hardly knew who Wash Stonecypher was when he stumbled up to her at Caleb Wyant's house-raising and stammeringly asked her to marry him. And Wash had seen Lizzie only two or three times- never for than a moment or so at that. But Wash needed a wife to fit into the plan he had; and as for Lizzie, she wouldn't have hurt his feelings for the world.So they married and set out on a long and dangerous winter journey by covered wagon from Pennsylvania down the Valley of Virginia, to establish a home, a farm and a family in the wilderness of Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountains.Give Us This Valley is the story of the young couple's adventures, of their quarrel with Rafe Williams who had joined up with them for Georgia, of the terrible storm which almost crippled Wash and of the amazing Yancey family who settled the feud between the Stonecypher and the Williams kin. But most of all it is the tender and entrancing story of how Lizzie came to know and love 'Mr. Stonecypher', as she always called him, and of how at last she made him aware of the depth of her feelings for him.This is a warm, uniquely American novel which owes its quality to the old virtue of storytelling. It is rich in the authentic details of early pioneer life, a novel whose characters glow with the true light of human nature. It is a story to read and remember.",
