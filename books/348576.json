  "description": "The sequel to Amber Allure best-seller Wranglers: Discovery... Attorney Sam Kimball finally gets what he’s wanted ever since meeting Derek Rossi across a conference room table—his legal rival in his bed. The sex is fantastic, but Derek makes it clear from the start this is a no-strings arrangement. That’s why Sam doesn’t bother letting Derek know about the weekend he needs to spend in Napa as best man in his friends’ commitment ceremony. But when Derek finds out, and inexplicably agrees to go along as his date, Sam is both excited and terrified. This will be the first time either of them has met the other’s friends. He has no idea how Derek is going to handle it, or worse, if he really wants to handle it at all... NOTE: Don’t miss Wranglers: The Defense Rests, the third story in the series, available November 2009...",
