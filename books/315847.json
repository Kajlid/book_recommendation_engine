  "description": "It’s time for spring cleaning, but I’m not ready to toss Logan yet…Out with the old, in with the new… a new me, that is. Now that Charlotte’s married, I, too, have decided to be mature. So Logan isn’t Austin--that’s okay. Better than okay. That’s what I’d wanted all along, someone just as kind and loving and--okay, smoking hot--as my roommate. But a kind, loving, smoking hot someone who likes me back.Logan has basically been all my dreams come true.If I could stop stressing about work for five whole minutes to appreciate it, I’m sure I would be really happy. Thank God I have Austin to keep me grounded. Literally, because he makes me garden with him now. And maybe it’s just the stress talking, but it kind of seems like he wants to put down roots too. How come no one told me maturity would be this complicated?Episode five of six in the laugh-out-loud Dating Season series.",
