  "description": "My intentions were to have a summer of fun with my twin brother before embarking on creating my own legitimate empire separate from the criminal enterprises of my family. Everything was going as planned until I met two women. One would pull me into the seedy world I had always avoided. She brought summer lust along with street racing, assaults and murder. The other woman gave me glimpses of the life I wanted in the light with passion and tenderness. When my actions began to spiral us all into a dark vortex, I realized that fate made the final choies for my future.",
