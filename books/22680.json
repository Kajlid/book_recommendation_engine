  "description": "When Darren wins a trip for two to an exclusive holiday resort and invites his work buddy Jamie to share it with him, they are the only two men in the office who know they won’t be enjoying a typical lads weekend away.Neither of them has any intention of chasing after girls—or even chasing after any guys other than each other. After months of subtle flirtation, Darren and Jamie are finally ready to do a hell of a lot more than stare longingly across the office.They both know they’re going to get laid, have a laugh and maybe even fall in lust. But neither realizes the weekend has other surprises in store for them—perhaps lust won’t be the only thing they fall in. Especially when one of them realizes that the other man doesn’t just have swimming trunks in his weekend bag—he’s packing leather.",
