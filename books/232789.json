  "description": "Once a man pledges his honor to his country, that sacrifice is embedded in his soul forever. For years he’s trained to fight, kill, and do whatever necessary to protect his country and its freedom, even if it means giving his own life.He becomes more of a machine than human—one that’s built to destroy the enemy.When it’s time to turn in his weapons, he never forgets the skills he learned. Never forgets the smell of death or feel of a rifle in his hands. The same hands that one day cradle his baby girl and caress the skin of his beautiful wife.If anything or anyone ever tried to steal away the family he has vowed to love and protect, may God have mercy on their soul.",
