  "description": "By night, Mandi is a waitress in her best friend’s adult entertainment club, complete with long raven hair and bright blue eyes. By day, she’s a boutique jewelry maker with a flair for the occasional naughty design. She’s shy, quiet, a definitive Plain Jane, and completely in lust with the one man who wouldn’t ever be interested in her. He’s big, menacing, and inspires every one of her dirty girl desires. If birthday wishes came true, he would hers.Tattoo artist. Business owner. Lover of vintage cars. Drummer. Jaz is far from the average guy. Built like a brick wall and inked from head to toe, he can scare the faint of heart with just a look, but faint of heart isn’t what interests him, isn’t what fuels his fantasies and keeps him hard from dawn to dusk. It’s her—the waitress, his sister’s friend, the birthday girl.Mandi is given the best present ever—Jaz. And she’s got one night to make every wicked thought and erotic dream she’s had about him come true.",
