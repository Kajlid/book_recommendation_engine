  "title": "Lee: The Last Years",
  "description": "After his surrender at Appomattox, Robert E. Lee lived only another five years - the forgotten chapter of an extraordinary life. These were his finest hours, when he did more than any other American to heal the wounds between North and South. Flood draws on new research to create an intensely human and a \"wonderful, tragic, and powerful . . . story for which we have been waiting over a century\" (Theodore H. White).",
