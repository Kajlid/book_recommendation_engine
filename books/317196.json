  "description": "He got the girl.But can he keep her?For once, Dante Martinez fought and won. Now that he and Camille are a couple, his personal life is looking up. But his career? Not so much. Especially in light of the upcoming legal battle he and his former bandmate and one-time nemesis, Frankie Blade, are preparing for. On top of that, his houseguest, Malik, is a ticking time bomb.Thrust into the spotlight as Dante’s new girlfriend, Camille is slowly finding her footing in his strange world. However, she still has other problems to deal with. Her teenage daughter is rebelling and keeping secrets, and the thought of introducing Dante to her conservative, and quite judgmental, parents fills Camille with dread.The impending lawsuit and Dante's unlikely alliance with Frankie not only draws unwanted attention from the press but also unravels some of the demons he thought he’d buried. As tension in his life mounts, Dante is pulled in too many directions, and when unexpected tragedy strikes and Camille’s worst fears come true, he’s not there when she needs him most. Can Camille and Dante build a trusting relationship or will their insecurities destroy their chance of finding harmony?◆◆◆Red Hot Harmony is the second part/conclusion of Dante’s story and should be read after Shattered Chords.",
