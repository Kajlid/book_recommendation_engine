  "description": "The biggest rock band in the world owes it all to a muse.Zoey Ackerman has a weakness—rock stars. Their looks, their swagger, and if they tried to sweet talk her with some lyrics, she'd probably melt on the spot. But when she takes a summer job at the hottest club in LA, the last thing she expects is to have to clean up after a bunch of wannabes.Back stage at amateur night, Jude Morrison is ready to give up his dreams of rock stardom. That is until he meets a pretty club rat. She's spirited, smart, and different from the other girls he's always falling for. And when she says she believes in him, he knows he's finally found his muse.  Zoey had no idea a summer job would lead to her helping create one of the biggest rock bands in the world. But when Jude goes on tour, can their love survive the temptations of sex, drugs and rock n roll?This is the first novella from the 3 part Backstage with Silverlight series, a spin off from the novel Lucky Break.This story is also available in Rock Gods of Romance Boxed Set—6 Book Rockstar Romance Bundle.",
