  "description": "\"Guys are in trouble these days,\" says Garrison Keillor. \"Years ago, manhood was an opportunity for achievement and now it's just a problem to be overcome. Guys who once might have painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling are now just trying to be Mr. O.K. All-Rite, the man who can bake a cherry pie, be passionate in a skillful way, and yet also lift them bales and tote that barge.\" This brilliant collection confirms Keillorâ€™s reputation as an ingenious storyteller and a very funny guy.",
