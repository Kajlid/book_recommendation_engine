  "description": "Water lilies, reflecting ponds, a Japanese footbridge, and blankets of glorious Nothing evokes Claude Monet’s Impressionist paintings quite like images from his gardens at Giverny, about 50 miles northwest of Paris. Monet discovered a profound source of artistic renewal in these gardens, a motif that appears in hundreds of his works. In Claude Monet’s Gardens at Giverny , Dominique Lobstein’s dynamic text introduces us to the many personalities that have strolled through these gardens and the role this setting played in Monet’s life, while Jean-Pierre Gilson’s lush four-season photographs offer a tour through the literally thousands of flowers—daffodils, irises, poppies, tulips, and more— winding pathways, arching trellises, cherry trees heavily laden with blossoms, and, of course, the iconic water garden. This book brings to life critical moments in Monet’s biography, presenting a vivid glimpse into the beloved artist’s personal experiences and creative universe.",
