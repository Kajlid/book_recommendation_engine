  "description": "Space Fleet’s first battle-worthy spaceship, SFPT-109, is on her maiden voyage when first contact occurs. An alien ship, filled with refugees from a galactic conflict, has arrived. Chased, low on supplies, and huddled aboard a damaged vessel, they seek sanctuary—but at what cost to Space Fleet? The decision is in the hands of no-nonsense Captain Cooper. At the edge of the solar system, Coop represents humanity to these frightened refugees. He could help and be pulled into war, or he could turn them away and live with the likely fatal consequences. His decisions and actions will decide the fate of everyone, aliens and humans alike … and Coop thought this was going to be an easy trip. Earth is the new player in galactic politics and naïve in many ways. While alien systems have developed commerce, connections, and conflicts, civilization on Earth has simply tried to survive. On the threshold of creating a unified planet, humans may now be on the verge of extinction by extraterrestrials intent on galactic dominance.",
