  "description": "Breaking News: NYC’s Golden Boy Takes A WalkThis “Breaking News” about Xander Turner hardly deserves such a title. Then again, the mere mention of Xander’s name has always made my ladybits tingle, no matter that he never gave me a second glance when we were in school. But when the news anchor announces he’s out of the high-profile marketing position in his now-infamous family’s business, my wayward thoughts shift to my struggling PR agency. I want him. Ahem, to save my firm.Much to my shock, Xander accepts my job offer. Not only does his sexy face and business savvy bring in the clients, but he adds a layer of fun and creativity I hadn’t expected. He even makes the transition from uptown shark to downtown employee seem effortless. Soon I come to realize that Xander’s more than just his looks. A hell of a lot more.When the paparazzi catch wind of our unlikely pairing, will their ruthless pursuit give my agency more exposure, or will NYC’s dog-eat-dog media industry tear apart all we’ve built?",
