  "title": "I'd Rather Teach Peace",
  "description": "When acclaimed Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy was invited to teach a course on writing at an impoverished public school in Washington, D.C., he responded, I d rather teach peace. Thus began the work he has passionately pursued for the past 25 years teaching courses on nonviolence, conflict management, and peace studies. I d Rather Teach Peace chronicles one semester in six of these schools, as students find themselves challenged and inspired by an unconventional course and by a man who believes that if we don t teach our children peace someone else will teach them violence.",
