  "description": "There's no such thing as magic, right? Dragons are mythical creatures, aren't they? And when people are dead they stay dead, don't they? Well, maybe not.Life would have been a lot simpler if Danny hadn’t ducked out of school without permission: he wouldn’t have been in the city centre, cold and hungry; he wouldn’t have tried to stop a robbery; and he wouldn’t have met Ellie, her grandfather and their bodyguard. He knows from the start that they’re up to something, and the more he finds out the weirder things get. His first clue: Ellie can read minds and talk to animals. His second clue: a fireball, police and a very sharp exit. And who is the man who simply will not die? Danny is soon caught up in an incredible conspiracy and sets off on a strange journey - but first he has to get out of Oxford in one piece, which isn’t so easy when you attract chaos the way he does.",
