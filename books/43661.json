  "description": "Do bad things really happen to us for a good reason? Escape into the ALL THINGS IRISH shop in Door County, Wisconsin and laugh exploring why--as you indulge in outrageous Irishness, friendships as thick as Aran sweaters, and a quirky Wisconsin fishing village of diehard Scandinavians that wants to run the shop out of town. Meg McKenna spent the last decade avoiding her crazy mother’s shamrock-shaped world of Celtic witchery and bad Irish luck that brought nothing but heartbreak. But when locals threaten to put her mother’s newly-opened Irish shop out of business, the prodigal daughter returns, attracting unexpected surprises, laughter, friendship, romance, and more bad Irish luck—which her mother swears is a good thing.",
