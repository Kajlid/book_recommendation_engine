  "description": "Worse than losing his life would be to lose the woman he loves.  Stranded on a half world in an unknown galaxy, seven Terrans and four Seneecians have declared an uneasy truce. But when three more Seneecians arrive at the temple, including their leader thought to be dead, the balance of power suddenly shifts.  The Seneecian D'har immediately assumes command, and he makes it clear the Terrans are now under his jurisdiction. Everyone must obey his rule as he takes full control of their weapons, their lives, and the only female, Kelen. But when Kyber announces that he and Kelen have mated, Kyber is banished from their midsts.  What follows is a harrowing ordeal as Kelen Chambliss fights to be reunited with the Seneecian who has claimed her heart, and Kyber struggles to survive long enough to get her back.",
