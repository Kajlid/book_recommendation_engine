  "description": "Peter and Lucien are back in this third book in the Soul Mates series! Following Soul Mates: Bound by Blood, and Soul Mates: Deceptions, Soul Mates: Sacrifice, picks up after a vicious attack on Peter's new paranormal family. Peter may have rescued Lucien but his problems are far from over. Caleb, a vampire who was once a friend, is chained in the dungeon and waiting judgment. Peter's body is dying. He needs Lucien to make him a vampire, but no one knows what he might become if Lucien goes ahead with the change. With his control slipping, even as a human, Peter knows he has to cross over. But he needs Lucien to help him control his instincts, to keep him from hurting the people he loves the most. As enemies gather and allies appear in the strangest of forms, Peter has to make choices that may affect not just his life with Lucien, but also the lives of the vampires and Lycans who look to them both for leadership. Their coven. Unrest among the werewolves, friends' betrayals, and broken emotional connections conspire to keep Peter off balance, looking to Lucien, and deep inside himself, for the answers. Answers that could cost him everything, including his life. Good thing Peter thinks some things are worth making sacrifices for.",
