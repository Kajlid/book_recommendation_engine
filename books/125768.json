  "description": "A small town rescue romance -- saving more than their hearts!Brock inherited a bookstore with a tiny caf√© in the quaint but confining hamlet he grew up in. He never imagined coming home would bring brand new issues and maybe a man of his own to protect.Eddy is on the run. He may be a little paranoid with a side of anxiety and a tendency to be obsessive, but that doesn't mean someone isn't out to get him. Worse, it might be someone he knows. But he never thought he'd turn to a sexy, gruff and unlikely bookstore owner for help.Welcome to Foggy Basin. Just passing through? No problem. Here to stay, well, better find your place. Sit back, relax and get to know the townsfolk. They love hard and play even harder. Each book is a standalone but why not stay and get to know us and read them all.",
