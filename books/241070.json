  "description": "150 years after a virus wipes out most of the world’s population, Reagan Scott finds herself chosen for the State of the Union's fifth Culling. She will compete against 49 of the country's brightest girls. And then, of course, there are the 50 boys. She’ll have to pair up with one for her shot at becoming the next Presidential Couple. Though the government truly means well, not everything is as it seems. She will be tested to the fullest extent while an evil storm brews. With eliminations happening frequently, how far can she make it? And if she makes it far enough to meet the boys, how can she be expected to, at just 18 years of age, find a partner... for life? Does she have what it takes to be the next Madam President?",
