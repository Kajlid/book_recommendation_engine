  "description": "Rick Wakeman is one of the most gifted keyboard players of his generation, as at home on stage at a rock concert as in the organ lift of a great cathedral. He is known these days for his TV appearances on Grumpy Old Men and Countdown and for his hugely popular Saturday morning radio show on Planet Rock — enjoyed by some 5 million listeners worldwide. He also presents television shows and writes hymns. What’s more, he is also a great raconteur.Grumpy Old RockStar is a collection of previously untold stories from his amazing from touring in a white van in the early Sixties to buying an American football team with the Mafia; his drinking days — two bottles of vodka before lunch — and how he ended up with the earth from around Che Guevara’s body in his shed (given to him by his old friend and Yes fan, Fidel Castro).",
