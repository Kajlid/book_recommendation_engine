  "description": "A perilous homecoming…  It’s been years since Katelyn Bowden last set foot in Evers, Texas. Sent away at age four by her father, the town sheriff, after her mother was murdered, Katelyn thrived under the loving care of her aunt in Austin. Now that Alan Bowden is suffering from dementia and dying, it’s time for his daughter to finally come home. But that means having to face the new sheriff, John Davies, the handsome ex-New York cop whom her father has always loved as a son, a fact that Katelyn has long resented.  When John Davies realizes his mentor’s daughter may be hiding the key to a decades-old mystery, he fears that her repressed memories of her mother’s death could make her the target of a killer who’s still at large. He’s also finding it more and more difficult to resist his powerful attraction to the beautiful, talented artist. Then, as shocking revelations about local murders, past and present, slowly come to light, the threats against Katelyn’s life become all-too real—and only John Davies can protect the lady his heart commands him passionately to love from the peril that surrounds them both.",
