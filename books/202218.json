As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" is the complete and official playscript of the original, award-winning West End production. This updated edition includes the final dialogue and stage directions, a conversation piece between director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne, the Potter family tree, and a timeline of events in the wizarding world leading up to \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\"",
