After a lifetime of seeing demons, Selma Lehmann thought she had learned to tune them out and pretend like she was perfectly normal. As long as she stayed inside after dark and never looked one of them directly in the eye, she thought she would be safe. She was wrong.  After a vicious attack, Selma finds herself locked in a psychiatric facility and at the mercy of her worst nightmare - a handsome young psychiatrist with a devil’s horns and eyes like fire. He will do anything to break her, until she submits her body and soul to him. The only person who can save her from the ruthless doctor is a Demon Lord with a tortured past and darkness in his heart. But his price for saving her turns out to be far dearer than what Selma ever suspected. In return for his protection, he wants her heart.  Demon’s Mark is a dark and very spicy paranormal suspense romance. The series contains mature content and is unsuitable for readers under the age of 18.",
