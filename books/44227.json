  "description": "Estrange ACHS is a spy, a mercenary, but... The job he is obliged to honor, somewhat, bored him. Caught in the trap of the daily routine: the training units of Foreign Legion in French Guiana and the rescue of hostages from the clutches of kidnappers - whether they are in the desert or in the snowy mountains - his life changed when an amazing dream reminds him of a little girl that he had saved, by chance, twenty years earlier. Why remember that? Why now? On a whim he decided to leave and find the trace of Alma and the key of his dream, but what he discovered was not a part of his sober mind: A foreign organization infiltrated into the French army, experiments on the human genome which will lead to the creation of another race and that will transform his friend, Tyrone, into a hunter pursuing him as all those of his race, because Estrange is not an ordinary human, but a mutant! A de novo mutation was caused by a virus and retro-transcribed its RNA genome into DNA. So, his ancestors had become... VAMPIRES !",
