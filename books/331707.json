Follow in the footsteps of my father, starting with my undercover mission to spy and take down the target.Easy, right?Except I didn't plan on liking the target. And I sure as hell didn't plan on falling in love with her best friend either.The Hunter is a Black Spades Novella. It is the POV of another character from the series and therefore, you should have read the Black Spades Trilogy before starting The Hunter. It is intended to be read after the Black Spades and will contain spoilers from the series.",
