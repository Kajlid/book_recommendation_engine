  "description": "In a primitive world somewhere in the depths of time and space, a fearsome warrior awakens to the horror of a disembodied hand which rewrites the future and unleashes a sequence of events that will take him and his friends on a disturbing journey as they seek the physical incarnation of the prophetic City of God. They battle against the known and the unknown; the seen and the unseen as they struggle to claim the riches of the City as their own. As they make their way on their quest, they are forced to experience the deepest depths of their own souls, and face the greatest enemy possible - the enemy within. They bravely battle physical and supernatural enemies, but can they prevail against jealousy, obsession, insanity, lust, disease and their own sinful natures and find the Lost City and salvation? Who is good? Who is evil? Are we heroes, or are we just human? This immersive tale of adventure, fantasy and horror takes you on a journey through the deep, dark recesses of the human spirit and engages all your senses. Do you dare to dream?",
