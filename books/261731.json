  "title": "Leisure & Pleasure in the 19th Century",
  "description": "Leisure among the upper classes of nineteenth-century England was a rule of life. Whether in the self-indulgent days of the Regency, in the genteel world of Queen Victoria, or during the bohemian explosion of the nineties, no gentleman ever boasted of doing anything and no lady ever wanted to be caught doing what could be done for her. Leisure was de rigueur -and so was the tireless pursuit of pleasure.",
