  "description": "If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all… All Cassidy “Goldie” Nash wanted to do was be a nice guy. He certainly hadn’t meant to turn a corner too fast and knock a stranger down into a muddy puddle, and helping him up seemed like it was the right thing to do. He even gave the strange young man his coat because it was so cold out. Goldie thought it was odd that the man didn’t even say so much as a thank you before fleeing with his headphones firmly planted on his ears, and Goldie would later learn to regret his kindness. He’d left his wallet in his coat pocket after paying for coffee earlier that morning, and now the silent man knows where he lives. Goldie didn’t know it then, but speaking was the absolute worst thing he could have done… Because the silent young man heard him, and he liked it.Day Hanley was raised with a strict hand and a wildly perverse interpretation of scripture. Those who speak with venom under their lips and use their tongues to deceive must be quieted, and it is his mission to silence them. He hears it everywhere, a constant torrent of profanity and hatred spewing from every mouth that he has to shut out or he’ll go insane. But Goldie is not like anyone else Day has ever heard before. Goldie speaks as an angel does, and Day has to find out why… Even if it means he must silence him.Virtuous Sinners is a collection of gay romance stories that center on killers who are guided by a virtuous code. These dark novels are connected only by theme and can be read standalone.The killer's virtue in Pure Silence : Silence.",
