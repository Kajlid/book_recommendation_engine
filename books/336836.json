  "description": "A beat movement icon and visionary poet, Allen Ginsberg broke boundaries with his fearless, pyrotechnic verse. The apocalyptic \"Howl\" became the subject of an obscenity trial when it was first published in 1956 -- its vindication was a watershed moment in twentieth-century history. Dark, ecstatic and rhapsodic, \"Howl\" shows why Ginsberg was one of the most influential poets of the twentieth century.Howl and Other Poems is a collection of Ginsberg's finest work, including \"Howl,\" one of the principal works of the Beat Generation as well as \"A Supermarket in California,\" \"Transcription of Organ Music,\" \"Sunflower Sutra,\" \"America,\" \"In the Baggage Room at Greyhound,\" and some of his earlier works.",
