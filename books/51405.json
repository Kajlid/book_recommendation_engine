  "title": "Found: The Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World",
  "description": "A collection of \"Found\" magazine's best lost, tossed, and forgotten items, \"Found\" offers a fascinating glimpse into other people's lives. Discarded valentines. Ransom notes. To-do lists. Diaries. Homework assignments. A break-up letter written on the back of an airsickness bag. Whether they are found on buses, at stores, in restaurants, waiting rooms, parking lots, or even prison yards, these items give readers an uncensored, poignant, and often hilarious peek into other people's lives. By collecting them in his hit magazine, \"Found\" (and its companion website, www.foundmagazine.com), Davy Rothbart has bewitched the nation with a surprising window into its heart and soul and turned his many readers into an army of sharp-eyed finders. \"Found\" is chock-full of the latest and greatest of these finds, arranged in the style of the magazine, laying bare the tantalizing tales to be discovered in the trash we toss. By turns heartbreaking and hysterically funny, \"Found\" is a mesmerizing tribute to everyday life and our eternal curiosity about our fellow human beings.",
