  "description": "Four years after Airship Captain Stig Rayner left Isabelle Feeney Hemsworth on a London sidewalk with a sizable windfall tucked into her pocket, she's built a life for herself hauling cargo out of Moscow. When a trans-continental race is announced—with a lucrative cargo contract as prize—it's too good an opportunity for her to pass up. Unfortunately, it requires a teammate, and Isabelle has pissed off just about everyone who might be suitable. With one exception...Life hasn't been good for Stig since he deserted Isabelle in London. A string of bad decisions and worse luck have left him and his airship barely limping along. He heads for Moscow—home of the cheapest and shoddiest repair yards around. But the vodka flows like water and it's easy enough to get whatever kind of fix he's after. All he has to do is figure out how he'll pay for his repairs when the time comes...In Book Two of The Steam and Steel Chronicles, The Great Healion Race, we'll follow the trials and adventures of a reunited Isabelle and Stig as they race halfway around the world against formidable opponents.",
