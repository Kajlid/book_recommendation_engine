When Piper Owens returns home to care for her father and to try to pick up the pieces following her mother’s death, she needs that boy more than ever.  But Ryker Black isn’t a boy anymore and he’s not interested in reliving the past.  Now a patched member of the Knight’s Motorcycle Club, Ryker has a building threat from another club to worry about.  As Piper fights to rebuild her family's dream and to overcome her loss, can Ryker put aside past hurt in order to build a future?  This is the story of Piper and Ryker.
