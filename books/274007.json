  "description": "When a little girl called Nell makes friends with a tiny chick on her farm, it is the start of a journey that leads her into a dreamy circus realm. Was it something real or did it spring from her imagination? Nell will never be sure . . . but she leaves the tent uplifted by the wonderland that she found inside. Beautifully written by Nell Gifford, founder of Giffords Circus, and with stunning illustrations from Briony May Smith, this story brings the heart-stopping magic of the circus to the pages of a book. With a linen feel cover and foil, this sumptuous hardback makes a perfect gift choice.",
