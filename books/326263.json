  "title": "Psychic Children: Revealing the Intuitive Gifts and Hidden Abilities of Boys and Girls",
  "description": "The respected, world-renowned New York Times bestselling psychic takes on an intriguing new subject—the psychic abilities of children. Sylvia Browne shares profound stories of how children can be channels to the Other Side.  A child’s world is comprised of extraordinary things—vivid imaginations, imaginary friends, Zen-like naïveté, and a heightened sense of good and evil. In fact, it is now in vogue to proclaim that certain children are a direct channel to God, calling them Indigo Children or Crystal Children. But psychic Sylvia Browne knows these are merely fashionable labels. She recognizes that all children have unusual psychic gifts and abilities—including each one of us—but society has been conflicted about those gifts, at times cherishing them and often stifling them over the centuries.  Sylvia Browne writes from personal experience. After her own psychic abilities were revealed at age three, her mother tolerated but never encouraged her startling talent. Browne’s own son would exhibit psychic abilities of his own as a toddler, which she fully embraced and supported. What Browne has learned over a lifetime is that psychic gifts are present at incredibly tender ages; they are, in her view, special blessings from God. Some children learn to develop them while others are pressed to ignore them. In Psychic Children she illuminates the phenomenon, issuing a call to society for more understanding and acceptance of these remarkable children.",
