  "description": "New Evil. Relentless Vendettas. Deadly Games. Welcome back to the Dark City. I returned to the city with one thing on my mind; find my nemesis and finish her. Nothing else mattered. Not the shadowy Organization I worked for. Not the Magic Council and their veiled threats. None of it.Just me and the witch locked into one final dance. But things werenâ€™t exactly going to plan as I discovered a new, sinister threat. One that was trying to pry at the kind of locked doors that should never be opened, as well as driving a conspiracy to turn the entire world on its head. With Halloween just around the corner, the veil was thinning, bringing darker nights and wild magic. And a terrible danger that would fast turn me from hunter to hunted as I raced toward the final round of a deadly end game.",
