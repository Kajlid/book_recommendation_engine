  "title": "Women's Intuition: Unlocking the Wisdom of Your Body",
  "description": "Women's Intuition is real, says Paula Reeves. Encoded in a woman's DNA, this subtle yet potent source of knowledge has been doubted and dismissed as an old wives' tale. Because social conditioning and maledominated culture have caused women to feel disconnected from their own bodies, Dr. Reeves believes that most women are unaware of what their intuition is trying to tell them. In Women's Intuition , Dr. Reeves guides readers to remove the blocks preventing this channel of knowledge from informing and enriching their daily lives. By evoking bodybased intuition, readers can reestablish their bodymind bond and access their intuitive power for healing and insight.",
