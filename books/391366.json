  "description": "Wingin' It By Sahara Kelly When a slick-chick fairy from Manhattan takes an unscheduled trip to Europe, more than her wings and her pierced navel are flying. Ripple is out of her country, out of her depth, and in the arms of one incredible lover-Philippe Pinot Noir. Ripple knows he's a real special vintage, but probably not the one for her, since the politics of the French vineyard fairies are confusing, to say the least. The Chardonnays are inconsistently gay, the bees aren't as busy as they should be, the Cabernet Sauvignons and the Merlots cause nothing but trouble-and the Gewrztraminers? They make the Marquis de Sade look like a softhearted dust bunny. And to top it all off, Ripple can't find her favorite jeans! It's gonna take all this gal's smartass New York ingenuity to straighten out the tangle of vines that separates her from Philippe. Even then, she'll need a helping wing or two from friends in high places. And as far as her growing feelings for Philippe are concerned-well, when it comes to love, Ripple's just \"wingin' it.\"",
