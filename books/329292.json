  "description": "\"A classic, breathtaking adventure brimful of dangerous magic and clever politics.\"  ―Tasha Suri, author of  The Jasmine Throne on The Obsidian TowerThe Rooks and Ruin series concludes with this epic fantasy bursting with intrigue and ambition, questioned loyalties, and broken magic as Ryx fights to defeat the demons and save everything she loves. The Dark Days have returned. The Demon of Carnage mercilessly cuts through villagers and armies. The Demon of Corruption rots the land. The Serene Empire and the Witch Lords race towards war. And in the middle of it all stands Rxyander, the Warden of Gloamingard.  Burdened by conflicting loyalties and guilt, Ryx searches desperately for a way to defeat the demons before the world she loves is completely destroyed. To find answers, she’ll have to return to where it all started…the black tower at the heart of Gloamingard. By blood the Door was opened and only by blood will the Dark Days end. Praise for Rooks and \"A must-read for lovers of high fantasy.\" ―C. L.
