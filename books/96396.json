  "description": "In this sequel to the popular \"Paws & Claws: A Three Dog Mystery,\" Levi, Sunny and Yoda return to battle evil in the form of a gang of Raptors who call themselves the Birds of Prey. At stake is the freedom of a lost tribe of Parrots exiled from their home decades earlier. Even as the operatives of the Three Dog Detective Agency challenge the predatory Raptors, however, another peril arises, an illegal \"school\" where dogs are forced to fight to the death in savage gladiatorial combat. For Levi, the brave little Dachshund-mix who leads the Three Dog Detective Agency, both cases hit very close to home, and he vows to both end the Raptors' reign of terror and crush the dog fight ring. With the help of Sunny, a Golden Retriever, and the Pomeranian Yoda, he knows the Three Dog Detective Agency will prevail...somehow.",
