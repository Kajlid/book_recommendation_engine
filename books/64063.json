  "title": "Twelve Months of a Soviet Childhood: Short Stories",
  "description": "This collection of stories will take you from icy cold winter days in Moscow to sunny (or rainy!) summers in the Russian countryside. A brief note accompanies each story to help you understand the events, places, or characters described.Most books about the Soviet Union focus on politics, food shortages, or lack of democratic freedoms. This book portrays everyday experiences of a young girl growing up in the Soviet Union of the 1970's and 1980's. Childhood can be a magical and innocent time oblivious to political regimes and problems. And that's what these twelve stories strive to convey.",
