  "description": "Finding big, strong aliens isn’t all that hard once you start looking for them. Motivating said aliens to protect your species from plague-infested space pirates? Ehhh…that takes a bit of bargaining.For a warrior race on the brink of extinction, the price is an old-fashioned marriage alliance.Which is how Lanie ends up speed-dating on a moon in the middle of nowhere—with no liquid courage in sight. Horns. Tails. Fangs. Claws. How was a girl to choose? With mix-and-match monsters as potential mates, Lanie thinks she’s pretty much offering herself up as a not-so-virgin sacrifice.…and then she gets to know Delloruin, with his endearing protective streak and raw sexuality. Fen, who thinks deep and considers all sides while melting her with his soulful eyes. Hilom, who’s as sweet as he is deadly, a cocky fighter with a heart of gold.It would be easy to love each of them…and hard to choose just one of them.Thankfully, some aliens come in variety packs.Author's Note** THIS IS A M/F/M/M EROTIC ROMANCE WITH SCIFI & BDSM ELEMENTS **This 37,000-word novella is the short *introduction* to the Survivors of Paradise series! It's not a full-length novel. Expect a fun and quirky erotic romance with cross-species insta-love, explicit scenes (including safe, sane, and consensual BDSM elements) meant for readers 18+. There are scifi elements to the story, but this is an erotic romance at heart. Happily-For-Now endings are the norm in this series, as each couple does their part in the mission to save mankind ;)",
