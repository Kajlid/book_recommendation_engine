  "description": "50 States of Gay is marching across America to bring you tales of gay romance. These are love stories between two men. Yes - men will be kissing (and other stuff). From cowboys down in Texas to ski instructors in Vermont, to trappers up in Alaska and to surfers in Hawaii, 50 States of Gay will proudly wave the flag of equal love. In VOL 1: OKLAHOMA, OH-GAY!, you'll meet two comic book loving cowboys, a couple of storm chasers, the boys of the Oklahoma State Sooners' football team, and experience the small town welcoming home of a soldier back from overseas. These are 'slice of life' romance stories.",
