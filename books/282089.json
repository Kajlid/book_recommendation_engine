  "title": "The Globally Competent School: a manual",
  "description": "In this short, to-the-point book, renowned international educationalist Dr Helen Wright explains why global competence is so important for schools now, and why it provides the answer to the problem of how to future-proof education. She sets out a very clear and practical framework for schools to adopt in putting the development of global competence at the absolute heart of the school curriculum, and - addressing teachers and school leaders directly - she presents a persuasive but forceful case for the re-orientation of the school curriculum to ensure that the quest for greater global competence underpins all their activity. Crucially, she explains exactly how schools can achieve this.",
