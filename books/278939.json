  "description": "Michele Jaffe's sensual new novel Stargazer, set against the exquisite background of Renaissance Venice, is the story of a brilliant and beautiful doctor's daughter and the aristocratic rogue who crosses her path. Each suspects the other of killing a well-known courtesan; when they're forced to team up to prove their innocence, sparks fly. Jaffe is a Renaissance scholar, so she knows the eraâ€”and she knows the romance as well: this is timeless historical fiction, with the kind of luminous heat that shines from the romance shelves.",
