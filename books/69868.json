  "title": "The Path to Power",
  "description": "This is the story of the rise to national power of a desperately poor young man from the Texas Hill Country. The Path to Power reveals in extraordinary detail the genesis of the almost superhuman drive, energy & ambition that set LBJ apart. It follows him from the Hill Country to New Deal Washington, from his boyhood thru the years of the Depression to his debut as Congressman, his heartbreaking defeat in his 1st race for the Senate, & his attainment, nonetheless, at age 31, of the national power for which he hungered. In this book, we are brought as close as we have ever been to a true perception of political genius & the American political process. Means of Ascent, Volume 2 of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, was a number one national best seller &, like The Path to Power, received the National Book Critics Circle Award.",
