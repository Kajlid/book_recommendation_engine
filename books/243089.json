  "title": "Djara: Book One",
  "description": "It was a period in time known as the westward expansion, a time when people from all over the country moved west in search of silver and gold. The population influx created a shift, and the untouched frontier became inhabited by corrupt men consumed with greed and spurred by desperation. In mining towns overtaken by outlaws, the primary capital was crime. The law of the land was there was no law in the land. Orphaned as a child, rescued by magical Indians, and raised by a grizzly-bearded mountain man, Djara grew up to be the deadliest woman west of the Mississippi. With a steely determination as immovable as the white-capped Rockies, the gun-slinging bounty hunter fears only one a raven-haired beauty named Eden McAllister. When the trail of the ruthless Kody Lawless leads Djara back to Silverton, neither her resolve nor her Colt revolver is a match for a love as wild as the West. This novelette of approximately 15,000 words is the first book of the DJARA series.",
