  "description": "Liam Hamilton. The mysterious billionaire who is no more than a shadow. Are the rumors true? Does he actually exist?  Michelle isn't usually the adventurous type. Tonight, however, is an exception to the rule. After her boss kept her late and ruined the plans she had laid out for the evening she is determined to prove to herself that he doesn't own her.  Stopping at the nearest bar, she quickly finds herself in foreign territory. The outside wall is lined with motorcycles, and inside their riders. \"Just a quick drink,\" she tells herself before swallowing the lump in her throat.  Little does Michelle know that her stop is going to be anything but quick. She's soon going to find herself taking orders from the mysterious billionaire, and she's going to be doing it all night long.",
