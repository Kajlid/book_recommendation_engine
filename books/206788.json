She knows that it isn’t easy to become one of the Special Forces, but she has hurtled that first obstacle. Her last name might have got her through the door, but now she was going to have to prove herself to be somebody that others can rely on to have their back.

There’s a terrible secret that has led her to this life and it’s what’s driving her to become part of the team. She has a long road, but she’s strong and maybe a little bit stronger than she gave herself credit for.  Free for a limited time only!",
