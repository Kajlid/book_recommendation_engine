  "description": "Even immortality can have its tragedies.  Jane’s impressive powers allowed her to secure her family’s safety but at a terrible cost. Now, with a message from two mysterious beings, a new series of trials begins on Jane’s heart, mind, and soul.  The plague was just the beginning. Thrust among the most wicked creatures, she will learn more truths about the myths and monsters of her world while also discovering the extent of the power she holds. However, it is the source of her power that is her most evil rival and, this time, Death will not be there to save her. She will have to face her inner demon and new enemies all on her own.  Death’s absence gives Lucifer a greater opportunity to acquire Jane than ever before. His interest in her is unclear but one thing is certain, he desires to see her fall. Perhaps, though, that has been Jane’s destiny all along.  How else can darkness end if she, the most evil monster of them all, remains?",
