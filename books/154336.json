  "description": "The universe is full of probabilities. They govern what happens to us and what happens in the world around us. Every action we attempt has a chance of success - but Gregory Watson has a gift - he can manipulate those probabilities directly. Many men have systems which they claim can influence the fates or lucky items that help life go their way; the difference is Watson can actually do it. Unable to resist a puzzle, he stumbles on an unthinkable conspiracy which may destroy the world as we know it. Can even his gift stand against the forces arrayed against him?",
