  "title": "Billy Purgatory and the Curse of the Satanic Five",
  "description": "Billy Purgatory is a man plagued by questions - about his mother's disappearance, his love-hate relationship with vampire fatale Anastasia, and why the Time Zombie keeps stealing his girlfriends. The search for answers frequently leads him into danger and the darker corners of the world, corners he would prefer not to see. In his quest for answers, Billy begins using the Zombie's powers for his own designs, hurtling into the past in a time-bending attempt to create an ideal present. No one can predict the outcome of such a plan - especially not Billy. This time, his adventures take him high above the African plains, through the sleek, marbled halls of a mysterious mansion brimming with sinister science, and across the U.S. on a heated road trip with none other than Anastasia at his side. Vampires, demons, and an evil cabal known simply as the Satanic Five are all hot on his trail. Some answers don't come easily...but that's never stopped Billy Purgatory.",
