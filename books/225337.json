  "description": "Sunglasses. Check.Binoculars. Check.Notepad. Check.Mom's pink bike. Check. Check? Meet Sherman Mack. Short. Nerdy. Amateur P.I. and prepared to do anything for Dini Trioli.Nobody knows who began it or when it became a tradition, but every girl at Harewood Tech fears being D-listed, a ritual that wipes her off the social map forever. When Sherman believes Dini is in danger of being D-listed, he snatches up his surveillance gear and launches a full-scale investigation to uncover who is responsible.Could it be the captain of the lacrosse team?The hottest girls in school, the Trophy Wives?Or maybe their boyfriends?One thing is for sure: Sherman Mack is on the case. And he's not giving up.Part comedy, part mystery, and with all of Juby's trademark tongue-in-cheek humor, Getting the Girl takes on one of the cruelest aspects of high school: how easy it is for an entire school to turn on someone, and how hard it can be to be the only one willing to fight back.",
