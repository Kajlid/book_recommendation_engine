  "description": "When she catches Edmund Wyatt following her through the streets of London, Abbie Sharp learns that every British monarch for hundreds of years has known about—and financially supported—the Conclave. Furious that the monarchy would cooperate with such a nefarious group, Abbie refuses Wyatt’s request for help in catching the person who is blackmailing Queen Victoria with this secret information. But a far greater threat emerges when the Ripper, Max, returns and brings a string of new murders with him. Abbie must choose whether to help the Queen she now despises or stop Max from succeeding at his most diabolical plan yet—the creation of a whole new Conclave aimed at usurping the British throne.Praise for RESURRECTION:“In the stunning conclusion of the Ripper series, Amy Carol Reeves once again twists an engaging tale that is as riveting as it is macabre. Readers will appreciate the way that Abbie faces her dangerous villains head on--even when sometimes the most dangerous foe is her own heart. You'll want to sleep with the light on after this one.” --Gwen Hayes, author of Falling Under",
