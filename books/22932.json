  "description": "Bestselling author Rosemary Wells tells a heartfelt holiday story  The Chicago Tribune calls “One of the best.”It’s Christmas day and Morris is missing. He was there to open his present—a teddy bear—and to watch his older sisters and brother open their gifts. His siblings went off to play with each other’s new toys, but nobody wanted to play with Morris’s bear. So Morris found something new to play with—a disappearing bag. He jumped right in and became invisible! Now he has something everybody wants to try. But they have to find him first. This warm and humorous story proves that sometimes the littlest bunny gets the last laugh.* “Irresistible . . . The author-artist does some wonderful things with Morris’s cars and eyes, expressing exactly the sentiments of a put-out preschool rabbit.”— Booklist , starred review",
