  "description": "First in the exciting new Desert Dog series, starring hot and sexy bikers in the Southwest...  Backbreaking days, wild nights, and the hard hum of steel between your thighs...  That’s a life well lived, according to the Desert Dogs—four friends who call Fortuity, Nevada, their badlands home.  Vince Grossier is the self-crowned outlaw king around here. But when Fortuity’s slick new mayor invites a shady casino development to town, the invaders’ cutthroat takeover tactics quickly turn deadly. With police turning a suspiciously blind eye, it’s up to the locals to fight back, and Vince is on the front line. The pretty photographer hired by the developers might be the key to infiltrating the enemy. And a temptation too good to pass up.  Finally free of a controlling ex, Kim Paget’s not looking to be taken for a ride—not on the back of some tattooed roughneck’s bike and definitely not in his bed. But when she finds evidence that her bosses are rattlesnake-dangerous, Kim must entrust her safety to the man who threatens danger of a whole different kind.",
