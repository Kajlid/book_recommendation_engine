  "description": "Pity poor Robin Hood. Any red-blooded young Saxon can rob from the rich to give to the poor. Can win every archery contest in seven shires. Can keep seven-score rowdy, randy Merrymen under control. But those feats are not what made him a hero. He did it all wearing too tight tights. That is why he is celebrated in minstrelsy and in Hollywood movies. What outline did Maid Marian see etched against the crotch of those too tight tights? Friar Tuck wisely said that Robin Hood was an outlaw who could not be hanged. Because the womenfolk in Nottingham knew he was already well hung. Robin's true lusty adventures can now dare to be told in Tim Desmondes' revealing tale -- Inside Robin's Too Tight Tights.",
