A new heiress, Eliza is financially secure, courtesy of her aunt’s fortune, but even great wealth has its drawbacks since every greedy, fortune-hunting bachelor suddenly finds Eliza irresistible.To help her best friend, Violet takes Eliza’s romantic dilemma into her own hands, enlisting the social skills of her brother-in-law, Lord Christopher “Kit” Winter. Kit helps transform Eliza into a stunning belle, certain to attract a worthy beau. There’s just one problem: Eliza has always been head over heels in love with Kit, the very man who is trying to find her a husband! But during Eliza’s sometimes-comic extreme makeover, and with a few secret love lessons from Kit on the side, sparks–and passionate kisses–begin to fly. Kit soon finds himself completely overcome by an all-consuming desire for Eliza. But if he fails to realize his true love for her, he may lose this fair lady forever..",
