  "description": "Live life out loud.Chrissie Laursen doesn't date models. Having barely survived her battle with alcoholism and just out of a ten-year marriage that lasted nine years too long, she's laser focused on her thriving Miami Beach business: promoting erotic photographers in local galleries. She has no time for the ego driven pretty boys that proliferate in that business. For so long she's wondered if life and love would ever truly touch her that she decides to go it alone. Then she sees the glacial blue eyes and rugged, animal intensity of Nick Jessup, and her resolve begins to fracture.Irresistibly drawn to him, she begins a relationship with Nick and soon becomes obsessed with his dominant, controlling personality. Even his dangerous past doesn't scare her. But before their charged sexual energy culminates in passion, the peril of Nick's past explodes into the present and he is sentenced to thirty-five years in prison for a horrific crime. Faced with the reality that her life can either return to the empty normalcy she's always known or continue through the terrifying and exhilarating doorway that Nick's arrival has opened...she makes a decision to do something that will never allow her to go back to the fragile life she's just rebuilt.A wild, erotic, and powerful journey of self-discovery, The Outmate shimmers with the intensity of what it means to be human-and the clarity that comes with finding your truth before it's too late.- See more at: www.theoutmate.com",
