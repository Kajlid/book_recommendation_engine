  "description": "Isaac went against his family when he refused to join the military. He had dreams and he wasn’t going to cave to family pressure to give them up. So when his boss offers him an opportunity to get some real experience in the job he’s working toward, he leaps at the chance. The only problem is that his new boss is a grumpy dragon with a short fuse known to terrorize the office. But that wasn’t anything Isaac couldn’t handle. Right?Maverick always had a temper. Most dragons did. It wasn’t something that affected his work. Until it did. Overworked, consistently dealing with incompetence, Maverick was at his wit’s end and in a last bid to keep his temper in check, he agreed with a recommendation to hire a temporary assistant to help him. But when the stubborn pink haired mage shows up, his dragon takes notice and suddenly, Maverick’s limited control has gone up in smoke. Now his career is on the line, and the only person willing to help him was the one who drove him over the edge. Things couldn’t get any worse. Right? Grumpy dragons are impossible, Isaac takes shit from no one, Maverick loses his temper, angry sex, knots, teamwork makes the dream work, flying is awesome and Isaac wants more, bjs settle dragons, who knew?, telepaths are creepy, or are they?, never talk shit about a dragon’s mate, Isaac’s ideas are reckless, accidental bonding…maybe, two stubborn men fall in love, what could go wrong?, guaranteed HEA",
