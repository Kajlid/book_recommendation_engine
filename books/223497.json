  "description": "To kill a monster, you have to be twice as monstrous. To love a monster, you have to share your soul...Logan Bennett makes me want to have a future not tainted by the constant hunger for revenge. Doesn't mean I can stop. Doesn't mean I want to stop. It just means I want more... one day.But how do you make a good man love the monster inside you without stripping his soul away as well? He is all the best parts of me right now, resurrecting bits of my heart I forgot could even exist.He makes me feel something other than cold.He also thinks I'm weak and fragile. Something I laugh about to myself, while secretly soaking in all his protectiveness and concern.If anyone touches him, harms him, or even threatens him, then they should probably run. Because his girlfriend is a little bit crazy. They just don't know it yet.**BE WARNED: Some of the flashbacks in this one do get a lot more intense and detailed than the ones prior to this book. Anyone with sensitive triggers should skip the flashbacks.**Graphic**Sexual content**Language",
