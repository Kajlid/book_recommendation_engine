  "description": "Some things are inevitable, even with a fated mate. As the future alpha of the Silver Wolves, my life was carefully planned: stay hidden and learn to fight. But that didn't happen. My pack was slaughtered and now Iâ€™m running for my life. In my search for safety, I discover something else. My fated mate. The handsome jerk alpha can offer me something that no one else can--protection. The more I try to fight our mate bond, the more fate pushes us together, but I fear the price may be too much for both of us. As a hidden enemy hunts me, difficult decisions must be made. Choices that will alter my life forever or end it completely.",
