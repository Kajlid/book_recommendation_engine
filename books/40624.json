  "description": "Camul and Acco were both Gauls of the Pyrenees living at the time of Julius Caesar, both young and proud of their noble descent; Acco, also an Ovate training to be a Druid. In avenging the girl he loved Acco brought upon himself the curse of the Goddess; and in consequence both men left home to join the Roman army. The story tells of their adventures and travels which took them to Rome and across the greater part of the Empire as far as its Eastern rim. Duggan includes a brilliant account of the fate of Marcus Crassus's expedition of seven Roman legions and Gallic cavalry which set out to plunder Seleucia and met with the Parthian horse-bowmen under their leader the Surenas.' WINTER QUARTERS covers a remarkable amount of ground, and covers it convincingly... Mr Duggan throws the strengths and weaknesses of the era into sharp relief... damnably skillful' Sunday Times",
