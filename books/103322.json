  "description": "David had no idea that he would become a king's messenger and have to flee the palace for his life. He could have never fathomed that nektar pods would have transformative powers to heal a man on his death bed. Nor could he have predicted that he would fly over Quark Mountain on the back of a giant pelican. For him, saving the Prince's life on his thirteenth birthday was just one of those rare events, but it turned out to be an event that would eventually lead him on a fast-paced adventure, target him for death, introduce him to the Master, and change the future of the City of Corinth. Join author L.A. Francis for an incredible journey of excitement, faith, and history in The City of Corinth and the Secret Diary.",
