  "description": "Shortlisted for the Danuta Gleed Literary Award The innocence and clarity of Teri Vlassopoulos’s narrative voice reveals new and unexpected layers. The characters in these stories look for signs and omens as they attempt to understand events in their lives by framing them in abstract superstitions. The stories in Bats and Swallows are sharp, accurate, told with balance and skill. \"Vlassopoulos has found a way to carry over the wide-eyed curiosity and innate goodness of childhood into the mysterious, often sad, often tragic world of adulthood.\" — Montreal Review of Books",
