  "description": "Perhaps the only thing more annoying than being visibly disabled in a town full of wannabe heroes was being a fruit stand owner in a market known for its chase sequences. After spending all 17 years of her life as a land-bound mermaid stuck in the most hero infested town in the realm, Wynnie unfortunately has plenty of experience with both.All Wynnie wants to to save up enough money to one day move far away from Arvory and its heroes guild to open up a clothing shop somewhere a little calmer so when the Guild throws a competition to try and name a second official hero, she's distraught. But when the local heroes sidekick--an incredibly annoying goblin with a shapeshifting left arm--enlists her help in tricking the rest of the guild into believing that they're a full shifter, she sees the opportunity for what it is: the perfect chance to exploit a rich asshole. And maybe, accidentally, fall a little in love along the way.",
