  "title": "The Stranger on the Road to Emmaus",
  "description": "It's been called the most misunderstood book in history. Wars have been fought in its name, scandals have been precipitated by it, politics shaped and reshaped at its word. Theologians have both defended and reviled it. Skeptics have done the same. If you are a typical member of the human race, you have often been perplexed by all the fuss surrounding the Bible. The question remains, What does it really say? Here is a book that explains the greatest of Bible themes clearly and logically. Rather than focusing on one part and missing the whole the author chronologically binds together the entire text into one great universal drama, looking at events from the perspective of those who experienced history in the making. The results are sometimes comical, sometimes frightening but always true to the intent of the text. When you are done reading it, you may find yourself believing the Book like you never have before. Or you may decide not to. The author's objective approach leaves that decision up to you.",
