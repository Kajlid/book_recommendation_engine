  "title": "Ender's Game",
  "description": "Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer-simulated war games at the Battle School; in fact, he is engaged in something far more desperate. Ender is the result of decades of genetic experimentation, Earth's attempt to make the military genius that the planet needs in its all-out war with an alien enemy. Ender Wiggin is six years old when his training begins. He will grow up fast. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world-if the world survives. This, the author's definitive edition, also includes an original postscript written and recorded by the author, in which he discusses the origins of the novel.",
