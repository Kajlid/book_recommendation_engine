  "title": "Barbara Wright: Translation as Art",
  "description": "Legendary publisher and writer John Calder said of Barbara Wright that she was \"the most brilliant, conscientious and original translator of 20th century French literature.\" Wright introduced to an English-speaking readership and audience some of the most innovative French literature of the last hundred years: a world without Alfred Jarry's \"Ubu,\" Raymond Queneau's \"Zazie,\" and Robert Pinget's \"Monsieur Songe\" scarcely bears thinking about. This wonderful collection of texts about and by Barbara Wright--including work by David Bellos, Breon Mitchell, and Nick Wadley, as well as a previously unpublished screenplay written and translated by Wright in collaboration with Robert Pinget--begins the work of properly commemorating a figure toward whom all of English letters owes an unpayable debt.",
