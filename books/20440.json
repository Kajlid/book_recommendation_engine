  "title": "Ms. Wellington's Oak Tree",
  "description": "A collection of short stories covering over a decade: the death of the gods; life in a conservative, American family; the Earth in an age when corporations have taken over; a stoner coming back from yet another trip to Amsterdam; a rebellious youth traveling through Italy during the Renaissance; likely love in an unlikely setting; psychotic daydreams; a fat man stuck in his neighbor's window; and the dark side of living in a Freemocracy. Enjoy!",
