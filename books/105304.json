  "description": "Save the world or save her?Nathan’s job for the past three thousand years has been to clean up supernatural messes. Jaded, ruthlessly effective and selfless, he’s seen it all and can handle anything - demons, homicidal angels, even bad bosses. His latest challenge: A creature named Shadowman is seeking out three keys it believes will open a portal between earth and hell. Nathan must eliminate the human host guiding Shadowman to the keys. Except Nathan isn’t expecting the woman anchoring Shadowman to the human world to be beautiful, innocent and completely unaware of the creature manipulating her. Worse, she makes him feel alive for the first time in his long existence. Kaylee convinces herself stress and a tired mind are to blame for the ominous presence following her everywhere. On a routine visit to a client’s workplace, she stumbles across a deaf girl with a supernatural gift who warns Kaylee about Shadowman – and then stabs her. No longer able to pretend stress is the problem, Kaylee turns to the mysterious man who promised he can help, only to discover his plans for her may not involve her surviving the ordeal. She has nowhere else to go and no one else to trust. Does she take a chance on Nathan or risk facing Shadowman alone?",
