  "title": "The Seduction of Samantha Bowman",
  "description": "To all appearances, Samantha Bowman is a happily married 48 year-old grade school teacher who enjoys life with her techie husband Charlie. But behind closed doors, she’s a bit restless as she deals with a stressful job and a distant husband, whose only interest appears to be inventing virtual reality for his company, Holotech. Looking for a little harmless fun, Samantha escapes to one of Holotech’s “Adult” virtual games on Thursday afternoons where she feels more sexy and desirable than she has in years. She loves the game, and soon becomes obsessed with one actor in particular: Pool Boy. Before long, he’s all she can think about—unaware that behind the scenes Charlie’s unscrupulous business partners Dante and Niles have seen an opportunity to further their own agenda. Fantasy sex soon turns all too real with deadly repercussions. A crazy wild ride featuring a cast of characters you will remember long after you’ve finished the story.",
