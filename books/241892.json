  "description": "â€œTen years have passed since the Demon War. The Forest's scars are slowly healing, the Darkwood is still and silent, and few demons ever venture out of the endless night. But in a clearing not far from the Darkwood boundary, in a darkness where a sun has never risen and a moon has never shone, an ancient evil stirs in its sleep and dreams foul dreams.\"And with those words, New York Times bestselling author Simon R. Green begins the third of his Forest Kingdom novels, a classic sword-and-sorcery quest of four Rangers, three outlaws, and one Infernal Device that could reawaken a Beast that's best left sleeping. Travel along with Duncan MacNeil, the witch Constance, Jessica Flint and Giles Dancer as they -- and their buried secrets -- go down among the dead men on the adventure of a lifetime.",
