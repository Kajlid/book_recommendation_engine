He'd rather have nothing to do with them, until the world-class sniper known only as The Whisper takes a shot at him...and misses. While Marcus' supervisors wrangle over red tape, Marcus follows the trail back and meets Ilaria, a hot-tempered, diminutive, smoldering Italian beauty who captures his scarred and defensive heart.Meanwhile, Cyneric PÃ¦ga's radar is prickled by a trail of clues that he puts together to reveal that Ilaria Scarvo, a vampire assassin just like Rick once was, is in town. He doesn't know who The Whisper's target is but Nial, leader of the revolutionaries, is at the top of the list. Then Rick meets Ilaria and finds she's not at all a cold-hearted killer. Ilaria is a wounded woman with a terrible secret that binds Rick to her.Is Ilaria working for the League for Humanity, or the Pro Libertatus? Is she involved with Menes Heru's plans to use the doomsday weapon, the Blood Stone? Or is she as innocent as both Marcus and Rick want desperately to believe?",
