Me being a serial killer ain’t common knowledge, and if there’s one thing I know, it’s a spiteful heart. He’s killing girls to get back at me.Sylvester, Maddox, and Viper are my rocks. My sexy mafia men who’d do anything to keep me safe, even if it means lying to me. But I’m no damsel in distress, and I don’t deal with liars. They better shape up if they want to stay on my good side.I got a serial killer to catch, and I’m gonna do it whether I have their help or not.One, two,you better believe the Night Slayer’s coming for you.Three, four,by the time I’m done, you won’t be begging for more.*Spiteful Heart is the second book in the Born to Die trilogy, and thus includes darker themes.
