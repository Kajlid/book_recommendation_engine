  "description": "Shy Neil Bricker can’t imagine a worse high school to attend than E. Hill Regional when he enrolls in 1979. Adding to his adolescent angst are a bullying classmate and a tense relationship with his adopted black brother, who has seamlessly folded into the school's social scene. Neil is envious until a disturbing event reveals he isn’t the only one of the three who’s uncomfortable in his own skin.",
