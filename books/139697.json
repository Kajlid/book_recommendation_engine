  "title": "The Warlords of Andromeda",
  "description": "Three hundred years after Earth’s sentient internet takes the planet into Singularity—and out of spacetime—to avoid a sun going supernova ahead of schedule, the fleeing Martian colonists have found another kind of liberation. Using space warping ships they spread their seed across Andromeda. But if Frakas, the genius bioengineer who created a new Cambrian explosion of humanoid life, and the first of the hundred year men, clones designed to uplift souls, were enough to see them through the first leg of their journey, they are not around to be leaned on anymore. So begins the second of The Hundred Year Clone sagas, THE WARLORDS OF ANDROMEDA, and the reign of Dargan, the second clone. But will the ingenious tactics of Dargan’s warlords be enough to unseat the powers threatening the empire from within as well as from without? Or will these highly evolved humanoid species merely use their genetic and cybernetic enhancements to make better war on a scale never before imagined, using imaginative methods only such technological breakthroughs—not to mention sprawling space armadas—could accommodate?",
