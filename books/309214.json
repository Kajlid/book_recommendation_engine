  "description": "As the boss, he makes the rules. For her, he wants to break them. If there’s one hard-and-fast rule Miles Steele knows he must follow as an administrator, it’s that he should maintain professional boundaries. His resolve is put to the test when the new guidance counselor catches his eye. Having all but given up on love, Miles is shocked by his budding feelings for the much younger staff member. Zoey Porter has admired her boss from afar since day one at Newberry High. Miles is responsible and dependable, not to mention a bit of a silver fox. Though she’s drawn to the handsome assistant principal, the last time Zoey opened her heart she was crushed, making her wary of pursuing Miles. When they attend a weekend-long conference out of town, the heat between the pair sparks into a full-blown flame, but lingering secrets possess the potential to burn them both.",
