  "description": "Middle-aged bookstore owner Willa Chance is often haunted by ghosts who want her to do their bidding. Usually it involves the nasty business of bringing their killer to justice, so when the ghost of Adelaide Hamilton asks her to find an old recipe book and give it to Elspeth Whipple, it seems like an easy job.Except Willa's search for the book has her crossing the path of Sheriff Eddie Striker one too many times for comfort. He's acting almost as if he's investigating a murder, but Adelaide died of natural causes. Didn't she?When it turns out Adelaide's entire family had means, motive, opportunity, Willa's search becomes dangerous, and she finds herself matching wits with a cold-blooded killer that wants the same thing she does. Luckily, Willa's cat Pandora is looking out for her and enlists the aid of the other cats of Mystic Notch who will stop at nothing to ensure Willa's safety as well as the recovery of the book ... even if it takes a little bit of magic.",
