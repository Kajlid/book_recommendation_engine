  "description": "Women Heroes of World War I brings to life the brave exploits of 16 women from around the world who served their countries at a time when most women didn’t even have the right to vote. Seventeen-year-old Frenchwoman Emilienne Moreau assisted the Allies as a guide and set up a first-aid post in her home. Russian peasant Maria Bochkareva joined the Imperial Russian Army, was twice wounded in battle and decorated for bravery, and created and led the all-women combat unit the Women’s Battalion of Death. American journalist Madeleine Zabriskie Doty risked her life to travel twice to Germany during the war. Resented, watched, and pursued by spies, she was determined to report back the truth. These and other suspense-filled stories of daring girls and women from around the world are told through fast-paced narrative, dialogue, direct quotes, and document and diary excerpts. Historical background information opens each section, and each profile includes informative sidebars and “Learn More” lists of books and websites for further study, making this a fabulous resource for young history buffs or anyone who likes tales of bravery and courage.",
