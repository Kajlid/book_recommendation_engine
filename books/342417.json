  "title": "The Girls Come Marching Home: Stories of Women Warriors Returning from the War in Iraq",
  "description": "In her award-winning Band of American Women at War in Iraq , Kirsten Holmstedt described how female soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are fighting on the front lines in Iraq despite the military's ban on women in combat. Now Holmstedt tells the stories of America's fighting women as they come home from Iraq. Some return with grave physical wounds, but all struggle with the psychological toll of battle while readjusting to life at home. As Holmstedt so poignantly shows, these women may have left the war, but the war will never leave them.",
