  "description": "Watch out for those umbrella drinks. Not even one day at sea, and I find myself the bride of a sea monster. In order to break a curse, I am supposed to marry a sea monster. Considering I only barely tolerate seafood, that isn’t going to work for me. Nor will I be guilted into doing it. Why should I wreck my life for a stranger? Instead, I leave on a cruise and get bitch-slapped by fate. The first night aboard, not only do I get wasted, I accidentally wind up married to the multi-armed beast I’d sworn to avoid. Turns out he’s not half bad, though, which is why I am trying to find a way to break the curse before he turns into a monster forever.",
