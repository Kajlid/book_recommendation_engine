  "description": "The right cause can topple a kingdom.Once upon a time, the kingdoms of Wales were rife with magic and conflict—and eighteen-year-old Mererid, or Mer, is well acquainted with both. As the last living water diviner, she can manipulate water with magic, and it's a skill many would kill to possess.For years, Mer has been running from the prince who bound her into his service and forced her to kill hundreds with her magic. Now all Mer desires is a safe, quiet life far from power and politics. But that peace is disrupted when Mer’s old handler returns with a proposition: use her abilities to bring down the very prince that abused them both. With a motley crew of allies—including a fae-cursed young man, the lady of thieves, and a corgi that may or may not be a spy—Mer must decide whether to run for the rest of her life or stand and fight for the true freedom she's long desired.Part heist novel, part dark fairy tale, this immersive and ethereal fantasy from acclaimed author Emily Lloyd-Jones will enchant readers until the very last page.",
