  "description": "Office Ethics Rule #1 - Do not date your boss. But aren’t rules meant to be broken?  Nora Ridgeway was comfortable in her relationship; her boyfriend was not. Now, jobless, homeless, and boyfriendless, Nora sets out for Washington D.C. to prove to herself—and her mother—that she can actually “adult”. Her “No more bad decisions” policy is tested right away when her new boss proves to be tall, dark, and broodily handsome. Can she resist his adorable dimple to keep her job and her dignity? Andrew Forrester is Mr. I-Don’t-Do-Relationships. He’s focused on his career and doesn’t have time for emotional females. Until he watches his new assistant swimming in a bikini and wonders what it would be like to trace the drops of water on her body with his tongue. Unfortunately, rule #1 of having a subordinate is “No touching”. But, what if no one found out? Can Nora and Andrew figure out a way to navigate an office romance while still each getting what they want?",
