  "title": "The Great Apocalypse",
  "description": "Thomas Adams is a talented editor for a major New York book publisher. He lived quietly until a beautiful forensic psychologist came into his life. When she disappears under mysterious circumstances, he becomes obsessed with unraveling a \"story\" that unites the Bible, a lost masterpiece by Hieronymus Bosch, Jewish legends, apocryphal literature, fairy tales, forgotten Gnostic heresies, end time predictions of nineteenth century apocalyptic sects, and even a religious propaganda film for children. The story that begins to unfold is too fantastic to believe, but it contains a strange internal logic. Thomas becomes convinced that the key to solving this mystery involves an ancient purple-clad rebel from Jewish legend. Then he discovers an obscure reference from a second-century bishop mentioning a claim that this same rebel escaped the wrath of God when the Goddess Sophia carried him away.Thomas' investigation takes a sinister turn when elements of the \"story\" begin to play out in real life. He uncovers clues that indicate a Great Apocalypse is imminent. A countdown has begun, and Thomas must confront a greater threat than he ever imagined.The first book of the Sparlock Trilogy is an intriguing exploration of our history and myths, our shared dreams and nightmares. It examines the hidden meaning behind the stories we tell our children and the lies we sometimes tell ourselves.",
