  "description": "A dead body. A missing daughter. A silver blade. All the clues point to one person: Me. My name is Evangeline, and I'm a retired assassin who wants nothing to do with the underworld. But an edict from a Demonic Lord forces me to return to the man and the life I left behind. I have seven days to prove my innocence. Whoever set me up is going to die. **** \"Xai...\" His fingers knotted in my ponytail as he yanked my head back to the angle he preferred. Oh, I knew that look. Nothing good ever came from that look. I flattened my palms against his bare chest, but he pushed right through my physical barrier and took my mouth with a ferocity that screamed possession. His tongue demanded entrance, and when I tried to fight him, he bit my lip hard enough to bleed. On my gasp, he entered and unleashed his desire in a kiss that deprived me of oxygen. My knees threatened to buckle under his assault. He took my mouth the way he did my body, reminding me who we were to each other with a few bold strokes. I melted for him, as I always did. God, I missed this. I missed him. I hated it. Loved it. Craved it... -- Daughter of Death is a standalone paranormal romance with dark elements, demons, angels, a sadistic alpha male, blood, and a lot of dead bodies. What can I say? Eve likes her knives, and Xai enjoys watching her play.",
