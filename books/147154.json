  "description": "Theo has five days to save Lizzy.Theo’s plots to rescue Lizzy from Mannix haven’t worked. But now, for five days, she will stay at Theo’s house, five days of conversations, of glances, of touches, but he thinks it won’t be enough.For two days, Theo will stick to his ethics, but after that, Theo is more than willing to break all his rules, even if he ends up with a broken heart.Lizzy was devastated when she realized that Mannix considers her to be just another interchangeable woman even though he told her he loved her. Heartbroken and numb, she doesn’t even protest when he gives her away while he goes on a business trip, even when he gives her to Theo, who seems reluctant to take her. Running away seems impossible because sports reporters are stalking her college dorm, asking when she is going back to Pajari Gym. The Devilhouse is in ruins. Someone attacks Theo’s house, maybe Russian hit men sent by her parents to scare her into going back to New Jersey.Should Lizzy be with Theo as Mannix instructed her to do, or should she stay out of Theo’s bed as he commanded, or will she run into the cold night yet again?",
