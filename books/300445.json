  "title": "Rex Appeal: The Amazing Story of Sue, the Dinosaur That Changed Science, the Law, and My Life",
  "description": "When Peter Larson and his team at the Black Hills Institute discovered the world's largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton beneath a South Dakota butte in 1990, Larson knew it was the find of a lifetime. He had no way of foreseeing that \"Sue,\" as they called the fossil, was about to plunge him down a rabbit hole into a topsy-turvy world of FBI agents, government prosecutors, powerful museums, Native American tribes, and competing paleontologists. As Larson began the biggest battle of his life - to hold on to Sue and to keep himself out of prison - an amazing thing happened. He and his Black Mills team began finding more and more T. rex. Reinventing the science of paleontology and hitting paydirt again and again, Larson became a lightning rod for the controversies rocking paleontology and the envy of fellow bonehunters everywhere.",
