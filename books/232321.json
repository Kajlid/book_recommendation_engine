  "description": "In 1963, shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy promises Mariska Bakunin, a poverty-stricken Chicago Ukrainian child, he will find her father lost in one of the massive mental hospitals of mid-twentieth century America. Kennedy also promises the nation he will close these institutions as they have imploded into horror. Kegs Addams, wealthy daughter of a federal judge and a mentally-ill mother who disappeared when Kegs was six years old, shows up in Mariska’s neighborhood as the Welfare worker. Kegs wants to escape the memory of her mother rather than find out what happened to her. She accomplished this as a child by mastering foreign languages. Now, graduating from college, she plans to enter President Kennedy’s Foreign Service and move from country to country as an American diplomat. When her father’s illness delays her plans to enter the Foreign Service, Kegs reluctantly takes the Welfare job to help her overburdened best friend, Maggie Cahan.",
