  "description": "After interviewing a number of old informants, the author, Edith M. Thomas, wove together this factual but fictitious story of Mary Midleton and her visit one summer to the farm of her Aunt Sarah and Uncle John.At age nineteen, Mary is about to be married and feels the need of learning about \"how to keep house, cook, economize and to learn how to get the most profit from life.\" What better school could she have than the Bucks County farm home of her great aunt and uncle. Aunt Sarah teaches Mary various crafts (especially beadwork and rug-making) and reveals the mysteries of cooking in hundreds of pages of authentic and traditional recipes, many accompanied by the stories and lore associated with them.
