  "description": "Contance, a beautiful and passionate woman, is deeply unhappy in her marriage to the invalid, Clifford Chatterley. Her emotional paralysis mirrors his physical conditon and it is not until she finds refure in the arms of Mellors the game-keeper that she feels regenerated. Together they move from an outer world of chaos towards an inner world of fulfilment.This edition reproduces the Cambridge text, the first edition ever to restore to Lawrence's most famous work the words he wrote and the first to correct authoritatively the 1928 Florence edition which Lawrence personally supervised.",
