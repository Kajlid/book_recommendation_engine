  "description": "It was a town where its sons had gone away to fight in their country’s newest wars. Their fathers before them had temporarily stepped away from farm and family to fight Freedom’s fight. Grandfathers, and even great grandfathers, had answered the patriot’s call to arms. Each time, after the fighting was done, those who lived through it returned “home” to once again pick up a plow for sowing the seeds of peace. And the community had sewn their names into the fabric that was becoming America the Beautiful.",
