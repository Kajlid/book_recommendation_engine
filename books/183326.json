  "description": "*This is a serial. The installments are not novel length. Intended for readers over 18.*  Harley’s story continues with the second part in the Inferno Glory series. After she’s reunited with her estranged brother, and learns his intentions are less than honorable, she’s plagued with the choice between staying to protect herself and the MC, or leaving before Colt destroys who she’s become.  When Colt catches Harley on her way out of town where she plans to clear her head for a few days, he’ll invite himself and Ranger to make sure she’s ‘properly spoiled.’ Once they’re all reunited on the beach, sparks will fly.  The pressure increases to full throttle when Harley is in the middle of two hot bikers with one possibly wanting more than she can give. The heat of multiple men and the fear of her twisted brother may make her leave the MC family for good, and send her running into the arms of another man.",
