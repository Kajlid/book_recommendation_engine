  "description": "A dark, wry, captivating tale, inspired by an unsolved American true crime mystery. My Sister, My Love is based on the controversial true-crime mystery of the JonBenet Ramsey murder. When a beautiful, ice-skating child prodigy is found brutally murdered, suspicion immediately mounts against friends, neighbors, and even the young girl's own family. Told from the point of view of the dead girl's brother, and in the inimitable style and gripping voice that has long been Oates's trademark, My Sister, My Love explores the darkest corners of the human psyche, and takes the reader into a twisted world that only the most daring and imaginative of novelists can capture.",
