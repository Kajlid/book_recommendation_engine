  "description": "One day Benny the woodpecker awakens to the best tummy-rumbling smell ever and discovers it’s something called waffles . He must taste them! He pecks on the door of the waffle house, but he gets the boot. He tries to sneak in, but he gets swept away. Each time Benny tries, he just can’t seem to get to those delicious waffles. The other forest animals laugh at “Woodpeckers don’t eat waffles!” they say. But Benny has a brilliant plan. . . . Steve Breen has created a delightful picture book with pitch-perfect humor and tons of visual gags that will keep readers coming back for more! Now a Chicago Public Library Best of the Best Book of 2016!",
