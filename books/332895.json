  "description": "Hope Moran had fashioned for herself a life of love without commitment, caring without intimacy, compassion without investment. As a priest, she ministered to the masses and gave time and effort to the homeless. As a dresser on Broadway, she ministered to her charges, stage stars in need of a steady, guiding hand. Always tending the needy, and always at arm's length.Until Ian, a broken actor more deeply troubled than she could have imagined slipped into her life and crossed the forbidden boundary into her heart. At the wrong time in his life. At the right time in hers.",
