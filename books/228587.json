  "description": "There's no instruction guide to saving the world, so...apologies in advance if I make a mess of it!An ancient mage plans to unleash an army of vamps, demons, werewolves, and shifters onto an unsuspecting Chicago, and I'm the last protector of humanity, a witch who goes into panic-attack mode just talking with a stranger. My name is Celestina Sykes, and I have two potential allies, my aunt, who may have murdered my mom, and a guy I sorta have a thing for, only he may be working for the other side. All told, I've got two days to stop the apocalypse, so wish me luck...and multiply that by infinity because I'm gonna need it.",
