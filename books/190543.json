So in order to care for her children, Ellie takes the only job available: that of her late husband, the sheriff.Ellie has long proven that she can handle herself, and her role as sheriff is largely symbolic. Yet the wariness of her male subordinates and the townspeople is palpable. Soon, as dark secrets come to light, Ellie is forced to grapple with the tenuous ties she shares with a convicted killer and the small-town superstitions that have plagued her for years.When a condemned killer is sentenced to death for his crime, her opportunity to do so presents itself in a way she never expected.
