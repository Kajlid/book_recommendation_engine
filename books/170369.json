  "description": "Candice Lowell founded and runs her own very successful publishing company. However, that success has come at a considerable personal cost. Years of near unending work had effectively bulldozed her once active social and sex life, and it had shown no signs of resurfacing. This situation is turned sideways and upside down in one night, when she meets the new author of Dominance and submission erotica who has been affecting her company's bottom line. This private man reads past her cast iron business persona and sees something in her that she didn't know existed.",
