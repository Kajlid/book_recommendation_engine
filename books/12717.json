  "description": "Chocolate Guitar Momos kicks off with young aspiring musician Joseph getting kicked out of a relationship, yet again, by his third girl- friend. Believing that relationships won't work out unless they're destined to be, he decides to track down a girl he believes might have been his soulmate—a girl who had smiled at him from a bus stop across the street eight years ago. The minor obstacle: he knows nothing of her—no name, no address, nothing. The major obstacle: he doesn't even remember her face! The only thing he does remember is that she was wearing a grey skirt. Harnessing the reach of radio and the internet, and dragging along his skeptical but loyal buddy Utpal, Joseph embarks on a search for his soulmate. Laugh- out-loud moments and incidents ensue.",
