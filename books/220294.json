  "description": "An elderly Blackfeet warrior tells the story of his youth, when his tribe owned and lived free on the great plains at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. During those days of freedom and plenty, they hunted the vast herds of buffalo, worshipped their ancient gods and sought glory in war parties against their traditional tribal enemies. In order to achieve his adulthood in the tribe, Little Otter must face the dangerous vision quest to find his sacred helper and then risk death as a member of a daring war party. Most of all, though, Little Otter wants to become a Sun priest. Alone, armed with nothing more than his own strength, he must capture and kill an eagle for its sacred and power-giving feathers. With the guidance of the elderly Sun priest Red Wings, he prepares himself to take on the most death-defying test of To become a seizer of eagles.Originally published in 1922, Seizer of Eagles relates this tale, as told by the elderly Old Sun to his white friend James Willard Schultz (1859 â€“ 1947), who knew the Montana frontier well. Arriving at Fort Benton in Blackfeet territory in 1877, Schultz married his beautiful Blackfeet wife, Natahki, and spent decades as a trader, rancher and hunting guide in what is now western Montana. He also spent his later life writing 47 books, many of them novels about his friends, the Blackfeet Indians. Seizer of Eagles has long been out of print, but this new digital edition, with a detailed, original introduction by Bryan R. Johnson, makes this fascinating tale of adventure available once more to the public.",
