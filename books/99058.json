  "title": "The Elven Star Oracle: A System of Divination for Star Enchanters",
  "description": "“The Elven Star Oracle” is an original divinatory system created by the Silver Elves invoking the 88 major constellations and the blessings of the Shining Ones for guiding one through the world and ever closer to the realization of Faerie. It is called \"The Elven Star Oracle\" because it is based upon the seven pointed Elven Star, sometimes called the Faery Star, and the areas between the points, overlaid on the dimensional manifestation of Faerie and the realms that are linked to it.",
