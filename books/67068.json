  "description": "An alternate cover edition can be found here.A war weary veteran, Chris Owens, returns to his apartment after his team's mission in rural Western Maryland. The mission to find and secure a contaminated soldier appeared successful, but the situation quickly spirals out of control as the uncontained virus spreads at an astounding rate. As death spreads across the landscape, it has an even more ghastly consequence and small groups of everyday people try to survive. A father and his two children witness the destruction and death from the distance of their remote cabin, but they are not insusceptible to the onslaught of the virus. A woman and her elderly father avoid the quarantines and roadblocks to escape the city only to find death encroaching in the countryside. As these few survivors band together in a world where they are the minority, their survival is measured in hours. Chris deals with his own demons while attempting to avoid the ever growing number of infected who relentlessly pursue the survivors; his mission: to keep everyone alive long enough to find asylum or answers. Time is quickly running out.",
