  "description": "Olalla is a Gothic horror novella written by Robert Louis Stevenson, first published in 1885. The story is set in Spain and follows a young Scottish soldier named Fettes, who is recovering from battle wounds at a remote castle. There he meets the beautiful but mysterious Olalla, who lives with her family in isolation. As Fettes becomes more infatuated with Olalla, he begins to uncover dark secrets about her family's past and their connection to his own. The story explores themes of identity, family, and the struggle between good and evil. It is a haunting and suspenseful tale that showcases Stevenson's mastery of the Gothic genre.But the intelligence (that more precious heirloom) was degenerate; the treasure of ancestral memory ran low; and it had required the potent, plebeian crossing of a muleteer or mountain contrabandista to raise, what approached hebetude in the mother, into the active oddity of the son. Yet of the two, it was the mother I preferred.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
