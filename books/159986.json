  "description": "We've lost something. Society's increasing secularization has stripped the sacred from our lives and culture—jettisoning much that is bright and good in exchange for dark, dull substitutes.Every human society has had religion—has needed religion. It is foolish to think ours is any different.But at the same time, the ancient cosmologies and disproved beliefs of the world's major religions feel increasingly dissatisfying and irrelevant to growing numbers of people.The Triple Path offers a solution. It sets forth a new monotheistic religion that harmonizes tradition and science. It reconciles our great Western heritage with modern knowledge, but with an emphasis on keeping as much as possible of the teachings and practices of Western tradition.When you honestly appraise yourself and your life, could you be aiming higher? Perhaps existence is calling to you to do more, to be more. Perhaps the Triple Path is calling to you. Test its fruits for yourself. Come back to religion and God.",
