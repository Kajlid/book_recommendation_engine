  "description": "Many self-help books are available to single women that shed light on the various types of men to avoid in today's dating scene.What about advice for single men on what types of women they should avoid?There are a number of women in society who would make any man a wonderful wife, girlfriend, or platonic friend.Then there are other women who only look to take advantage of men who are naive and highly libidinous for their own egotistical and/or financial advantage.Book Author Alan Roger Currie releases yet another book (in both a paperback and Kindle eBook version) that is filled with his unique brand of knowledge and wisdom related to how single men and women verbally communicate their romantic and sexual desires and interests to one another.Currie once again highlights the fact that when a man expresses his romantic or sexual desires, interests and intentions to women in a very \"cautious,\" \"vague,\" \"ambiguous,\" or \"beat-around-the-bush\" manner, that the man potentially opens himself up to be misled and taken advantage of by women who are seasoned manipulators of men.",
