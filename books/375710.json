  "description": "It only takes a little to be BIG!Meet Clifford & Emily Elizabeth in the original Clifford book! Clifford is big. Clifford is red. But most of all, Clifford knows how to be a good friend!Like other dogs, Clifford sometimes chases cars; unlike other dogs, Clifford catches them. Like other dogs, Clifford digs in the garden; but while other dogs may dig up a few flowers, Clifford can dig up a whole tree. Also like other dogs, Clifford chases cats—big cats, like lions! When Clifford messes up, he messes up big time!This is how it all began—in 1963, \nNorman Bridwell\n published his very first Clifford book, and kids have loved Clifford ever since. He's an adorable dog whose well-meaning bumblings have great kid-appeal. Clifford is Emily Elizabeth's, and everyone's, favorite big red dog!Orifinally published in 1963, Clifford the Big Red Dog launched a popular children's book series, now with more than ninety million books in print. Clifford books, with their understated texts, slapstick illustrations, and tounge-in-cheek humor, have entertained generations of children all around the world.",
