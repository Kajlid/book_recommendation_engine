  "description": "In the first Crime of Fashion mystery, fashion reporter Lacey Smithsonian tackles a deadly fashion crime in Washington, D.C., \"The City Fashion Forgot.\" A beautiful dead hairstylist, a straight razor, a horrendously bad haircut: The cops call it an open-and-shut case of suicide, but Lacey's subtle style instincts (and her punk hairstylist, Stella) all say it's murder. Amid ditzy diva stylists, a fog of D.C. scandals and conspiracies, and a wave of \"assisted\" suicides, Lacey must tease out the twisted truth before she becomes the victim of the Capital City's next fatal coiffure, assisted by her unstoppable stylist, a short-circuited psychic, and the one man she thought she'd never have a second chance with. And they say a bad haircut can't kill you--or can it?",
