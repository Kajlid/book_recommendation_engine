  "description": "I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie is a hilarious collection of Roger Ebert's reviews of films that he believes should be avoided at any cost. And yet there is a certain allure in the deliciously caustic comments that make the reader actually want to go out and see these movies. After all, who wouldn't want to watch a movie so magnificently bad that its \"sincere idiocy...has to be seen to be appreciated\"?",
