  "title": "Inside the Robe: A Judge's Candid Tale of Criminal Justice in America",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered what a judge is really thinking? To most people, judges are mysterious creatures. Judge Mader shines a bright spotlight on the hidden folds of the judging world. The old saying is that judges merely \"follow the law.\" Yet following the law can produce wildly different results depending upon each judge's background, politics, and life experiences. Even the floor of the courthouse to which a case is assigned can mean the difference between prison and freedom.  Never before has the judging world been laid bare for all to see.   \"A thoughtful and provocative personal account and an excellent primer on the American judicial process.\"--Kirkus Reviews  \"This book literally held me hostage until the last page.\" --author Michael Connelly",
