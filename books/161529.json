  "title": "The darling star - poems",
  "description": "The book has poems written over a period of 6 years. The poems here are sweet and deep on diverse themes like nature (stars, flowers, butterflies, birds), lovely girls and any little pleasures the poet came across mostly during his evening walks or while travelling. Some poems are small philosophical pieces. Some are humorous about the dumbness of animals and birds. Some of them are about a dark girl whose darkness the poet admires and in front of which all the fair world looses its beauty. Some of the poems are on sudden surprises aroused by beautiful things. The poems have occurred to the poet in a brief moment and are written without much tampering with the original thoughts. The poet has also written a few rhyming fables for children which are included in the book. The drawings in the book are drawn by the author himself and have come from his imagination or are drawn from real life or photographs. Hope the readers will enjoy this collection.",
