  "description": "After nineteen-year-old Katie Murray witnesses the shocking coverup of a crime that could implicate Eric Clarke, the estranged son of her neighbors, she struggles with how much to divulge. The two families spend their summers in an upscale Cape Cod locale where adults prioritize appearances and, as the opioid crisis wreaks havoc, steer clear of the inhabitants of the blue-collar town next door. Driven by an overpowering urge to protect the downtrodden and infuriated by the complacency of the people around her, Katie makes decisions that could carry dangerous consequences for everyone involved.Insightful, heart-wrenching, and peppered with wry observations, SEAVIEW ROAD is a story of family and alienation, of apathy and loyalty, of parent-child communication and the agony of missed connections.",
