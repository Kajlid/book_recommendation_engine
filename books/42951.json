  "title": "The Undoing of a Libertine",
  "description": "A Libertine...  Jeremy Greymont certainly qualifies. ‘Sex rough and women loose’ is his credo—one he’s always taken very seriously, with no deference whatsoever to the society into which he’s been born. He’s been perfectly content milling along through life on an existence of courtesans and fine Scotch whisky...that is until his grandfather lets him know he’s out of time, and his station in life comes with duties attached. Jeremy must produce an heir—posthaste. Lucky for him, the lovely Georgina is the perfect answer to his predicament and intrigues him like no other woman before her.  Jeremy can’t wait to make her his lady, and begin working on creating that heir he needs so badly. He’s even willing to tone down his preference for the wild romps he’s always enjoyed in the bed chamber, just for her sake. There will be plenty of time to teach his innocent bride all about that after the wedding, right? No, not even close. Georgina’s demons trump Jeremy’s in so many ways. A brutal assault has left her wounded and vowing she can be wife to no man—not even Jeremy Greymont.  What is a libertine to do?  “Georgina...I am so entangled in thoughts of you I could not find my way out if ever I desired.” JEREMY GREYMONT  2nd edition ©Raine Miller Romance, March 2017 First publication [Siren Publishing] 2012",
