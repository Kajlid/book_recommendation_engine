  "title": "First Cry",
  "description": "Long ago, God set Watchmen on Jerusalem's walls to keep vigil and sound the battle cry when evil approached. These men and women would not sleep--for if they grew complacent, many innocents would fall. They do not age, time has no hold on them. Throughout the ages and into the present, there are those born who are destined to be Watchmen. Some would watch over countries, some over just one soul. Each one is equiped with gifts to use in the constant battle that remains unseen to human eyes. Raphael is one such Watchman. His gift? His battle cry? Song. Just as the demons fled at the sound of David's song to Saul, so the Dark Ones afflicting mankind flee with Raphael's battle song. One such song begins the redemptive song of Hadassah, a direct descendant of Queen Esther, who must also save her people...with the help of the Watchmen.Show More Show Less",
