  "description": "Charlie has isolated herself in an old farmhouse on the outskirts of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It’s not the frigid temperatures, nor her lack of a vehicle that keep her secluded. Charlie has a secret. Without warning, she disappears into her mind with little control over when she will return. After putting herself to sleep one evening, Charlie is ripped from her bed by an invisible force and attacked. This entity needs her in order to relive the most evil events of its past. If Charlie does not uncover the mystery of those events, and discover the connection between the old farmhouse, the entity, and her self, she risks disappearing into her mind forever. Filled with fever pitch intensity, Catherine Doesn’t Live Here Anymore is an utterly riveting novella. Mira Gibson weaves a spellbinding paranormal thriller with suspense at every dark turn.",
