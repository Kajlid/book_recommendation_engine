Some secrets are best left undiscovered, unspoken, buried deep in cold damp earth. Wounded and broken, Dimitri Cyr remains silent to hide a dark secret. His life, however, is thrown upside-down when he transfers to a new school and meets Beau, a popular football player with his own secrets to hide.Unwilling to take no for an answer, Beau proceeds to ingrain himself into Dimitri's life, blissfully oblivious to the consequences of his actions. His interference shatters Dimitri's defenses apart and Dimitri's secrets come pouring out, threatening Dimitri's very sanity in the process. Desperate to help Dimitri, Beau decides to risk his own heart thus bringing him face to face with the secrets he himself had been hiding beneath a very different mask. With secrets, denial, guilt, nightmares and lies to block the way, can the two overcome the darkness that binds them to find hope, friendship and perhaps love along the way.Status: CompleteWord count: approx. 133,567",
