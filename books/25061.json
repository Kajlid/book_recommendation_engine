  "description": "Nearly two hundred years have passed since the Dome, with forty thousand selected inhabitants, was sealed against the threat of an astroid about to collide with earth. The few survivors outside of Dome have surely devolved into distorted monsters by now. But talented art student Rhiane a'Dare has painted a picture so shocking it cannot be put on public display. And rumours abound that Rhiane has been 'outside'-- and is the cause of the deadly virus that is decimating the city of Dome.",
