Sexy and smart, Lena Jamerson has her whole life planned out for her. The daughter of two of Freedom s most prominent alums, it is a given that she will fulfill her Chi Theta Legacy as well as become engaged to NBA-bound Brandon Redding, or is it? With wealth, prestige and a beautiful body she could choose anything ... even someone new. Denise the reserved women's basketball champion has no time for dating. Her only choices are grades, game and becoming the first in her family to graduate, until a sexy stranger enters her life, causing her to reconsider her options. Playa of another flava, Cooley sparks curiosity of her own with women on both sides of the orientation fence. Will the choices of her past prevent the romance of her future? Meanwhile, Carmen's choices have given her a new exterior and a new lease on life. Can her sexy new shape get her into Chi Theta and a new romance? Or will the same internalized insecurities keep her from finding the love she deserves? In the school of life and love, what choices would you make?",
