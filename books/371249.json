  "description": "Major Rafe Eaglefeather loves a challenge—the riskier the better. A former rodeo champion, he's also served his country. So is it too much to ask for a little solitude to heal from the effects of his deployment? With pushy relatives like his, apparently it is. Despite his protests, they've arranged for naturopath Alexa Robinson to treat him.Since treatment involves staying at Alexa's remote Texas ranch, Rafe sort of gets his wish for peace. Surprisingly, spending time with Alexa helps him feel more like himself. Something about her is irresistible and the attraction between them is growing. It's so strong he's tempted to take the biggest risk of all…committing to her.",
