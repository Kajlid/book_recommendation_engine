  "description": "The madcap, macabre, and maddeningly funny Tales from the Five Kingdoms continue — with an oddly heart-warming adventure.It’s a fine day for dwarf watching! At least that’s what Gracie Gillypott and Prince Marcus innocently think as they set out, unaware that Princess Marigold has honed her sights on Marcus and plans to follow him to the ends of the earth — fan, frilly petticoats, and all. As for the dwarves, it’s not a fine day at all: they’re overworked and underpaid, rushing to produce extra gold to make crowns for a royal wedding. The Chief of Works has no choice but to send for some trolls to deal with the problem, but they have their own agenda: finding a princess for their lonely king. Throw in the faithful Gubble, a slinking goblin, four chatty bats, and a heart of glass that will give its owner absolute power and you have a hilarious new adventure rife with mistaken identities — and the ever-compelling search for the perfect match.",
