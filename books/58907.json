The authorized edition is more complete, better priced, and is produced with the author's permission.  This book on this page is being produced in violation of U.S. Copyrights on file, and the Berne Convention.  Thanks --W.M. Mott A Fable is the first volume of The Pulsifer Saga, by Wm. Michael Mott. Fantasy fiction has a new and outrageous hero...or anti-hero. He's not politically correct, overly heroic, or even overly endearing...but he is uproariously entertaining. Meet Calim Pulsifer-thief, rogue, womanizer, and confidence man-and, in spite of having earned the enmity of wizards, warriors, and women, always his own worst enemy. Extricating himself from one outrageous misadventure after another in his quest for vengeance and survival, the outcast Calim Pulsifer leaves a trail of mayhem and mirth across and beneath a frozen, monster-haunted world. Political correctness goes out the window as the ultimate trickster and adventurer takes the stage. Fantasy-fiction readers and role-playing fans alike will find these novels provide a thrilling, belly-laughing reading experience.",
