  "description": "Morgan Skully is the world’s only blonde demon girl and she’s got a brand new, very unusual after-school job. Spying for the Devil. She’d much rather spy on hottie-licious, Derek, with her friends, but the Devil won’t take no for an answer. Lucky for Morgan, her new boss is kinda hot. Her assignment is simple: find out who at Pitch Fork Prep is funneling secrets to the Siberian Werewolf Council. If she succeeds, pedicures and platinum highlights are just the beginning. But if she fails, she’ll be expelled before she can woo Derek into asking her to the Brimstone Ball!",
