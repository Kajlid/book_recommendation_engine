  "title": "The Slip Swing",
  "description": "I wrote my first book Bricked after teaching in a school for at-risk students. Pat Riordan, the protagonist in my mystery trilogy, was introduced in this novel. In the second book of the trilogy, The Slip Swing, Riordan, the teacher, has also taken on the role of an amateur shamus while having been named a person of interest in a missing woman case. Detective Sergeant Donald Cromwell says Riordan is also likely guilty in the disappearance of two other women. Fired from his teaching position, Riordan sets out to exonerate himself as Cromwell builds a case against him. Accompanied by a stray dog, Riordan prods onward through unexplained encounters. Pieces start to fall into place, but answers lead to more questions.The Slip Swing has a paranormal bent, driven by hard dialogue, reflecting my years working in the criminal justice system and my experiences as a teacher. My intent was to provide a fresh twist for the reader of mysteries and for the detective in all of us.",
