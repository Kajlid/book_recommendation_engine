Luckily for her, she's a witch about to come of age ~ so she's only a few spells away from making it all happen. On her milestone birthday, Brooklyn's conservative parents finally unbind her powers, and this newfound freedom leads to a spell-assisted dream makeover. Her crush, Asher, finally notices her, and so does the Queen Bee of the popular, cool clique. Even better, Brooklyn discovers her true the ability to magically match couples with a love spell.But Brooklyn's quest for popularity is not without its price, and as the clique escalates their initiation tests, the more she relies on her powers to complete the tasks. Can Brooklyn keep her magic hidden from their scrutiny? Like her Salem ancestors, if caught, she could be vilified. But worst of all, Brooklyn runs the risk of losing what she really cares about ~ Asher ~ unless she can work a little magic of her own.",
