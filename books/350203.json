  "description": "Determined to land a huge advertising account for his company, Nick gets a LITTLE carried away and tells the potential client he's married, then he has a serious problem--he can't join the client on the ship unless he shows up with the wife he's supposed to be taking on an anniversary cruise. Laney Parks is either in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the right place at the right time-She isn't sure which. She isn't even entirely certain of how she got roped into posing as her hunky boss's wife. She finds it SERIOUSLY unnerving, though, to 'stick to the script' when that includes cuddling up and kissing in public, and even more unnerving to share the close confines of the cabin-and its single bed-with him. Adult situations and language.",
