  "description": "Lilly Garner is the picture of Midwestern, apple pie America until a freak accident leaves her in a short-term coma. When she awakes, Lilly finds she has an unlikely and uncontrollable craving: an insatiable sexual hunger. Too humiliated to confess her carnal needs to those closest, Lilly finds solace and guidance in Trinity, a Gothic sex-superstore entrepreneur and budding, flesh film producer. However, when Lilly takes her sexual exploits too far, even Trinity’s strong shoulder and worldly advice can’t keep her from losing her family, best friend, and even her crumbling sanity. Will Lilly gain control of the raging fiend within, or will she succumb to the dark yearning that threatens to swallow her once perfectly normal life in one, final, greedy gulp?",
