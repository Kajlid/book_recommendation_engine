  "description": "A Norwegian Marcel Proust. This nerve-striking, addictive piece of hyper-realism, by the Norwegian Critics' Prize-winning author of A Time For Everything, has created a phenomenon throughout Scandinavia.Almost ten years have passed since Karl O. Knausgaard's father drank himself to death. He is now embarking on his third novel while haunted by self-doubt. Knausgaard breaks his own life story down to its elementary particles, often recreating memories in real time, blending recollections of pain and family moments with profound questions in a devastating way. Written as though his very life were at stake, Knausgaard probes into his past, dissecting struggles (immense and small) with great candor and vitality. He strikes nerves. Articulating universal dilemmas, this masterpiece opens a window into one of the most original minds writing today.",
