  "description": "Like any girl, I just wanna have some fun.I might be blonde, but I’m far from dumb.But Hell, men like 'em dumber than a box of rocks,So that's the game I play--Just to get 'em wrapped around my finger,And in my bed. Let's face it, sex is fun,And I’m all about having a good time… I've had my share of man-whores and douchebags,I'm not looking for anything more. And nobody can change my mind,Not even Dan Westbrook.With his sexy smile and irresistible body.I'm a man-eater,And right now, he's the only man I want a bite of.",
