  "description": "Fantasies come true on this sultry Georgia island.Emma Vance is the serious sister, happiest running her family's Wilde Dunes Resort from behind the scenes. She leaves the parties and the host duties to her sister, Sara. But when Sara takes off for unknown adventures, Emma is thrust into Sara's role--and finds herself face to face with a sinfully sexy guest. It isn't long before Emma begins considering mixing business with pleasure. Liam Anderson is rich, worldly, and gorgeous . . . but not at peace. At Solomon's Island, where his family once summered, he finds himself fantasizing about spending the week relaxing with Emma on the beach . . . and in his bed. Emma tells herself she's not his type, that this is just a fling, but the attraction between her and Liam is hotter than a Georgia summer. When trouble arrives and Liam appears to have come there with ulterior motives, she'll find out just how high the price may be when a fantasy is swept out with the tide.",
