In a small Chicago suburb, Amanda Summers is at the end of her rope and desperate. Tired of being her husband's punching bag and with no friends or family to help her, she embarks on a cross-country journey to start a new life. Their paths cross in the hot and dusty town of Crenshaw, Oklahoma, where the line between truth and fiction is often blurred. An escalation in events forces them to work together. Can they trust each other? Can he keep his promise to Lizzie? Can they survive the Arbuckles, the local redneck mafia? Break It is the story of two people on wholly different journeys, who have to step out of their comfort zones in order to answer the age old question- Do I believe in myself?",
