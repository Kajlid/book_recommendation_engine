The Russian leader, a war-weary colonel who knows no other life but conflict, carries old ghosts that refuse to let him be. But the battle that awaits him deep in this ancient land will change his life forever, and send him on a violent journey no sane man would contemplate. The ultimate soldier meets his destiny, in a tale from Garth Ennis, the creator of PREACHER.",
