  "description": "CHRISTMASTIME is Sandra Boynton's humorous and compassionate carol to the season of warmth and giving, celebration and tradition. And tradition, to Boynton, is anything that happens every Christmas without like trimming the tree, a fruitcake from the Rossiters, the crunch underfoot of your most precious ornament, and the customary search for scissors at four A.M. Christmas morning. With guest appearances by Santa and his reindeer, Boynton's familiar menagerie reveals the many joys and satisfactions that make Chrismastime such a universally special the thrill of finding the right gift for someone you love, and affording it; the personal gratification of wrapping all the gifts early; and the wonder of Christmas morning, when you realize you forgot to label them. And, in the spirit of giving, Boynton includes her own Christmas Santa's favorite chocolate chip cookies (with suggested note urging him to \"please stack dishes neatly in the sink and wrap uneaten cookies in tin foil\"); plum pudding (well worth someone else's time and money); and Wassail, which seems like a great treat if you happen to have 2,640 blanched almonds lying around the house. This hardcover book makes a perfect gift for the \"staunch traditionalist\" and the \"santaclaustrophobic\" alike. 94,000 copies in print.",
