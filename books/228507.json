  "description": "From New York Times & USA Today Bestselling Author Max Monroe comes a new, sexy, and exciting twist on a favorite fairytale.  I’m Matt Hadder. I’ve been called ruthless, savage—even brutal—by the men and women who work for me. And I’ve earned my reputation.  Wonderland Inc., a party planning organization for every major player in the world, is Oz, and I’m its Wizard. I can make anything—drugs, prostitutes, deals—appear for a night and disappear just as quickly.  This doesn’t make me good or bad—it makes me essential.  Wonderland Inc. was my life, until a beautiful contradiction of innocence and impurity, obedience and rebelliousness named Alex Little stepped in and turned both of our worlds upside down.  Welcome to Wonderland, Alex. A place where everything appears normal. \nBut we’re all mad.",
