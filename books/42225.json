  "description": "Ashford Blackburne, Fifth Earl of Blackburne, does not care where he marries and plants his seed, so long as he does both before Christmas when his tyrannical grandfather’s archaic ultimatum runs out. Jilted, drunk, and challenged to a high-stakes poker game, Ash loses the game, but wins the consolation prize: a guttersnipe bride and a wedding at gunpoint. For her part, Larkin McAdams has loved Ashford Blackburne since she was a child. She’ll make him a good wife. She does not need much—a cot, a warm blanket ... a monthly bath.",
