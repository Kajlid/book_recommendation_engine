  "description": "Second book in the best selling Abduct Series. Please read Messy and Shattered (Abduct #1) first.  Sometimes in life you are put in a position that causes you to make a difficult decision.  Sometimes, the decisions you make effect other people.  Yesterday I was saved from a fate worse than death, I was saved from being sold to the highest bidder.  I should be grateful, glad to be alive. I should be.  The man beside me, driving the car we just stole, he is the reason I was nearly sold, the reason my fifteen year old sister was killed, after all he slit her delicate throat.  Could you let go, pretend it never happened? Trust a murderer? Or like me, would you need vengeance - justice?  As Heinrich Heine once said \"We should forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged‚Äù  I thought about forgiving him, but I want revenge, I want what's mine.",
