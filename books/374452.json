  "description": "Winner of the 2009 Steel Toe Books Prize in Poetry (Editor's Choice), written by the author of Buddha's Dogs, which was selected by Ed Hirsch as the winner of the Four Way Books Intro Prize \"The poems in Susan Browne's Zephyr are grounded in the mysteries of this terribly known, outrageously funny and sad world. With an expert sense of language and narrative, this intrepid poet cranks her highbeams to rummage 'humanity's basement, the murk inside the mammalian heart' and unearths each dark, radiant truth.\" -- Dorianne Laux",
