  "description": "When Zach fell in love with Josef, it didn't take long for him to know he was in over his head. Knowing almost nothing about dominance and submission, he and Josef made some big mistakes. Too big, Zach thought, to be overcome, despite still loving and lusting for his would-be Master. Though he ran across country to New York, Josef finds him and makes him both an offer and an order: \"Come home and learn, with me, how to get it right this time.\"Zach's not sure if he can offer that much trust again. He knows for sure that when it comes to his passionate desire for Josef, he definitely can't trust himself to do anything but relent, common sense be damned. More, he knows now that he'll never stop loving Josef. Is it possible that taking the risk of a second chance will give them both what they want most?Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, BDSM theme and content featuring significant D/s elements, male/male sexual practices.
