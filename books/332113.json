  "description": "I have millions of followers on social media, and it has absolutely nothing to do with my last name. It’s because I’m good at what I do. I work hard, and it has paid off. I’m not a trainer who only talks the talk, either. I walk the walk—or rather, I run the run. It was actually during one of those jogs through the park that I ran into him.Of course, at the time, I didn’t realize it was the Isaiah “Ike” Harrison, Seattle’s hot new quarterback. All I knew was that I was suddenly pinned under some solid, sexy body, unable to breathe.But even now, I keep running into Ike in the most unexpected places.And he’s doing everything in his power to convince me that he’s not just a player—in any form of the word. It’s so much more than that.But I’ve been there, done that. I have the mended broken heart to prove it and have no intention of doing it again.Except the frustrating man is convincing, and my walls are quickly lowering—especially when I feel responsible for possibly upending his career.Is letting him in a mistake? Or will it be the best thing I’ve ever done?",
