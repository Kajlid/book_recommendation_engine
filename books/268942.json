  "description": "Can love survive amidst lies, schemes and subterfuge? Zac, a man accustomed to getting what he wants, seeks retribution on behalf of the only father figure he's known, even though no one asked him to.\"I still can't believe how an ethereal being like Diane can be a plotting bitch. Why the old man held her in such a high regard, is beyond me. She is ungrateful and someone needs to teach her a thing or two. And I have the only right to do so.\" Evidence and reports condemn the woman he purposefully set to 'teach a lesson', but the truth has a way of creeping out of the most unlikely corners. \"She looked at me in the eyes and told me, but I didn't believe her... She lay there with trust in her eyes and let me do that to her and more.\"One mistake after the other and one fight too many bring them closer to the end. All it takes is three little words to take down his whole house of cards. Now Zac has to trust the only woman who had the tenacity to see beyond his scowls and cold behaviour and not because she was innocent all along. â€œHer name is Diane. The woman who has made my heart beating.\"Warning: This book contains themes intended for mature audiences only.
