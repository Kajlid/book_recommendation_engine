For with those fantastic sheets of etheric material, ships could sail the sky and even brave the radiant tides between worlds and stars.The alchemists who had replaced the scientists still sought the ancient secrets... and Rachad, apprentice to such a would-be wizard, learned that the key to his quest lay in a book abandoned in a Martian colonial ruin long, long ago.But how to get to Mars ? There was one way left - take a sea vessel, caulk it airtight, steal new sails, and fly the star winds in the way of the ancient windjammers.Here is an intriguing, unusual and colorful novel of ships that sail the stars riding before the solar breeze that blows between the worlds.",
