  "description": "One desperate need. One eager stranger. One night of shameless passion. The only rule? No one goes home unsatisfied. Welcome to Last Call, the premiere bar for supernatural creatures and sexual indulgence. * * * Werewolf in heat, looking for a temporary mate * * * With her mating cycle upon her, inexperienced werewolf Zoe Bennett has two options—suffer at home in silence and risk madness, or find a wolf who can sate her every debauched desire. Desperate, she braves the supernatural crowds at Last Call, the bar where your drink order tells everyone what you need. The chase is on, and security specialist Connor O'Malley intends to win. The sweet young woman at the bar looks unprepared for what the night will bring, but teaching her will be no hardship. It’s not until she’s beneath him that Connor realizes the real danger—one taste of her submission, and he won’t be satisfied being just a temporary mate. * * * Each Last Call story is a stand alone story about one couple and one night. They contain adult content and fully realized sex scenes. * * *",
