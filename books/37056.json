  "description": "All of us make choices every second . . . 86,400 times a day. CHOICES 86,400 a day is a provocative and novel exploration of engagement in a particular moment in time. CHOICES challenges the reader to do something counterintuitive and revolutionary in today’s outcome-oriented Intend the choices you make. Operating on autopilot, our choices are made by default. The choices we make mimic the breaths we take—voluntary deep breaths and involuntary shallow ones. We make choices every second of the day. Intent puts things in perspective and keeps the present in plain view. Intent enhances all that we experience. CHOICES 86,400 a day is the residue of a journey that emanated from an age-old Think about what you are doing. A passionate pursuit of a vigorous, intentional way of being was the driving force in the writing of CHOICES. Most of my life, my focus was fixed on the endgame, never the process. Going through the motions, I used the present to prepare for the future until I figured out that my achievement-eating ego was running the show. All I was really doing was accruing regrets for all the opportunities that had expired. CHOICES 86,400 a day exposes the underbelly of ordinary circumstances, retrieves discoveries we discard and uncovers an ever-present intended choices. In this increasingly accelerated era of multitasking, CHOICES is chock-full of observations relevant to each and every individual in the throes of one endeavor after another.",
