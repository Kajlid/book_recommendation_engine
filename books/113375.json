  "description": "Chaos never felt this good!Warning: Adult only! This novel is Dark, Twisted, and really Sexy! Absolutely not for the weak at heart.Blurb: Rain’s been washing blood off her hands for far too long. After five years, she accepts the fact that she’s still a little crazy but feels as if she’s finally gotten it all under control. Parties, drugs, and sex flood Jude’s life, and music and scandal run through his veins. He’s the son of a rock god and grandson of a jazz legend. It's no surprise that his own star is on the rise, and with so many groupies vying for his attention, his childhood best friend Rain keeps him anchored in reality.She’s nothing like him—an art student with no idea of her own beauty, who would rather curl up with a sci-fi novel than party in the spotlight. Everything changes when she asks him for a unique favor: she wants him to take her virginity. He’s more than willing to oblige, but things get complicated when his pervy father gets involved. Meanwhile, intense feelings rise to the surface, ones neither Rain or Jude are prepared to deal with. If their relationship has any chance for survival, she must finally confront the demons of her past, and he must face the addictions of the present. When the smoke clears, will they find that sex between best friends was a good idea, or will they discover they had been Flirting With Chaos the entire time?",
