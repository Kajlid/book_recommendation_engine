  "description": "It was 1941 and their passion was forbidden. Yet what they felt was greater than who they were, a love that stood taller than the divide of race or class. And together they would risk everything to preserve what they'd found in each other.She is Vivian Scott, with little else in the world besides the love and support of her brother, Elias. After he enlists in the Navy, Vivian resolves herself to the role of nurturer, making a home for them along the sandy white shores of Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Eli's happiness is enough to sustain her. That is, until she meets Michael Daniels. Their spark of friendship becomes trust and admiration that quickly blossoms into more. But how can that be? He's white, and she's not. Michael and Vivian struggle to resist the growing attraction they share, but at what price comes love? On the Wings of Love is the heart of a tale, as yet absent a beginning or an end. It is a weathered moment between two destined lovers, entwined by chance and sealed tight by fate. You, the reader, are invited to imagine the conclusion, and help complete this tale of love that comes only once in a lifetime.",
