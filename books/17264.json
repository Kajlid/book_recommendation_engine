The two men who reduced her heart to cinders. Men she’d hoped never to see again. One wild weekend with Phoebe overwhelmed Will Bradley and Damon Hunt. Like wankers, they blew it off, burning any chance for a future with the talented beauty. The investigation gets them back in her life, but now they have to prove the three of them were meant to be together. Their strategy? A body-blazing inferno none of them will ever be able to extinguish",
