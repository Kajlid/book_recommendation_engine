But the soothsayer, Tia Dalma has other plans for the Lords and cannot allow them to be destroyed. So she calls on the one man who can turn the tide--Captain Jack Sparrow...In Book One of Legends of the Brethren Court, the mystic Tia Dalma sends Jack Sparrow on a mission to recover nine pieces of shadow gold. If he fails, she warns, the seas will become the playground of shadows and those who survive their reign of terror will wish they had not.
