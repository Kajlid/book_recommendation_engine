Blue America teeters on the edge of chaos and collapse, but that’s not ex-operator Kelly Turnbull’s problem anymore – until he is called out of retirement for a crucial job in Siberia that turns out to be a deadly trap.

Working alongside his sworn enemy, he has to put his trust where he always has – in his instincts and his .45 automatic as his bloody campaign of revenge takes him from Mexico City to Germany to the bowels of the urban jungle of the abandoned Pentagon where, MAC-10 in hand, Kelly Turnbull faces his deadliest enemy.",
