  "description": "Irreverent and compulsively readable, 101 Places Not to See Before You Die highlights destinations we can all live without - like Jupiter's Worst Moon, an Outdoor Wedding During the 2021 Reemergence of the Great Eastern Cicada Brood, and fan hours at the Las Vegas Porn Convention - while reminding us why we're willing to put up with the bed bugs and the food poisoning and set out to explore the world.",
