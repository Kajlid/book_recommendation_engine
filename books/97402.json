The Earth is ready for habitation but it is a far different Earth from the one last seen so long ago. Alongside the original wildlife and generations of their offspring, new plants and forms of wildlife from different worlds populate the planet as chosen by the Womb. The survivors discover they have not aged a day since the bombs dropped, but any new relationship that is forged stagnates when the chance to bear children is denied them. Every human now realizes their sole purpose is to support the animals and must fight to eke out a role in the new ecosystem that has put them at the bottom of the food chain. As a new civilization develops above ground, the new natural order thrusts women into positions of power. Will the softer of the species spell success for what is left of the human race?
