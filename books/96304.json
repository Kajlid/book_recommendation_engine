  "description": "No one is safe! The school has become a war-zone and the innocent are turning fast! A brave and nameless teacher has collected some awful and disturbing documents from the some ghastly students. These are their stories and they will shock and amaze both teacher and student. But they haven't been given away for free. This terrified individual has paid a hefty price to get the truth and is paying for it, with his freedom. In his report he states, 'If you are considering a career in teaching I would advise against it completely. It has become a profession far more dangerous than a police officer or even an army soldier in open war.' 'I'm risking my life giving you this information, but I feel you need to know the truth. On the surface these children appear innocent and well-mannered but it is inside where their darkness dwells.' The Students sold us secrets volume 1 is the first collection of short stories from the writer that brought you Reverse the Universe, Lee J Mavin and will take you down a path you never thought existed. It's packed with twelve short stories, all equally alarming and unsettling, as well as a secret report written by an undercover teacher. Look Inside to find out the truth!",
