  "description": "Following the discovery of \"wet tunnels\" linking the majority of the world's oil wells together, combined with the now vividly apparent oil shortage, panic among the global populous ensues. Violent riots become commonplace as the critical infrastructure, previously dependent on the black gold, grinds suddenly to a halt. The citizens of the United States cry out for government intervention and a national savior. The response: Martial Law. Realizing they are losing control, the U.S. government calls its troops home and isolationism becomes the new norm.Out of the torrent of chaos and oppression an underground movement forms: the Pilgrims. Founded with the sole purpose of recapturing their once held rights to freedom, the plan from which to obtain their dream is nearly complete. Operating from the shadows, the pilgrims must tread carefully if they are to succeed.The story itself follows a young man named Devin, who falls unwillingly into the Pilgrim movement and finds himself an enemy of the state. With his survival at stake, the teen, joined by a group of refugees, struggles to escape the government controlled city and on to the Pilgrim capital of freedom: Lake Haven.",
