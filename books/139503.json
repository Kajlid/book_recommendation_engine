Doctors Without Borders (also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF) is arguably the best known humanitarian organization in the world.

This book follows these men and women on location as they risk their own health, well-being and lives to treat patients in desperate need. These engaging true stories with dramatic color photographs examine the lives of individual volunteer medical professionals from around the world This new paperback edition is updated to include events that occurred following publication of the hardcover. Hope in Hell chronicles the raucous founding of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the organization. If there is a horrific event, MSF will be there. This book tells why and how.",
