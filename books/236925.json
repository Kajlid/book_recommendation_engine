  "title": "The I Hate Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage... Reader: The Hideous Truth About America's Ugliest Conservatives",
  "description": "Our smartest and funniest progressive writers, cartoonists and satirists have increasingly turned their attention to the right-wing zealots who clutter up our media—television, radio, books, magazines—with hysterical, bullying, personal attacks on liberals, democrats, minorities, workers, women, gays, anti-war activists and ordinary citizens who dare to object to the right’s radical agenda for our country. This reader exposes the lies and distortions of these morons and bullies—who routinely rely on made-up statistics and scare tactics to push their policies and so-called values, revealing these liars for what they are—intellectually shallow and emotionally crippled demagogues who are more interested in their personal power than in America’s future. Featuring a wonderful compilation of attacks by Michael Moore, Molly Ivins and Jim Hightower; profiles of Ann Coulter and Peggy Noonan; transcripts from debates and interviews that humiliate Savage and O’Reilly; quizzes by Paul Slansky; commentary by stand-up comedians; satire from The Onion and other websites; works by Greg Palast and Chris Floyd; and much, much more. The I Hate Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity Reader is a piece of sweet revenge for the harm these mean-spirited demagogues are doing to our country and our world.",
