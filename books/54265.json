  "description": "\"In the midst of the tall wild grass, almost lost in a tangle of weeds and deep-green vines, was a little stone house. It looked sadly neglected and tumbledown: some of the windows were boarded, some were partly broken out, and the weathered door hung crookedly from a single hinge. Still, it was the closest thing to a picture-book cottage that the three children had ever seen. For a second they stood there breathless. In their hearts, they all knew it. 'This ..., ' Ashley whispered half aloud. 'This is where we're going to live!'\"--Back of dust-jacket.",
