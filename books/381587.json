  "description": "2010 Reprint of 1929 Edition. The inspiration of Ernest Holmes has reached hundreds of thousands of readers through his classic works, many of which are just now becoming available in paperback. Originally published in 1929, this exegesis on the hidden lessons of some of Scripture's best-known verses has been largely unavailable since the 1940s. Holmes interprets sections from the Bible from the Story of Creation, the Teachings of Moses, the Teachings of Jesus and from the Epistles of the Apostles. The founder of the worldwide Science of Mind movement, Ernest Holmes (1887-1960) was a uniquely gifted scholar with a vast command of the world's spiritual philosophies. The author of the landmark classic The Science of Mind, Holmes wrote many popular and inspirational books, including This Thing Called You, The Art of Life, Creative Mind and Success, and 365 Science of Mind.",
