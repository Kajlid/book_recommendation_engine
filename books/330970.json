  "description": "My life has been full of half-truths tangled in lies—I’d been to hell and back more times than I could count. But nothing could have prepared me for the fear in her voice, and then the sight of that building going up in flames. After the way I treated her, the way I hurt her, I’d earned that pain back tenfold. I deserved to lose the only bit of light in my dark, twisted life. Neither of us have survived the suffering only to have it end this way and I refuse to believe that our time is done. It can’t be. Because she was made for me—the only good thing that came out of my past. And the first chance I get, I’m going to make sure she knows exactly what she means to me. No more lies. No more pretending. Just the raw, honest truth. I can’t live without her and I’ll spend the rest of my life proving to her that she belongs with me. That the life we were born into might have left us damaged, but it made us stronger. And when she claims her rightful place amongst us, I’ll be by her side and together we will rule this reckless dynasty. But first we have to survive… Dear Reader, Reckless Dynasty is the third, and final book in the Reckless trilogy in my Knight's Ridge Empire series.",
