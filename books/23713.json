  "description": "Annebelle Roth was afraid she'd get stuck in the small town she grew up in. She was afraid her high school boyfriend Riley would break her heart, and afraid a lifetime of regrets would follow them if they never left. Her solution? Break Riley’s heart first, before they leave for college on opposite coasts. Now, years later, the two find themselves back where it all began, and Annebelle quickly realizes their time apart hasn't stopped the butterflies from fluttering at the sight of him. But is it too late for them? The girl who wanted Riley in high school is still vying for his attention—and it appears she's finally getting it. Meanwhile, Annebelle’s own experiences have left her scarred, and she continues to hold tight to the belief that small town life isn’t for her. Will Annebelle stick to her plan and leave once more without so much as a backwards glance? Or will Riverdale’s residents—and the charm she once resisted—convince her otherwise?",
