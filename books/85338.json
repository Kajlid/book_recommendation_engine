Chandler was a beautiful woman who was sensible, staid and in control--that was before she met hypnotically stunning and incredibly magnetic Lucien.

There were also her incredible wet dreams about making love with someone she knew but she couldn't see... things were happening to Chandler that she couldn't explain. In Lucien's arms, she was becoming someone she didn't know.Or someone she couldn't remember? It was as if he was waking her up from the slumber of a powerful curse.
