  "description": "Frighteningly Good, August 6, 2010 J Knox, MFA, Creative Writing Professor , San Antonio, TX, Editor American Chronicle \"The Raven Affair is a fast-moving book that pulls you in from page one. The sense of urgency that Nedelton creates from the get-go grows exponentially as the tale progresses. Raven is a hired hand, on the trail of a war criminal, but he soon finds his assignment isn't what it seems. This book is dynamic and frighteningly believable, full of complex plot twists and sinister intellectual questions that, remarkably, kept this reader hooked. The Raven Affair is destined to be adapted for the big screen. I found myself envisioning the scenes as I went along--quickly--unable to put the damn thing down.\" The US Review of Books PO Box 11, Titusville, NJ 08560 www.theUSreview.com The Raven Affair by Steven Nedelton Asylett Press, Inc.
