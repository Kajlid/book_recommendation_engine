As the city of Elenia's finest sorcerer (or so he would say) no one paid him any mind, until he trips over the body of an Arbiter - the legendary warriors who aren't supposed to leave corpses behind when they die. It gets even worse when he comes face-to-face with a real, live Arbiter who blames him for the death.
