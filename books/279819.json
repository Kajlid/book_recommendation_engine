  "description": "Can silence be heard? Understood? Does it have different tones?Does it have a colour, with different shades?A difference in perception can reveal the answers to all these questions that seek to give a concrete form and tangibility to silence. When the horizons of understanding are widened with the thirst for deeper and profound knowledge,silence does have a voice and a colour too. It is a vibrant symphony in itself. Keener eyes and sharper ears,in quest of deeper perspectives, can see and hear all the tones of this otherwise invisible and inaudible silence.",
