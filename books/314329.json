But when an old friend begs her to show her beloved Golden Retriever at the upcoming West Coast Canine Classic, Ruby reluctantly straps on her heels and gets to work.If only she knew exactly what the adorably lazy lump of a dog was getting her into.If there's one thing veterinarian Spencer Wilson knows in this world, it's dogs. Human beings are an entirely different animal—especially stubborn, gorgeous women clearly in way over their heads. As judge for the local dog show, Spencer advises Ruby to quit while she still can, but her old fervor for winning has returned—and she's determined to show the stern, broody-eyed judge that she's more than just a pretty face.",
