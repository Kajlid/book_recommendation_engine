WARD BOOK #1 IN THE BESTSELLING DEMON KISSED SERIES \"I have not been this enraptured by a novel since I read Karen Marie Moning's Fever Series. It's that good.\" - Kris Seventeenth birthdays aren't supposed to suck, but mine does. Literally. Before I know what's happened a guy knocks me to the ground and tries to suck out my soul. With a kiss. That's all it takes with his kind. This next part is embarrassing--I thought this guy was my boyfriend. Screw that, I thought he was human, but those creepy, blood red eyes suggest I was mistaken. This is it, the end of my sucktacularly short life--killed by a creature that's half vampire, half demon, and smokin' hot. Killed by a kiss. It sounds poetic until it happens to you. The world fades to black, but just as I accept my fate, someone saves me. At least I think he saved me, because I'm still alive. It isn't until much later that I learn what really happened and exactly what it cost me. 496 Pages, 3rd Edition. Young Adult Paranormal Romance. DEMON KISSED SERIES  #1. Demon Kissed #2. Cursed #3.
