  "description": "Inspired by the #1 New York Times Bestselling Trilogy, the official FIFTY SHADES OF GREY: Inner Goddess Journal is a beautiful blank book designed for keeping a journal or writing notes. It features a foreword by E L James, brief excerpts from the novels, tips for writers, a writing playlist, elegant color artwork, and fully lined pages throughout. Aspiring writers are encouraged to express their own Inner Goddess, as E L James writes in her foreword: \"The best person to write for is yourself--and what better place to start than in a journal.\" Produced with eye-catching design and details, the journal has a bonded leather cover with foil stamping, rounded corners, endpapers, and a red-ribbon marker. Perfect for gift-giving and portability.",
