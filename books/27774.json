  "description": "A young girl befriends an older woman, Frankie Bristol, in her neighborhood. They hit it off when the girl realizes Frankie is a fashion icon, at least at the hat shop where she works and in the young girlâ€™s mind. The girl sells greeting cards door-to-door to earn some extra spending money, so she figures Frankie launched her sales career by being her first customer. When Frankie takes ill and can no longer sell hats at the shop, the young girl meets some hard truths about living and hatboxes.",
