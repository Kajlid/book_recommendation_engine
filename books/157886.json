  "description": "The beauty of California’s Gold Rush country and a tragic personal loss are what led Richard to leave L.A. and buy the old Moodry estate in North San Juan. But the estate is unquestionably a haunted, unearthly place. Hidden deep in the woods, the decaying mansion and its Victorian entities are driving the last trace of order out of Richard’s world. He turns to his real estate agent for help and soon begins to depend on her to restore his strength and reason. She restores order to his world, and common sense, and love. Yet the old ruin continues to draw his attention. Out in the woods is a profound metaphysical puzzle that he is determined to solve. But the puzzle only grows more complex. In a tiny spot in the Sierras, amid the beauty of summer, amid the bright days and the ponderosa pines, Richard is creating an enormous spiritual dilemma for himself, for his friends, and for those in the world beyond.",
