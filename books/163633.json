When Luc \"Lucifer\" Bontrager wakes up to Lilith - the satanic, sociopath bitch he left for dead in the desert - holding a gun to his head, his first thought is the girl he's got stashed in the club's basement. That's how he knows he's fucked.  He's lived his life kidnapping women and training them for Lucifer's Legion Motorcycle Club to sell as sex slaves. Now, he's caught up in the innocent young girl he's supposed to hand over to a Mexican cartel boss in a few days. There's no way in hell he's letting her go.  But Luc can't save her if he's dead, so this time Lilith won't get away from him alive.  NOMAD is the second installment in the Lucifer's Legion Motorcycle Club series and continues Luc's story from Lilith.  ***Explicit sexual content and violence. 18+***",
