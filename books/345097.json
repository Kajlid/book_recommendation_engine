  "description": "DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR?Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy is a hilarious collection of over 275 lines people think they've heard in pop songs from the 1960s to the 1990s. Now you can come out of that closet and proudly sing whatever you think you hear. Don't deny it! You know you've sung totally absurd lyrics in place of the real-and usually less interesting-ones. (It's nothing to ashamed of-most rock stars never took elocution classes.) Breeze through some of the world's most widely misinterpreted lyrics, including:\"The ants are my friends/They're blowin' in the wind\" (\"The answer my friend/Is blowing' in the wind\"-Bob Dylan)\"Sweet dreams are made of cheese\" (\"Sweet dreams are made of this\"-Eurythmics)\"The girl with colitis goes by\" (\"The girl with kaleidoscope eyes\"-The Beatles)Whether it's Eddie Vedder singing about \"forty-five versions of a pelican\" or Bruce Springsteen proclaiming \"everybody's got a hungry horse,\" 'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy is sure to make you want to get your hearing checked.",
