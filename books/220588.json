A body found on the grave of a man who had been the town's minister during the Civil War. As retired English professor Susan Warner tracks down the motive, she discovers a secret that uncovers the sins of the past and that connects the victim and the murderer.In Tour de Trace, the tenacious Susan confronted the fraught history of Mississippi's Natchez Trace. In Death of the Keynote Speaker, set on New Hampshire's Star Island, she unraveled how Celia Thaxter's nineteenth-century literary salon and a brutal murder on Smuttynose Island led to a twenty-first century murder. In Cemetery Wine, Susan once again finds herself a reluctant sleuth as she tries to solve a murder in a town she calls home.",
