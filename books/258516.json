  "title": "Fifty Shades of Greg",
  "description": "Probably the most candid, brutally honest, and often hilarious insight ever published into sex, dating, love, and heartbreak from a man's perspective. Fifty Shades of Greg is a sometimes graphic first-person recounting of modern-day dating experiences during the author's seven year stay in Italy. No fairy tales, just the brutally straight truth from a real guy. One that could sometimes be described as a hopeless romantic, and other times a flaming a**hole. (There I said it.) First date family planners? Stalkers? Romance novel reenactors? Obsessives? Sex freaks? Runaway brides? We've got you covered! Often scarcely credible, and hilarious, we navigate the insanity of one man's \"love\" (sex?) life… and the slow torture of his twisted soul. So join Greg as he exposes himself (not like that), through his thoughts and experiences. It often isn't pretty, he'll probably be murdered by feminists, but it sure makes for a good read! \"No, seriously, you'll be hooked.\" \"Made me smile all the way through! From a feminist point of view (like a non-man-hating-feminist… the true kind). I thought it was both hilarious and deep.\" \"I've never read anything that made me make so many shocked faces! People on the train would ask me what I was reading.\" \"I couldn't stop reading. Made me miss my bus stop a bunch of times!\" \"This is brilliant!!!! Absolutely fantastic … saying so much truth and so much that people shy away from.\" \"Goes from hilariously crass to surprisingly beautiful.\" -Feedback from actual women!",
