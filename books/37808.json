  "description": "\"Touchingly sincere...Trent and Laura are both rendered as wounded, lovable people, and readers will cheer for each stumbling, shy step toward the couple's reunion. Scott's prose is witty and sharp, and her delightful cast of characters keeps this delectable page-turner vibrant throughout.\"\n--Publishers Weekly (starred review)Dying has a way of changing a man. Ever since the day Army captain Trent Davila lost his life, he’s been fighting the demons that haunt him from that terrible day. Time and again, he’s left his wife and their two children behind as he’s volunteered to put himself in harm’s way until his wife had enough. Laura gave her husband everything, believing that if she was strong enough, patient enough, that he would eventually come home to her. She believed in him until she learns he betrayed her by volunteering for multiple deployments instead of spending much needed time with her and their two small children. Sent home facing a court martial on trumped up charges, Trent needs her to stand by him one last time. Being close to him reignites the spark in their troubled marriage that had almost been extinguished. As the fight for his career and reputation threatens to destroy them both, their marriage will be tested like never before.
