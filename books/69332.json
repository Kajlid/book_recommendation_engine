Until she was offered a position that would take her from her small office in San Antonio, Texas to that of her company’s larger, more upscale headquarters in Dallas, Texas, Sam hadn't seen anything. Her new boss is not only intensely sexy, he is also about to show her things she's only read in books.Logan McCoy’s life was steady going until he set his sights on his new Vice President of Project Operations. The woman makes his blood boil and makes him want things he didn't realize he was in search of. Logan only hopes Samantha is capable of handling his dominating, controlling ways… especially between the sheets... or in the shower.When Logan and Sam get together, sparks fly and they bring out each other’s deepest, darkest desires. He will push Sam past her sexual boundaries, and she will bring out his need to possess her in every way. But, can they find love within the inferno that burns between them?
