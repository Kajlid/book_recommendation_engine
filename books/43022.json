  "description": "A collection of pieces in five sections: I. Epistles: epistles written by Eve, Cain's wife, Noah's wife, Delilah, the Queen of Sheba, Mary, and others - as if they were feminist II. Myths: the myths within the myths revealed - what might Pandora, Circe, Penelope, Eurydice, Persephone, the Gorgons, and others have thought and done if they had not been the creations of a chauvinist patriarchy? III. Letters: letters that might have been written by Lady Godiva, Milton's daughter, Rubens' model, Mozart's mother, Freud's wife, Plato's students, and others - assuming a feminist consciousness IV. Soliloquies: soliloquies delivered by Juliet, Ophelia, Lady MacBeth, Kate, Desdemona, Regan, Miranda, and others - protesting the role given to them by Shakespeare V. Fairy Tales: the classic fairy tales retold - what would have happened if Gretel, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and others had been strong and critical girls and women living today?",
