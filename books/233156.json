  "description": "In this character driven novel of first contact by debut author Sue Burke, human survival hinges on a bizarre alliance.\nOnly mutual communication can forge an alliance with the planet's sentient species and prove that mammals are more than tools.Forced to land on a planet they aren't prepared for, human colonists rely on their limited resources to survive. The planet provides a lush but inexplicable landscapeâ€”trees offer edible, addictive fruit one day and poison the next, while the ruins of an alien race are found entwined in the roots of a strange plant. Conflicts between generations arise as they struggle to understand one another and grapple with an unknowable alien intellect.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
