  "description": "I’ll do anything to keep my family safe, including marrying a vicious mobster I’ve never met.When my stepdad’s questionable career choices put my family in danger, he arranges for me to marry a mob boss’s son in exchange for protection. Gossip about my groom says he’s as icy and reserved as he is vicious and loyal. But marrying Siro Dirosa is not as bloodcurdling as the alternative.At work one evening in the ER, I stitch up the arm of a six-foot-eight, heavily tattooed Roman god. The man is using an alias... and he purposely injured himself to create a cover to talk with me in private—to cut a deal with me.If I help boost his image by publicly faking marital bliss, he’ll reward me with money and autonomy. But the Underboss makes his devotion to the mafia’s traditions and rules clear. He’s not interested in faking his private husbandly duties. I happily agree to his terms. But when a deep secret of Siro’s rears its ugly head, the rules of our game are flipped upside down, and the line between forged and authentic starts to blur.Vicious Secrets is a standalone mafia romance with no cheating or other man/woman drama. It contains multiple open-door spicy scenes and discussion of subject matter that some may find disturbing. The Arranged Devotion series is interconnected but can be read in any order.",
