  "description": "England 1840The bleak, wild, windswept coast of North Norfolk has, through the fabric of time, held many a secret, but none perhaps so strange as the one discovered by the young, tender-hearted vicar of Blakeney, Thomas Goodchild.Through tragedy and despair he is unwittingly drawn into the nefarious dealings of the local smuggling community. But what are they smuggling? What are the heart-wrenching sounds he hears emanating through the cellar walls of his house?Over a hundred and forty years later, a London-based journalist comes across an old journal among her deceased grandmother’s belongings. On reading the contents, she is both shocked and intrigued. She re-traces the steps of the journal back to Blakeney, where she finds to her astonishment that the events from the past could have far-reaching implications for her own identity – and for her safety.Sometimes, she begins to realize, myth is based upon truth.",
