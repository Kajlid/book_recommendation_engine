  "description": "When a young woman is robbed at gunpoint, she finds out chivalry isn’t dead, even if her hero is. Magically embalmed and drop dead gorgeous, there are no flies on this guy. But Sean has more than a little trouble adjusting to the lifestyle of the undead, and Payson never suspects by helping him, she’ll become an accidental celebrity to an entire neurotic, undead community. She's soon faced with a fate worth than death, and Sean may lose the only girl who makes him feel alive again.Praise for the \"a snappy hole-in-one romantic comedy debut\" - Publishers Weekly, for Mulligan Girl (December 2009)",
