  "description": "I did not order the extra slice of Armageddon to go with my midlife crisis. Apparently , if you’re an Immortal, it comes free of charge. I have until sundown tomorrow to get to a parallel plane of existence, save my family, and kick bad-guy butt all before the world ends. Impossible, right? Not according to my posse of whackado buddies. They like to remind me that nothing is impossible as long as I believe. Well, I’m about to be the mother of all believers. Armed with nothing but a folder titled ‘Sh*t Pile’ and backed by a few fabulous drag queens, a toothpick-chewing nutjob, a sweetheart with a penchant for sharing disgusting facts, and an ice queen who doesn’t play nice with others, we have our work cut out for us. Time is not on my side, and I am having one hell of a midlife crisis.",
