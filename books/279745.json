Then she spies an ad for an all-rounder at a remote place called Sanctuary, whatever that is.Somehow Jules is the only applicant and it appears all her prayers have been answered. She now has food, board, a job and a whole lot more. It appears Sanctuary is the home of a huge pool of ridiculously good looking men who are 1. All vying for her attention and 2, expect her to choose to have relationships with multiples of them.Just as Jules thinks she’s Alice and she’s fallen down the hole into Dickland, she starts to look past the guys who read romance novels to better understand women and the HR manuals written by kink practitioners and starts to wonder. What is behind the huge fence at the centre of Sanctuary? Why is everyone waiting for the full moon? What secrets are the staff hiding? Join Jules as she finds her answers to these questions and those she never thought to ask.",
