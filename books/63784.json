  "description": "Glenn Beck tells the untold stories behind America’s heroes—and by heroes, he doesn’t mean guys in tights and capes. He means the Americans who made this country great. Americans who sacrificed family fortune, showed courage in the face of fear, and never backed down. These are the stories that are not taught in school—but probably should be.",
