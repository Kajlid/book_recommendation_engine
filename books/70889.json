  "description": "There's sex and then there's sizzling sex—and the difference between them is like the difference between vegetables and dessert. We may need the former, but the latter is infinitely more luscious.In this latest TruLOVE Collection, you'll discover love and passion that heats up in stormy weather, on a dare in a bar, popping out of a cake at a bachelor party, in a would-be open marriage, and even on one lover's menu. Sometimes putting some sizzle in your sex life means setting rules with your partner, like absolutely no talking during sex or insisting that the room is in total darkness. Sometimes it involves role-playing—complete with costumes or wigs—or acting as if you are strangers. (And sometimes you really are strangers!) Wherever it takes place, whomever it is with, you can count on sizzling sex to be a game-changer. It can revitalize a tired relationship or kick-start a new one. At the very least, it will unleash a side of yourself that has been yearning to be discovered.",
