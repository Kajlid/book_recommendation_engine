  "description": "TIME TRAVEL THRILLERTime isn't what we think it is...Most scientists think of time as a mathematical tool to chronicle events from past to future. Others view it as an integral component of the fourth dimension.But physicist Lucas Ramsay thinks they’re all wrong. Dead wrong.Time is something else altogether. He believes time is a living, sentient entity that seeks out to torment, then destroy anyone who dares to look at it. To control it, like himself.His theories have been called complete fantasy. Some consider Lucas insane and a threat. A few want him dead, or at least held accountable for the failed experiment that caused the death of millions.But what none of them know is that Lucas’ life is the temporal anchor point that keeps the multiverse from unraveling.Every decision Lucas has made leads him to a singular moment. The moment when he puts on the Smart Skin Suit and steps into the Incursion Chamber to travel back in time and fix the timeline.And fix himself, too.",
