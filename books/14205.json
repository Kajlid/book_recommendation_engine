  "description": "The Nanny Diaries \nmeets The Wedding Planner in this smart, dishy novel from the author of Secret Lives of Husbands and Wives—featuring a woman who runs San Francisco’s premier baby planning company and the mommies-to-be who seek out her services. Today’s trend seems to be that long before a professional woman’s baby bump becomes obvious under her Armani suit, she turns to San Francisco’s premier baby planner, Maddie McFadden, whose job it is to make her clients’ pregnancies emotionally painless. Maddie may make her living consulting with new moms on the latest and greatest baby gadgets no parent should be without, or which mommy meet-ups are the most socially desirable, but the success of her marriage to husband Brady depends on controlling her own urges toward motherhood. He’s adamant that they stay childless, but Maddie suspects it’s only because he’s still too upset that his out-of-town ex-wife rarely lets him see their eight-year-old son. Living vicariously through her clueless clients and her twin sisters’ precocious toddlers only makes Maddie’s biological clock tick louder. As she helps her newest client—Tyler Halstead, a stockbroker who must raise his newborn alone after the tragic death of his wife in childbirth—she tries her best to get pregnant “accidentally.” If that should happen, Brady will have to live with it… right? But when the unexpected happens, Maddie learns the most important life lesson of How we nurture is the true nature of love.",
