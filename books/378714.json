  "description": "Manfred Steiner was ten years old, a human defective on Mars whom the Earth authorities wanted destroyed. But Arnie Kott had other plans. Doctors had discovered a curious derangement in Manfred's sense of time — a derangement that could, with the right equipment, actually push him into the future.To know what lay ahead could mean lots of money for an operator like Kott. All he had to do was find a way to control Manfred. A man could go far with the right tools — in this case, a mentally ill kid with bizarre talents. But Kott didn't realize that there was more than one way for things to go wrong. And that was his first mistake!Front cover illustration by Darrell K. Sweet",
