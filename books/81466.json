  "description": "Candace Hilt works with stray and injured animals, takes care of five of her own loveable mutts, deals with meddling sisters, and can hold her own at a poker table full of rowdy men. Her heart is as big as all of Whisper Hollow but not quite big enough to fit a serious relationship into the mix. That was reaffirmed when she came face to face with the walking, talking reminder of that long ago summer when one stupid guy ruined it for all the rest. When Tad Dundee had met Candace he’d been six feet of baseball capped, country boy, down home idiot and probably still is. He is the guy who broke Candace’s heart all those years ago because his feelings for her scared him then and even now, as a grown man doesn’t find her or relationships any less intimidating. With the past tucked neatly behind them and neither of them looking for anything serious they’d fallen into a very easy, comfortable friendship until their friends challenge them to a summer of commitment. Tad and Candace’s pride won’t let them turn it down. They are thrust into a fake relationship with each other that has them both battling against a sizzling hot attraction and that even hotter old flame. Will winning the bet mean losing everything all over again or are they about to be dealt one Lucky deal?",
