She gets off to a rough start when she meets Luke, the nephew of her grandmother's friend, and one unfortunate event leads to another. Just when she thinks her summer cannot get much worse, she finds herself transported to Acadia in 1755. Here she meets Anne and learns much about the Acadian culture and history and the Acadians' relations with the Mi'kmac people.

When Sarah realizes that the peace-loving Acadians are about to be torn from their homes and banished to distant shores, she is desperate to find a way to help them. Forced to abandon her pampered, stylish lifestyle, Sarah uncovers a strength and determination she did not know she possessed. Although Sarah has to come to terms with the fact that \"you can't change history,\" she is willing to risk her life to do everything in her power to help her Acadian family, and finds a surprising ally in Luke. \"Winds of L'Acadie, \" a historical novel for readers ten and up, reveals a painful part of Canadian history through the relationship of two young women from different centuries.",
