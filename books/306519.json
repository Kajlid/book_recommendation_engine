  "description": "Len needs to track down a handbasket ASAP, because things are going straight to hell.In the aftermath of the disastrous battle to close the rip between realms, he's stuck with a Fae who seems convinced that the only way to fix things is to leap directly into the maw of the Wild Hunt.Len recognizes martyrdom when he sees it, and he's not about to let Albigard of the Unseelie sacrifice himself on the altar of his own guilty conscience.After the events of the past few weeks, it's looking more and more like Len's ghosts may hold the key that can lock the Hunt back inside its box of horrors. But when circumstances trap him alone with Albigard in a dead pocket realm, it becomes increasingly clear that the Fae is every bit as damaged inside as Len is.Before they can stop the Hunt and save the lost souls of their closest friends, they'll have to glue their broken edges together somehow. Only then will Len have a shot at undoing the damage that's already been done.He just has to keep himself—and Albigard—alive long enough to get the chance.* * *\nForsaken Fae\n is an M/M urban fantasy trilogy.
