  "description": "Chloe Rodriguez values three things above all else her family; her best friend, Rock; and Lolita, her Harley-Davidson 1200 Sportster. With a black body, blue airbrushed flames, and perfect sloping ape hangers, Lolita is Chloe's last connection to her beloved uncle, Seth, who left her the bike when he died last summer. So when a failing chemistry grade threatens to separate Chloe from her motorcycle, she vows not to let that happen . . . no matter what. Enter Gordon. Ridiculously organized, ubersmart, and hot in a casual, doesn't-know-it kind of way, Chloe's peer tutor may have a thing or two to teach her besides chemistry. But she has to stop falling for Gordon . . . and get Rock to act mature whenever he's around . . . and pass chemistry so she doesn't lose Lolita forever. Just when Chloe thinks she's got it all figured out, a bump in the road comes out of nowhere and sends her skidding.",
