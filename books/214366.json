  "description": "That was the way Sarah liked to think of the house where Miss Tabitha Henshaw lived with her thirty cats. There was no better place to visit if you wanted just the right kitten. Soon Sarah and the old lady became friends, and Sarah also got to know each of the cats' personalities.But the happiness at Miss Tabitha's is threatened by an angry neighbor who does not like cats. He complains to the town council, which finally tells Miss Tabitha that most of her pets must go.Then Sarah has an idea. If she can match cats with people, perhaps she can help save her feline friends and find them all new homes.....\"This is a delightfully 'catty' story with a strong appeal. Many homely hints on cat care appear throughout, and each pet is a distinct and lovable personality.\"--Denver Post",
