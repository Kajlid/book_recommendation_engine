  "title": "Raising Boys Without Men: How Maverick Moms Are Creating the Next Generation of Exceptional Men",
  "description": "Backed by peer-reviewed research, this hotly debated bestseller (San Francisco Chronicle) continues to open eyes with its finding that raising thriving, emotionally healthy sons does not require a man in the house.As the number of single-mom and two-mom households has grown, so have concerns about the possible damage caused by the lack of a stable male role model in the house. Determined to find the truth, research psychologist Peggy Drexler embarked on a long-term study comparing boys raised in nontraditional families with those whose fathers were present throughout their childhood. The results were startling. Female-headed households can provide even better parenting for boys than households with men. Sons from female-headed families can grow up emotionally stronger and more well-rounded than boys from \"traditional\" mother-father familiesâ€”more in touch with their feelings yet masculine in all the ways defined by our culture.Nominated for a Books for a Better Life Award in Parenting, Raising Boys Without Men has been featured on numerous television shows and in print, from Good Morning America to Good Housekeeping.",
