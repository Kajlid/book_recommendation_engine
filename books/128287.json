  "title": "The Church: Is Not What You Think",
  "description": "This book also answers critical questions such what does Jehovah God really think about the religious division that exists today? Does He want unity instead? In this book I have explained what the Bible says about the meaning of the word CHURCH, characteristics of Christian and Non-Christian Churches, church membership, the purpose of the church, Church Governance or management and Administration, Church Conflict and resolution etc. To many people, “Church” includes hundreds of different denominations or religions that disagree with one another in name, organization, doctrine, worship, and plan of salvation. Such a situation clearly constitutes division, not unity. Yet all the denominations claim to be Church of Jesus Christ.
