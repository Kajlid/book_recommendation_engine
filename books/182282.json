  "description": "For the first time ever Arden & Exton's complete story is together in one book!  Just a Small Town girl…  Raised on fairytales and dreams of true love, Arden Winger left for college with a smile on her face and a happy, hopeful heart. Fast-forward seven years, and that small town is behind her, but not the baggage she’s been carrying since she left.  Just a city boy…  It’s not that Exton Alexander had anything against relationships—he just never had the desire to try. Not necessarily jaded, Exton considered himself a realist. Little did he know the one woman that would change everything was about to rock his world.  This Alpha male knows the second he lays eyes on her that Arden is special-- now he just has to work past her defenses.  Is their relationship destined to be Strictly Temporary?",
