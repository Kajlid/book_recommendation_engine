  "description": "They always want to break me, but I'm too strong now. Untouchable. Or at least I was...until her.  **** LOGAN  I've had tunnel vision for one main goal for so long, that I forgot there was a whole other world just outside. Until Lana.  She's everything I never expected, and I love the fact I can never guess her every move or reaction. It's part of the reason I keep falling. But I also know she shuts me out, hides things from me she feels she can't share.  One day, I hope she trusts me enough to share.  It isn't until my job puts her at risk that I realize just how fierce she is, but it doesn't stop me from doing all I can to protect her. I should walk away to protect her better, but I can't. Instead, I'm forced to find other ways to keep her safe.  I just hope it's enough.  Though she is fierce, she's still fragile...  Right?",
