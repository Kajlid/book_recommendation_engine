  "title": "Touched by Magic: The Tommy Bolin Story",
  "description": "To many, Tommy Bolin was the legitimate heir to Jimi Hendrix's rock guitar throne. Stints with the James Gang and Deep Purple - as well as solo albums and a groundbreaking release with jazz-rocker Billy Cobham - certainly proved that the adulation was rightly deserved. And with a techno-color fashion sense, he certainly stood out from the pack. Only one problem, Tommy had a death-defying drug addiction, which ultimately would lead to a premature and tragic end - before he was able to truly take his standing among the elite musicians of the world. 'Touched by Magic: The Tommy Bolin Story' is the first book to focus entirely on the life story of Tommy Bolin - compiled from nearly 50 exclusive interviews (including family, friends, and band members that played alongside Tommy throughout the years). \"After reading 'Touched by Magic,' it seemed to me every interview 'takes you there' for the moment...I give 105 stars to Greg!\" -Johnnie Bolin, Tommy's brother",
