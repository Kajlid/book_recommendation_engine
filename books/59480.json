  "description": "Stone Barrington thought sadly that he'd heard the last of former girlfriend Arrington Carter after she'd left him and New York for California to marry Vance Calder, Hollywood's hottest star. The last thing Stone expected was a desperate call from Vance informing him that Arrington had vanished and asking him to come to L.A. and help find her.In a town where the sharks drive Bentleys and no one can be trusted, Stone soon discovers he's drowning in a sea of empty clues that take him from Bel Air to Malibu to Rodeo Drive. Running out of time and leads, he needs to keep his head above water and find Arrington fast, or end up swimming with the fishes himself.Librarian's note: the characters, settings and other information for the first 25 books in the series are complete as best possible (corrections are welcome!) for: #1, New York Dead, 1991; #2, Dirt, 1996; #3, Dead in the Water, 1997; #4, Swimming to Catalina, 1998; #5, Worst Fears Realized, 1999; #6, L.A.
