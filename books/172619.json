  "description": "Trust no one. That's Jenna's motto.     And it serves her well, even before a strange light blinds nearly everyone on Earth and causes the glare.   Not that she minds the apocalypse. Why should she? It's the best thing that's ever happened to her. No more secrets. No more lies, and there's plenty of food, just waiting for her to take it.   Best of all, she doesn't have to worry about who to trust anymore. Because almost everyone is dead. Or dying.   But there are other dangers in the new vicious coyotes, legions of rats, and something worse. Much worse.   Someone's out there. Someone else who can see in the glare.   Someone she has reason to distrust...and fear.   And he knows she's all alone...   Grab your sunglasses and get the first book in the thrilling Glare Series now, because the apocalypse won't wait!",
