  "description": "Unemployed Emma Trent can't believe her dream job as masseuse of a luxury island resort just fell into her lap. There's one thing the agency didn't mention-the resort caters to vampires. She meets resort owner Alex Masters and reels. Alex is the mystery lover she's been spending all her nights with-in her dreams.Alex built the resort as a way for his kind to experience a \"day at the beach.\" But even the grand opening of his greatest achievement is overshadowed by the ache in his soul for one woman-the sensual woman who's been tormenting his dreams with a taste of the love that has so far eluded him. When he meets the new masseuse, his libido kicks in with a vengeance. His dream woman has dropped out of his dreams and into his life. For a vampire this encounter means one thing-she's his eternal mate. He didn't count on Emma being mortal though-a deadly quality on an island of hungry vampires Unable to deny it's more than overwhelming passion drawing them together, Emma's faced with an impossible decision-choose between her fear of death or her love for Alex.",
