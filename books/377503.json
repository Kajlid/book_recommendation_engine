  "title": "To Marry Medusa",
  "description": "“A master storyteller certain to fascinate.”— Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Up until one minute ago, Gurlick was merely a specimen of Homo sapiens, and a substandard specimen at that. But now this craven, seething, barely literate drunk has ingested a spore that traveled light years before touching down on our planet. A spore that has in turn ingested Gurlick—turned him into a host for the Medusa, a hive mind so vast that it encompasses the life forms of a billion planets. A hive mind that is determined to ingest Earth as well. In this mind-wrenching classic of science fiction, the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novelist Theodore Sturgeon places humanity on a collision course with an organism of unimaginable power and malevolence and reminds us how much we depend on each other, or even on a wretch like Gurlick. Crackling with suspense, overflowing with invention, and startling in its compassion, To Marry Medusa is a tour de force from one of the great imaginers of the golden age of speculative fiction.",
