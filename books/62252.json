  "description": "In Brighton England, Elizabeth Fine is refined and ready for marriage. However, she is selective. It is 1835, she lives in a modern world and she is experienced in the ways of men. Especially when it comes to the sins of the body. Sex, was all she cared about, so her husband would have to be adept. Love was secondary. Dandy Carter comes from new money. A recent resident to Brighton, he never wants to set foot on the shores of America again. Especially now that he had the lovely Lady Fine to consider. She was proving to be more than his libido could take. If he had his way, he’d never marry and prefer to share his bed with Lizzy for all time. Yet as luck would have it, his father had other plans. Texas was home to many things. Desperados, Comanche and Dandy’s home. When his father is kidnapped, and feared dead, life for him and Lizzy begin to change. A will, and a rule made by Dandy’s father tell them that their lives are no longer theirs. As they leave England behind, and travel to America, Elizabeth and Dandy realize that life is no longer, Fine and Dandy. However, four weeks on a ship is more time than they need to prove their lust is more than even they can handle.",
