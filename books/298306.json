  "description": "Situated in rural New Mexico, Our Lady of Hope Monastery squeaks by on donations and various craft and skilled jobs suited to the nuns’ cloistered, contemplative life. When a stolen SUV crashes through their outside walls, Our Lady’s budget goes through the roof. So it seems like divine intervention when an ailing millionaire asks Sister Agatha—the extern nun whose investigative skills have earned her points in Heaven—to find his long-estranged niece. All Sister Agatha has to do is track down the woman, and the monastery’s financial worries will be over. But at what cost? Sister Agatha’s investigation quickly lands her in the midst of a deadly situation…and now it’s going to take more than faith alone to see that justice is done.",
