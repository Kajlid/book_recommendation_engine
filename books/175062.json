But Poppy, dog lover, artist extraordinaire, and fixer of problems, is working on a plan to spring Grandma Beth so Poppy can get out of the orphanage and things can go back to normal. But her plan falls to pieces when she witnesses a horrible crime, and suddenly normal slips even further out of her reach.To keep Poppy safe, the budget-strapped police devise an unusual \"witness protection program,\" where Poppy will stay with Detective Brannigan's mom. It's weird at first, but soon Poppy settles in, even making sort-of-friends with a misfit girl named Lizzie and definitely making friends with Gunner, a beautiful German shepherd with an uncertain future. But it's still not home. So while she and Lizzie navigate a rocky friendship and plot to save Gunner, Poppy also tries to figure out a new plan to rescue Grandma Beth and get home, all while avoiding a dangerous criminal who might be looking for her. But what if things can never go back to the way they were?Appeals to 4th-6th graders, reading level grade 5.",
