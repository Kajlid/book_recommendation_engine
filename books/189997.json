He's compromised by a corrupt Attorney General, drug pushers and businessmen who try their best to sideline him for speaking out. By chance he meets Gwennie, and they move interstate to start anew, only to find themselves caught in a web of corruption and vice. Gwennie disappears and Flint's left to deal with his psychotic mind. He is taunted by his enemies who, he discovers, are more closely linked than ever before.Artwork and illustrations by Paul Summerfield.Foreword by Ernest Hunter",
