  "title": "Breaking Meredith",
  "description": "For five years - one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two nights to be exact - I’ve watched her from afar…  Protecting her. Keeping her safe from the world.  And stalking her every move.  What started as a favor for her brother has grown into something so much more.  A full-blown obsession.  I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, unless I get my Meredith fix.  Claiming her could start a war, and might very well result in my death.  But she’s mine, she’s always been mine.  She just doesn’t know it yet. A Dark Romance.",
