  "description": "Something remarkable was happening. A dream was becoming a reality, and it was all because of a little rhyme that came to a busy mom in 1997. It was all because that mom was determined to rise above challenges and stay true to the desires of her heart. It was all because that mom never stopped talking to God.Remarkable Guidance is a story of what happened when a stay-at-home mom, who had communicated everything that weighed heavily on her heart and that which made her heart sing with joy with God, was handed an extraordinary task and that task had to do with guardian angels. It is a story of how that mom's determination and perseverance to rise above challenges in her world while on a quest for complete happiness developed an unwavering relationship with God.A belief in the assistance of guardian angels, a steadfast relationship with God, and a desire to find complete happiness made for the perfect ingredients for a remarkable story. Remarkable Guidance is that story, and there are other stories as well because when God is behind a plan, remarkable things can happen and that plan includes guardian angels.",
