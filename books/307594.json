  "title": "Beyond the Latch and Lever",
  "description": "A doorway can be a bridge to another world, a portal to a bygone era, or a crossroads between two cultures, or two lives. Doorways can be ledges that teeter between a racist past and a robotic future. Passages that lead to celestial spirits, earthbound souls, or a crumbling castle adrift in time.Doorways are the ferries that usher us through beginnings and endings, steering us into possibility and misfortune, alike. Some doors protect us and give us privacy, while others keep us isolated and confined. Some doors trap you inside your haunted mind.In this book you will find eleven doors. Eleven stories waiting to be opened. Each one a passageway into the unknown. Beyond the Latch and Lever is an anthology of speculative literary fiction with stories from emerging authors with ties to the Pacific Northwest.",
