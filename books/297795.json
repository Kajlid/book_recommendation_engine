Five years ago, Charlotte Murphy's brother tracked down her family through a DNA ancestry test. Charlotte was the only one he left alive. And now he's back to finish the deadly game he started.

But when Mack falls hard for the sassy Alaskan, the stakes suddenly become much higher than he can afford. Charlotte's scared. She's in danger. She's afraid to trust. Until Mack walks into her life, with shadows in his eyes, a gun at his hip, and a heart he keeps under lockdown. When the serial arsonist heats up his game, can Charlotte and Mack find a way to survive, or will her death be the final victory for the brother no one would ever want?",
