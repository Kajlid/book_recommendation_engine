  "title": "Bunny and Shark",
  "description": "Plunging into the first thirteen days after the 'bastard' pushes his ex- Playboy wife 'Bunny' over a cliff in the Caribbean, BUNNY AND SHARK is a fable about island survival and the perils of being exiled from one's identity. Literally lost at sea, Bunny is fueled by the miracle of having been saved from sharks by a band of dolphins. Her continued survival depends on her ability to become a spiritual extension of the landscape: she is the mood of the ocean at night as she swims blindly in it and the protective coolness of the jungle by day; the close-walled refuge of the sailboats anchored in the harbour and the sparkling deck of an opulent super yacht when, transformed, she makes a triumphant return to her former world. Introducing one of the great heroines of contemporary fiction, BUNNY AND SHARK takes readers on a voyage intense with abandon in a story that invokes more than a little bit of magic in the telling.",
