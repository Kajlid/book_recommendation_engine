  "description": "Psychologist Paul Clark receives an unusual invitation from Hope psychiatric hospital to undertake therapy with a strangely non-communicative young girl. Discovering that she has unusual memory problems and a hazy background, he soon begins to suspect that the girl is not mentally ill at all and that powerful figures within the hospital are covering up aspects of her past.Therapy brings about dramatic changes in his patient, but her awakening pulls Paul and his friends into a dangerous world of technological surveillance and psychic espionage, which ultimately questions the very nature of the reality they have so far taken for granted.",
