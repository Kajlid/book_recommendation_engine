  "description": "I met Adam Nova under the twinkling lights of a nighttime sky. He was hiding, but that gorgeous boy didn’t belong in the dark. Nevertheless it was where he lived; a different world than mine. I was Livingston Montgomery, Southern debutante. With the world at my fingertips, I was well on my way to being another spoiled socialite.   But I didn’t want money.   I didn’t want social status.   I wanted him; tattoos, sarcastic smirk, bad boy reputation and all.   It didn’t matter that he was from the wrong side of the tracks.   It didn’t matter that my family forbade me from seeing him.   I just wanted to be Beneath His Stars.",
