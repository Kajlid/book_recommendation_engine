  "title": "The Crabby Angels Chronicles: Radical Guidance on Love, Healing, Happiness, Inner Peace and Creating Miracles in Everyday Life",
  "description": "Wouldn't it be great to have a little message from Heaven every day to send you on your way? Or a kind of oracle like the I Ching or the Runes with a modern voice to give some direction when you have a question? The Crabby Angels Chronicles is just that, the book that the author's fabulous, nutty, funny, loving stalker angels wanted him to write. They've been after him for so long so he decided to let them write their book now. They're a nutty bunch who fit his life perfectly. Jacob Glass, along with his Angelic Guides, has written a handy spiritual tool kit to soothe, uplift, guide, direct, and renew you on your daily walk through a sometimes overwhelming world in which it is easy to lose connection with what really matters and what is really true. Direct, simple and based on the profound principles of A Course in Miracles, these short lessons are here to give you the comfort and peace that you deserve by reminding you of who you are and why you came here.",
