  "title": "A Light Song of Light",
  "description": "Exploring the relationship between poetry and song, the pieces in this collection work to define the elemental human struggles of good versus evil and light against darkness. The poems take different shapes—newly forged dictionary definitions; praise-songs celebrating the Singerman in a Jamaican road gang; and simple narratives of ghosts, bandits, and other night creatures—and present an accomplished and progressive voice from a new generation of Caribbean writers.",
