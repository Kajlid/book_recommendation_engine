  "description": "Patrick Healy loves his friends, loves his job, and loves all things Harry Potter. But when it comes to falling in love, he hasn’t found his match. Until he meets Kelsey Elliot, the older sister to his friend Nick. All it took was one night, and he was hooked. But Patrick discovers that Kelsey is hiding a secret. Convinced she needs his help to untangle herself from whatever she’s gotten herself into, he quickly discovers that maybe love isn’t enough to fix Kelsey’s broken dreams or her heart. Kelsey Elliot is done with love. After a dismal breakup and living on her parents’ couch, she decides to go to Miami with her brother and sister-in-law for a change of scenery and hopefully get a job interview at The Miami Times. Nothing is going to get in the way of her dream job as a journalist, especially not her brother’s hot friend, Patrick. Despite her resolve, old feelings are quickly rekindled when they live in the same house together. Now Kelsey has to decide if she can hold onto her dream and the man she’s fallen for, or if circumstances out of her control force her to choose between the two.",
