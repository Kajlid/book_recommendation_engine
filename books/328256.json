  "description": "Volume I of the Chronicles of the House of Chax**** Pell is a farm boy with great dreams. He wishes to be a hero, a knight in shining armor. Instead, as punishment for his pride, he must serve as a fool to the king and princess. Only through the clever help of the True Knight, Sir Antigon, is he able to trick the king into knighting him. But alas, his trickery costs him dearly! On his first day of knighthood, Pell is dreadfully wounded by the dragon, Rog. Only because his heart is like Sir Antigon's is he able to overcome his physical hardship. But how can he kill the invincible dragon, which all true knights must? And, even if he can fulfill the first requirement, how will he survive the treachery of the other knights?",
