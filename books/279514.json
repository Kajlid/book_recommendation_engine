Do buttons truly go flying across the floor when you rip off a guy's shirt? Is staircase sex hella hot or does it leave you with a big old bruise mark on your back? And donâ€™t even get me started on all that panty shredding, and whether it even works.Time to find out as I embark on Project Sexy Scenes Research, at the request of my hotshot book editor bestie.All I need is a willing scene partner. Enter Tristan, my best guy friend. The witty, tell-it-like-it-is, bearded hottie volunteers for the experiment.He's also the guy who gave me the most devastating, toe-curling kiss of my life ten years ago. But nothing has happened since then.And nothing will come between my panties and our friendship now since we have a plan to keep it PG.But once the buttons start flying, all bets are off...S-E-X AND OTHER SHINY OBJECTS is a standalone romance in the BOYFRIEND MATERIAL series. The other titles are ASKING FOR A FRIEND and ONE NIGHT STAND-IN.",
