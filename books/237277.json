  "description": "No one would stop me from keeping her as mine.  OTTO  The world that was once known is gone. In its place is a society where the rich rule, and the female population are auctioned off to the highest bidder.  I am more primitive than most, living off the grid and surviving on my own. I am a loner, a man who has needs and desires, and I am about to do something about it.  I may not be wealthy enough to purchase a female for myself, but I’ll have one as mine regardless.  And anyone who tries to stop me will see exactly the type of man I am, and the lengths I’ll go to claim a woman as my own.  SANSA  I lost the only two people I loved, my parent who hid me away from a barbaric society that wanted nothing more than to sell my body.  Being alone was consuming, and I didn’t know how much more I could take.  Then I found myself injured, on the verge of unconsciousness, and in the middle of nowhere. When I wake I’m in a strange cabin, and the man who is just feet from me looks at me as if he owns me.  He’s big, strong and muscular, and seems more animal than human.  And he’s told me I’m his now.   Warning: This story is fast, hot, and leaves nothing to the imagination. It features an over-the-top, caveman alpha male who wants his heroine as only his, and nothing will stop him from making that happen. Oh, did I mention the hero and heroine are both virgins *wink*. Lock your bedroom door, because this is one story you’ll want to read alone.",
