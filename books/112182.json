  "description": "Keti Jones is an ordinary teenage girl- well that's how her retired hero parents tried to raise her. But with some seriously mixed up DNA, a government that hates non-humans on their tail, and a universe where the laws of fiction trump the laws of physics, things are not going to plan. when Keti's Faerie Godmother shows up, Keti finds herself in a Dojo full of Earth's misfits and Faerie's finest, where magical girls rule the roost, oversized weaponry is a class of it's own, giant robots are the butt of everyone's jokes, and the deadliest weapon of all... is a shoe. The first volume of the collected comics from www.footloosecomic.com",
