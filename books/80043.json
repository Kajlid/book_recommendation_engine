  "description": "The hugely anticipated follow-up to Matt Shaw's best-selling horror story 'The Cabin'.\"I sat up and rested my back against the soft padded wall. I wonder whether the padding on the wall is to stop me from hurting myself, as they had explained when I first got here, or to drown the sounds of my banging and screaming as I beg for them to let me out; not that they ever will.\"Deemed unfit to stand trial after murdering his family, Craig was sent to the very Asylum (centred around the ghost stories) which led to his downfall. Here he hoped for nothing more than peace and quiet, as he struggled to get to grips with what he'd done, but the vengeful spirits had other ideas as they set about revealing their secrets to him.",
