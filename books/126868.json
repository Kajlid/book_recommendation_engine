  "title": "A French Darcy",
  "description": "Sacked from her high-flying corporate job, marketing guru Rebecca Ford arrives in rural France for a period of rest and recuperation. Despite being prompted by her best friend, attracting a ‘French Darcy’ is a long way from her thoughts. But soon she finds herself drawn to two men—the Vicomte de Bornay, who is a member of the French nobility and appeals to her desire for respect and status; and Marc Lambert, a street trader who both irritates and intrigues her in equal measure. And then a dilemma arises when the Vicomte pursues her and asks for help. Because the help he wants could spell the ruin of her friend while ruling out any chance of romance with Marc.",
