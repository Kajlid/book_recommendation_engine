  "description": "Trust. No. One.  A mantra that Dr. Cian O’Reilly has lived by; never allowing any new insiders to pierce his inner circle. Until her. Dr. Athena Payne was his game changer, the woman he wanted to bring into his cloak of darkness; to share in his malicious desires of torture and terror as the executioner of all who escaped justice. But when faced with an alleged betrayal of that trust, how far will he go to seek his vengeance?  Love. Conquers. All.  Three words that Athena Payne has always believed whole-heartedly. In her determination to become a brilliant heart surgeon, her thirst for knowledge tossed her headlong into a hidden conspiracy, a deadly game of death intertwined with the complications of love. Trusting and loving Cian may very well be the last things she ever does as she’s faced with paying the ultimate price for allowing him into her heart.  Save a life. Take a life.  Will the hardest kill Cian’s ever faced be his last? As others circle closer to learning his true identity, interns and attendings alike face the possibility of losing everything they’ve fought so hard to gain.  Trust no one. Let love conquer all. And prepare for a shocking ending that you won’t see coming in this third installment of the Trauma Series.  Lincoln Hospital, where the cure can be your worst nightmare.  Warning: Contains violent and graphic situations not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen. This is the third book in the \"Dexter\" meets \"Grey's Anatomy\" series and ends on a cliffhanger. All books must be read in order to follow the series.",
