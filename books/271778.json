  "description": "Sheba Ransome is a woman driven by the quest for unlimited money, street credibility and mind-blowing sex. After the sudden and unexpected death of her Mother, Sheba meets and marries mob henchmen, John Henry Carter, who takes over where her mother left off in teaching her the Wolf Philosophy. Sheba loves the fast-paced life of being married to a mobster but when their marriage starts to fall prey to the lifestyle Sheba decides to get in the game. As she and her husband are immersed deeper into the crime world the pressure pushes them over the edge. John Henry’s betrayals soon turn their once sweet love to bitter hate. After an ugly divorce followed by a string of hot affairs, Sheba hooks up with Raymond Ogletree, a lamb of a man who thinks his endearing love can turn Sheba into an honest woman. But to Raymond’s dismay, Sheba keeps her no-good ex-husband—who she still has a soft spot for—on the sidelines. John Henry’s disrespect pushes Raymond to the brink and this time, Sheba can’t stop Raymond and John Henry from going toe to toe. Sheba has only one true weakness—her son, Diondre—who she adores and would give her left kidney for. But the day comes when Sheba’s quest for the lavish life causes her to betray even him and risk losing the one thing she really cares about. The events that follow will either destroy everything Sheba has built or give birth to a bright new future. It all depends on whether Sheba survives seventy-two of the longest hours of her life and if a psychic named Violet Brown can help her through the dark, murky territory of the Sheep & the Wolves.",
