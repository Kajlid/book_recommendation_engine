I'm going to prom with Lucas Hook.I'm Ever Darlington and yeah, things just got even more complicated.Guilt, betrayal and lies continue in EVER FOUND, book 2 in the Lost Boys of Neverly Prep series, a dark and dirty fast build/medium burn contemporary RH academy romance based loosely on the characters from Peter Pan.
