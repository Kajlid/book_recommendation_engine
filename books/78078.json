  "description": "The Crackwalker explores the psyches of a retarded woman and her friends. \"Judith Thompson hears the poetry of the inarticulate and the semi-literate, embodying the colloquialisms, the brand names, the fractured but expressive syntax, with the urgency of their speakers. These characters do terrible things, and they have terrible things done to them.\"â€”Urjo Kareda",
