  "description": "It's been six months since Alex became Sous Chef at Schulze's, and in that time Alex has been working strenuously to improve and expand his skills, working toward the goal of becoming Nik's equal. He is kept motivated by the occasional breakfast shared with Nik, flirting and talking and offering tender bites of his culinary creations. But just as his hard work seems to be paying off, a new challenge is thrust upon him. Selected to be one of five challengers on a new cooking competition, Alex is quick to accept the offer, certain that winning will prove his abilities to Nik and everyone else. Except that to win, he will have to beat not only a handful of strangers, but also Nik, thrusting them right back to the ruthless competition of their school daysâ€”and quite possibly ruining any hope of a future as lovers.",
