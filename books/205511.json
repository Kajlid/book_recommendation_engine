  "description": "While celebrating his birthday, Alpha's Son Max Redfern finds the best present a shifter could ever have - His true-mate. The last thing he was expecting was for her to run out on him. But his headstrong wolf has left a bite mark on Emma Yates shoulder and claimed her as their mate. Five years later, he's now the Alpha and he tracks Emma down to get her back and gets a big shock. She's living with two other wolf shifters now and they aren't going to let him just bust his way through the door and attack her. But the real shock is that once Emma stops them beating Max up, he finds out that they're only five years old!",
