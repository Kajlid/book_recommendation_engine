  "description": "\"There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order. This lukewarmness arises partly from fear of their adversaries who have the law in their favor; and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had actual experience of it.\"- Nicolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)What does it mean to live on a world in which the worst case scenarios of Global Warming predict the temperature will be rising by six celsius degrees in only 100 years?What does it mean to move forward through our lives day-by-day into such a projected future?This is the question I asked myself when I arrived in Australia after a year of travelling across Asia.But after such a journey, such an encounter with foreign cultures, my mind had been changed and things were not as they were before.Join me, as I arrive in Sydney, on this journey of looking at life in a new way...Take the Red Pill now to discover:- the secret history of corporate globalisation- why money doesn't exist- who was wishing for a new Pearl Harbor back in 1997, and their actions after it came to pass on September 11th 2001- what Krishna, Lao Tzu, Bodhidharma, Rumi and the Gnostic Jesus have in common- the link between our mind and our reality- what it will take to halt Global Warming- why you can never Go Green",
