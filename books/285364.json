Philip, the heir to Ambrose's beautiful English estate, is crushed that the man he loved died far from home. He is also suspicious.

But the final, brief letters Ambrose wrote hint that his love had turned to paranoia and fear.Â Now Rachel has arrived at Philip's newly inherited estate. Could this exquisite woman, who seems to genuinely share Philip's grief at Ambrose's death, really be as cruel as Philip imagined? Or is she the kind, passionate woman with whom Ambrose fell in love? Philip struggles to answer this question, knowing Ambrose's estate, and his own future, will be destroyed if his answer is wrong.Bonus Reading Group Guide Included",
