  "description": "Serial Killers Iterum\"You, me, the general public, have a fascination for true crime accounts of people like Bundy, and fictional depictions of similar characters in television shows such as Criminal Minds and Dexter. We have a macabre interest in real life serial killers and can't comprehend the pure lack of remorse of these monsters. But yet we can't get enough. So we watch these shows and buy these books and read about these abhorrent yet fascinating criminals. Serial Killers Iterum is one such work that fulfils our insatiable obsession with serial killers in this terrifying, and bloodcurdling short story collection.\"The mythos of the serial killer is examined through fiction, poetry and art in this anthology",
