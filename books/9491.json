  "description": "Winner in the 2014 Reader's Favorite Award-Inspirational Fiction!Friendships, old and new, find fresh beginnings when Cherryvale's extreme makeover transforms the peaceful town to an exciting movie location. Grace Harkins, a muffin-baking, bike-riding, retired teacher can't wait to be an extra for the movie filming in Cherryvale. But when outspoken Maggie protests the \"biz\" invading, suspicious fires break out, strangers lurk and threatening phone calls force Grace to choose between her carefree retirement and saving a friendship in real danger.\"Open the pages of this delightful book, Fresh Start Summer by Beverly Nault, and prepare to be entertained. Small-town Americans are proud of their roots and even more so of their hometown...When you put all these folk together and add two shady characters from the town, and a spoiled teenage film diva who has known nothing but success, you have the ingredients for an out of the ordinary story. Throw in greed, envy, kidnapping and arsonists, and the story turns from interesting to attention-grabbing. Initially, I wondered when the many characters would be brought together and what would the catalyst be? People and attitudes are changed radically as the intrigue unfolds; even people you'd never think of as friendly become changed beings when their 'normal' is tossed inside out. I finished the book loving the differences that had come about as the tale developed. Worth the read.\" Patricia Day, reviewer",
