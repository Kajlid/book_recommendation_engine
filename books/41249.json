  "title": "Bravemouth: Living with Billy Connolly",
  "description": "\"Billy\", the ground-breaking biography of the nation's favourite iconoclast, gave millions of readers a fascinating insight into the personal and professional life of the genius that is Billy Connolly. Now, in the sequel to that bestselling book, the award-winning Pamela Stephenson celebrates life with the Scottish beastie as he hits the big six-oh. Here we relive colourful and epic moments from Billy's early life in Glasgow - the background to an intimate portrait of his marriage with Pamela and his life in Scotland, LA and the rest of the world. Witty, insightful and intimate, \"Bravemouth\" draws the reader into two very different worlds - hers of international sexology and the serious psychology of humorists, his of incontinence pants, being married to a shrink...and the finer points of banjo playing.",
