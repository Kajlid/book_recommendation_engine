  "description": "1922. From the preface: The revolutionary unrest which today afflicts the entire world goes far deeper than is generally supposed. Its root cause is not Russian Bolshevik propaganda, nor the late war, nor the French Revolution, but a process of racial impoverishment, which destroyed the great civilizations of the past and which threatens to destroy our own. This grim blight of civilized society has been correctly diagnosed only in recent years. The momentous biological discoveries of the past generation have revealed the true workings of those hitherto mysterious laws of life on which, in the last analysis, all human activity depends. In the light of these biological discoveries, confirmed and amplified by investigations in other fields of science, especially psychology, all political and social problems need to be reexamined. Such a reexamination of one of these problems-the problem of social revolution-has been attempted in the present book. Contents: The Burden of Civilization; The Iron Law of Inequality; The Nemesis of the Inferior; The Lure of the Primitive; The Groundswell of Revolt; The Rebellion of the Under-Man; The War Against Chaos; and Neo-Aristocracy.
