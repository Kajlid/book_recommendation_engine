  "description": "*This enhanced edition of The Anti-Federalist Papers includes illustrations and the U.S. Bill of Rights.Anti-Federalism refers to a movement that opposed the development of a stronger U.S. federal government during the period of the Constitutional Convention. The previous governing documents called the Articles of Confederation gave state governments ultimate authority unlike the new U. S. Constitution, which attempted to put the federal government on equal footing. Led by Patrick Henry, George Mason, George Clinton, Melancton Smith, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Yates, and Samuel Bryan, among others, the Anti-Federalists worried that the office of the president might become similar to the monarchy that Americans initially left behind in England.In order to oppose the ratification of the new Constitution, A series of articles were written called The Anti-Federalist Papers. The articles offer a detailed explanation of Anti-Federalist though and can be used as a counter to The Federalist Papers that were written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay in favor of the ratification of the U. S. Constitution.",
