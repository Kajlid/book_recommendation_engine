  "description": "Polikushka is a novel written by the renowned Russian author Leo Tolstoy. The story is set in the 19th century and follows the life of a serf named Polikushka, who is employed as a courier for his master, Count Ivan Ivanovich. Polikushka is a simple man who is content with his life, but his world is turned upside down when he is sent on a mission to deliver a message to a neighboring estate.During his journey, Polikushka falls in love with a peasant girl named Masha, but their relationship is short-lived as he is forced to return to his duties as a courier. However, Polikushka's life takes a dramatic turn when he is accused of stealing a valuable item from the Count's estate. He is arrested, tried, and sentenced to hard labor in Siberia.The novel explores themes of social injustice, the plight of the serfs, and the corrupt nature of the Russian aristocracy. Tolstoy's vivid descriptions of the harsh conditions in Siberia and the brutal treatment of the prisoners provide a stark contrast to the luxurious lifestyle of the aristocracy.Polikushka is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that highlights the social and political issues of 19th century Russia. It is a must-read for anyone interested in Russian literature and history.THIS 78 PAGE ARTICLE WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE The Cossacks, Sevastopol, The Invaders and Other Stories, by Leo Tolstoy.
