  "description": "Amoria has fallen. Its capitol lies in ashes, and its people have scattered in the wind. A final heirloom, a final hope—its last dragon egg—has fallen into the protection of two unlikely Tenlon, and Desik. It falls to them to fend off the long-standing terror of the Volrathi. More than an army, more than an invading force, the Volrathi represent the death of all that a lost country stood for, and they have their sights set on all of Endura. No single nation has the power to stand against them alone.The remnants of Amorian strength—its students; its refugees; and its princess, Natalia—have gathered in an isolated mountain fortress known as the Gambit. This last vestige of a defense for a failing nation is legendary, but not infallible. The Volrathi have even found this place, and put its defense’s to the test.Can a group of young students defend themselves against both the Volrathi and an unknown, gruesome new threat? Can Tenlon survive his dangerous plunge into the powerful magic nestled in the Book of Aramid? Will Desik find the princess, and the other survivors, before it’s too late?These destines will intertwine, and represent the last hope for a world in turmoil, all in the far-reaching shadow of the Gambit.",
