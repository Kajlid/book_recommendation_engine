  "description": "Art can bring life…but it can also kill. When her voodoo runs dry, an ancient woman on the Louisiana bayou finds a new way to keep the dead close. A young boy is chased out of the woods by an unseen monster…at home he will learn who the real monsters are. A haunted hospital holds tight to its spirits. The world is about to end. How will you spend those last moments? Everyone has a dark thought now and then. But sometimes our dark thoughts have us. These thoughts are capable of great evil, but also redemption. Herein lie dark tales, dark nights of the soul, to be read with the lights low and the doors locked. Take the simple complexity of Mondrian, fill it with the passion of Klimt, the psychology of Munch, then look at it all through stereo-blind Rembrandt eyes and convert it into words; that’s the best way I can think of to describe the darkly poetic writing of Martin Reaves. ~ Trent Zelazny, author of Too Late to Call Texas and Butterfly Potion.Show More Show Less",
