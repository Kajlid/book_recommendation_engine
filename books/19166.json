  "title": "Death: Living to Talk About It",
  "description": "For over twenty-years I have found myself on the verge of death and fought to stay alive. My heart attack in 1989 marked the beginning of a life and death struggle that has lasted more than twenty-years. I have been in hospice, and my family told I had three weeks to live. I was on a heart transplant list, but was removed because they said I was too sick to survive surgery. This is the story of the journey I am taking. Living, and dying, with heart and lung disease. Join me as I talk about what it is like to be terminally ill, and told time and again I was dying. Most importantly, I wish to impart hope.",
