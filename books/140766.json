  "description": "Real estate agent Margo Fellshur can’t catch a break in a slow housing market. With her teen-age daughter dreaming of high end colleges, hopes of financial stability grow dimmer by the minute. For extra cash, the single mother works weekends as a psychic, reading cards and palms at parties – and she’s good at it. Too bad she can’t resolve her own issues. As a kid, Margo took her gifts for granted. Couldn't everyone see auras and hear the thoughts of their friends? When a chance encounter connects Margo with a young pilot, he asks for her help in finding his sister who disappeared months before. Margo recruits fellow psychics but they come up short until a dream changes everything.",
