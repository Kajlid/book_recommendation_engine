  "title": "New Year's: Nathaniel P. as Seen Through the Eyes of His Friend Aurit",
  "description": "From Adelle Waldman, author of The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P., here's New Year's, a story from the point of view of Nate's friend Auritâ€”as startling, provocative and true-to-life a tale about a young woman's dating life as The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. was about a young man's. She felt some part of herself relax when she was with him. She could shut off the part of her brain that was always monitoring whether she was talking too much, being \"selfish.\" A few years before the start of The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P., twentysomething writer Nathaniel Piven admires a piece of published work by a young woman named Aurit Arazi, and writes her an email expressing his appreciation. After this introduction, they meet for a drink. At the time, Nate is dating gorgeous, moody Elisa, and Aurit has an older, successful novelist boyfriend named Carter, but Nate and Aurit become friends. In the months, even years, that pass, Nate's and Aurit's romantic partners change, but their friendship carries on. And then, one New Year's eve, it seems that the nature of their relationship may change. Like many readers who got to know Nate P. in The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P., Aurit is pretty sure that, when it comes to relationships with women, Nate can be an asshole, but is there more to him than that? In New Year's, author Adelle Waldman exposes the mating psyche of one brilliant young female writer, with the same shockingly accurate eye that brought the world Nathaniel P.",
