We’re either away from the phone or just can’t talk! Please leave your name and number, and who knows, we might just call you back!” Jeff slammed the phone. That was the fifth time today he had gotten that same stupid message with three voices and a dog’s bark on cue. The guy owed him over ten grand for a landscaping job that hadn’t even started, but the building materials delivered, were still waiting for payment.Sera heard the phone and yelled out to the kids, “Don’t answer that!” She held her breath, waiting. This time he didn’t leave a message.How on earth was she going to pay for landscaping when she could be losing the house any day now?Six months from now, she might pay closer attention to that sexy voice on the phone, but after Peter left her and the kids, she had no time for any man unless he did dishes, took out the trash, or paid off her many debts.Then a thought occurred to what if she provided a service to him to work off the money she owed?
