  "description": "Cori Stephens thought that she had it all. She had a great job, her own home, the man of her dreams and a bright future in Miami. She was living the life she always wanted, but in an instance, her world was turned upside down. Betrayal and heartbreak sends her into the arms of an unlikely ally. There she finds comfort and a type of passion that she never knew existed. As she tries to find her happiness again, Cori quickly learns that giving into her desires may destroy her. Can she get it together in time to live the life that God has planned for her? Or will she continue down this road of bitterness and regret by continually yielding to her temptations?",
