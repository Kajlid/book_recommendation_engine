  "title": "Rock 'n' Roll Love Stories: True tales of the passion and drama behind the stage acts",
  "description": "The music world has seen some of the most iconic partnerships of all time the reader feels almost on a first-name acquaintance with many of them: Sonny and Cher, Mick and Marianne, Elvis and Priscilla, Ike and Tina...Rock n Roll Love Stories looks at 14 of the best, taking us from the 1950s all the way up to the early 2000s. Along the way we see behind the public face of a whole range of relationships, from the straightforwardly romantic to the messily divided, and from the famous (and infamous) to the relatively unknown. All are engaging, full of contemporary detail, and come imbued with the energy and the spirit of the music world over the last half century.",
