  "description": "Follow Sgoobidoo, famed canine detective, to the corner store, bingo hall and amusement park in a series of feeble intrigues with disappointing endings. Listen to the deafening silence of the broken television set as the wretched Sammy sits waiting for the professor, the prospector or his mother to call with a mission. Accompany the pitiful pooch and his humble human through a series of sad adventures in this collection of stories gathered in the familiar format of an Archie digest, interspersed with ketchup-flavoured games and advertisements. In The Adventures of Sgoobidoo, Cathon pays homage once again to the B-series movies and detective novels that inspiredi The Pineapples of Wrath, her popular tiki murder mystery set in the Hawaiian quarter of Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec.",
