  "title": "Diary of a Sixth Grade Ninja",
  "description": "My name is Chase Cooper, and I'm a 6th grade ninja. It's my first day at a different school and the only person I know is my cousin, Zoe (but she might be a little too cool for me). I was just another scrawny kid until a group of ninjas recruited me into their clan. It was a world of trouble I wasn't prepared for, which is why I kept this diary (or \"chronicle\" as my dad would call it) - to warn other kids about the dangers of becoming a ninja. They say history is destined to repeat itself... well, not if I can help it.Diary of a 6th Grade Ninja is a funny thriller that's entertaining for kids, middle school students, and adults.",
