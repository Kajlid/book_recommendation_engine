  "description": "A beautiful gift edition of the beloved classic about three orphan siblings and their love of music, theater, and dance.Â When orphans Sorrel, Mark, and Holly are sent to live with their grandmother, a famous English actress, she enrolls them in the Children's Academy of Dancing and Stage Training, the same Academy that made the orphans from Ballet Shoes famous so long ago. It's the chance of a lifetime, but the Academy won't give the children the \"proper\" education their parents would have wanted. However, the children learn to love the Academy when they find out that Sorrel has dramatic flair, Mark can sing, and Holly charms everyone with her adorable impish ways. Maybe talent does run in the family.This classic children's book is perfect for kids who dream of being on stage--dancing, singing, or acting. Don't miss the other classic Noel Streatfeild books, Ballet Shoes, Skating Shoes, and Dancing Shoes!",
