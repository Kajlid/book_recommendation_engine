  "description": "Lexi Levine's life changed forever the night she became a werewolf. She was only meant to be a temporary addition to the Shifter Squad, but at barely eighteen, she is now a permanent member of the team. Well used to facing danger, none of the squad is prepared to meet Lexi's father. Major Philip Levine is a sniper with unparalleled skills. He has returned from his overseas mission to seek answers. Even Lexi isn't sure how he will react when he meets the squad for the first time. Still coming to terms with her new role as a shifter, she is in denial about the mysterious link that has sprung up between her and Agent Reece Garrett. She hopes in vain that if she pretends that it doesn't exist, it will just go away. If the team manages to survive her fatherâ€™s anger, they must then face an even bigger threat. A voodoo practitioner has been raising corpses in New Orleans and the Shifter Squad has been ordered to investigate. If they fail to stop the man who calls himself the Zombie King, his undead minions will soon overrun the city.",
