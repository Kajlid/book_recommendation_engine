  "description": "Absyn is a dragon hybrid, but he isn't like the others of his kind—he can't breathe fire. Ten years ago, the Yomzai descended upon the earth and created an ice-age, parting the classes like the sea and stirring up more controversy within society than before. Stuck between both classes, Absyn decided to take out the Yomzai with his bare hands—a feat no one else had been able to do. The journey rips open scars once healed, but still he continues on. Is there truly worth to his life after all?",
