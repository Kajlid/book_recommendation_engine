  "description": "The decision to leave the European Union sparked a conflict which would change the world forever. The enemies of the Scottish Patriots, an underground guerrilla organisation, responded in a way that nobody could have foreseen; a dangerous biological weapon was unleashed, designed to kill them quickly and quietly, but the unpredictable events that unfolded threatened borders and allegiances in a way that none of them thought possible. Facing an outbreak on all sides, the safety of not just the UK, but that of the entire world, is in jeopardy. Combining with European forces, the Patriots make chilling discoveries about how the mutated virus works",
