  "description": "alternate cover edition of ASIN: B00GF59BAEAt twenty years of age, Isaiah’s got a bright future ahead of him. He’s popular, he’s handsome, and all the ladies sigh when he walks by. Maybe it’s his smirk, or perhaps it’s the beautiful color of his eyes, but one thing is for sure-he is the coolest guy on campus. Heidi is a bit hot-headed, she can admit. She doesn’t have much patience when it comes to Isaiah’s ridiculous behavior. Her fuse is short and it doesn’t help when he’s always making snide remarks about her preference to read instead of going to parties. She’s nineteen and trying to find her way in the world, except there’s one minor detail that sets her apart from the average girl. Our world is not theirs. They are royalty. Isaiah is the prince of Ice and Heidi is the princess of Fire. In an effort to keep them safe when their kingdoms are attacked by unknown forces, their parents sent them to earth. For the time being, Heidi is stuck in North America with Isaiah, attending a small community college and attempting to blend in. It’s not as easy as humans make it seem. Worried about her father and their kingdom, Heidi has a difficult time adjusting to life on a foreign planet, and being with Isaiah doesn’t make it any easier. With new enemies entering their lives and old wounds being reopened, will Heidi and Isaiah be able to set aside their differences long enough to save their world? Will they be able to save ours?",
