  "description": "The Kingdom is careening toward catastrophe. Meanwhile, the King is cruising seedy taverns looking for likely maidens. \"The King\" is his only name. He avoids responsibility at all costs. He executes anyone who annoys him. He keeps his mother locked in a dungeon. But deep down, what the King really wants is to be loved. During this misguided search for romance, he is portrayed as a cross dresser by the Kingdom Crier (the Kingdom's most popular tabloid). Shortly after, he must defend his castle against a siege, with only his royal fiddler - while attempting to steal his royal fiddler's girlfriend.Royal Flush is a recipient of the H. R. (Bill) Percy Prize.",
