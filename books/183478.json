  "description": "You’ve heard of the \"Great Books\"? These are their evil opposites.From Machiavelli's The Prince to Alfred Kinsey’s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male , from Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto to Margaret Mead’s Coming of Age in Samoa , these \"influential\" books have led to war, genocide, totalitarian oppression, the breakdown of the family, and disastrous social experiments.And yet the toxic ideas peddled in these books are more popular and pervasive than ever. In fact, they might influence your own thinking without your realizing it.Fortunately, Professor Benjamin Wiker is ready with an antidote, exposing the beguiling errors in each of these evil books.Witty, learned, and provocative, 10 Books That Screwed Up the World provides a quick education in the worst ideas in human history and explains how we can avoid them in the future.",
