  "description": "Crash landing on a distant alien world had left Nyota dazed, confused, and more than a little bewilderedâ€” all of which was currently being massively amplified by the revelation she was not only an alien abductee, which sucked to no end, but was now unexpectedly a wanted fugitive from brutal Raxxian captivity.Hunted, on the run, and very much out of her element, Nyota was grateful she at least had one thing going for her. A muscular hunk of an alien watching over her.The pair had been thrown together by chaos and chance, a human and a Nimenni warrior. Not the usual sort of partnership either of them would have expected. But circumstances has tested fate, and as a result the alien commando was honor-bound to protect his human companion.Facing a vast and exotic wilderness, marauding alien brutes, and all on a planet far, far from home, Nyota was in for the adventure of her life. And if she was lucky, perhaps a little something more than just protection from her deliciously manly companion.",
