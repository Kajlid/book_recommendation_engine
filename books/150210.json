  "title": "American Wolf: A Journey of an Avoidant Heart",
  "description": "Emotionally avoidant James Wolf has spent his life runningâ€”from his past, his pain, and most importantly, from himself. Now nearing 40 and feeling the weight of profound loneliness, James escapes his life in Chicago for the vibrant yet isolating Florida Keys. There, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that challenges the walls he's spent a lifetime constructing.When an unexpected reunion with Lily, a long-lost friend, disrupts his carefully controlled world, James must decide whether to continue living in isolation or take a chance on connection and healing. Along the way, memories of his best friend Neb and the scars of his past weave a poignant tapestry of friendship, identity, and longing.Through tender and sometimes heartbreaking moments, American Wolf peels back the layers of masculinity and the deep-seated wounds that shape how we loveâ€”and how we let ourselves be loved. Perfect for readers who love literary fiction that lingers long after the last page, American Wolf is a thought-provoking yet hopeful meditation on the courage it takes to break down the walls we build around our hearts.âœ¨ For fans of: The Sun Also Rises, The Alchemist, A Single Man, A Little Life, and character-driven psychological fiction.ðŸ“– Add to your Goodreads shelf & mark as \"Want to Read\" today!",
