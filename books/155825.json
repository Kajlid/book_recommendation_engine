She just knows it’s a secret that no one must know. Nothing in her world is as it seems. Not, Aunt Lilian, or her Uncle Kam, not even the wolf she rescued from a hunter's trap. Rafael can't help but watch over the beautiful redhead who saved him. A Lycan trapped by a wizard’s curse he knows she needs his help.  To top it off the ultimate evil is hot on her trial, and getting closer. No one is safe, especially not her.",
