  "title": "Leaves of Hypnos",
  "description": "A war had begun which, though most of his country was soon occupied, occupied Rene Char still more. He was about 36 then. And the poetic journal he kept of and at that time comes to us under the auspices of his Resistance code-name, Hypnos, the Greek divinity of Sleep. As for the present work, the \"leaves\" remind the translator of Rimbaud's from a Season in Hell, but this is no longer a private hell expatiated into a vision of the human condition, but a public hell drawn from, exceeded by, a sense of responsibility.",
