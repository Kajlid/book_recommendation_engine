  "title": "The Complete Tales",
  "description": "This deluxe volume brings all of Beatrix Potter's twenty-three Peter Rabbit tales and verses together in one book. The texts are complete and unabridged, and all the original illustrations, both colour and black and white, are included. The stories are arranged in the order in which they were first published to enable them to be read in the proper sequence for, although each story stands on its own, several are linked together by events and characters.Beatrix Potter's tales were often connected with real places, people or animals so each story has a brief introductory note about its history. The volume also includes four other works by Beatrix Potter which for one reason or another remained unpublished in her lifetime but show new facets of her talent as an illustrator and storyteller.The world of Beatrix Potter, presented here in its entirety, is as appealing now as when it was first created over one hundred years ago.",
