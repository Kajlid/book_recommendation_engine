  "title": "Death Times Three",
  "description": "Murder strikes thrice in these three baffling mysteries of crime and detection.First, Rex Stout’s great detective, Nero Wolfe, develops an appetite for the sweet taste of revenge when someone slips something most foul into his lunch—in a case motivated by the most “alimentary” of passions. Then, a couturier’s beautiful sister uses Archie Goodwin, Wolfe’s man about town, as her ready-made alibi—and maybe her fall guy—unless Wolfe can spot the loose ends in a nearly seamless crime. Finally, Wolfe has a run-in with the law after a mysterious old woman leaves a package at the detective’s West Thirty-fifth Street brownstone that pits him against a cunning criminal—and the U.S. federal government.",
