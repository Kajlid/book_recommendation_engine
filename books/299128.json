And it tastes better than Riah’s lips on mine.I will find my way home no matter what Prince Thorne throws at me. I don’t care Riah has to say. It’s too late for apologies. We’re beyond explanations.

They did this to me…but they don’t know just how strong I am.If they want me, well, I’d like to see them try. Here I am, come and get me.I waited 327 years for this…I will have my vengeance.",
