When Rae got the invitation to NightWhere, a secret underground sex club, Mark agreed to go. But NightWhere is not your typical swingers club. Where it's held on a given night, only those who receive the red invitations know. It's never in the same place twice. And the mysterious Watchers who guard the club answer to something far more sinister than the calls of the flesh. Soon Rae is indulging her lust for pain, moving closer to a threshold of unimaginable evil. And Mark is in a race against time to save not only Rae's life, but her very soul!",
