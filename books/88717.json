  "title": "Falling Backwards",
  "description": "Life becomes complicated for Simon – a fundamentalist preacher and marriage guidance counsellor – when he realises in between adulterous affairs that he is, in fact, an atheist. From his dingy office in Kings Cross, from the pulpit, and from the beds of his lovers, Simon sorrowfully observes the hypocrisies and corruption of the worlds that he inhabits. And sometimes he embraces them.Raunchy and blasphemous, provocative and funny, Falling Backwards follows Simon from his flock at Sunday School to his ministry in the brothels of Kings Cross, and asks us to wonder whether Simon may not be something of a saint after all.",
