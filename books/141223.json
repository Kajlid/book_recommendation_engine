  "description": "Right fairy tale. Wrong guy.Happily Ever After only happens with the right guy. It's a tiny but important detail most fairy tales choose to leave out.

Sure, her brother may be the super-stud captain of the football team, but that's her only claim to fame â€“- until her friends' social experiment turns her into the new It girl of the Sophomore class, and she captures the attention of the most popular guy in her grade. Ecstatic to introduce the world to her first boyfriend, she's trying to enjoy being wooed by the ultimate heartthrob.

Oh, if only love was as simple as fairy tales make it out to be....",
