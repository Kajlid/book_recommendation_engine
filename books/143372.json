  "description": "This is the tale of how Harry met Fiona… And broke her heart.They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned but Fiona MacKintosh was more inclined to believe that after a long, furious journey through hell, no scorned woman was apt to be inclined to love and entrust her heart to a man so easily again.Especially not to the same man!Lord Harrison Brudenall, Marquis of Aylesbury, isn’t a man to let what he wants slip through his fingers, and what Harry wants is Fiona as his wife. Two years past, friendship and respect for the MacKintosh brothers compelled him to discourage the infatuation and flirtation of their only sister even if he denied himself in the process, but the years since have changed Harry. The joy and humor once readily found in his life has become conspicuously absent but Harry doesn’t realize just how lacking they had been until he met Fiona MacKintosh once more.Unconventional, daring and achingly beautiful, she reminds Harry of everything his life has been missing and what it was like to truly feel alive. Now, he means to have the tempermental Highland lass for his own whether the whole of the MacKintosh clan – Fiona included – approves or not.And she does not!Fiona is determined to find a man and marriage meant for her convenience and the handsome, charismatic, heartbreaking marquis, Harry Brudenall, is not on her list. But when danger looms unexpectedly, and it is her life rather than her heart that is in peril, Fiona soon realizes that there is only one man she wants to turn to for protection.There was just something about Harry. The one man who will prove his love … and without question, give his life for her.",
