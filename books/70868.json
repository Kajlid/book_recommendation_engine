  "description": "Some memories fade. Some memories fight back. Since the tragic accident that stole her parents, sixteen-year-old amnesiac Cat Lindensen lives each day with only faint memories of the last. But after her uncle abruptly uproots their L.A. lives for the lush forests of Oregon, even Cat begins to notice the shadows that stalk her steps. Frightening hallucinations, flash growth spurts, and a debilitating reaction to iron leave Cat fearing for her mind. No one notices Cat's struggles more than the strange new boy Card Thomas, namely because he triggers them. The touch of his skin sends Cat into consuming visions of magic, monsters, and even her own lost past. But while Cat clings to the world she thought she lived in, she can't help but fall in love with a truth she can't explain--even as she's falling into the arms of an old friend with more secrets than she ever knew. Revived to the supernatural world around her, Cat must bend the lines between right and wrong to navigate the harsh world of bargains, curses, and a love that tests her very sanity. But sometimes itâ€™s good to go a little crazy in love...",
