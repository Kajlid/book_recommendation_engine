  "description": "What if bad guys ruled the world and the good guys were the outlaws?Deviant doesn’t do friendly. He’s had a hard life and it shows in his behavior. The Outlaw MC of Mars is starting to expand thanks to some tough women who want to change the law. In the government’s eyes, women are only needed for breeding. Deviant is volunteered to train them. What he doesn’t expect is to meet Tage. The handsome man blushes more than a hard spanked butt. And what a fine pair of cheeks he has. Deviant made a promise to himself. Never fall in love. That makes a man vulnerable to hurt, to loss, to become broken. So why does he feel this undeniable attraction to Tage? Deviant doesn’t do romance or cuddling or any of that other shit. With a covert war against the government going on, the last thing he needs is a weakness. Will the shy Tage bring the big badass biker to his knees?",
