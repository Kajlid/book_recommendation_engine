  "title": "Anywhere but Here...",
  "description": "The stories included in Anywhere But Here share common eccentricity, displacement, and the author's own sense of being an outsider, an observer of the unique and myriad forms of self-expression. These stories are a mixture of travel tale, memoir and fiction. They range in setting from the Deep South of the United States to Prague and London in Europe and locations in North Eastern Australia. The stories are sometimes factual, sometimes purely fiction but more often than not are an enigmatic blending of the two. The principle character of these stories is Angguish himself, whose own eccentricity and idiosyncratic powers of observation make for a delightful read that is at times funny, sometimes erotic or sombre and often quirky.",
