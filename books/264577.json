  "description": "New cover edition found here.A standalone Frisky Beavers story from the authors of USA Today bestsellerPrime Minister Bas: Meadow is off-limits. She’s my tenant, my friend, and most importantly, a woman who has her shit together when I famously do not. But in the dark of night, when the filthiest of fantasies take over, it’s her soft, curvy body I’m tying up, holding down, and dominating. So I throw myself into yet another new project—a Halloween street party. It’s supposed to be clean and wholesome, but with each planning session, a little bit of kink slides in. And my depravity is just twisted enough that I start to imagine the good doctor is enjoying the double entendres.  Meadow: I’ve been keeping a secret from Bas since the moment I met him, and everything that’s happened since then—our friendship, my inappropriate crush, the fact that I moved into the apartment over his bar—is tainted by that lie. I need to confess everything, and I will, after Halloween. Because there’s no way I’m going to miss the hottest party of the year—or lose what might be my only chance to explore the hidden side of my desires I’ve never been brave enough to let loose before. . . . THE HALLOWEEN STREET PARTY RULES: * No nudity. Leave your undies on when you climb onto the spanking bench! * Adults only, please. The entire street is licensed for liquor and inappropriate language. * Whatever you do, don’t fall in love with your best friend. The costumes aren’t real, and the feelings are fragile.",
