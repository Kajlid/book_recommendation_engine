  "title": "How to Be French",
  "description": "For Margaret, Paris was a place where dreams were reality; a fairytale city where beauty, elegance and style were still the ultimate ambition. And Paris was a long way from the routine of Margaret's life with a less-than-satisfying job. Studying French allowed her, at least for a few hours a week, to forget her work and her fears of disappearing into suburbia. Margaret’s life began to fall into place when she landed the job of her dreams at an online women’s magazine. The job allowed her to pursue her passion for France and the language as she travelled to France to file stories, review French films and interview visiting French stars. How to Be French is about the challenges of learning another language but more than that, it is a captivating story about how your life can change when you follow your dreams.",
