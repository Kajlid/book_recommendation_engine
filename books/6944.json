  "title": "Fool for Love",
  "description": "'Set in a desolate motel room on the edge of the Mojave desert, the play has something of the timeless universality of a Greek tragedy . . . Like ancient classical drama, too, the action is at once brief and relentless. By the end of the 90-minute play you feel you have lived through a cataclysm . . . This is a tremendous play, bleak but savagely funny, apparently naturalistic yet also resonant and dreamlike.' Daily TelegraphFool for Love is accompanied in this volume by The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill on the Eve of Killing his Wife, a comic operetta by Sam Shepard and Catherine Stone, which takes an irreverent view of American heroes and heroics.",
