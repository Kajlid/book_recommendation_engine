  "description": "Forced apart by war five years ago, Renjiro and Selina have another chance at love. Can they make it work or does fate have other plans?  Without the citizenship of the Federation, Indy pilot Selina Codecko is treated like a second-class citizen. When she gets caught up in a bar brawl she's arrested and finds herself in the hands of the Justice Officers.  Renjiro Ito has dreamed of Selina for five long years. As the Commander of the Justice Officers, the plight of this one woman will turn his life upside down.  But there's more going on than just the fate of one womanâ€”there's a seething underbelly that wants to destroy their newly expanded Federation. The chances of a future together are slim, but they'll take any chances that come their way. Will it be enough?    \"...you'll love this book!\" Bookworm Bridgette's World  \"Good story building and characters...\" Roni at Romance Book Scene",
