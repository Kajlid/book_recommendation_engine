  "description": "What was happening couldn’t be real. I couldn’t be on the run from the police and gang members. I was, or had been, a strait-laced high school teacher. Nor could I be sitting next to one of my students, a boy from my English class. And he definitely couldn’t be the love of my life, since I was married. But it was all very real. I was in love with Dante Rata, a teenage gang member from the wrong side of town. I’d ruined my marriage for him. Destroyed my career for him. Left my safe middle-class world behind, risking my freedom, and even my life, just to be with him. And despite all of that, I was living my happily-ever... For now. Because when the after part came, I would lose everything. Including Dante.",
