  "title": "Scull Shoals the Mill Village That Vanished in Old Georgia",
  "description": "In the Scull Shoals clearing by the Oconee River in Georgia the forest air is heavy with old Georgia history. Humans have left an imprint on this place for at least 10,000 years. Today,the brick ruins of the Antebellum textile mill village speak broken sentences about this gathering place in the old South. It was surrounded by huge cotton plantations making a few folks wealthy off the backs of dispossessed white workers and black slaves. A governor of Georgia, a major Baptist evangelist and a famous herb doctor led the cultural boom of the area. The final chapter of the declining village was after the Civil War when the maternal grandfather of Martin Luther King jr., A.D. Williams, struggled to feed his family as he learned to read and write and go onto ministerial training. .",
