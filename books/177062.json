  "title": "Jungle Man: An Autobiography of Major P.J. Pretorius",
  "description": "Pretorius began his career as an ivory hunter -- back in the 1890s when one could make a living at it, and almost two decades before the profession of white hunter was created. This book, first published in 1948, tells the story of this famed African adventurer in his own words.Responsible for finding and sinking the German warship Konigsberg during World War I, when Pretorius helped the South African government clear a huge number of rogue elephants in the Addo district, he cleaned them out so efficiently that it was decided to create a reserve and let the remainder live out their lives there; today that reserve is the Addo Elephant Park.",
