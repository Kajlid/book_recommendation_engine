  "title": "Navigating Genesis: A Scientist's Journey through Genesis 1-11",
  "description": "Is constructive integration of Genesis 1-11 with the current scientific knowledge possible? Everyone knows the Bible teaches scientific nonsense that s the commonly held misconception. When pushed for examples, skeptics point to the early part of Genesis, with stories of creation, the flood, and 900-year life spans as proof. Examining recent scientific discoveries, astronomer and pastor Dr. Hugh Ross explores the opening chapters in Genesis and shows how they hold some of the strongest scientific evidence for the Bible s supernatural accuracy. Navigating Genesis expands upon Ross earlier book The Genesis Question (1998), integrating the message of both the Bible and science without compromise giving skeptics and believers common ground for dialogue.",
