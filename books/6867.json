Never laughing, never crying, Cadence lives an existence that barely feels alive. She isn't the only one, her parents feel it too. When she meets handsome, mysterious Cole, he helps Cadence unlock the secrets that hide in her past, and the magic within her soul, allowing her to experience feelings of her own for the very first time. Bound to a destiny she didn't ask for, Cadence must face an evil she never dreamed possible, if she wants to find the missing piece of her broken heart.",
