  "description": "The drums boomed forth the incredible message from tribe to tribe—Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, had become an enemy to all, stealing and enslaving their women...even the daughter of an English millionaire, who offered a princely reward for her recapture and Tarzan's death. Certainly her captor told Sandra Pickerall that he was Tarzan...but he also told her he was God...Tarzan followed their trail with one thought in mind—to pursue and destroy utterly the man who had stolen his name and made it infamous in the jungle world he loved.",
