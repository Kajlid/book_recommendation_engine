  "title": "The Old Child and Other Stories",
  "description": "Written in spare, highly concentrated language, \"a sustained feat of verbal economy\" (Die Zeit), the one novella and four stories in The Old Child go beyond the limits of the expected, the real. Dark, serious, often mystical, these marvelous fictions about women’s lives provide glimpses into the minds of outcasts and eccentrics, at the same time bearing out Dostoevsky’s comment that hope can be found so long as a man can see even a tiny view of the sky.Contents:- The Story of the Old Child- The Sun-Flecked Shadows of My Skull- Sand- Hale and Hallowed- Siberia- Light a Fire or Leave",
