  "description": "The Warlock enslaves, seizes and terrorizes the eastern lands at the urging of the Five Sisters.\tWhere the sun rises from the south and the night is dotted with three moons, a young Nagling escapes her enslavers, and then ventures on a quest to free her people. While being stalked by an enigmatic and dangerous spirit, Ka enlists the help from a wanderer, a conjuror, two thieves, and a mercenary. On the journey, her presence invokes awe and hope from ordinary citizens, believing that the end of the Warlock's reign is close at hand. The thieves' persistent greed drives them to follow the young Nagling despite the horrors she awakens, and a Mercenary pursues cruel ambitions of his own above that greed. Usually isolated from other races, Ka learns the difference between \"what is said, what is read, and what is true.\" Behind the odd assortment of traveling companions, a tracker trails their course for a General who leads an army with a mind of it's own. Ka's ambition to save her people may change the course of the surrounding lands for all races in this alien world, but at what cost to herself and those around her.\tA hope lingers that these are the end of Dry Days.",
