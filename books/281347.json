  "description": "Your dead are our business.\n\nGot a loved one who’s passed? Want to ask your dead aunt where she hid that elusive will? Head over to Necro city and look no further than Soul Savers Inc. \n\n\nOne day the world was normal, and the next, it was filled with ghosts. And then the reapers came. Blood-sucking hot dudes with wings and wicked scythes.  They took control, and now we have a system.\nNow we have Necro city, the hub of all things untethered. \nAs a soul relocation agent, it’s my job to rehouse the dead until the reapers come to collect, but with so few of those dudes about, the wait isn’t pretty. Thank goodness for decent coffee, frosted donuts, and a pending promotion.\nThings are looking good until they’re not. \n\nOne bar fight and a dead reaper later, I’m left holding the scythe.\nNot just any scythe, but a scythe belonging to one of Lilith’s four favored sons—the most powerful reapers in the world.For some reason, it’s chosen me.Now, three very large, very pissed off reapers are on my case.It looks like that promotion is going to have to wait.\n\n\n\nA kickass Urban fantasy with a why choose romance. Vampires, ghosts, angels, and demons. Perfect for readers who enjoy forbidden romance, enemies to lovers, or friends to lovers.",
