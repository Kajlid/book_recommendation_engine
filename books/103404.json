  "description": "Americans have made it perfectly clear they do not want Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs touched by Congress. If you are concerned about Social Security, Medicare, Unemployment Compensation, Pell Grants, Food Stamps and other social programs, this book is a must-read for you. Byron Goines explains in detail the effect social programs have on the stimulation of the economy while at the same time helping those who are in need, and he explains the word \"entitlement,\" which some have attempted to turn into a bad word when in reality it is a good word. Have you heard the words \"trickle-down economics\" in reference to the Republican Party ideological mindset? Byron Goines explains trickle-down (supply-side) economics and trickle-up (demand-side) economics in detail along with other important topics. Which political party follows the example of Jesus Christ concerning these issues and others that are important to the American people? Find out as Byron Goines examines the tenets of Jesus Christ and performs a comparative analysis to determine which political party follows the example of Jesus Christ.",
