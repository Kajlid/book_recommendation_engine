  "description": "Rachel's Holiday, by bestselling British author Marian Keyes (author of \nLucy Sullivan Is Getting Married\n and \nWatermelon)\n, is a poignant, madcap story of life in the fast lane. Rachel Walsh (the wild younger sister of the heroine of Watermelon) is living in New York, working hard and playing harder. For Rachel, every night is a party, until she makes what she calls a stupid little mistake. If her overindulgence had only involved a little too much to drink and an attempt to write poetry, no one would have been alarmed. But the addition of a few sleeping pills adds up to what the hospital calls an overdose. Rachel's New York friends call it just plain stupid, and her loving family calls it a disaster. After the ER docs pump her stomach and her boyfriend dumps her, the Walsh clan hustles their wild child onto the first plane back to Ireland, where they've booked her into the Cloisters, a drug treatment center. Rachel would be the first to agree she needs a holiday, but she finds the Cloisters is no celebrity spa. In fact, it's definitely no holiday for Rachel to face hard facts, battle her demons, and get her life back on track. Rachel's Holiday is tough, tender and funny all at once, with a wild, wonderful love story to sweeten the mix.",
