  "description": "Watching someone you love self-destruct hurts. Praying for Your Addicted Loved 90 in 90 provides ninety devotions of strength, hope, and encouragement to families coping with addiction. Realizing you're not alone in your struggles brings comfort and confidence to face day-to-day challenges. The overall message of Praying for Your Addicted Loved One conveys hope to families caught in the cycles of addiction. The various stages of the abuse, recovery, and relapse, take their toll on families. Hopelessness grabs a family's heart and wrings it out with each slip of clean or sober time. The verses in Jeremiah 30 and 31, the foundation of the book, offer promises of restoration and redemption. 90 in 90 reflects the 12 Step model of attending 90 meetings in 90 days. While your loved one attends meetings, you will read a daily devotional to lend spiritual support. \"Today I pray for other lost addicts to find the hope of recovery. I pray the families reading this book will continue to have hope that an addict-any addict-can stop using drugs and find a new way to live. If there is one thing I can say to family members it is, never quit fighting. There is always hope. With hope, I, a once hopeless dope addict, am now a dope-less hope addict.\" Josh Cosby",
