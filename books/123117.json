  "description": "Habaek, the mysterious Water God, is cursed to live his days in the form of a little boy-while he turns back to his true adult self at night. His new human bride, Soah, thinks that she's been married to a child and has no idea that the attractive \"Mui\" is actually the adult Habaek. Surrounded by a cast of colorful elemental gods and their servants, Soah is tempted by flirtations from both \"Mui\" and the rascal Huye. When Tae-eul-jin-in spills Habaek's surprising secret, Soah audaciously plots to uncover the truth for herself. She has to be careful, though, so she doesn't anger the moody gods-including her powerful, new husband!",
