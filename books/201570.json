  "description": "The Letherii Empire is in turmoil. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, while the Errant, once a farseeing god, appears suddenly blind to the future. And the venal self-serving courtiers who claim the emperor's ear seem intent on waging all-out war against the empire's neighbours.And there is the matter of the Edur fleet that draws ever closer. Amongst its warriors are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer, and their presence alone means that blood will be spilled. But a small band of fugitives seeks a way out. One of their company, Fear Sengar, hunts the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye, for with his help they might halt the Tiste Edur and save the emperor, his brother. However Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake, also travels with them. He bears scars made by the blades of Scabandari, and seeks revenge. There wll be a reckoning - and it will be on an unimaginable scale...",
