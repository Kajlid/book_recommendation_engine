  "description": "I'm supposed to marry a woman I've never met, make her my 'ol lady and all that. This deal was struck when I was a kid playing with toy trucks in my front yard. Hell, Octavia wasn't even born yet.  Everything changed when the Raiders MC started getting picked off one by one. Her sisters were all murdered, including the woman I was supposed to marry. Now Octavia, is the only one left and she's not exactly keen on uprooting her life and moving to Montana.  Either way, we don't have the option to throw in the towel and say fuck it. I'm just gonna have to make the best of it, even if she fights me every step of the way.",
