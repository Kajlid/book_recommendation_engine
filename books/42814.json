  "description": "When shy, troubled Anna reluctantly attends an exclusive fetish event, she catches the eye of domineering but sensitive Oscar. Soon he's introducing her to the pleasures of kneeling at his feet and being soundly spanked across his knee. And then there's the state-of-the-art dungeon awaiting her in the basement of his luxury London home. Manacled, whipped and used in every orifice, Anna believes she is at last learning what it truly means to be loved. But what will her nosy friend Cleo and her boss, playboy philanthropist Nigel Duneden, make of Anna's descent into an orgy of masochism?",
