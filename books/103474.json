  "description": "When Danni Montgomery - a survivor of a rebel raid on an African village fifteen years earlier - had been rescued from the grips of Obasanji, the rebel leader of that army, she'd thought she'd lost her soul forever. Now, a new fear lurks within the confines of her world. Danni receives a cryptic letter written by her uncle Roland, her only living relative, who has mysteriously disappeared somewhere deep within the African Congo. The letter speaks of a fantastic discovery, one that will change the fate of the troubled United States from China's imminent attack. A rare earth element known as Promethium, the missing element needed for the completion of Viper 6, an unprecedented stealth missile that will shift the position of world leader back to the United States. Now, Danni is leading a team of mercenaries of her own, led by the charming and all-to-perfect Kayden Moreau, on a journey into the harsh, remote corners of the Congo. A journey where Danni makes a phenomenal discovery of her own. While searching for her uncle and his remarkable find, Danni comes face to face with the demon of her nightmares, and learns he is the only one who can help find her uncle and save her country. Consumed by hatred, Danni must make a choice: in order to secure the safety of her uncle and the fate of the United States, she must decide if she will forgive the man who murdered her mother and changed her life forever, or will her desire for revenge prove stronger than she can bear...",
