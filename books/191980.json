  "description": "(This is the first volume of the book series On the earth. Other volumes are in pipeline.) This book series is intended to provoke consciousness toward the feeling of human being attached with day to day incidences. Sometimes mankind cannot follow or do the right, even after knowing the right or wrong. Like Karna, Bhisma and Duryodhan (Characters of the world’s great epic ‘Mahabhart’) mankind finds himself prisoned in some type of virtual fear or compulsion. Human justifies itself by telling it practical and this practical act might have saved the individual person, but dragged the universe near its end. Till yet the something is left in the world which is not corrupted by this practical thought and perhaps the ‘Prabuddh’ (leading character of the novel) might be successful to find it.",
