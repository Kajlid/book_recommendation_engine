  "description": "A brash bounty hunter and an energetic elementary school teacher is the murder-solving team no one asked for, but they're stuck together, come hell or high tide until a killer is found in this spicy rom-com with a brand new bonus novella from Tessa Bailey, #1 New York Times bestselling author of It Happened One Summer . It was supposed to be a relaxing vacation in sweet, sunny Cape Cod—just Taylor Bassey and her beloved brother—but discovering a corpse in their rental house has really thrown a wrench into their tanning schedule. Now a rude, crude bounty hunter has arrived on the back of his motorcycle to catch the killer and refuses to believe Taylor can be helpful, despite the countless hours she’s spent listening to true crime podcasts. Not to mention her fulfilling teaching career of wrangling second graders. Myles Sumner is only there to do a job, not babysit an amateur sleuth. Although…it is becoming less and less of a hardship to have Taylor around. Sure, she’s stubborn, distracting and can’t stay out of harm’s way. She’s also brave and beautiful and reminds him of home. In other words, the insatiable hunger and protectiveness she’s awakening is a threat to his peace of mind. Before Myles sinks any deeper into this dangerous attraction, he needs to solve the murder and get back on the road. Only now there are two threats—and the biggest one is to his heart.",
