He suddenly finds that fragile truce threatened from without by an unknown enemy and from within by old hatreds and prejudice. With the aid of his true-friend Colath, the wizard Jareth and the elven archer Jalila, he goes in search of the source of the threat. Ailith, the Heir to Riverford - fights her own silent battle. Her father has changed, something's wrong. But her quest to discover what has changed puts her life and very soul in danger and leaves her only one direction in which to turn. Elon. To preserve the alliance, though, Elon may have to choose between his honor, his duty and the soul-bond he has awaited for centuries.",
