Well, here’s your chance to find out…  Follow the lives of Kane, Cody, Emmaline, Anna, Dakota, Kellen, Bryce, and Amalia as they navigate their way through the minefield of lies, secrets, and deception on their road to what they hope is a happy ending.  Learning from their parents before them what not to do, they all believed they were clever enough not to fall into the same traps. However, what they didn’t take into account was no two stories are ever the same, and that no less applied to them than anyone else. Realizing quickly that it’s the journey they take to get to the end that matters the most some decide to give up and enjoy the ride, but others…Well, others have a harder time of accepting their fate that awaits them at the finish line.  “Sometimes you put walls up not to keep people out, but to see who cares enough to break them down.” - Socrates  *This book is an extended length novel as it covers four couples in total. It is written in two parts and contain an intermission in the middle. At approx. 400 pages, and 126,000 words, this is a compelling, nail biting read for the current die-hard readers of the previous Devil's Spawn MC novels, and an excellent insight into the MC for all those new readers out there.* Monica Langley Holloway, Illustrator",
