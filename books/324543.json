  "title": "My Graphic Bipolar Fantasies: & Other Short Stories",
  "description": "This book is the product of a sick mind; a product of the \"Southern Madman.\" There are 104 Fantasies inside that are not based in reality, interspersed with 70 Short Stories of somewhat sane thought of heavy opinion. The theme of the Fantasies is Law and Order and the author and the good guys always win. In a few places, it is quite tame. In most of the others, it is twisted, gruesome, bloody, and void of any empathy. Read at your own peril, but remember, it is mainly a book of fiction, and no one really dies. This book is not a template for murder, but the thoughts do arise in the mind of the author and as far as the author knows, someone can not be put away for their thoughts.",
