She'll be a senior in high school this fall and after that, college beckons. Yep, life is perfect, except for one small little she's in love with her best friend, Jacob Bennett. Everybody thought that she had gotten over her silly crush on Jacob ever since tenth grade. In a way, they were right; but what she didn't realize was that even though she managed to convince herself she was over him, the feelings that still remained were more than just friendship. Helplessly trapped with her feelings, how can she ever tell Jacob how much she loves him without ruining what they already have?
