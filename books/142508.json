  "description": "NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR, ELLE CASEY, brings readers PART 4 in the 6-part contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT.[This book is PART 4. Readers should begin by reading PARTS 1-3 first.] Jennifer doesn't know who to believe, but the lipstick on William's neck is just a little too red to ignore, much as he might like her to. The more she tries to make sense of the stories, the more it feels like she's repeating mistakes from her past, and that's something she wants to avoid at all costs, no matter how much it might hurt. William does what he can to juggle all the secrets, stories, and his brother's antics, but in the end it proves to be his undoing. Following Edward's advice, he takes a chance and reveals things he'd really rather keep to himself. Whether the risk and the fallout will be worth the price he must pay remains to be seen.This ebook is Part 4 of the contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT, approximately 24,000 words or 95 paper pages long. The story continues with Parts 5-6.Content warning: Due to sexy situations and content, this book is definitely not appropriate for younger readers.A note from Elle about this series: Hello readers! I had such a great time writing this serial. Like you, I had no idea what was going to happen from one part to the next. I didn't even know how many parts there would be. It was great having all the feedback from my readers as each part was released; it definitely influenced the end result. Edward's story, JUST ONE WEEK, is coming soon in 2016.
