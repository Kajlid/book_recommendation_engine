  "description": "After the death of her mother, the last thing seventeen-year-old Charlotte O'Dell wants to do is spend the summer on Angel Island with her family. Her younger sister hates her, and her dad is lost in his own little world. It's a recipe for a disastrous summer on the island...until Ezra Rhodes walks into her life. The boy next door helps Charlotte forget her almost paralyzing fear of really living her life. After taking care of her mother in her last months, Charlotte is drowning, numb to everything but her own grief and anger. With Ezra, she feels something again, and as he repairs her family's summer home, she dares to think he might actually be fixing her, too. Ezra challenges Charlotte to leave her comfort zone, and as their friendship slowly blossoms into more, Charlotte begins to come alive again.But Ezra has secrets...secrets he isn't sharing with Charlotte. Between that and the growing tension with her family, Charlotte can't help but feel there's a storm on the horizon. And she isn't sure if they can weather it unscathed.",
