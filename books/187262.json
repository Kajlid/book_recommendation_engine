Carmen might hold a position of power within the pack, but part of her always wonders if they could turn on her as quickly as they did him.

He couldn’t stand to watch other wolves happily carrying on with their lives and mates after he’d failed to protect his own.

When one headstrong and opinionated she-wolf decides she’s going to end the unique hell of his isolation, Seth has to make a choice…Kick her butt to the curb or answer the call to claim her. But can he dare claim another mate when he knows he failed once to be the man his mate needed?",
