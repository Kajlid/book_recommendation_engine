  "description": "The hearing and deaf worlds come together in this engaging novel from an award-winning author. A young artist badly in need of money bluffs her way through an interview into a job she is not prepared for. To succeed, she must make room in her life for two Curtis, a deaf architect who has sworn he will never date a hearing woman, and thirteen-year-old Alex, profoundly deaf, rebellious, bold, and frightened.  With sign language--nimble and evocative--at its center, Turn On the Light So I Can Hear is about reaching across distances, the transformative powers of art, and finding a place to belong. Teri Kanefield's awards and distinctions include the 2015 Jane Addams Peace Association Book Award for The Girl From The Tar Paper School.",
