  "description": "Lisa Yee returns to her core strength in older middle-grade fiction and the characters that made her famous in this \"Diary of a Wimpy Trekkie.\" Entering 7th grade is no big deal for Marley Sandelski: Same old boring classes, same old boring life. The only thing he has to look forward to is the upcoming Star Trek convention. But when he inadvertently draws the attention of Digger Ronster, the biggest bully in school, his life has officially moved from boring to far too dramatic . . . from invisible to center stage.",
