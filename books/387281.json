  "description": "Houston nightclub Rave is famous for nearly-naked male dancers and beautiful bartenders. It's a club for hedonists and playboys. Like Peter, a young man with a strict rule about one-night stands. He breaks that rule for Lucien, the owner of The Den, a rival gay nightclub where there are no boundaries, no taboos.Anything goes at The Den, including vampires. When Peter finds out about Lucien's vampire nature, he figures he should have stuck to his rule. He's not a vampire fan, after all, and Lucien pulls him into a dark world of vampires, werewolves and feuding in-laws. Peter resists Lucien as long as he can, but when he gives in, he does it in a big way.Peter and Lucien begin a very dangerous dance of sensual heat and deep emotion, one that causes them nothing but trouble. No one approves of the human and vampire match, including the Council, old enemies and even older friends. Peter and Lucien have to struggle to stay together and protect those they love. Can they beat the forces that will try to tear them apart forever? And can they face what will become of Peter if they stay together?",
