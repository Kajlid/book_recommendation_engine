  "description": "When I arrive back at the city dome with Omari in tow, I know it's going to be a challenge. My life isn't exactly ideal for a child, but I'm determined to make it work. I'm resourceful and reasonably intelligentâ€”I'll figure it out.  Right?  But then my already risky life starts to turn even riskier. A job goes wrong. It happens. I shrug it off. But then another goes sideways soon after the first. And then things really start to hit the fan.  I've never been without my fair share of enemies but this is ridiculous!  And then I have to deal with Ashur when he gets wind of what's going on and shows up to insist I come back with him to the safety of his territory.  To make matters worse, Ashur doesn't exactly get along with my friend, Jacob. Never mind that they're both just trying to keep me safe.  I dig in my heels, despite everything. I'm determined to stay, to get to the bottom of what's going on. Nobody is going to drive me out of my home if I can help it.  But things sure are complicated when there's a pissed off Dragon Lord, an ex-mercenary, and a six year old involved.",
