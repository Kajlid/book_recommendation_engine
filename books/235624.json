  "title": "Sin & Silver",
  "description": "I have known since I was four years old that demons cannot invade hallowed ground because my mother stashed me in a church the night one of those evil SOBs killed her. What I didn’t know, twenty years later, was whether a designated wedding chapel counted.But I was tear-assing down a side street in Vegas, heading straight toward an Elvis wedding drive-through, about to find out. Blaize Silver has spent her entire life training to hunt demons and monsters. Now she carries the family curse that keeps her confined to the southwestern United States—and a craving to see the rest of the world.Only one thing stands between Blaize and freedom: the slick bastard of a demon who crafted the curse.And now that she’s found him, she’s ready to rain hellfire down on all of Las Vegas to take him down.Unless, of course, he gets to her first.",
