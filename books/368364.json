  "description": "It's Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and all the Empire is preparing to celebrate. But between suffragists, assassins, submariners, Scots impersonators, by-elections, and aunts, having a quiet holiday is proving to be a tricky matter for Elliott Graven and Paisley DeLoup. And with Alexander Graham Bell hosting a meeting that threatens to plunge the world into war (not to mention making romance dashed difficult), it's all Elliott and Paisley can do to keep their heads above water. Especially after their ship sinks.Latest review:\"Fun reading that will delight fans of Phillip Pullman...\"-Lois McNicol, TriState Reviews (Oct 28, 2011) http://tristatereviews.blogspot.com/2...",
