  "description": "Will her need to do the right thing cost them everything? Book Four of the Hearts of the South series. Public Defender Autry Holton, honor-bound to defend an accused serial killer, is in a \"shunned if she does, disbarred if she doesn't\" position. To complicate matters, she's pregnant and hasn't yet told her ex-lover he's the father. The reason? She's pretty sure he won't want the baby. After raising one family and suffering a failed marriage, Sheriff Stanton Reed never believed he was the right man for Autry. Then an attempted break-in at Autry's home highlights the real danger she faces, and all he can think of is protecting her. When she tells him the truth about their baby, the past doesn't matter. He wants both her and their child in his life. But just as Autry dares to hope there's a future for them, an act of homegrown terrorism shatters her trust-and threatens their lives. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, language, violence.",
