  "description": "Everyone thinks Luna Harvey is a good girl, but she has a dark secret. She’s a kleptomaniac. For years, Luna has managed to keep her secret from everyone, until one day she slips up and almost gets caught. Fortunately, Grey Sawyer steps in and saves her from getting into trouble. Grey Sawyer is one of the most popular guys in school and hasn’t always been nice to Luna. While she’s grateful he helped her out, Luna worries he’ll tell everyone her secret and her good girl reputation will be ruined. Grey understands Luna’s situation more than she realizes, though, because he has a secret of his own. One he desperately wants to tell Luna. But with their rocky past, he knows he’ll have to get her to trust him first and show Luna he’s not the guy he used to be.",
