  "description": "On Halloween, a strange carnival comes to town. The gates open at sunset, and the attractions are all one of a kind: faery magic under the big top, masked demons on the midway, carnies greeting crowds with sharp-toothed smiles. Those who go and come back have tales to tell that linger with them long after the carnival is gone. Those who go and never come back... well. There are stories that linger about them, too.Monsters, magic and mischief abound in these thirteen short stories about the Midnight Carnival.",
