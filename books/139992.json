  "description": "Sometimes the gift of the right story to tell at the right time is a blessing. Sometimes it's a curse. But the Norse gods don't leave Astrid much choice, either way.On the eve of a desperate battle, with her father lying mortally wounded, the gods give her a story about the first dragon to learn to breathe fire. As usual, the story doesn't come with instructions. It's up to Astrid to decide if the story is meant to calm the frightened children or encourage the dispirited men. Or if she just might be able to do both with the same story. All their lives may depend on her skill with a story.",
