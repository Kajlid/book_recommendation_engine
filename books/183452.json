  "description": "The Ice Maiden by Sally Wentworth released on Dec 25, 1979 is available now for purchase.\"Computer matching works, you'll see!\" Her roommates were enthralled with the idea of the experiment, but Gemma wasn't sure. It didn't seem right to cold-bloodedly plot another person's falling in love. Gemma liked it even less after they had done the computer analysis of Paul Verignac, and the results showed that she was the best suited to be the bait. But her moral reservations disappeared after she'd met him. Good looks, arrogance and conceit were a rankling combination. He deserved to have the tables turned on him!",
