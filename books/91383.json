  "description": "Has this Caffarelli finally met his match? Millionaire playboy Raoul Caffarelli has always lived life in the fast lane. But when an accident confines him to a wheelchair--and to the care of a woman whose beauty taunts him--he's consumed with rage and frustration.Used to difficult patients, physical therapist Lily Archer won't be cowed by Raoul's arrogance or distracted by his Adonis-like physique. Carrying her own scars from the past, Lily has vowed never to relinquish her power to a man again.Both underestimate the power of the shared passion between them. Their physical scars may heal, but some wounds run much deeper....ReviewMilburne's sweet tale shows the healing power of love. Her narrative showcases the lavish vistas, and her couple meshes nicely and is aided by a cast of perfect co-stars.~ RT Book Reviews ~From the AuthorIt would have been easy (buttotally unrealistic) to get Raoul out of the chair by the end of the book. Hehad an important lesson to learn and the only way he could learn it was byaccepting his physical limitations. For those of you who want to know how hisrehab went watch out for next month's Never Gamble With A Caffarelli whereyou will find out! Lily has her own deeplypersonal issues, ones that a lot of young women (and increasingly young men)have to deal with. Her time with the brooding but utterly delicious Raoul helpher finally accept her past and move forward. I hope you enjoy Never Underestimate A Caffarelli and find the theme of emotional healing Ihave explored a meaningful one.",
