  "description": "A young farmer brings his toy barnyard to life in Jane Cowen-Fletcher’s idyllic celebration of the innocence and wonder of childhood.Will loves farm animals. He loves to say, Neigh! Moo! Baa! and Wink! He has a special farmer’s hat and his own little horse, cow, sheep, and pig. His family calls him Farmer Will. The author-illustrator of the best-selling BABY ANGELS brings her gentle focus to a familiar image of childhood — that of a child engaged in imaginary play with favorite toys. Sparely, eloquently told, and illustrated in the soft colors of a country springtime, this book will speak volumes to young children who are devoted to their toys, and who know how to live and play in the world of the imagination.",
