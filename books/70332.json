  "description": "Book of the Sky God was originally published as a single volume, but in 2014 it was divided into Volume 1 and Volume 2. This edition is no longer available.The clock is ticking down to the Day of Judgment. The ancient gods are on their way back to Earth, and they're not pleased. Humans have made a big mess of the planet, and the gods have a plan to set things right---by changing time itself so that humans never existed. A powerful secret society is looking forward to the Day of Judgment. Theyâ€™ve been preparing for generations to steal the divine power for themselves. Once they become as powerful as the gods, they will make everyone else their slaves. When five unlikely teens discover that the gods are returning to judge humanity, they must race against time and across two continents to try to save the world. The fate of the past, present and future rests in their hands. No biggie.",
