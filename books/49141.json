  "description": "North Korea is isolated, hungry, bankrupt, and belligerent. Its also armed with nuclear weapons. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people are being held in its political prison camps, which have existed twice as long as Stalins Soviet gulags and twelve times as long as the Nazi concentration camps. Very few born and raised in these camps have escapedbut Shin Dong-hyuk did.In Escape from Camp 14, acclaimed journalist Blaine Harden tells the story of Shin Dong-hyuk and, through the lens of Shins life, unlocks the secrets of the worlds most repressive totalitarian state. Shin knew nothing of civilized existence: he saw his mother as a competitor for food, guards raised him to be a snitch, and he witnessed the execution of his family. Through Hardens harrowing narrative of Shins life and remarkable escape, he offers an unequaled inside account of one of the worlds darkest nations and a riveting tale of endurance, courage, and survival.",
