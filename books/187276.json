  "description": "A Mississippi Bluff is a Texas Hold ’Em poker strategy, seventy-five percent bluffing and twenty-five percent odds. Jo Lane doesn’t gamble on anything but love and her life. In the past, gambling on love has been a no-win for her. However, she’ll have to bluff her way out to win the latest game on her life.  With a deranged clown and a contract assassin after her, the odds don’t look good for the young Special Agent Lane. The clown is seeking revenge—but for whom? The contract assassin is desperate to get his hands on something in Jo’s lost airline luggage. The assassin plans to take her out of the picture as soon as he gets his hands on it—but who hired him?  Sam Hunter is new in town. He’s looking for his missing young niece, April, and requests Jo’s help in finding her. After much thought, she agrees to try to tap into her God-given ability to locate April. The more she digs into April’s history, the more confused Jo becomes. Something isn’t adding up—but what?  Jo’s love life takes a toll on her emotions, leaving her heartbroken. After she’s made up her mind that she’s through with the game of love, a new player sits down at the table, and he’s all in. Is she willing to take the risk and bet it all, or will she fold and walk away?  The stakes are high in Mississippi Bluff, the third book in A Southern Country Novel series.",
