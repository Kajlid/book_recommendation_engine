  "description": "There are some choices no parent should ever have to make  Nikki Grant has her whole life ahead of her when she discovers she is pregnant. But she welcomes the news with joy—the baby will be a wonderful addition to the happy household she shares with the love of her life, Spencer James, and three close friends. Nikki's parents have a very different view of what the baby is going to mean to their daughter's future. Deeply disapproving of Spencer and the friends Nikki has chosen, their frustrations reach breaking point when Nikki refuses to be controlled by them any more. A rift opens up between them that breaks their hearts, but they are all too proud to back down. Baby Zac arrives, and with Spencer's career taking off they are ready to make a big move to London. But sudden events rush them down a very different road, and nothing could have prepared them for where they find themselves—a frightening and alien place with Zac at the center and Nikki desperately trying to hold onto her baby, her life, and her dreams. As they become more embroiled in a world they cannot escape, the love between Nikki and her son is put to the kind of test no parent should ever have to face.",
