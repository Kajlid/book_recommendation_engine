Why is Gandhi's role in history under threat? And has an ancient, all-powerful god of destruction really come back to wreak his vengeance upon the Earth?The Doctor and Donna travel back in time to India, 1947 - the latest in the bestselling series of Doctor Who novels.Featuring the Doctor and Donna as played by David Tennant and Catherine Tate in the hit series from BBC Television.",
