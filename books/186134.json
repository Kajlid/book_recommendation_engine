  "description": "The minute any woman walks into my bar, I can tell two things about her: what she wants to drink, and how she likes to f*ck.I’m Cash: bartender at the hottest bar in Atlanta. I’ve got girls lining up around the block, and they all know the rules: no strings, no promises, and no morning-after snuggling. You want brunch? Call your sister. You want the best sex of your life? Call me. Or better yet, just drop by the bar anytime. Clothing optional.There’s a reason they call me a sexy bastard. And yes, I really am that good.",
