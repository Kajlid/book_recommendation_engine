  "description": "\"Vivid and touching, Aloha Joe in Hawaii is a rare type of book that not only educates, but also moves.\" - Any Subject Books This book is the sunny and inspiring tale of someone who refuses to be defeated by the adversities in his life. Scarred by a childhood of abuse, by injury and trauma as a Sergeant in the U.S. Marines and by a totally fortuitous hit-and-run accident, he finally takes his life into his own hands and moves to the 'Big Island' of Hawaii which has a reputation for offering a healing lifestyle. Immersed in a jungle environment where geckos are his companions and he can forage for fruit every day to make his breakfast smoothies, he gradually slows to the pace of island life. He abandons tv, and instead listens to the sound of the rain on the roof. He learns how to greet and be greeted according to the beautiful customs of the island's inhabitants, enjoys local food and allows serendipity to guide him. Joe's book is not just an account of his own life experiences. He is at the same time imparting his attractive and compelling philosophy of life which might be summarized in his words: \"Give yourself permission to live the life that you have always wanted to live.\" It may mean selling your possessions and moving to the place of your dreams to engage in a simple way of life, but following your heart is more important than anything else. Some of the areas of the Big Island covered are Hilo, Ke'eau, Puna, Pahoa, Kalapana, Red Road, Vacationland, Volcano, Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, South Kohala Coast, Waikoloa, Discovery Harbor, and more!",
