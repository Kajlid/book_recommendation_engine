  "description": "Rob Turner is a big city detective who leads a double life. On the surface he's a cocky, high-profile and successful public servant. On the inside he's a diseased man obsessed with dark sexual addictions. He's already hip deep in a fierce battle of wills when he finds himself, by way of his ex-wife, thrown into a bizarre rogue investigation born from a doomed airliner's black box. He must now run head-long into places he's tried all too often to run from. The closer he gets to the root of this ad hoc probe, the deeper it cuts into his own plagued psyche. Before he knows it, doors he's dared open in the past, sandwich him between doors newly entered. Now sex, murder and blackmail are attacking this detective's already tormented soul from every direction, and time is not his friend.",
