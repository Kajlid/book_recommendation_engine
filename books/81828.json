  "title": "On a Scale of One to Marcus: Altar Boy to Bad Boy to Lost Soul",
  "description": "Mid-life crisis seems harsh, and judgmental. D.O. Pelganger much prefers Mid-Life ENLIGHTENMENT, especially when the protagonist's, (Marcus) lessons are so diverse and entertaining! The Great Recession, Iraq, Afghanistan, and The Virgin Islands, are the backdrop for life's lessons on \"Living the Dream,\" strippers, internet dating sites, drugs, hookers, everyday scams, and women! Women who are kind enough to share in educational detail why their sexcapades with Marcus were so satisfying and fun! You might call it \"50 Shades of Pink.\" Women have had their tales of lust and erotica blended into the shady love story of a billionaire and pretty young co-ed. Now men can enjoy racy and educational tales set in real life politics, island paradises and war zones. The reader of Marcus's tales may identify with the struggles of The Great Recession, but will certainly learn much about pleasing women, and understanding the scams that \"The Man\" is frequently perpetrating.",
