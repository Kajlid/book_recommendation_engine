  "description": "My mother says trouble began the day I was born, but I’d disagree. I think trouble started the day I crashed my broomstick into an undercover cop car.My name is Ainsley Shaw, and I’m a Guardian Witch. The title sounds fancier than it is—really, I’m a glorified bodyguard for magical people. I love my job, and I’m good at it… most days.Except today. While I was flying around town on my broomstick thinking about life, love, and the latest episode of The Bachelor, I zoned out and ran smack dab into the taillights of a speeding police cruiser. Unfortunately, the man inside was a human cop, which made explaining how I appeared from thin air in the middle of a crime scene a bit of a challenge.Now, the police think I’m trouble—not least of all Detective Hotterson, the one responsible for denting my shiny new broomstick. Which means that if I can’t find the real bad guys before I’m put in jail, I’ll be locked away for a crime I didn’t commit.However, when magic is involved, things are never as simple as they appear...** ** ** **This is a full length, humorous cozy mystery complete with magic, romance, and suspense. So grab your broomstick, hold on tight, and join Ainsley for the ride!",
