  "description": "They hired me to keep her safe. I never planned to give her a baby.   My job was to do what I do best. Watch my target. Protect them at all costs. Kill anyone who gets in my way. My weapon of choice? Anything with a sharp edge. But the second I see my newest client, I know I'm in trouble. The pain in her eyes, her sinful body, those sky-high, take-me-hard, spiked heels I can't ignore. In one night, we share more than I thought possible. Our secrets. Our torments. Her bed. I never expected she'd give me so much more. Until I find out she's having my baby. Then out of nowhere, the threat of danger becomes real. But I'm ready. I'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe, even if it means laying down my own life.  Warning. This dark and dirty romance is steamy, dangerous, and swoon-worthy. If you like slightly over the top romance stories with a dominant alpha male, this is for you! Standalone romance with no cliffhanger and a naughty happily ever after to give you all the feels.",
