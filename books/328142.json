He leased a cabin upstate, closed his Manhattan apartment and resolved to find, if nothing else, some peace. However, an unexpected friendship with his new neighbor quickly turns into a crisis of identity surpassing any turmoil he's ever endured. Ridge Garrett brings out emotions and desires Jason can't understand. His unprecedented attraction to another man isn't helped by Ridge's fierce sexuality and persistent seduction. What begins as a painful period of self-discovery, rapidly evolves into a passionate affair and swift plunge into love. Jason finds true happiness finally within his reach. He'll have to overcome his destructive inner demons, and the dangers of a powerful Garrett family enemy willing to kill in order to keep that happiness. Until You is a candid, emotional story about learning self-acceptance and the inestimable value of family, desire between two devoted people, and love without boundaries of gender.
