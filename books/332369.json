  "description": "Entrepreneurs who are facing challenges with growing their businesses often face the same issues that impede their growth. Many entrepreneurs believe that to grow their businesses, they must work harder and harder. They overlook the importance of the team, the financials, and a solid plan that must be executed and adjusted on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. They don’t understand the concept of working “on the business” because they are too often working – harder and harder – “in the business”, creating another job for themselves instead of rising to leadership and orchestrating a well-run business. Vision to Reality provides a simple set of steps to help entrepreneurs realize their vision for their business and “clear the fog” for everyone involved to get on board with executing the vision. The goal of Vision to Reality is to help entrepreneurs clear the fog for themselves and their business, giving them confidence that they can tackle problems head-on despite the problems appearing insurmountable. It is unique and appealing because it introduces a new opportunity, using simple but effective foundational principles and tools often overlooked by entrepreneurs in their quest for business success.",
