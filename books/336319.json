  "description": "I’ve had a crush on my best friend’s older brothers for as long as I can remember . . . long before they made a fortune designing high-end homes, and their success puts them even further out of my league.Being the bratty friend of their little sister never gave me much appeal. Dropping out of college and working, temporarily, as a maid doesn’t exactly sweeten the deal either.Or does it?When opportunity presents itself, will I risk losing my best friend by cozying up to her brothers?If you love dirty-talking men who have over-the-top ideas of how to please their woman and want to give her babies, these guys are ready to snuggle up with you in the middle!",
