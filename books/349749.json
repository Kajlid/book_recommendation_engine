  "title": "Culture of Honor: Sustaining A Supernatural Environment",
  "description": "An environment that sustains life, hope, honor and destiny! In this powerful, revelation-packed book, Danny Silk describes the significant paradigm shift in church life, government, and relationships that has created and sustained the revival culture at Bethel Church in Redding, CA. Through many relevant and true-life stories, the church is revealed as a place of freedom, respect, empowerment, and healthy discipline (not punishment). Culture of Honor challenges the status quo of church leadership structure and presents a refreshing view of the five-fold ministry. Jesus acknowledged this important principle in Matthew 20:25-26: \"But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.\" If those with power learn how to empower those around them, then surely it will come to pass that, \"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.\" Today you can apply the truths revealed to relationships in your family, workplace, community, ministry, church--anywhere you deal with others.",
