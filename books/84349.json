  "description": "Clay can't sleep, he never could. Every night he'd close his eyes knowing the dreams would be waiting, but he couldn't quite understand them, making each night more restless than the last. Clay was desperate to find answers to his dreams, and his need to escape Dra√≠ochta was beginning to drive him mad. He badly missed his Brother and wanted to visit him, but deep down he knew the need to leave was about more than family. There was a void in him that was growing more painful with each passing day. Life should be perfect for the fourteen year old Prince. It wasn't. Glass Castles is the story of Clay, a prequel novella to my Fae-Witch Trilogy. See Ari through Clay's eyes, their day on the beach, and the events leading up to the moment that would change their lives, forever. It is meant to be read as the 4th and final in the series. Spoiler Alert: fair warning that if this short book is read before the Trilogy, you'll learn information meant to be revealed over time within the series.",
