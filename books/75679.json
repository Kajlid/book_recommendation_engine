  "description": "Winter is a harsh mistress and drives men to hunger, despair and death. When young hunters and Vierra meet over a prey just fallen, none of them understand the events they set in motion. For blood calls for blood even in the worst circumstances. Pure white of snow can be the deathbed for the feuders, lost in revenge. Part six of the Fargoer, a series of short stories set in mythic Viking Age.",
