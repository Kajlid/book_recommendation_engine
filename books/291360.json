  "description": "The Woods are Lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go, before I sleep —Robert Frost I was born under fire and swore to protect her until my dying day, I just never knew that one day, I'd be the very monster I was protecting her from. She didn't know it was me.She didn't know that I had no choice and would do it again and again to save her.I may as well have given her the mark on her finger.The one that shows where her loyalty must lie.Because we don't sin in silence.And eventually, you have to pay up what you owe.My need to protect her turned into a lie to save her.And when she found out—I turned in to the very monster I was trying to protect her from.Watching Violet Abandonato walk out of my life was like a knife to the chest, a wound that refused to heal.The bosses sent me to protect her, to watch over her even though I was the demon she fled.We both carry scars.But if all I can have is her hate for as long as I breathe.I'll take it.Because at the end of the day, I should burn in Hell forever thinking Chase Abandonato's perfect angel would pick me—over her perfect life.\"I broke you,\" I confessed.\"The worst part… is that you liked it,\" she snapped right back. Welcome to the second generation of the mafia, may the best man or woman, be left standing.May God bless our tainted souls.",
