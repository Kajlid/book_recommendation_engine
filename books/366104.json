  "description": "If Howard had known the old hag was a witch, he never would have taunted her. But he did, and she did what witches do--cursed him--and now he's a goose, which to tell you the truth, is not as serene and peaceful as it might look from the shore. People try to kill geese, for crying out loud, and the other geese are none too nice to newcomers. Howard is desperate to become a human again so he can show that old witch a thing or two.But the only way to break the curse is to do three good deeds--and how can you help others when you've got webbed feet, wings for hands, and can't say anything but \" Honk \"?",
