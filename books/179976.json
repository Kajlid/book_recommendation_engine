  "description": "It was just a trip before college. Build schools in a Central American village; get to know some of the other freshmen. But after tragedy strikes, a handful of once-privileged US teens must find their way home in a cruel landscape that at best doesn't like them, and at worst, actively wants to kill them. And then, of course, there are the secrets the kids are keeping from each other. From third-grade spelling bee champ Alex de Campi (Archie vs Predator, Grindhouse) and Eisner/LA Times Book Award winner Carla Speed McNeil (Finder) comes a highly episodic thriller of teenagers in peril.",
