  "description": "The Anarchist War is over. The bloodiest crusade in world history involved not soldiers, but citizens. In the wake of destruction, a new power emerged in America. The Dragoons. With new rulers came new rules, and disobeying them means death. Able to do the extraordinary, no one stands in their way. Brought together by a strange old man, the Sevens are tasked with the safety of those around them. Unaware of the secret struggles for power that exist, the real world will be a deadly awakening for the Sevens as they train their bodies, minds, and abilities.",
