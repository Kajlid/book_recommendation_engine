In this insightful book, each of the runes is fully described, together with the symbolic images and celestial phenomena associated with them. Methods of laying out or \"casting\" the runes are described in order to give a full and comprehensive reading to answer any question. There are six spreads to choose from, from Odinâ€™s Rune, a simple reading with one rune stone, to using up to nine runes for deeper insight into the past, present and future.",
