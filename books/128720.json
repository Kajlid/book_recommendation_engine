  "description": "Something evil is going on in the Montgomery Psychiatric Hospital; every time there is an unexplainable blackout, a patient dies. Callie isn't insane - she sees the ghost of her dead best friend only because he really is there. It's just that nobody believes her. Casey is scarred after a horrific attack during which he killed someone. Temporary insanity was his plea, and the asylum is his prison. With fear and death lurking everywhere, and no way to escape, Callie is certain it's only a matter of time before she or Casey, the odd boy she has an inexplicable link with, becomes the next victim of the creature in the shadows. Trapped in the asylum with a killer on the loose, there's plenty of reason to be afraid of the dark.",
