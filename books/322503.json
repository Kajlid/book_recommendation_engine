But, as he hunkered down with his family, literally dodging the German and Russian bullets piercing the gatekeeper’s house where they hid, survival became his only ambition. He lived through World War II only to be trapped behind the Iron Curtain, unable to realize any of his ambitions. Unwilling to accept the indignities of Communism and facing persecution in the aftermath of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, he was forced to flee his family, friends, and the only life he’d ever known. A refugee, Janos immigrated to America and became hard-working immigrant, popular foreign student, Hollywood actor and producer, aviator, skier, businessman, and successful entrepreneur. His utterly fascinating, harrowing, joyous journey is the true embodiment American Dream.",
