  "title": "On The Threshold: Home, Hardwood, and Holiness",
  "description": "\"A tremendously authentic and beautifully written book!\" --Paulette Bates Alden, author of Crossing the MoonFor readers of Kathleen Norris and Annie Dillard, Elizabeth Jarrett Andrew's On The Threshold is an intimate and unabashed portrait of the spiritual life. Drawing from the physical and spiritual terrain that she has inhabited throughout her life--predominantly around her home in Minneapolis, MN--the author leads the reader on the quest to feel at home with one's self and one's beliefs.With honesty, subtlety, and none of the spiritual platitudes that encumber many faith narratives, Andrew's meditations turn to the details of household maintenance--the cluttered pantry, the loose-screened porch, the dim bedroom--and neighborly relations to examine the sometimes empty, sometimes exuberant seasons of the spiritual life.Â  Occasionally whimsical, sometimes awed, always probing, these reflections model for us the possibility of leading a contemplative life in contemporary society.",
