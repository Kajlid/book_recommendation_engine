  "description": "The daughter of an infamous art forger, Chloe Somerton grew up poor. Desperate to aid her sisters, she'd picked a pocket…or two. Now circumstances have changed, and Chloe has a chance to marry a young, wealthy lord. Only his mentor—a dark, dangerous duke—stands in her way. The duke knows about her past, and she'll do anything to keep him from telling. The moment Michael Keswick, the Duke of Cameron, sees Chloe Somerton, he recognizes her as a fraud. The stunning beauty with sapphire eyes and golden hair now appears to be a proper lady, but he knows better. What begins as a battle of wills soon escalates into a fierce attraction. In Chloe, Michael finds peace from the memories of war, but he refuses to marry…and she won't settle for anything less. Each book in the Infamous Somertons series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.Series Book #1 An Artful SeductionBook #2 Real Earls Break the RulesBook #3 The Duke Meets His Match",
