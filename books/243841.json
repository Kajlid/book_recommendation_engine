  "title": "The Deputy",
  "description": "First staged in 1963, The Deputy stirred up more controversy and caused greater repercussions than any other postwar work. Based on Rolf Hochhuth's research into Vatican activities during World War II, the play's treatment of Pope Pius XII―the \"deputy\" of Christ on earth―and the Church during the Nazi persecution of the Jews made it the object of impassioned praise and violent denunciation. It is a powerful, shocking work. This new paperback edition includes an appendix about Hochhuth's research.",
