  "description": "Roanne Harper is having a bad week. Falsely accused of shoplifting and suspended from school, her whole life has taken a distinct nose-dive. So when her solicitor tells her that there is another option open to her, that by helping to rescue a kidnapped child the charges against her could be dropped, she ignores the nagging voice of doubt in the back of her mind and agrees to help. What she doesnâ€™t realise is that her journey will take her through a parallel dimension, where she will meet gods, demons, psychopaths and a boy who may hold the answer to who she really is.",
