Granted Immortality and tasked with protecting a young woman in his Southern town, he was given one rule: Stay away from her. He failed—and as punishment was cursed with a life of solitude, pain, and loss. His only escape is death at the hands of the soul that marked his so deeply, all those years ago... if he can find her. A soul marked and cursed in her own way, who remembers nothing of the love they shared and lost. For pre-med student Hallie, loneliness isn't a curse—it's a survival skill. After years of struggle and abandonment, her world tilts on its axis again: a freak ice storm sends her van hurtling into a tree — and Hallie into the arms of a tall stranger whose embrace feels hauntingly familiar… With a vengeful Guardian on their tail, she can’t fall for him. But faced with Matthew’s captivating presence, a baffling historical mystery, and one whirlwind road trip, Hallie will have to come to terms with her past, Matthew’s secret, and the fact that some lives are like true love… eternal. ESCAPING FOREVER is book one in a full-length New Adult Paranormal Romance series. It contains sensual love scenes and is intended for mature readers.",
