  "description": "Aveyana’s world will never be the same.  After an unexpected attack claims her mom, seventeen-year-old Veya is forced to abandon the only home she's ever known and the only boy she’s ever loved to make a new life on Pangalax, a US space station. Heartbroken, angry, and homesick, she resents her dad’s decision to move and his demand to hide her unique abilities. As she suspected, appearing normal proves to be nearly impossible, especially around Kye, a way-too-handsome officer who is determined to break through her walls. But can he be trusted? Can anyone be trusted? As Veya uncovers the deep, dark secrets of Pangalax, her very existence becomes threatened. Only one person can save her. Is she willing to forget the past and trust him with her life?",
