  "description": "Still Rock Water is the first in the Moonstone series of paranormal novels set in the little village of St. Ives, Cornwall, England. Liliha's life changes when she inherits her grandmother's star moonstone ring. Instead of playing the role of an Australian housewife, an apparition whisks her away to participate in a flood rescue. She dismisses the strange vision as a dream until it is repeated and grows stronger. Despite her unique ability to help others in distress, Liliha is powerless to alter her depressed, belittling husband. But transformation awaits her in the form of betrayal, losing her ring and immigrating to the other side of the Earth. After a coastal storm, the St. Ives police discover the unique ring on a body and send it away for assessment. Experts at the British Museum offer Liliha an appointment.",
