  "description": "A college campus sex rompJamie Brennan is studying English literature but majoring in seduction. Blessed with good looks, charm, and confidence, Jamie lives for the chase. He has a well-earned reputation as a seducer of straight guys, but he’s also happy to help fellow gay students out of the closet when they are ready. Jamie sees nothing wrong with having a healthy sex life, even if his amorous pursuits frequently land him in sticky situations.Alas, not everyone approves of Jamie’s adventures. Roger Hunt, the hunky grad student, who dresses more like a lumberjack than the talented artist he is, gives Jamie hostile looks whenever their paths cross. Jamie tries to ignore Roger, but they can't seem to stop running into each other. Every time they meet the air crackles with tension, and Jamie begins to wonder if it’s fate or design pushing them together.",
