  "title": "Starting A Small Business The Real Deal",
  "description": "The book concept was birthed from the request of individuals asking how do they start their own business. Having several years of experience with working with multiple industries; I realized there were no simple guides explaining “The Real Deal” of Starting a Small Business. Being an entrepreneur many seeked me out for guidance. One day a friend and I were having lunch and we discussed the frame work of starting a business. The books details how that lunch conversation went. Through the encouragement of many people, I felt compelled to write this book.The book is a guide to provide you with a sense of direction. Starting anything new is scary but to have some honest guidance relives pressure.",
