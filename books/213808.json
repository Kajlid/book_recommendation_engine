  "description": "Portia Porter has struck out on her own and landed her first big client: a millionaire many times over who needs a divorce. But as the billable hours and expenses mount, Portia is learning first hand how hard it is to get a client to pay if they donâ€™t want to. Will her tiny firm crumble under the weight of his unpaid bills? Or might the confusion and expense of switching lawyers be the leverage she needs to finally get paid? With a biting wit, endearing characters, and a story that will leave you reeling, Beaver vs. Beaver is the quintessential legal comedy. For law students, pre-law, young lawyers with a solo practice, and anybody who enjoys laughing at lawyers . . . I mean, legal comedy. (a version of this story first appeared in \"Can You Stiff Your Divorce Lawyer? Tales of How Cunning Clients Can Get Free Legal Work.\")",
