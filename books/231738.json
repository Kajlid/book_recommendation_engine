  "title": "Cherished",
  "description": "After I’m thrown out of the only home I’ve ever know—the cult where I was raised— there’s only one place I’m headed: back to Cherish, my best-friend and first love.  But she isn’t where I left her.  A mountain brings us together but our past is determined to keep us apart. She may be another man’s sister-wife but she belongs with me.  She was my first and she’s going to be my last. Cherish is my one true love and I’m fighting for what’s mine.  Dear Reader, Cherished is more than a filthy-sweet story with a HEA— this is a book with heart & soul … and lots of babies! It may seem over the top— but that’s what true love is — bigger and better than we could have ever imagined. So go get lost on your favorite mountain, the gang is all there, just waiting for you. xo, Frankie",
