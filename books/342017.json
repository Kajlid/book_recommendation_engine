  "description": "Bowie teams up with fellow thieves Chicamaw and T-Dub to rob a bank - he needs the money to hire a lawyer to prove he's innocent of murder. On the run, Bowie finds momentary peace when he elopes with a young woman. But Chicamaw and T-Dub want to reel him back in for one more job. One of the earliest American noir novels, Thieves Like Us was filmed twice, as \"They Live By Night\" in 1949, and by Robert Altman under the book's original title.",
