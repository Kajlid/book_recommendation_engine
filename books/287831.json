  "description": "This book is MM urban fantasy with psychic links. It contains mention of a past coercive relationship and alludes to dubious consent in that context. Characters from the rest of the series are mentioned, but this novella can stand alone.Anchors lie, it's in their nature.Telekinetic, Marc Overton, learned that the hard way as a teen. Five years hasnâ€™t blunted the sharp edges of the lesson. So when Marc starts a fling with an anchor, he knows better than to get attached.Zane Parker might be fuzzy on the details, but Marc has obvious baggage and clear rules for their friends with benefits arrangement. The longer their agreement lasts, the more the lines between them blur.",
