  "description": "What better place to spend the holidays than Cold Comfort Farm? \nAvailable for the first time since its original publication more than fifty years ago, Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm is a charming collection whose hilarious title story features Christmas dinner with the Starkadders before Flora's arrival. With Adam playing Santa while draped in Mrs. Starkadders's shawls, the family shares their traditional \"Christmas pudding\"-a m√©lange containing random objects of doom foretelling the coming year: a coffin nail for death, a bad sixpence for financial ruin, and a menthol cone to indicate that the lucky recipient will go \"blind wi' headache.\" These lively tales will delight anyone who loves Stella Gibbons and her signature wit.",
