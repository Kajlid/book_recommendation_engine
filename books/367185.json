  "description": "This remarkable debut collection introduces a wholly new original young voice to fiction by and about African Americans. Ferrell's remarkable stories show young people on the verge of being erased from society--but determined to endure. They are black or biracial, poor or from broken families, almost-adults navigating a treacherous world. Yet their voices--incandescently street-smart--speak of passion, of connection, of hope wherever they can find it.",
