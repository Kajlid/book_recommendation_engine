  "description": "Once upon a Time, in a Kingdom that was just a little twisted (oh yeah, and kinda far away), Fairy Godmothers Rule! Elf Kings drool, and a Prince was betrothed to a somnolent Princess.Too bad his heart was already lost to a fiery-mannered-and-maned bodyguard...As the Prince of a large kingdom who desired his peoples health and prosperity, for Seth honor and integrity were more than mere words, and putting duty before desire was second-nature. If sometimes he looked at Kira - best friend since childhood and his personal guard - and regretted his betrothal to the Princess of a neighboring kingdom, well, that was the price he had to pay for his people's happiness.Even if that Princess was cursed and given the nickname Sleeping Beauty.With maybe a little help from a Fairy Godmother, Seth discovers the way to end the curse and sets off on a perilous journey to free Sleeping Beauty. Kira rides with him, by his side as always, but Kira's nearness represents a different type of danger... Only love can break the curse, but how can Seth keep his promise to wake the slumbering Princess when being with Kira makes his heart demand a very selfish Happily Ever After?",
