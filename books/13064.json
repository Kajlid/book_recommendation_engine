  "description": "A dark tale of slavery, immigration, and murder set on the west coast of Wales, this is a startling portrait of three ordinary lives taken to extremes. In the aching cold where night bumps into day, Hold hears noises confirming he isn't alone. At the edge of his nets, a rudderless dingy thumps against the rocks, prey to the ebbing tide. What he finds there changes everything. Meanwhile, Grzegorz works hard, with no time for rest and little thanks. All he needs is an opportunity; when it comes, with no apparent strings attached, what can he do but take it? On the other hand, the Big Man knows only one kind of life—where all that is needed are a code of honor and a reputation—but it’s leaving him behind and he’s struggling to keep up. One random technical hitch later and the three men are set on a journey that none could have foreseen, none can halt, and that ends as abruptly as it began.",
