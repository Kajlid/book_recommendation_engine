  "description": "There’s more to life than pull-ups.Marc’s life has changed since last summer, when his for-real, super-cool Navy SEAL Uncle Jake came to visit. He’s eating healthy, practicing jiu-jitsu, and working hard in school. Marc’s had a great year…until the very last day of school, when he gets into trouble because of Nathan James. Nathan is mean and annoying, and Marc has to spend every day with Nathan at summer camp. Nathan calls Marc “Plate Face,” and he’ll never leave him alone. Marc is sick of it. Even worse, Marc has no way to get to summer camp except for walking. He wants a new bike, called \"the Bentley,\" but his parents don’t think he needs it, even though the bike he owns is totally falling apart. There’s only one person who can help Marc turn his bummer summer around – Uncle Jake. With Uncle Jake back in town, Marc realizes that being a Warrior Kid isn’t just about being strong on the outside – it’s also about being strong on the inside. Can Marc learn to control his temper, get himself the bike he wants, and get Nathan off his back?",
