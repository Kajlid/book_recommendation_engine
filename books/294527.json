  "description": "A gripping, friends-to-lovers-to-enemies, dark romance.New York City—not for the faint-hearted or the sweetest of souls. The last thing I expected was to be back in this city, after all these years. And I definitely did not expect to be back in this house, where it all started. I have spent years avoiding this place, and the cold hard reality of what happened here. But I have no choice. We are all back here and quarantined together. It took, the end of the world, for me to come back here. And to face him. Milo Sinclair. Once my legal guardian and savior in life. The person who saved me from drowning in loneliness. Who gave me everything I ever wanted. But then he took everything away from me. Plus interest. He broke me. He will not break me again.PLEASE READ THE WARNING: Dark romance is subjective.
