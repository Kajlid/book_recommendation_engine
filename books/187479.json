They were blessed with a child, a son, and the pair couldn't be happier. Until one day their world was ripped apart by deceit and betrayal. A threat to their son's life caused Ryland to send him away into hiding, in hopes that he would be safe. When Phenex arrived home to find his mate in the arms of another man he was hurt and angry, but when he found that his mate had taken his son from him, he was enraged. Phenex turned his back on his mate and walked away from their mating. Twenty six years later, they have found their son, but the horrors he suffered his whole life cause Ryland great pain and guilt. To ensure that their son Jesse has his full powers, these two strong leaders must find a way back to each other.
