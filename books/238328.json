After so much build-up for the big night, how will Ethan handle it? Sam has no idea, and while she’s pretty sure she’s ready, she’s still a bit nervous. Who wouldn’t be?Most newlyweds don’t ride bicycles up and then back down dormant volcanoes for fun on their honeymoon, but Sam and Ethan aren’t the average couple.
