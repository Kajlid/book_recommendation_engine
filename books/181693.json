  "title": "Life Without Stirrups: A Witty Memoir About One Person's Gallop Through Life",
  "description": "Dagnyâ€™s obsession with horses began when she was young and could bounce back from injury. In the beginning, she spent more time being catapulted through the air than actually sitting in the saddle. After a childhood tragedy, however, she is left hanging by a thread and eventually walks away from the magic of Equus. Years later, when adult life becomes as exciting as bone marrow, Merlot gallops into her life. Yes, buying a devil of a horse is just a brilliant solution to midlife boredom. Shaking in her boots, Dagny soon realizes life is not pink. What follows is a winding and often hilarious tale of horses, ice storms, downed electric fences, a nasty hurricane, and one very crazy life. Spanning two countries and five states, the author takes the reader on a very personal, touching journey with profound life lessons. Lighthearted and funny, the book will appeal both to riders and non-riders and is a perfect gift for anyone who enjoys a smart, entertaining read.",
