  "description": "Have you ever wondered if curses really do exist? Marty's grandfather always said that superstition was nothing more than nonsense that hindered fools from discovery, but now Marty’s not so sure. Ever since his grandfather, a world-renowned archeologist, discovered a tomb in Egypt his family has been plagued with tragedy. First Marty’s mother disappears, and then Reginald himself collapses at the museum in the weeks leading up to the mummy's unveiling. One by one children start to disappear as the town turns against Marty and his family, blaming them for unleashing the curse upon them. Haunted by visions of creatures that shouldn't exist, Marty soon finds himself in a waking nightmare filled with demons running rampant in the streets, ghouls masquerading in the flesh of humans, and an evil necromancer who will stop at nothing to secure his own immortality. As if that wasn’t enough, then there's Daniel Richardson, the most beautiful girl Marty has ever laid eyes on. The only thing is, his competition isn’t another boy at school, it’s the monster behind the abductions, and now he has to find a way to stop her from being taken next.
