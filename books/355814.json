  "description": "\"Remarkable.… Ekirch has emptied night's pockets, and laid the contents out before us.\" ―Arthur Krystal, The New Yorker Bringing light to the shadows of history through a \"rich weave of citation and archival evidence\" ( Publishers Weekly ), scholar A. Roger Ekirch illuminates the aspects of life most often overlooked by other historians―those that unfold at night. In this \"triumph of social history\" ( Mail on Sunday ), Ekirch's \"enthralling anthropology\" ( Harper's ) exposes the nightlife that spawned a distinct culture and a refuge from daily life. Fear of crime, of fire, and of the supernatural; the importance of moonlight; the increased incidence of sickness and death at night; evening gatherings to spin wool and stories; masqued balls; inns, taverns, and brothels; the strategies of thieves, assassins, and conspirators; the protective uses of incantations, meditations, and prayers; the nature of our predecessors' sleep and dreams―Ekirch reveals all these and more in his \"monumental study\" ( The Nation ) of sociocultural history, \"maintaining throughout an infectious sense of wonder\" ( Booklist ).",
