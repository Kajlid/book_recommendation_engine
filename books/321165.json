  "description": "I met the devil when I was fourteen years old.Just a kid himself, he was hellbent on making me miserable.By fifteen I hated him.When I was sixteen, I moved as far away as I could.Since I’ve left, my life has been simple—peaceful and still.I had no intention of ever returning to Skull Creek.Until tragedy struck and I was called back.It’s been two years since I saw my step-brother.I hoped he had changed.But the devil is still the same.He’s arrogant and ruthless.Rules the town with an iron fist.Where he walks, crowds part.Now his blame is set on me, along with his dark orbs of hate.It’s time to show him I’m not the same girl I was back then.If he pushes, I’ll push harder.Where I bend, he will break.As long as he doesn’t find my weakness, I can survive this.Even if my weakness has become the devil himself.",
