  "description": "In 1984, Danika Laroque, a young indigenous woman, was reported missing. The investigation went cold not long after. Decades later, a True Crime podcaster starts poking around, bringing the missing persons case to the attention of Cassidy Miller. But how do you resolve a case with no crime scene, no evidence, and no body?Back in the Twin Cities after Julia’s father’s funeral, Cassidy is hoping for some good luck romantically, or at least a break. It’s starting to feel like her relationship with Julia has been defined by overcoming one obstacle after the next. Between rehoming Julia’s mom, a new job at a high-profile criminal defense firm, and baby fever, Cassidy worries there might not be room for her in Julia’s life. But more importantly, with Julia being pulled in so many directions, is whatever’s left over enough to make Cassidy happy?Book 6 in the Don’t Call Me Hero series.",
