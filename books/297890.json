  "description": "The end of our world is fast approaching. A global economic collapse, driven by climate change, disease, and sea level rise, is causing chaos across the planet. Faced with 6th mass extinction of our planet, the new world government is forced to commit horrific acts against humanity in order to try and save a single generation of children, who are taken from their parents and raised by an artificial life-like intelligence (ALLI). This gripping tale follows the lives of seven characters as they face the harsh realities of extinction. For General Reeves, he is forced to enslave adults and work them until their death, deconstructing all of humanity's past to build new cities. Luke is forced into this slavery, but he is desperate to escape it. Blind to the horrors around her, Mary is designing and overseeing the construction of an environmentally autonomous city that can survive the coming environmental apocalypse. While Eve is being raised by artificial intelligence to live in this new city, Issac is being turned into a child solider who will hunt down anyone dares defy this new reality. Like Adam, whose parents refuse to be part of this new world, hiding and struggling to survive in the changing environment. Then there's Paul, who is forced to decide which children will live and which will become killing machines, trained to hunt down those who fail to comply with this new reality. Over the course of the novel, these seven characters' lives intertwine and collide as they all face the realities of the 6th extinction.",
