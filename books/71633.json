  "description": "The Queen's Wizard available now in iTunes! http://bit.ly/Rjj0V5The grating crash of the metal bold on the gate behind them signals the end of the quiet country life Nicholas Quill and his younger brother Peter have always known. The tall, narrow mansion, looming before them like a besieged fortress on the Thames, closets a strange and eerie world of occult arts and inexplicable intrigues. Within that forbidding house Dr. Griffin, the “wizard of Mortlake,” reigns supreme, making predictions and casting horoscopes for the great and powerful of Elizabethan England – including the mighty Queen herself. Nicholas’ growing involvement with the wizard leads him into the very center of court intrigue and dangerous plots, culminating in a spine-chilling climax – the discovery of a plot against the life of the monarch. While faithfully recreating an exciting period and a little-known aspect of English history, the Beattys have written an irresistible novel of suspense.",
