  "description": "Claire Daniels was stunningly attractive... blonde hair, blue eyes and a curvaceous body she worked on relentlessly. Claire was the desire of every man in town. As the Twin Cities' most prominent political and investigative reporter she reported the news... now she was the news.  Murder... Greed... Treason... Thirty-two-year-old, fourth-generation St. Paul Homicide Detective \"Mac\" McRyan thought his day was going to be less stressful. The day would involve paper work, coffee, and maybe even an early trip to the pub. Then his cell phone rings... A body has been found in a high-end condominium between Summit and Grand Avenues; and it's not just anyone. With the Daniels brutal murder on top of the latest serial killer attack, the political and media pressure on the police department only builds and places Mac in the middle of a dangerous and high-stakes murder investigation that will ultimately have national political and security implications.",
