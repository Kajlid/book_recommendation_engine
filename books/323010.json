  "title": "The Abolition of Sex: How the \"Transgender\" Agenda Harms Women and Girls",
  "description": "Most Americans do not understand the real threat that the \"transgender\" agenda, or the so-called \"gender identity\" movement, poses to all of us —especially women and girls — nor do they understand the extent to which it is taking over U.S. law and civil society. The simple truth is that \"gender identity\" functions to abolish sex, and all of our civic institutions — government, media, academia, and business — have been completely captured by it. We have been told that \"transgender\" is a word to describe a marginalized group of people who are in need of civil rights protection; it is not. Instead, it is an incoherent word that is being used to advance a much broader agenda. There are many people — including people on the political left — who understand the threat that enshrining “gender identity” in law and society poses, but they are silenced when they try to speak out. This book shines a light on the truth about \"gender identity,\" the \"transgender\" agenda, the very real threats that they pose to all of society — specifically to the rights, privacy, and safety of women and girls — and what the global Women’s Human Rights Campaign is doing to fight back.",
