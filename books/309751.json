  "description": "An age-gap, opposites-attract lesbian romance between a nanny and her career-climbing boss that ends in a puddle of melted ice queen.Ambitious corporate shark Camila Evans might have just lost her marriage but she decides she doesn’t need love to build a television empire and raise her young son alone. What she does need is a nanny, but the incompetent idiots sent her way make her lose faith in ever finding anyone useful.Enter Emily Walker—fresh out of college, bright, a little naive, and new to New York City. Emily is everything Camila is not and frankly it’s a little unsettling how innocent and gentle the young woman is.That’s not all that’s unsettling. Camila’s growing feelings for Emily are making it hard to maintain a professional distance. Surely she can’t possibly be falling for the nanny? God, it’s such a mid-life crisis cliché. But would it be too impossible?As time goes on, Camila starts to wonder if maybe even she can get her happy ending after all.75,000 wordsTags: age gap romance, ice queen romance, New York, opposites-attract romance, single mom",
