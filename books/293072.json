Edward Ford Westcott has accepted a position in a clandestine program that seeks to find answers to history's greatest unknowns. He is sent back in time to 18th century England to investigate a woman’s murder and falls in love with Ian Gallihugh, the devoted nephew of the soon-to-be victim, but when he and his partner, Angelica Law, are thrown into the upper echelons of English society, they soon discover that things are not what they appear to be. Edward’s relationship with Ian is soon in jeopardy, along with all their lives. Discovering the truth will leave the two men cornered, and they will be forced to make a terrible choice if they are to save their love.",
