  "description": "I'm disfigured. Scarred. Ugly. When I look in the mirror, I see a stranger. When I look over my shoulder, no one's there… Yet I feel watched. Hunted. Afraid.And then he tells me I’m beautiful. He tells me I’m safe.I believe him.Until someone tries to kill me. Secrets abound, danger is near, and still… my heart desires a boy with whiskey-colored eyes and far too many secrets.Secrets that could cost me my life. To stay alive I have to look deep, beneath the masks everyone wears, to find the truth. To find myself.",
