This is 1862, after all, and such things are the wonder of the age.But then events take a turn for the worse: men and women wander the streets talking of ‘the darkness’; bodies vanish from morgues across town; and random, bloody attacks on innocent people take place in broad daylight.Soon Kat and her friends are fighting for their lives against a horde of infected people, with only their wits and ingenuity to help them.A steampunked story of diamonds, chutzpah, death and horror from the blood-drenched pen of Sam Stone.",
