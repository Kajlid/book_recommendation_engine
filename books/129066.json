  "title": "A Twist of Lyme",
  "description": "Who are the 'men in the garden'? Was Chipping Norton really once the centre of the universe? What part do dodgy knees have to play? Just who are Johnny Norfolk and Johnny Stevens? What is W.A.S.T.E.? What connects the Cotswolds, Venice, East Molesey and Lyme Regis? Why would anyone pay to see 'Ophelia get Your Gun'? And just what is the appropriate response to virtually everything? Some of these questions may be answered...some may not in this comic tale of family life in this, David Ruffle's first foray into contemporary fiction.",
