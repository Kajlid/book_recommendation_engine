  "title": "Fall of the Citizens",
  "description": "When you take away people's choices, the only choice left is revolution. Eric Thomas' debut thriller is an exciting, violent and thought provoking story that asks the question, \"What happens after you've won the revolution?\" The story centers around Josh, a member of the hacktivist group Anonymous, who is living in safe seclusion until he's recruited by a bloodthirsty group of revolutionaries called \"The Citizens.\" They've launched a war on the wealthy; stealing vaccinations from rich pharmaceutical companies and handing them out for free to the poor. Josh is reluctant to join until he meets Betty, a sarcastic, pink haired revolutionary motivated by her recent misfortune. Josh and Betty ride the wave of the uprising that will put them on the front line in the battle between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" a classic class warfare struggle where the rights of the many finally outweigh the rights of the few.",
