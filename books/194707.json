  "description": "Surrounding the destiny of the RMS Titanic, and the terror of September 11th. One man has forgotten how to love. Only one woman can help him remember... Everlasting Journey As quiet as a hummingbird's breath, a special miracle has taken place. Only a chosen few are fortunate enough to experience such an extraordinary phenomenon. One of them is Layna Bennett, a woman facing the difficulties of modern day society, divorce, and despair embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Another is Trey Margeaut, a Southern gentleman who was wounded in the Civil War. He is a man who loves unconditionally and completely, and sees no barriers - color or otherwise - in those he loves. Except for Layna Bennettâ€¦ Trey harbors a true and well-deserved hatred for the woman who destroyed his life and devastated his soul. The war may have crippled him physically, but Layna crippled him spiritually. Or did she?? As events unfold and spiral entirely out of control, the fine line that divides love and hatred begins to unravel beyond redemption. If time truly heals all wounds, can their shattered hearts be mended by breaking the very barriers of time itself?",
