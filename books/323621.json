  "description": "Love wanes.That’s what my missing groom told me over the phone . . . on our wedding day, no less.I wasn’t about to go down that road again—love, marriage, forever. I had enough on my plate serving as deputy general counsel of our family business and keeping my matchmaking parents off my back.Then Wayland Ramirez comes roaring back into my life.The boy who asked me to be his girlfriend in middle school. The man I shared a sizzling night of passion with five years ago. The man who made me trust him . . . then disappeared.This time, I know better than to put my heart in anyone’s hands.But when Dad throws down an ultimatum—bring a date to the office Christmas party or meet a stranger of his choosing—I spontaneously ask Wayland to play the part of my doting fake-boyfriend for a night.He just wasn’t supposed to give an Oscar-winning performance.Once more, his whispered words, his searing kisses, his body against mine almost have me believing that this could last. Almost.I say love is a sham, a reservoir that depletes with time.He says he wants it all—my todays and tomorrows.But can I trust him with my tomorrows? Can I trust him to pick me up if I fall?Because God knows, I am falling for this man.",
