  "description": "A cartoonumentary that Ralph Bakshi called “A textbook for animators in the brilliant use of design”. A dizzying salad-toss of caricatures, typography and wild design.This stylized, visual exploration of American hobo culture is chock full of images that are as appealing as they are repulsive. Characters you don't want to know and situations you don't want to encounter are illustrated in a dazzling display of colors and patterns. Was a nomadic existence of working and riding the rails ever really this ugly or this beautiful? Join artist/designer Ragnar as he takes you on a fictitious trip across some not-so-great parts of this great country with some less-than-desirable traveling companions.",
