  "description": "Intending to take a neighbouring realm and enslave its queen, King Eldred and Prince Aldric believe they have succeeded in the first stage of their plan when they take a castle commanded by the Queen’s aunt. They have no idea of the power wielded by Queen Arctis and by the women of her army – or what she will do to them when she finally has them under her power. Neither the King nor the Prince could possibly have imagined a mere woman could overcome them, or the extent of the pain and sexual humiliation they would have to endure as her prisoners.",
