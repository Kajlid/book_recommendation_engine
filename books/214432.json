Consider this pure Nirvana.\" —  BooklistExiled from Canada to Los Angeles, Katy can't believe she is spending the summer with her father—punk the Rat—a recovered addict and drummer for the band Suck. Even though Katy feels abandoned by her mom, even though the Rat's place is a mess and he's not like anything she'd call a father, Kathy won't make a fuss. After all, she is a girl who is quiet and polite, a girl who smiles, a girl who is, well, beige. Or is she?
