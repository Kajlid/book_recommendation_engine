  "title": "Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold: The History of a Lesbian Community",
  "description": "This ground-breaking book traces the emergence and growth of a lesbian community in Buffalo, New York, from the mid-1930s to the early 1960s. Based on thirteen years of research and drawing upon the oral histories of forty-five women, authors Kennedy and Davis explore butch-femme roles, coming out, women who passed as men, motherhood, aging, racism, and the courage and pride of the working-class lesbians of Buffalo who, by confronting incredible oppression and violence, helped to pave the way for the gay and lesbian liberation movements of the 1970s and 1980s. Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold captures the full complexity of lesbian culture; it is a compassionate history of real people fighting for respect and a place to love without fear of persecution.",
