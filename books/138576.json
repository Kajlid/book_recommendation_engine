  "description": "All Rachel Blackstone wanted was to talk with her dead father. Using a Native American ceremony given to her by a shaman, she summoned him. Instead, a soul intent on revenge slipped through. Now the Santa Fe reporter must follow the evil spirit, uncover its purpose and send it back. The shapeshifter has horrific powers and threatens the people she loves. There’s more on her plate. She’s seeing dead people, which give her the creeps. Some are helpful. Others try to lead her away from the truth. One spirit, a lone wolf, seems to have an uncertain allegiance. What she, and friend Chloe, uncover is an earthly scam involving both the quick and the dead–and may even involve her brother, the mayor. To save him, Rachel must play a dangerous game of treasure hunt which leads to a powerful climax of earth, wind and fire.",
