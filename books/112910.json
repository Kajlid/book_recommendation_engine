  "title": "A Winner's Guide to Negotiating: How Conversation Gets Deals Done",
  "description": "You don't have to be an agent or a lawyer to negotiate. In fact, we all negotiate in every aspect of our lives. Every negotiation, however, is an obstacle course, with a specific set of goals and roadblocks. Understanding the psychology behind decision-making, the role gender plays in the conversation, the overall process and the key strategies that drive successful negotiation is critical. Each person I negotiated with is different and each and every situation presents a unique set of opportunities and challenges. The one constant is the gap that needs to be closed and the dynamic of human connection. Knowing how to negotiate can help you close deals, manage conflict, and strengthen relationships. It will give you an entirely new view on how to deal with conflict.",
