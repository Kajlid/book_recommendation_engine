  "description": "Snowball, that lovable bundle of feline fluff readers first met as a kitten in Snowball’s Christmas, is all grown up. And now that she has her forever home at a cozy B&B, she’s determined to orchestrate a forever love match, just in time for the holidays... Snowball takes her job as the “official kitty” at the Victorian B&B Inn, Weber Haus, very seriously. Greeting guests and keeping tabs on them is a full-time feline job, after all. However, being nice to Daniel Aarons is not on her to-do list. The handsome construction manager almost messed up her forever family, and she isn’t about to forgive him anytime soon... But then someone new arrives at Weber Haus. Her name is Sophie Heidt — and she’s the B&B’s new manager. When Snowball goes missing on Sophie’s first day, Daniel, in charge of the new hotel wing, comes to her rescue by getting the cat to do what she does best: attack him. It doesn’t take long for Snowball’s animal instincts to reveal that Daniel and Sophie are meant to be together. Unfortunately, Daniel keeps making a mess of things. It’s going to take some special insight and holiday cheer to bring them together. But if anyone can do it, Snowball can — even if she has to tolerate turtle doves, French hens, calling birds, and other fur-raising human traditions...",
