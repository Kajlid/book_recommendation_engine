  "title": "A Kiss to Tell",
  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author W Winters comes a emotionally-gripping, standalone, romantic suspense.  I didn’t need anyone to tell me; I knew he was forbidden with a single glance. He was a boy I should’ve been afraid of, and definitely a boy I should’ve never wanted. No matter how much neither of those statements were true.  From the first time I saw him, Sebastian had a hard stare that pinned me in place. And years later, it hasn’t softened. We lived on the same street and went to the same school, although he was a year ahead. Even so close, he was untouchable. He was bad news and I was the sad girl who didn’t belong.  One night changed everything.  We both had secrets. We both saw the pain in each other’s eyes. The gaze that gave me chills turned to a lust-filled haze that heated every inch of me. But that didn’t change who he was. A man who would take everything from me.",
