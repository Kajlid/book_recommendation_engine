  "description": "Twenty-year old Kate De Laurel wants two things in life: to be ordinary and to grow old and wrinkly with her best friend, Erick. Unfortunately for Kate, Erick goes missing, and any dreams of simplicity are further diminished when she wakes up one morning and can read everyone's mind. Through her unique gift that she views as a curse, Kate learns that Erick is dead and spends the next few years holding onto his memory, and mastering the fine art of becoming a loner. But when Kate steps out of her comfort zone to attend college in Georgetown, Washington D.C., she unknowingly steps onto a path full of sarcastic gothic-faes who become her close friends, a bubbly roommate that can see ghosts, and a sadistic vampire that is hell-bent on turning her into his midnight snack. Most importantly, this complicated journey forces Kate to accept an important lesson: life may not always play out as we have imagined. To Love A Dead Boy captures the beauty of love, the pain of loss, and the complex struggle between holding on and letting go.",
