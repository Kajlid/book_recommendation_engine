  "description": "\"I’m the one known as Tatterwing. The one who meddled too far within the cloven book, turning the world dark. Turning it into a place that frightens even me. I did this. I called death to every door. The dog with yellowed eye lurks in this marsh because of what I’ve done.  I wish I had the answers to this riddle, or that I understood what’s happened. To this day, I don’t. There is no way to turn back time, to unmake my own mistakes. We live and die in this dark place now. We hunt the beast of yellowed eye because of the whispers in every village, in every realm. That the beast is part of the riddle. He’s part of whatever it is I’ve done. So for now at least, my road is clear: This beast will die in my clutches—unless I die in his.\"",
