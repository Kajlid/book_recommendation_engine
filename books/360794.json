  "description": "THERON — Dark haired, duty bound and deceptively deadly. He's the leader of the Eternal Guardians, an elite group of warriors that defend the mortal realm.From the moment he walked into the club, Casey knew this guy was different. Men like that just didn't exist in real life—silky shoulder-length hair, chest impossibly broad, and a predatory manner that just screamed dark and dangerous. He was looking for something. Her.She was the one. She had the mark. Casey had to die so his kind could live, and it was Theron's duty to bring her in. But even he wasn't strong enough to resist the pull in her fathomless eyes, to tear himself away from the heat of her body.As war with the immortal realm nears, someone will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.",
