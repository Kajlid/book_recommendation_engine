  "title": "The Mutiny on the Bounty Trilogy",
  "description": "The story of the Bounty will be told as long as men sail the sea. The storytelling genius of the authors finds here a canvas filled with color, action and adventure. Readers will realize, as did the authors, that so large a drama could not be confined to the compass of an ordinary book. Nordoff and Hall chose to tell the story of the Bounty in three acts: \n   Mutiny on the Bounty \n   Men Against the Sea \n   Pitcairn's Island \n In The Mutiny on the Bounty Trilogy these three books have been united in a single volume to form the complete work that the authors had in mind.",
