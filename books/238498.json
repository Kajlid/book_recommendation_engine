  "description": "In Marlowe’s Maverick, Rachelle Vaughn introduces Ryan, Gavin, and Coop—three sexy hockey players who despite not sharing a last name, are brothers at heart. And for Gavin Bozymowski, the thrill of a lifetime is about to arrive in a surprising package…Red Valley, California seemed like a good place for Marin Marlowe to start over and reinvent herself. Here, cleaning houses for a living, Marin scrubs toilets, washes windows, and dreams of a more meaningful relationship than the one she has with the paper towel hunk and the bald guy on the cleanser she uses. The upside of her thankless job gives her a behind-the-scenes look at Red Valley’s wealthiest residents. At Gavin Bozymowski’s house, she likes what she sees behind door number one. A peek inside his massive walk-in closet reveals rows upon rows of custom-made suits and more designer ties than she could shake her mop at. Her newest client might spend most of his time traveling, but when he’s home, Marin can’t resist the sharp-dressing, smooth-talking hockey player.After Gavin wakes up to find a gorgeous stranger standing at the foot of his bed, he wishes his heart wasn’t off limits. When Gavin shows Marin the finer things in life, she wishes she wasn’t so far out of his league—and out of his reach. A rough-and-tumble guy like Gavin giving her the romance she’s always dreamed about? Seems bizarre! Then again, crazier things have happened under the sunny California sky.Marin is sure she has no place in a community like Harlequin Hills, but Gavin knows differently. Marin belongs here with him, and convincing this sexy, stubborn woman will be a challenge no bad boy could resist…",
