  "description": "Constance lost the only family she had in a fatal car accident. It also left her blind in one eye. With her life seeming like an endless, broken record, she’s never really felt she is living.  But then she meets this hardened biker, one who is so unlike anyone she’s met before. He makes her feel alive like there’s more to life than just going through the motions.  She feels desire for him, and the things she wants him to do to her should make her blush. But all she feels is heat … so much she’s burning alive from her need.   Vengeance lives the MC life. That means he works hard and plays harder. But when he comes across a woman, this fragile, innocent female, something in him awakens.  He wants her instantly, but not just in a filthy way. He wants to protect her, keep her safe. It’s clear she’s been hurt, and not only because he knows she’s lost her family.  But when Constance starts to feel happy, loved even, she realizes someone has been watching her. They want her, and if they can’t have her they’ll make sure no one does.  Constance is strong in her own right, but it’s up to Vengeance to protect the woman he loves. It’s up to Vengeance to make sure his old lady stays by his side.  WARNING: This is novella length. It does contain graphic scenes and content and is the seventh book in the Soldiers of Wrath MC series. Although the story is written that it can be read on its own, it's suggested that the other books in the series be read first in order to understand the world and characters.",
