This fair-haired, light-skinned foreigner, called haole by the natives, decides to stay in Maui for a couple of days until she can figure out what to do with her life. She realizes that her quick trip to Maui may not be all she's hoping for when: -She has to bail her Hawaiian/Korean grandmother out of jail for possession of pakalolo. -The only thing she can understand her grandmother say is: \"Not that.\" -She can't decide which hurts worse, her sunburn, hangover, or memories of the night before. -She's labeled the \"Liquor Licker\" on the front page of the Maui News in a photo that shows her doing a shot of tequila with a hunky Hawaiian who's been found dead. -It seems she's had orgasms that have lasted longer than her career. -She scrapes the bottom of the barrel to find her guardian angel. Beautiful fabric found in her grandmother's closet unfolds a future for Jaswinder as she designs sensuous silky wraps called sunshminas that provide sun protection. She tries for a Hollywood connection, but her company, Haole Wood, has some growing pains. From trying to find a killer, to selling her sunshminas, to lusting after Dr. Jac, the island dermatologist, to trying to ignore her so-called guardian angel, can Jaswinder learn to embrace the island way of life?
