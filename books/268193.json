  "description": "I’ve gotten into my fair share of awkward situations... Although, asking a random stranger to be my fake boyfriend is by far the worst. In my defense, it was an act of desperation. An act I hope will keep away the men in town who see me as their ticket to becoming the mayor’s son-in-law. But I have a plan.1. Date my fake boyfriend long enough for the news to spread across town.2. Have a very public breakup that leaves me too heartbroken to move on.3. Continue living my happily single life. There’s only one problem… Harris wasn’t supposed to be the kind of man I’ve always wanted. There’s no denying the sparks that fly between us. Just when I’m about to give him my heart, he does the one thing I can’t forgive. Our breakup is public all right, and the heartbreak is real.",
