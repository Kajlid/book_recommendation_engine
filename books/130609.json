  "description": "Adam Clarkson is a successful TV actor who is enjoying his life and all the benefits it brings him. All that changes when Connell Mansell and his three children move in next door. From the moment he sees Connell, Adam is fascinated by him but is baffled when his friendly overtures are rebuffed. Determined to get to know the other man better, he starts a campaign to get closer to the little family and the aloof Connell. Connell is equally determined to keep Adam at arm's length and it takes help from friends, judicious use of dogs and a smattering of bribes before Adam is able to get close enough to even hold a conversation. Just when Adam thinks he has made some progress in getting closer to Connell he discovers the reason the other man is so protective and wary of letting anyone get close to him and his children. What happens from there is something neither man expected, but will ultimately change everyone's lives forever.",
