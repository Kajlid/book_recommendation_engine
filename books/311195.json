His solution is working for the Polished P & P company to not only help out with his money situation but to give him the freedom to be himself. All he has to do is be an escort without selling his body, just his company. Easy, right? It is until he meets Russian god Adrik Hail. Wealthy businessman Adrik is lonely. His solution is to pay for no-strings-attached company. He doesn’t have time to waste impressing someone, nor does he want anyone to think they can weasel their way into his life. He’s a busy man who likes organization, and by hiring someone from Polished, he’s the one who’s in control. Then adorable West walks through the door, changing everything. Now Adrik’s mind and body want more from the man, who is as sweet as he is kind. Adrik just needs to find a way of working out West.",
