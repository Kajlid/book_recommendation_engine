  "description": "As the brother of the pack alpha, Wren knows his place, even if that place occasionally brings him to harm. It's simply pack rules. But when a handsome new alpha and his pack come to town, challenging the status quo, Wren finds himself torn between the old wolf shifter attitude and a new one.  Gideon is the alpha of the Corwin pack. Though he moved into the territory to take advantage of business opportunities, the moment he encounters the young black wolf with the blue eyes, he find his priorities changing. Wren is obedient as a good beta should be, but Gideon is banking on him having a rebellious streak. The only way to find out is to gamble: by forcing a marriage between their packs. But it's a step that unleashes homophobia, deadly danger, and the discovery of a dark secret that was never meant to surface. And it may involve Gideon losing his heart. (M/M Paranormal Shifter Romance.)",
