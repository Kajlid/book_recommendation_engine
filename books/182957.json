  "description": "Dragons, Dragons everywhere! So, you want to know about dragons? Run the gamut of stories about the mythological beasts in a Firestorm of Dragons. Humorous tales of extreme sports with genetically engineered animals and pesky door-to-door salesmen with scales, exist beside conventional stories of treasure and deceit, hunter and hunted, hatred and sacrifice. See how dragons exist today without most humans noticing or abandon all preconceived notions and imagine a dragon as a 1940’s-style detective. Let your experience with dragons end with a trio of stories depicting possible ends to dragonkind—one uplifting, one poignant, and one heart-wrenching in its melancholy.With dragon tales TeehanChris AzureKirk DougalBob NailorKarina L.
