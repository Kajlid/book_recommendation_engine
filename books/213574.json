  "title": "Ivanov",
  "description": "The first of Chekhov's full-length dramas, Ivanov treads a fine line between broad comedy and tragic melodrama. Ivanov, a young estate owner, is too intelligent and too bored to endure his provincial life. He is a \"superfluous man,\" attracted to a beautiful young woman who threatens his moral foundations and leads him ultimately to tragedy. This new translation beautifully captures Chekhov's dialogue for modern audiences.",
