  "description": "Meet Lady Vanessa Sherwin-Williams, whose heart-stopping beauty has caused more coronaries than saturated fats. Join her in a dizzying odyssey as she's transported from nineteeth-century England to old New Orleans (and back again).Swooning at the drop of an eyelash, Vanessa is swept from rapture to reverie, reverie romp, and romp back to rapture; she won't rest until she finds Real Romance -- or loses her virginity -- though she'd kind of prefer it if they happened close together.Voluptuous Vanessa's virtue is nearly (darn it!) compromised by such luminaries as the filthy French explorer, Trapper Jacques, who wins her in a poker game aboard a Mississippi steamboat; Lord Gastleigh, who dresses like a bloodhound and has been known to lift his leg at masked balls; and, most romantically, the dashing Duke of Earl, Vanessa's One True Love.",
