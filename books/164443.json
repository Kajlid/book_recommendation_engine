  "description": "Many a meddling matron would delight in making a match between her daughter and George Winterbrook, Earl of Weymouth. But winning the dashing peer over proves frustrating at best. Few people know that the proud earl is an incurable romantic determined to marry for love or not at all. Then an eccentric divorcée kidnaps him and nearly blackmails him into a false marriage—until fate offers him a breathtaking savior.Beth Castleton is practical to a fault. She believes herself too old, too American, and too serious for the merry and gossiping ton. Stranger still, she's not at all certain that she even wants to marry. But when happenstance brings the dashing Earl of Weymouth into her life, she lets her heart guide her to a love she has never imagined.",
