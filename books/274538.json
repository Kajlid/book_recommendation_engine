After all, he's rich, successful and looks more like one of his movie-star clients than their PR rep. Paul can have any woman he wants. Any woman--except Gwen's smokin'-hot sister. Taking plain-Jane Gwen out as a favor was supposed to be his ticket in. And okay, sure, Gwen's fun and smart and interesting--and absolutely amazing in bed. But she'd never fit in with his parties-and-paparazzi lifestyle. This is a total mismatch.So why's he so ready to dive back into bed with Gwen first chance he can?",
