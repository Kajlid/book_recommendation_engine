As Tegan begins to track down people with those names, she sees a pattern begin to form: The names she sees point to people who will die that same day.Then Tegan meets a mysterious friend of one of the dead, and they begin a desperate attempt to save these people from their fate. Tegan changes lives that summer, just like her father used to. But can she change her own?",
