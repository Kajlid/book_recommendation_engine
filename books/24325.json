  "description": "In 1572, during the reign of Queen Jane, English mathematician Thomas Digges pilots an ethership designed by John Dee into orbit around the Earth, to discover whether the ether can sustain life. Accompanying Digges are privateer Francis Drake, adventurer Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, and John Field, a representative of the Archibishop of Canterbury.
