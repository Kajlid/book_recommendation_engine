  "title": "The Woodsman's Daughter",
  "description": "\"Set in post-Civil War southern Georgia, the land of the longleaf pines, The Woodsman's Daughter chronicles the conflicts of the Miller family, seen mostly through Dalia Miller's eyes. Dalia is the brassy and beautiful elder daughter of Monroe Miller, a shrewd turpentine farmer haunted by a devastating secret. Anguished but resourceful, Dalia strives to create a better life for herself and will stop at nothing to protect her family - but the sins of the father are never far behind.\" Gwyn Hyman Rubio brings to life a South in transition: the majestic estates and the humble shantytowns, the swaying pines and the insular bustle of small-town living. Against this backdrop, the narrative follows the twists and turns of Dalia's emotions as she struggles with her father's legacy, and ultimately her own.",
