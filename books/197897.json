Braver “Brave” Trousseau, the voice of Winter’s Wrath.For the success of the band, they have to work past their animosity, but that’s difficult when they have the same taste in women. And men.Sex is a game to Brave. A game that might leave the people Alder cares for completely broken. Unless he claims them for his own.If he steps out of the shadows, he’ll have no choice to play. To win.On stage, the drama drives the fans insane. The songs they sing are a blood racing, body moving, warcry. But the very real battle taking place between the snares and the mic might tear the band apart.",
