  "description": "Poor Akira has an ugly duckling complex, and his oblivious family isn't helping! His mother is as pretty and young-looking as a shojo manga character. His father is the study-hard, pretty-bishonen type. Akira's elder brother shines like a top model. His elder sister looks like a pretty boy and is adored by the other girls at her school. And even his little sister is as cute as a doll. No matter where they go, the Sakamoto family gathers everybody's attention and admiration, making things all the more painful for Akira - because he's so ordinary!",
