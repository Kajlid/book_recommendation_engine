  "description": "Winner of 5 national awards, “Recipes for a Sacred Life left us moved — and changed. Wise, poignant, funny, and inspiring.” — Redbook, Book Club Pick of the MonthOn a dark winter night with little to do, Rivvy Neshama took a Find Your Highest Purpose quiz. And the funny thing was, she found it: to live a sacred life. Problem was, she didn’t know how. But in the weeks and months that followed, she began to remember and encounter all the people and experiences that are featured in this book — from her father’s jokes to her mother’s prayers, from Billie in Harlem to a stranger in Salzburg, and from warm tortillas to the humble oatmeal. Each became a story, like a recipe passed down, beginning with Neshama’s mom and her simple toast to life. Neshama’s true tales, a memoir of sorts, are filled with love, warmth, and timeless wisdom. They ground us, and they lift us up. They make us laugh, and they make us cry. And most of all, they connect us more deeply with the grace and meaning of our lives. “Exquisite storytelling. Written in the spirit of Anne Lamott or Elizabeth Gilbert, Neshama’s stories (and a few miracles) are uplifting, witty, and wise.” — Publishers Weekly",
