But Gabriel, the untouchable proprietor who outbids his patrons, doesn’t want her innocence. Too late Victoria discovers she is a pawn, sent to Gabriel by the very man he will do anything—sacrifice anyone—to kill. Or will he?... Irresistibly drawn to the dangerously beautiful proprietor who has walled himself away from human touch, Victoria vows to free Gabriel. Their passion plunges them into a masterminded game of desire and death where their only hope for survival is to embrace the past and the devastating truth it hides.",
