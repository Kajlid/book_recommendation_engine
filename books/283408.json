  "description": "Advice from my Future Self: Don't Ask Your Best Guy Friend to Give you Nookie Lessons. Oops. Too late.I already begged my rock star BFF to give me lessons in seduction.And sweet, strong, always-has-my-back Shep already let me down easy, proving I have zero game, even with people who profess to care about me.Now, I'll never live down my embarrassment or figure out why I'm a failure with the opposite sex.Or so I assume...until Shep changes his mind, agreeing to three weeks of red hot study buddy time before he goes on tour and we part ways as friends. Shep swears he can't give me what I need in a real relationship, but the more time we spend together, the more certain I am he's the only one who can. And I'm going to pull out all the stops to convince my uber-protective tutor that I can handle anything life--or love--throws our way.",
