The planet is in chaos and the weather patterns have completely shifted, turning most of the world into an uninhabited wasteland.The rich and powerful of North America have pulled back into the six remaining megacities, erasing all trace of a central government and leaving millions displaced by the environmental crisis to fend for themselves in the dying world.

The school for the gifted in Neo York is the only place where she can learn to control her power and reach her potential.Yet the school is not what it seems.

Will his growing love for Maya be strong enough to save them both?",
