  "description": "Lucifer is dead and Hell is under new management.. Ash had lived his life under a deal with a demon, but when the demon asked for more than Ash could give, he killed the demon to save his sister and the woman he loved...and in doing so, Ash landed himself as the new leader of Hell. Ash accepted his fate and asked only one thing in return: He didn't want Elizabeth, the woman who held his heart, not to be a part of his new life. He just wanted her safe and happy, and he asked that they not know each other. Elizabeth was happy as a trauma surgeon until one day she was hit with a deep, dark depression. She feels as though she has lost the love of her life, but can't figure out why she would suddenly feel that way. All she knows is that she keeps seeing flashes of man that she can't really make out in her mind, and feelings of longing for him that make no sense. Ash is now entrenched in his new life and faced with the enormous task of learning to lead Hell. With the help of a Warrior Angel, he is busy recruiting his Elite Guard, yet he can feel that there is something or someone missing from his life and he is determined to find out who or what it is. The Warrior knows about Elizabeth and also knows that God always leads one in the right direction...even the leader of Hell. One touch is all it would take...but he needs to get them together at the right place and the right time. The question is, can he do it before they are found by those who seek their demise?",
