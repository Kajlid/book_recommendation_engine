  "description": "Tough Times is the second installment in the series Ayesha's Teenage Survival Files. Aimed at inspiring more young adults of color to read, the Teenage Survival Files features five smart and sophisticated teens from varied racial and ethnic backgrounds, doing all they can to make it through high school with their sanity and sense of humor intact. Picking up where Crossing Paths left off, the second semester of tenth grade is proving to be almost as trying as the first. Malik is on the warpath and the women in his life are not making matters any better. From Malik's perspective, his mom has lost it, his twin sister has turned into someone he can barely recognize and his best girl, Ayesha, is anything but that right now. How's a guy supposed to maintain his composure when everyone's lost it? And to make matters more interesting, there's a new guy walking the halls of Xavier. Dhru has come to town and he's got everyone talking, but he's not saying a word. The longer he can keep everyone in the dark about anything and everything having to do with him and his family, the better. Or so he thinks. Little does he know that crossing thousands of miles doesn't necessarily mean you get to leave your past behind.",
