  "description": "Bursting onto the comic-book scene in 1941, Plastic Man was a bright spot in a Golden Age of heroes, standing out as one of the most unusual and innovative creations of the time. A reformed criminal turned do-gooder, Plastic Man stretched the definition of the strong-jawed, straight-faced super-hero to its absolute limits. Pitted against an equally odd and colorful group of foes and paired with the indescribably strange sidekick Woozy Winks in the pages of Quality Publishing's Police Comics, \"Plas\" quickly gained in popularity and soon graduated to his own title. Collected here for the first time are the Plastic Man features from the third issue of Plastic Man Comics, and issues 41-49 of Police Comics, all written and drawn by Jack Cole, Plas's creator and one of the most highly regarded talents in the history of comics. This volume also includes an insightful foreword by international comics historian Andreas Knigge.",
