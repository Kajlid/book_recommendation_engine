  "description": "Rescued by the Wolf tells the tale of Lana Boxer, a child-abuse survivor and now social worker for the state of Maryland. Because of her traumatic past, Lana is a woman who is working and living on auto-pilot. The only light in Lanaâ€™s life comes from her friend Jenny, a fellow social worker. One day after a particularly difficult case, Jenny goes missing. Making matters confusing, Jenny re-surfaces but only to let her family know that she will never see them again and to never look for her. That is not good enough for Lana so she searches for Jenny anyway. Finding Jenny turns out to be a lot easier than Lana imagined. However, Lana loses and finds more than what she bargained for when she is bitten by a werewolf.",
