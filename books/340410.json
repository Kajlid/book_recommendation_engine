Incubus Dekin Swain finds himself plucked from his monochrome, sex-feeding lifestyle and thrown into the harsh, chilling world of a traveling carnival freak show. His life gains a vibrant splash of color when he is caged beside a fellow 'freak' who should be his mortal enemy.A prisoner of the carnival long before the demon arrived, Kelly, the 'Scarlet Angel', has almost given up hope of ever escaping his captors. His extraordinary hair and wings quickly catch Dekin's interest and lustful stares.Thrust together by the cold fingers of fate, Dekin and Kelly are forced to put aside their differences and work together. The appearance of an artist with an unusual talent puts the fragile bond between angel and demon to the test. Dekin and Kelly quickly discover that although life together will never be easy, life apart would be unbearable.",
