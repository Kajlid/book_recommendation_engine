  "description": "A Hand in God's Till is a thought-provoking and passionate story of sexual and spiritual awakening, ignited by 1967‘s “Summer of Love”. If you’re fascinated by the era, but too young to have been there, or simply want to revisit this evocative time, A Hand in God’s Till will take you on an unforgettable trip. As the young Adam Busk arrives in London, having been expelled from the strict confines of boarding school, he is hungry for excitement. It is therefore not long before he is absorbed into the burgeoning hippy movement, where the promise of free-love, mind expanding drugs and compelling spiritual ideas are driven by the all pervasive musical soundtrack of the time. Having met the enigmatic Belinda, her subsequent disappearance becomes the catalyst for a mystical quest across England, where the die is cast for the powerful and unsettling events that will spark tragedy and retribution.",
