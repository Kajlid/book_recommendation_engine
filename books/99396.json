  "description": "For free shipping visit http://bookstore.BiblioPublishing.com and enter Goodreads-13 at checkout.My Life With Words is a collection of essays, short stories, classic movie reviews, and poems. On approaching his ninth decade, Aaron compiled this volume of such disparate writings because he believes these short pieces deserve to be shared. Will his writings be of interest to current and future generations? Hopefully, yes, because they provide a view into what was happening on this planet and why, over the course of a long lifetime. As the sages suggest, to understand the present, one needs to know the past.",
