  "description": "A Vivid Glimpse of our Possible Future: Powerful hurricanes dominate Earth’s weather in 2099 as global temperatures soar. The Hurricane Code follows North American climate refugees seeking escape from storms unimaginable by today’s standards. The old saying, “Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it,’ is turned on its head in an age of Quantum computers where Artificial Intelligence runs governments. Will Homo sapiens go extinct, or will our technology eventually save us? This story, a blend of Science and Climate fiction, explores the destiny of humans and all creatures on the planet through the lives of ordinary people and wealthy oligarchs.",
