  "description": "Franny is close to her parents, adores her horse, and is head-over-heels in love with her girlfriend Leah. Her life would be perfect if it wasn’t for the death threats: Franny’s parents are abortion providers at the local hospital, and an anonymous stranger is prepared to use violence to stop them. A stranger who phones at all hours, who knows where they live, who knows Franny’s name. When Leah’s older brother Jake refers to her parents as baby killers, Franny starts to wonder if perhaps the threats aren’t coming from a stranger at all. If she tells the police about her suspicions, she could lose her girlfriend. But if she doesn’t—and if she’s right— she could lose her parents.",
