  "description": "Logan Walsh doesn't do relationships.Clare Thompson doesn't do casual.What could possibly bring them together?Finance bro Logan and tabletop game designer Clare couldn't be more different. They know this because their apartments face each other, and they've noticed. But not, you know, in a creepy way.Still, when they get stuck in the elevator together, sparks fly and they each see an opportunity: Clare needs her co-workers to believe that she is capable of a one-night stand to get them to buy into her new role-play character, and Logan needs a steady girlfriend to prove his maturity to his boss.After one night together, they're keen to get on with their respective plans. Except Clare can't understand why her hook-up seems to want to date her, and Logan is confused that Clare isn't responding to his flirting.A kiss in the rain might clear up any confusion over their chemistry, but this whole 'relationship' thing is a two-player game, and both want to win. With their hearts and their pride on the line, could the prize be love?",
