  "description": "When a stranger attends an evening event in a small town’s art café, his silence and brooding presence unsettle everyone, but three old school-friends in particular. Something stirs from the sludge of their memories. The consequences of a cruel practical joke played thirty years before come back to haunt them, with a disturbing, potentially fatal outcome.",
