She’s learnt first-hand not to rely on anyone and she’s come to terms with the fact that her dream of becoming a wedding dress designer will never happen. Ever since her mother walked out when she was eighteen, and her father dying two years ago after drinking himself into an early grave, she’s had no other choice than to work all the hours God sends as a waitress.Taking care of her teenage brother is paramount. Putting food on the table, clothes on their back, and a roof over their head, as well as making sure Joshua stays out of jail and away from the wrong kind, she’s had her hands full. Being his full-time guardian means he comes first, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. So, there’s no time to enjoy herself with friends and definitely no time for men.Especially a certain man with hypnotic eyes, a gorgeous smile, and the ability to make her heart stutter when he says her name.Zacharia Slater isn’t used to the word ‘no’. His job gives him stature and the private club he frequents, which he is part owner of, tends to his needs. So why, for the best part of a year, is he still pursuing the same woman?When Zach attends an engagement party of a close colleague, he’s left revaluating what he wants from life. Jennifer, the raven-headed server with the icy blue eyes, playing a permanent part in it.After she is attacked, left hospitalized, and in fear for her brother’s safety, will she accept the help from the man who will do anything to keep not just her but her brother safe? Or will she still be determined to push him away and go it alone?This book is intended for mature readers.",
