  "description": "The last thing war vet Travis MacRayne expects to find while house-sitting in Boston is a man like Vincent Clark. Even more unexpected is that Vincent seems to be attracted to Travis, too -- scars, bad leg, and all. But Travis has to go back to Alabama the next day, and a cell phone just doesn't seem like enough to bridge the distance.Itâ€™s the first of many obstacles that Vincent teaches Travis to overcome, and Travis wants nothing more desperately than to believe in the love he feels building inside. Still, the doubts instilled by harsh experience are difficult to put aside. Can Vincent convince Travis that the time is truly right to break free?",
