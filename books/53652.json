  "description": "Are history books giving us the whole story? Or is civilization far more complex and for older than we have been taught?Our school textbooks barely mention the 6,000-year-old Sumerian civilization, yet the latest archaeological findings at sites such as Jericho and, most recently, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey have been dated to 10,000 BC.Civilization goes back at least another 10,000 years, if we are willing to believe what our ancestors themselves claimed.The Lost Civilization Enigma reveals the truth",
