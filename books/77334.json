  "description": "It's another busy morning. Mama is hurrying to get Billy to school and make it to work on time. With Billy dawdling and fussing over his stuffed rabbit, it seems they might never get there. And when they finally do arrive at school, Mama rushes off, forgetting two really crucial things! The familiar frenzy of getting ready is warmly portrayed in this comforting tale. The affirmative ending will reassure children that no matter how busy parents are, they always remember what's most important.",
