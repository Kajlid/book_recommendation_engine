  "description": "--Ask how you can win an hour in time- Marae O'Conaire has much bigger problems than the fact her watch stopped at 3:57 p.m. When she brings her watch to a kindly repairman, she learns she has won a peculiar prize, a chance to re-live a single hour of her life. But Fate has strict rules about how one can go poking in the past, including the warning that she can't do anything that would create a time-paradox. Can Marae make peace with the mistake she regrets most in this world?",
