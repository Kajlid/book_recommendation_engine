  "description": "KNIGHTSCARES #2 SKULL IN THE BIRDCAGE Beware the Skull with the Hourglass Tattoo! It's the day Connor has been waiting for his whole life. The day he is supposed to begin training as a knight. Then why is everything going so wrong? Connor and his friend Simon, a boy with a talent for magic, soon find themselves caught between goblins and skeletons in an ancient castle buried deep underground. When they stumble upon a talking skull locked in a rusty, old birdcage, it could cost them their lives. The 8-book Knightscares series features many favorites from the epic fantasy genre. Encounter dragons, witches and wizards, goblins, swords and sorcery, centaurs, griffons, and dwarves. Oh, my! Readers will also meet a host of unique magical monsters and fantastic creatures found nowhere else. If Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Goosebumps were mixed in a cauldron and sprinkled with magic, the result would be the face-paced, kid-friendly Knightscares series.
