  "description": "Stormy Sprague is convinced he's always in trouble because he just can't think or act like everyone else. One minute he's being pushed around; the next he's in trouble with a teacher and serving time in detention with all the other \"misfits\". Who would think the bunch they call \"the dregs of the detention dungeon\" would form a floor hockey team and have the nerve to compete against the unbeatable Screaming Eagles?The challenge is one big joke as far as the Screaming Eagles are concerned. But these wiseguys underestimate Stormy and the Dregs who have their own game plan - for dealing with bullies, and for winning the trophy cup. And it's all based on being just a bunch of nuts!",
