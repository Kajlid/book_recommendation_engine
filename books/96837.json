  "description": "This edition is no longer available.Dear Author,He enters my cell daily at ten pm. He leaves in the morning at six am. He never says a word. Never moves from where he sits right beside the thick steel door. He does not beat me. He doesn't take me to the tiled room at the end of the corridor. He doesn't goad me, smirk when I wince afterwards, cry, or scream. I'm not sure what he does when I drift off, into deep, exhausted, pain-drenched sleep. I think he just watches. A fixture, a security, so they may state that I'm not left unattended. Sometimes I wish...Photo Description:While the cell is sparse and cold, at least this one has a bed. The figure resting there is too thin; too still, the prominent bones the result of long starvation, the stillness the product of too much anguish and abuse. He watches, though. An anxious, intelligent mind still occupies this frail and failing body, one that watches and wonders about the new guard occupying his cell each night.Genre: science fictionTags: futuristic, dystopia, security, guard, prison-captivity, darkWord Count: 10,361Content warnings: violence, medical experimentation, attempted rape, semi-explicit descriptions of past abuse and torture.NOTE: This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event.
