  "description": "Someone is killing off Wall Street’s shadiest financiers, and only Silas Cade can get to the bottom of itWith breakneck pacing, nonstop action, and cutting-edge details of today’s financial intelligence technology, Clawback offers a thrill-a-minute narrative set in the world of Too Big to Fail. Silas Cade, a black-ops vet and gray-zone contractor, is no stranger to gunslinging or shady finance. After coming home from America’s wars abroad, he becomes an “accountant”—the go-to for Wall Street financiers who need jobs done quickly, quietly, and by any means necessary. Hired by a major player to visit a tanking hedge fund manager and extract ten million dollars in clawback—the mandatory return of compensation paid on a deal that goes bad—Silas instead discovers that someone is killing off bankers all over New York.",
