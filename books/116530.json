  "description": "Subject: Lieutenant Jameson Cartwright Current Status: Out of commission…and totally in lust! It was the cat's fault. Otherwise Jameson Cartwright wouldn't have tripped and ruined not only his knee, but also his newly minted air force career and the Cartwright family pride. Now he's lying low and miserable—until the girl he tormented as a kid comes breezing through his door, looking fresh and sexy. This time, it's his turn to be exquisitely and thoroughly tortured…. Grief counselor Kendra Lonergan isn't sure she wants to help the (mouthwateringly hot) guy who once put worms in her sandwich. Still—he needs her badly. But it's not long before \"professional\" turns into provocative, and the sexual tension is off the charts. And there is only one way to get this scrumptious airman back in service….",
