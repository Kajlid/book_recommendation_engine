  "description": "On Our Way Home is a novel about Aidan Fisher, a young man struggling to define and, ultimately, to begin his life in the years following the unsolved death of his mother and the suicide of her tormented ex-boyfriend. Raised from age ten by his maternal grandparents, his only surviving family members, Aidan grows hungry for answers about a past and a tragedy that haunted his formative years. Will he find the answers he seeks by returning to his childhood home and moving back into the bedroom from which he heard the gunshot, from which he emerged motherless and rootless and deeply wounded? Will he find answers in a relationship of his own? Are there answers, at all? Aidan's pursuit of them will push him beyond the limits of his sanity-all to find that lost place he considers home.",
