Five years since he decided our friendship was less important than our parents’ fight. So when we’re forced to practice a duet together, I expect him to keep our contact to a minimum.  Instead, he’s telling me the feud between our parents has gone on long enough. That he misses me and wants to fix things between us.  But I’m not going to fall for it. I won’t fall for his charms like so many other girls have in the past.  If only my stupid heart would listen to my brain. Because kissing the boy next door is no way to fix a family feud.  Or is it?  1 town. 1 high school. 12 sweet romances.Read Kissing the Boy Next Door from Judy Corry. It is the third installment of the Sweet Water High Multi-Author Series.
