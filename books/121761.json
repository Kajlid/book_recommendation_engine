  "description": "As far as job hazards go, Douglass Fraser didn't think crash-landing on an alien planet and spending her recuperation being erotically pleasured by three gorgeous men was in the United Planetary Parcel Service's courier handbook. There certainly wasn't a section on what to do when a very sexy king wants you to have his baby and save his world.Marcus Blood Axe isn't only a descendant of ancient Viking space travelers, he's also a ruler dealing with a shortage of fertile women and no heir. Surely the gods are on his side when Douglass drops out of the sky and into his bed, giving him a last chance to stop his people's death spiral into extinction.Despite the exquisite pleasures to be found in the king's arms, Douglass wants more from Marcus than to be his broodmare. When another woman claims to be pregnant with Marcus' child, it's past time to get back home. Now the war Marcus wages is one of sensual passion designed to convince his Earth woman that she's worth everything to himâ€¦even if it means giving up what he cherishes most.",
