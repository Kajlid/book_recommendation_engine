  "description": "I pull into the diner of this small mountain town, knowing there's only two things I want:Â To put down roots and find someone to build a life with. And when I slide into the booth, the woman who pours me a cup of joe is sweet as sugar and warm as apple pie. She serves me up a \"Josie Special\" and I know she's made to order--the only woman for me. My past is dark, too dark for a ray of light like her. But she cracks open the clouds and lets the sunshine in ... she sees me as the man I can become. Her father wants me gone. He thinks he knows all about me. But he's wrong, and I'll do whatever I can to clear my name. For Josie. For our love. For the life we will build together. Dear Reader, You're going to melt when you meet Beau Montgomery--he's BUILT, if you know what I mean. He's all man, all alpha--and all yours. This mountain is full of babies, and he's gonna make one fine baby-daddy--guaranteed! xo, frankie",
