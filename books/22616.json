When Sandy decides to babysit for the Johnsons, she has no clue that their daughter Cassie has a special talent. In matter of fact, Cassie's own family does not know what she can do. After they awake to a massive electrical storm and utter darkness, Sandy discovers on a weather-band radio that, after a mysterious crash, their chunk of town has been transported away in a bubble of space and time where creatures are at war. Before anyone knows what is happening, death and mayhem darken the streets of the coastal town of Ventura. Cassie confesses her secret to Sandy and says has figured out she can travel, as Sandy understands the little girl, hyper-dimensionally. Sandy is worried, not because of a five-year-old child's claim, but because she witnesses it herself. As Sandy and Cassie fight for their lives with other survivors, it is Cassie and her gift that may offer them a second chance. If Cassie can get to the crash site, maybe she can use her ability to get their chunk of town back and prevent the effect of the crash from expanding and destroying the world, provided Sandy can keep her alive long enough. Babysitting has never been so tough.",
