  "description": "My name is Jake Sheppard and I’m ambivalent about Christmas and the Christmas-themed town I grew up in. But when I find out my late uncle left me an old barn and acres of land, the decision to return home to build my dream golf course is an easy one. Imagine my surprise when I arrive and find out I have a squatter. An incredibly sexy squatter, with wavy blonde hair, green eyes, a free spirit… and a herd of goats. Sutton hates my guts. Apparently evicting a non-paying non-tenant and her goats weeks before Christmas is grounds for war. Except Sutton's version of war includes flinging her clothing at me and, as it turns out, I might be in way over my head with this girl… Warning: Christmas in Reindeer Falls is more naughty than nice. These stories are over-the-top festive with merrily-ever-afters guaranteed. Novella length for quick holiday binge reading. Enjoy!",
