  "description": "Rumpole defends Charles Hearthstoke against charges of keeping bawdy houses, in the form of his chain of massage parlors. The case has become quite a scandal since many customers were prominent members of the community and to Rumpole's astonishment, paid with credit cards. Guthrie Featherstone, who sought a massage for an injury now thinks that may be identified as one of the patrons and Rumpole cunningly arranges for him to preside at Hearthstoke's trial.",
