  "description": "Ani Maxima has recently found a new friend that truly cares about her. The only problem is, she only gets to see this friend while she’s dreaming. For the past month, Ani has been getting visits from a little girl who seems to feel a real desire to take care of her. Unfortunately, she never gets to talk to this little girl unless she’s dreaming. It’s probably a good thing however that this little girl wasn’t a physical person. Otherwise she might have gone down in the same plane crash as Ani, Cyril, and her parents.The Ani Maxima Files:Ptolemy’s Child SuperVirusVeiled SkyEnigmaFlying in the RainSilent LucidityFlesh and BloodSoul SisterSocial AnimalBrought to you by the international bestselling author of the Mystic Saga, Dominion, Beyond the Event Horizon, Maelstrom, Endeavor, and Ghosts of Ophidian.
