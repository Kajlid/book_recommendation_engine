Offering both prose and verse in an accessible, chronological order, this collection also includes usefulappendices on \"St. Agnes' Eve\" and \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci,\" and provides a handy glossary of classical names. Keats poetry and his letters reveal a spirit of questing vitality and profound understanding. This remarkable volume attests to an astonishing maturity of power.",
