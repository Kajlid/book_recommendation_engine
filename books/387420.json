  "description": "\"I believe you have visitors,\" Giff said, setting the coronet on its velvet stand.\"I know.\" I rubbed my forehead where the pale line showed from wearing the gold band. \"People waiting on me and I have hat lines.\"Lissa expected her life as Queen of Le-Ath Veronis to run smoothly. At least for a little while. Reality has a way of intruding on even the most idyllic of circumstances. Complications arise in the form of creatures created by the Ra'Ak; creatures who now seem bent on destroying the universe, one planet at a time. The former Ra'Ak and Elemaiya who were left on Kifirin are determined to rebel; vampires are clamoring for entertainment and other distractions on Le-Ath Veronis and family that Lissa never suspected she had show upâ€”some of them in the most unexpected of ways. Lissa is forced to juggle the difficulties in her life while dealing with the ugliest of betrayals.",
