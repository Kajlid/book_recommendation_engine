  "description": "Three days ago, I didn’t even know Simon Cambridge existed. If it wasn’t for one drunken night out with my friends, I would never have met Mr. Cocky Pants. I certainly never would have entered into a bet with him if I’d known then what I know now. And if I hadn’t lost the bet, I wouldn’t have to work for him for the next month. Today is only day one, and he’s already driving me crazy.Ms. Gemma Whitestone,I expected you in the office at 7 a.m. You’re tardy. Not a great look for your first day.Your boss,Simon CambridgeSimon,I’d hardly call you my boss. It’s not like I wanted this job. I’ll be in as soon as I can make it.Doing you a favor,Gemma WhitestoneGem Gem,If this is just a favor, then I know something else I’d prefer more. Meet me at my place at 10 p.m.Your boss and soon-to-be lover,SimoMr. Cambridge,That’s not appropriate language to be used with a member of your employ. I will be there in thirty minutes.Your secretary for a month,Ms. WhitestoneP.S. If anything were to go down, it would be at my place, not yours.Gemma,Send me the address, and I’ll come right now.SimonAs I stared at the emails on my phone, I contemplated not showing up. Having the cocky, grumpy, irresistibly handsome Simon Cambridge as my boss for the next thirty days would test every part of me, and I wasn’t sure I would last two days without ripping him to pieces or ripping his shirt off. And I wasn’t really sure which one I wanted to do most.",
