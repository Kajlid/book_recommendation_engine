  "description": "Where there are roses there’s dead bodies and no one knows this better than Poppy Rae Mamadou. Out of college and in debt, she has no choice but to take a job at her family’s P.I. firm in Seattle. When her stiff sniffing ability leads her to a notorious homicide with kinky overtones, her life quickly spins out of control. The police label her a suspect, the media can’t get enough of her, a killer wants her dead and the good looking young detective wants a piece of her. If only she wasn’t such a Virgin Detective. As the bodies pile up, it’s up to Poppy Rae to prove her innocence but who will believe her? Telling the truth never sounded so unbelievable.",
