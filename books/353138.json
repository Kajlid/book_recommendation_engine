  "title": "The Beleaguered Lord Bourne",
  "description": "MISCHIEF IN MARR1AGE The Earl of Bourne wanted no part of married life. After years of danger in foreign wars, he was eager to plunge into a campaign of Conquests among the long lists of London lovelies who would give their all to please a man as well-born well-financed, and well-favored as he. Miss Jane Maitland wanted to be wed even less than did the libertine lord. As proud as she was beautiful, she would never let any man enslave her -- much less claim her body, and woe to any foolhardy enough to try. But now the wedding bells were tolling for them both--sounding the call to battle for this militant miss and martial lord in the perfect mismatch.",
