  "description": "Mike Gauliet could be a world class swimmer if he took care of himself better. He's too good to let go, so his team coach calls in a private trainer, up-and-coming hardass Jessy Turner. Jessy locks Mike down, putting him on a strict regimen of diet and exercise that Mike resents a lot until he finds himself becoming a better swimmer for it. Jessy finds Mike all but irresistible, but he stays away to begin with, making decisions based on what's best for Mike's career. The two of them resist their attraction to each other for as long as they can, but sooner or later they have to give into the heat between them. When things go wrong, though, can they, and their sports careers, survive the strain? CB Potts, author of Tuesday's Rubies, says, \"(Sean) Michael is to be commended. Fans of sports smut, such as myself, are sure to be pleased with the mix of athleticism and eroticism, and romance fans will love the emotional heights and depths the couple journey through.\" Pick up this hot, athletic romance today! And look for Personal Best II, a Going for the Gold novel, on shelves next to Personal Best!",
