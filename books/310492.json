  "description": "Highland war heroes rebuilding their lives grapple with ladies forging their own paths—who will win?Regency Scotland comes alive in the vibrant and sexy new SCOTS OF HONOR series by USA TODAY bestselling author Eliza Knight. Scottish military heroes, who want nothing more than to lay low after the ravages of war in 19th century France, find their Highland homecomings vastly contradict their simple desires. Especially when they meet the feisty lasses who are tenacious enough to take them on, and show them just what they’ve been missing out of life. In battle they can’t be beaten, but in love, they all find the ultimate surrender.Scarred by the brutal ravages of war, Lorne Gordon, Duke of Sutherland and Colonel in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, returns to the Highlands to discover that his clan thought him long dead. His greedy half-brother has assumed his title, sold his family seat, and disappeared with the fortune. Once he engineers the return of his title, he must convince the new estate owner to reverse the wholly legal sale with the promise that his half-brother and the funds will be found. However, that goal seems impossible when Lorne discovers the buyer is none other than the sister of his ex-betrothed.",
