Problem is she doesn’t know any of this yet.But she’s about to find out—and fast. Her powers are awakening, and Grace is in danger as her transformation reignites an ages-old war between her clan and an evil rival witch faction that will stop at nothing to see Grace dead so their leader, the vicious, ruthless Catherine, can harness Grace’s incredible powers for her own dark purposes.It’s up to Grace’s immortal Aunt Evelyn and her best friend Julie—a shape shifter from a long line of Native American mystics—to defend her. She also has James on her side, a witch from the Bolingbroke clan that has vowed since Grace’s birth to keep her safe. From the moment they meet, the two share a fierce supernatural attraction—a white-hot heat that neither can resist. Will their undying love protect her or put her in greater danger? Only time will tell, and time for Grace is running out.",
