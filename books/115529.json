Not only to protect their wellbeing – but for their destruction. Seventeen year old, Myla believes herself to be human despite her inhuman quirks. She begins to question her true lineage only when she meets Josh. He’s dangerous. He’s handsome. He’s captivatingly cocky. He’s everything she should run from – but he’s her only chance at survival. Burdened by a prophecy – bound by a curse, Myla has no choice but to accept the only help she has been offered. Forced from her home and the only life she’d ever known, Myla embarks on the adventure that challenges every fabricated illusion she’d crafted about the world she thought she knew. As the frightening reality of the world she’d been born to walk in unfolds around her, Myla is forced to adapt in order to survive. But she never took into consideration the embers of desire burning in the depth of her heart. When loving someone who can’t love in return becomes too much, too painful, the heart must either build a wall or take a chance at crumbling.",
