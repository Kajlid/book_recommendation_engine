  "title": "Paris Talks: Addresses Given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 1911",
  "description": "Despite old age and poor health, Abdu'l-Baha set out from Palestine in 1911 on a momentous series of journeys to Europe and the United States. The purpose of his trip was to share the teachings and vision of the Baha'i Faith with the people of the West. This collection of inspiring and uplifting talks documents an extraordinary series of public addresses 'Abdu'l-Baha gave on his historic trip to the West in the early twentieth century. Addressing such subjects as the nature of humankind, the soul, the Prophets of God, the establishment of world peace, the abolition of all forms of prejudice, the equality of men and women, the harmony of science and religion, and the causes of war, Abdu'l-Baha spoke in a profound yet simple manner that transcended all barriers.",
