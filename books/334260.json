  "title": "Critical Race Theory and Woke Culture: America's Dangerous Repeat of China's Cultural Revolution",
  "description": "As the radical left introduces socialism and uses Critical Race Theory, censorship, cancel culture, and racial division to tear down America, there is reason for grave concern over the future of the country. Unfortunately, it appears that history is repeating itself and America is in danger of a cultural revolution from which it will not be able to recover.Based on his firsthand experience of the horrors of communism, Mike Zhao crafted Critical Race Theory & Woke Culture / America's Dangerous Repeat of China's Cultural Revolution to reveal how the radical left is using the Maoist playbook to destroy America. He provides a striking overview of the similar tactics used, which include employing divisive Marxist ideologies, changing cultural values, rewriting history, indoctrinating citizens, and silencing the opposition.",
