  "description": "Marissa Worse than the lies they had told were the ones the continued to perpetuate - the ones that at times made me doubt even myself. But I knew what had happened, knew what they had done to her , and I was the only one left to exact her vengeance for everything they had done. Getting in had been far easier than I had expected, or perhaps I had simply become so good at playing their game. Staying here on the other hand was where the difficulty lay, because the boy with the auburn hair and nice smile seemed to see through all the brittle lies that I told. Mack She's different. Different to any other Society girl that I had met, but it was more than that. Because it was almost as if she didn't want to be here, even after fighting for a place among the elite. A paradox - an enigma - a beauty that seemed to rival those that had been bred for this life. Call her what you liked, but Marissa was more than just a Society recruit, and I was determined to find out exactly who she was and why she was here - even if my blood sang each time she pressed her lips against mine.",
