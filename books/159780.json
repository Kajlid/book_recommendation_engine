Good food relies on skillful shopping, and The New English Kitchen is a hard-hitting guide to the most controversial food issues, helping you make the right decisions whether buying tuna or veal, milk or prawns. It also brims with suggestions, from exploring the flavours of unexploited fish, choosing inexpensive cuts of meat, to cooking with the new artisan British cheeses. With over 280 easy and distinctive recipes, and a mine of quick ideas, Rose Prince shows how everyone can eat economically and well, every single day.",
