  "description": "Max has just returned from the Peace Corps and is crashing with pediatrician Harrison. Dealing with her return to Western civilization, her long-divorced parents dating again and the feelings she is trying not to develop for the dashing doctor may just drive her crazy. Then again, if he reciprocates . . .Robin relishes her job as an executive sous-chef in a trendy restaurant almost as much as she savors her friendship with its owner, Michael. But Robin knows she wants much more. So how do you make someone who knows you so well look at you with fresh eyes? Then, artsy Lilith. When she and her boyfriend realize they've been getting more sleep than sex, they agree to \"see other people,\" which turns into quite a nightmare. Lastly there are sisters Riv and Anne. Between them, they've got enough secrets to keep anyone awake at night. Part Sex and the City, part Little Women Stacey Ballis's Sleeping Over examines relationships both romantic and platonic (and platonic wanting to be romantic), and looks at the various configurations of what it means to spend the night together. Stacey Ballis is the Director of Education and Community Programs at The Goodman Theater in Chicago. In addition to writing, she throws a heck of a dinner party.
