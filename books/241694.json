  "description": "A two act play for 7 males and 1 female. From the publisher's \"Jeffrey, a gay actor/waiter, has sworn off sex after too many bouts with his partners about what is \"safe\" and what is not. In gay New York, though, sex is not something you can avoid. Whether catering a ditzy socialite's \"how-down for AIDS\" or cruising at a funeral; at the gym or in the back rooms of an anonymous sex club; at the annual Gay Pride Parade, or in the libidinous hands of a father-confessor, Jeffrey finds the pursuit of love and just plain old physical gratification to be the number one preoccupation of his times - and the source of plenty of hilarity.\"",
