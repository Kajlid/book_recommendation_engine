But for a stunned and grieving daughter, the nightmare was hust beginning. Racing to Biloxi for answers, Lynne found the police investigation in chaos.

Lynne, armed with a savvy private eye -- and a .357 Magnum -- set out to accomplish what the authorities could not or would not do: hunt down her parents' assassins and bring them to justice.Pulitzer Prize-winner Edward Humes delivers a shocking and bizarre tale set against a teeming underworld of merciless killers, ruthless con men, and venal politicians. \"Mississippi Mud\" portrays how one woman's steely obsession for the truth shook a city to its foundation -- and nearly destroyed everything she loved.",
