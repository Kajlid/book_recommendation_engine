  "description": "Growing up, I had one rule: stay away from my brother’s best friend.It was easy to follow. I spent my years avoiding the boys on the baseball team, studying hard, and saving every dime I could. When I was accepted to transfer into UC Berkeley, I needed a place to live, and my brother had a free room off-campus.Win-win, right? Except that best friend I was determined to stay away from is now my new roommate.My very naughty, very rebellious roommate, Wesley Knight.The boy who was once the bane of my existence with his constant teasing is now a drop-dead gorgeous athlete. He’s the life of the party, but I can’t have fun. According to Wes, no guys are allowed to talk to me.Well, two can play at this game. If I can’t date, then neither can he.It starts off as innocent fun. Some half-naked yoga or a little flirting until an interrupted moment of self-gratification turns things dangerous … for my body and my heart.Living with my brother and his best friend has me breaking all the rules. I just have to decide if the consequences are worth the reward.",
