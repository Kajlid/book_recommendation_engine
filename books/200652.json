  "description": "Closely related to the Bardic Voices series this book falls between The Robin & the Kestrel and The Eagle & the Nightingales.The power of choice...A strange pall has settled over Alanda. Everywhere representatives of the Church seek to ferret out unauthorized magic â€“ and music, because it is magic at its roots, has come under suspicion. And that which is suspect, if it cannot be crushed altogether, must be stripped of its mystery, made tame and answerable to the power of the priests. Throughout the lands the Free Bards, those who will not or cannot join the priest-condoned Guild, are being driven away. But all who are Free are free to choose: To flee or to fight.",
