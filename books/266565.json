  "description": "For Tori, the holiday season was rarely merry and bright.  Raised by an alcoholic mother after her father's death, Christmas never held much joy for her. But Scott wants to change all that for his bride-to-be. His only goal is to show her the season can still be full of joy and light.  However, in spite of Scott's best efforts, nothing goes according to plan. The holiday season is shaping up to be a disaster. That is, until a stranger unexpectedly bestows upon him the one gift that could be the miracle he needs to save Christmas.  Tori stopped believing in miracles a long time ago. Can Scott finally restore her long-lost faith in the holiday season?  Dream by the Fire is a 27,000 word Christmas novella and an extension of Scott and Tori’s trilogy, (but can be read as a standalone). It contains adult language, and steamy scenes by the fire and a happy holiday ending to warm your heart. Meant for a mature audience.",
