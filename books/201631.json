  "description": "Angel is my name. A name I despise. A name that haunts me. I've been a prisoner for nearly four years. Trapped. Held against my will. I fear I'll never escape, and then he saves me. Logan. His face is my undoing. His smile is my haven, and the sexy way he blushes when I catch him watching me becomes my addiction. He's everything I don't deserve, but everything I need. He's my hero, but yet so much more. I'll try to escape my nightmares, but I'll stumble from the weight of it all. With the help of new friends, lost family, and a romance that turns my whole world. I'll try to outrun my past. Outrun Angel. *WARNING* Not appropriate for ages under 18. Some material/scenes are not appropriate for young readers, and some readers may find them difficult to read.",
