  "description": "BREAK THE BONDS, FREE THE FAE Becoming a faery was enough to keep me alive… but that's the only good it did me. Now, I've got a trash-load of magic I don't know how to use, and my skin's coated in pixie dust that keeps acting out violently. On top of that, Ien is still hunting me and the other faeries. He wants to use us to break the bonds tying fae to their gone and forgotten mates, causing them constant pain. If we can beat him to the punch and figure out a way to do it ourselves, we just might survive this. It doesn't sound too difficult: Break the bonds, free the fae. But Ien's been three steps ahead of us this whole time… and we might just be playing right into his fingers. *This new-adult fantasy features sarcasm, mermaids, and slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance.",
