  "description": "“Yeah, well I don’t want to do you either. Being friends sounds just perfect.”  That's not exactly true, but it seems like the right thing for Beatrice to say to the angry man in front of her. Because yes; she had a thing with Day ten years ago. Yes, it was five minutes. Yes, it's pathetically enough probably still the best sex in her whole goddamned life. And yes, she used it to kickstart her new career. A career that has hit a snag.  Day loves his home, but hates the memories he can't seem to let go of. Thirty years of trying to escape have not eased the pain, and now he's forced to stop running. He's frustrated and furious, and to top it all off - he blurted out that he only wanted to be friends with the curvaceous, and stunningly gorgeous woman living in his guesthouse. And the goddamned woman agreed.  A dead woman and secrets from the past seep into the everyday life of a headstrong couple, who slowly learn to rely on each other when life turns rough.  Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
