  "title": "Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith",
  "description": "Hang on, it's a hell of a ride!   From the band that lived by the motto \"Anything worth doing was worth overdoing\" — Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford, and Joey Kramer — comes a quarter century of rock godhood: the life, the music, the truth, the hell, the lost years, and the raunchy, unsafe sex. And, of course, the drugs. But after crashing in a suffocating cloud of cocaine, crystal meth, and heroin, Aerosmith rose up from the ashes to become clean and sober — and reclaim their rightful title as World Champion Rockers. Learn how they did it in a book that is pure Aerosmith unbound: where they came from, what they are now, and what they will always be — a great American band.",
