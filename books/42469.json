  "description": "Sylvia Meyer, a successful lawyer, has committed suicide. This drives her son Lucas to trace back the paths that may provide him with clues to find answers beyond her factual decision to die. He suddenly realizes that he did not actually know neither who his mother was or how she had lived. A counterpoint of past and present voices whispering into his ears outline a tormented image in which the blending of background and figure enables us to recognize masks that we all perhaps wear but dare not name. ++++ Marta Merajver Kurlat's exquisitely written tale of a young man's journey towards understanding his mother's painful life and suicide is a hard novel to put down. The book's narrative is vivid, and thought-provoking psychological dimensions contribute to a literary piece that will engage serious readers. -Virginia Shiller, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, New Haven, Connecticut \"What's the point of living if you're nothing?... This novel does not attempt to provide specific answers to this question. This novel,",
