  "description": "Often described as the “Great American Novel,” F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is the quintessential story of love, ambition, and wealth in the Roaring Twenties. In the Long Island village of West Egg, the rich and mysterious Jay Gatsby pursues the now-married Daisy Buchanan, whom he last saw five years ago, before amassing his fortune. Along with the eleven short stories from Fitzgerald’s collection Tales of the Jazz Age—including “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”—this handsome Word Cloud edition makes a fine addition to anyone’s bookshelf.",
