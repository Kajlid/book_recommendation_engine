  "description": "Jared was the school’s darling of the baseball team, with one major flaw. He was failing math. Fortunately, the teacher ‘assigns’ her best pupil; Scott. Scott is overweight, shy, and very aware he ranks just above an amoeba in popularity. How could he and Jared possibly work together, much less develop any semblance of a friendship?The tutoring begins, as do Jared’s daily visits to Scott’s house. Rumors abound as to why they never visit his house, all of them ending with lame excuses and unanswered questions. This goes on for months until the new, strong friendship had developed an unbreakable bond. On one sunny afternoon, almost all of the questions are answered, except for one.That night, a shocking atrocity brings the teens back together to rally at each other’s side. The truth is out; Jared has been abused by his father for years! He hid it as best he could; but that night he’d not only told his father off, he told him he was gay and in love with Scott.Can this new relationship stand the test of both school and their impending graduation? Scott asks a serious question and doesn’t quite get the answer he expected. Everything is up in the air. What will win? Their love or go their separate ways?",
