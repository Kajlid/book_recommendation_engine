Instead, she’s in Russia to fight for the Alphaship of her family’s pack, a battle that won’t end until either she or Ryker are dead. She’s steadier now, stronger, and more in control of the natural born Alpha powers that make her a threat, but her powers are growing, and she has no idea how they’ll react in a fight to the death. Elena returns to the country where her parents were murdered, to a pack who don’t know her and who doubt her ability to lead. Political intrigue and deadly plots await at every turn, making it hard to know who to trust. To win the Alphaship and her life, she’ll need to trust her mate, her friends, The Sisterhood, and herself. But how do you trust something that refuses to be harnessed and threatens to consume you and everyone you love?",
