  "description": "\"There are evil people carrying out evil acts across the world, and the only ones who can stop them are other humans. In spite of this, so many people simply turn a blind eye to the need for justice. Your new abilities are intended to aid you in the fight.” Luke let out what sounded remarkably like a frustrated sigh. “Your world will crumble around you if you do not fight back.” Matt Reynolds knows he isn't crazy. But on the day he turns sixteen, he begins to question that assumption. First he starts seeing invisible creatures, and then he meets a stranger who tells him he needs to save the world. With the help of a few new friends and his burgeoning powers, he has just days to uncover the nefarious plot of one of the most powerful men in Madison before the balance of good and evil shifts irrevocably.",
