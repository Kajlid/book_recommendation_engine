  "description": "\"I wonder if my first breath was as soul-stirring to my mother as her last breath was to me.\"   How do you let go of a hand you've held your whole life? When Lisa traveled home to visit her parents in December 2011, she never expected an ordinary three-day weekend to turn into an extraordinary 14-day observance of her mother’s life – and ultimately – death. 14 Days is a story of parental loss, and how to lovingly, bravely and gracefully let go of a hand you’ve been holding your entire life.  From a child’s first breath, to a mother’s last, this memoir shows how closing that circle can be a celebration of this unbreakable bond.",
