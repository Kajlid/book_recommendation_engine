  "description": "Life is full of surprises, like a weekend trip to Cabo San Lucas. Before Joel Fleming can surprise his girlfriend, he discovers she’s stripped his house and bailed on the relationship. But maybe something good can come out of losing everything. Joel has three days and two nights in Mexico. Who better to take than his best friend, Asher Paton.But Asher has a few surprises of his own. He’d have thought Joel would’ve figured him out by now. Asher is gay, and his perfect boyfriend would be someone he likes enough to love, a best friend as a lover. The only problem is the best friend he wants is straight and just might be on the rebound. Maybe to the rest of the world, Joel appears to have life by the balls, but Asher knows his friend deserves better. That doesn’t mean Joel will want him as anything more than a Weekend Boyfriend.",
