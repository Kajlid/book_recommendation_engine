  "description": "After winning a custody battle Arielle Taylor moves to Portus Felix to start a new life with her nephew while she undergoes surgery for breast cancer. But when her junkie sister finds her, Jolene brings the attention of an angry outlaw biker straight to Arielle's doorstep—bent on payback.  Deadly, strong and fiercely loyal, Quentin's unassuming calm belies a man willing to get his hands dirty for the Dead Men Riders MC who’d been his only family. When a biker groupie seduces him into his bed, he gets more than a night of pleasure after she drugs him unconscious and steals his money, leading him straight to his neighbor's house.  But when he first sets eyes on Arielle, he is blown away by her beauty and innocence. And when he accidentally strikes up a relationship with her eight-year-old nephew, he finds himself falling hard for a woman who manages to get under his skin and crack his hard exterior. He doesn't do sweet. He doesn't like sweet. He owes it to sweet to just leave it alone and walk away. But their attraction is instant and explosive—and one neither of them can afford… nor resist.  But when the club finds a connection between a current threat and Arielle, it jeopardizes everything that he has ever believed in. And soon he finds himself not only having to keep Arielle safe from a mysterious drug lord but his own club—his family—threatens the only woman he's ever fallen in love with.  Will Quentin choose Duty over Love? Or will he betray his own club to save a woman who is already dying?  Suitable for ages 18+ for strong language, scenes of violence and scenes of a sexual nature.
