  "title": "Regina in the Sun",
  "description": "Theres only one place left to run-into forbidden arms. When she arrives at Ye Olde Haven Pub, the sanctuary for Trueblood Vampires, Regina is wounded and desperate. Her only thought is to save the Deva Clan, her family, from the dangerous Loups De L?Ombre, the Shadow Wolves. She knows she will not exactly be welcomed with open arms. She is, after all, an Unborn, the lowest caste of Vampire.  As a natural born from the purest line, Zander Sariel knows the rules are sacrosanct-a Trueblood mates with his own kind. But one taste of the young Unborn is all Zander needs to know that rules were made to be broken.  With enemies at every turn, Zander risks everything to save Regina from the monster that hunts her, his own kind?s ignorance and-if he must-her lack of faith in her own unique abilities. Only together do they have a chance to defeat the shadow that haunts their future, and save their entire race from extinction.  Warning, this title contains the explicit sex, voyeurism of an m/m/f m?nage?a plethora of vampire nookie.",
