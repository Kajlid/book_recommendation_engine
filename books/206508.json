  "title": "Mick Jagger: Primitive Cool",
  "description": "For all his vast and enduring fame, Mick Jagger remains enigmatic to the public eye. Decades of press reports, culminating in the publication of sensationalist biographies like last year's Jagger Unauthorized, have painted him as nothing more than a walking libido, a sex machine with little more on his mind than groupies and guitars.Rock journalist Christopher Sandford offers as an alternative the first truly comprehensive biography of the premiere Rolling not just the mayhem and the models, but the man and the music. His insight into Jagger's English childhood - including exclusive interviews with his parents and his first musical partners - is unparalleled. His understanding of how the Stones made their music into the world's greatest rock 'n' roll - informed by rare detail contributed by Ian Stewart, the Stones's late pianist - is profound. And his portrait of this paradoxical rocker - wild, abandoned, raucous on stage; cool, shrewd, ambitious in his real life - gets past the facade to uncover the creative artist who even today retains both credibility and bite.No punches are Besides covering the romps with Bianca and Jerry, Bardot and Trudeau, Mick Primitive Cool is the first book to contain excerpts from Jagger's FBI file, obtained by the author under the Freedom of Information Act. But Sandford's biography tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the Mick plain and simple, pure energy, primitive cool.",
