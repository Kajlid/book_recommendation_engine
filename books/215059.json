  "description": "A cure has been found for both the Infection and Vampirism, and Porschia Grant must take this news out of the colony. Between her friends volunteering to go with her and a well-planned route, the first journey should be easy. But when they make it to Mountainside, things are strange. The people are frightened of female night-walkers and won’t say why.  When the excursion takes a wrong turn, Porschia’s friends make a decision that will impact the rest of their lives. They expect to save Porschia from the evil contained in The Manor; they don’t expect to have to save her from herself.  When everything goes wrong, who will be left to pick up the pieces and save Ford from a threat no one could have seen coming?  What will happen when they risk everything to save one?  Suggested reading order for The Frenzy Series: Frenzy, Frantic, Frequency, Friction and Fraud.",
