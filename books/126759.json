  "description": "Al Kooper began his professional career in 1958 at the age of fourteen. Kooper's quirky keyboard style was a seminal force in popularizing the Hammond B3 organ as a major voice in rock music. Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, B.B. King, George Harrison, The Who, Trisha Yearwood, and a plethora of other artists have benefited from having Kooper perform on their albums and singles. Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards, Kooper's insightful and amusing autobiography, puts you in the passenger seat as you cruise the entire history of rock 'n roll as well as the various cultural landmarks and idiosyncrasies of the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s.",
