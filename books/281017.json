  "title": "A Short History of Russia: Tracing Russia's Path Through History, from Its Wars and Conquests, Royal Dynasties, Revolutions into the Modern Era Under Putin―a Concise Exploration of a Complex Nation",
  "description": "Russia’s epic and dramatic story told in an accessible, lively and short form, using the country's fascinating history to illuminate its future. A country with no natural borders, no single ethnic group, no true central identity, Russia has mythologized its past to unite its people and to signal strength to outsiders. Mark Galeotti takes us behind the myths to the heart of the Russian story: the formation of a nation through its early legends including Ivan the Terrible and Catherine the Great the rise and fall of the Romanovs, the Russian Revolution, the Cold War, Chernobyl and the Soviet Union the arrival of an obscure politician named Vladimir Putin.A Short History of Russia explores the history of this fascinating, glorious, desperate and exasperating country through two intertwined issues: the way successive influences from beyond its borders have shaped Russia, and the way Russians came to terms with this influence, writing and rewriting their past to understand their present and try to influence their future. In turn, this self-invented history has come to affect not just their constant nation-building project but also their relations with the world.",
