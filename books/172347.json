  "description": "Emmy Sumner is sure she's met her match in William Scott, graduate doctor, when their paths cross during Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations. So much so that, when she returns to Australia and William returns to England, she trusts his promise that they'll be together again.  Contact is precious, and is kept up with the help of technology interspersed with the tradition of handwritten letters. That is, until one day Emmy receives a final postcard from William before he disappears. Completely. What went wrong? Where did he go? Why?  An opportunity to work in London sends Emmy back in William's direction, a crumpled photo the only thing that remains of them. Should she look for him? Will he remember her? Will they still share the same connection they once had?",
