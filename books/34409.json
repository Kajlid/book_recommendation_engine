  "description": "Mercy Coltrane, a brash young American woman, travels to England to search for her estranged brother.  Strident in her quest, she seeks out the help of Hart Moreland, whom she knew years ago as Duke the Gunslinger, the hired gun her father enlisted to protect his land.  Now Earl of Perth, Hart is back in his native England in a hard-earned position of respect and power, and the last thing he wants is a reminder of his dishonorable past.  But Mercy Coltrane proves to be much more than just a painful reminder of the life he left behind.  Vibrant, beautiful, and witty, Mercy embodies the life of happiness that Hart desperately craves.  Connie Brockway is an author who understands the underlying fantasy of romance and dazzles readers with her emotional perception of love.  She writes with keen intelligence about the most important desires of the human heart.",
