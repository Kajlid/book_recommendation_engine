  "description": "Long before his career as a hostage negotiator imploded, Alexander Blackwell lived by a simple rule: only fools and civilians believe in coincidences. Four years later, that rule returns to haunt him when a mysterious hostage taker called Seth surfaces in New York City, threatening to make 9/11 look like the dress rehearsal. Seth has a single, cryptic request: he will only negotiate with Blackwell. Coincidence, right?",
