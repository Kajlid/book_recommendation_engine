  "description": "‘I turned to Genevieve, and my jaw dropped. She was struggling in the arms of a great Beast. The creature’s head was snake-like, its tongue long and forked, a single eye, slit-pupilled, in the centre of its forehead. It opened its great mouth as if it meant to swallow her alive…’In 1912, when Nathaniel Brown, an agent with the Morningstar Agency, boards the Titanic, his mission is simple: he must prevent the Eye of Empire, a stolen jewel with untold powers, from reaching America. Nathaniel is a young man of many talents—he can speak to animals, and he has incredibly sharp senses and the skills of many Jungle creatures. But between him and the jewel stands guard the burning-eyed and inhumanly strong Bavarian; and on his trail are the Parloks, horrific Beasts prepared to tear him to shreds in their quest for the Eye.With the help of Genevieve, a distractingly beautiful Morningstar agent with a mysterious past and an assortment of ingenious gadgets, Nathaniel must overcome all obstacles and complete his mission. For, the fate of the world hangs in balance.",
