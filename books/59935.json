  "description": "King Jarvin is in exile and his only hope is for Azerick and his wizard friends, along with a small army out of North Haven, to ride to the rescue. But the traitor and his vastly superior forces are not the greatest threat to the kingdom. Far to the north, a lich of extraordinary power has been gathering dark energy for years and is nearly ready to release it upon the living. Back home, Azerick's apprentice finds herself in so much trouble she may single-handedly reignite the war between Valaria and their southern neighbor.",
