  "description": "Rayne Amber Storm finds her serenity on the waters of her Louisiana bayou, where she can let her thoughts be her own among the moss-covered cypress trees. Slowly, a gentle, insistent ripple of difference stirs within her. A ripple that leads her away from her mother's Southern Baptist values to thoughts that betray the very core of what she believes is right and wrong.She leaves the protection of the bayou for medical school and lets the ripple grow until she is knocked unsteady by a powerful wave in the charismatic Samantha LeJeune. But when tragedy strikes back home, the pull of cross currents traps Rayne in what seems an insurmountable struggle between her heart, which now knows the true meaning of happiness, and doing what she has been taught all her life.Is she strong enough to keep navigating through unfamiliar but thrilling waters or will she give in and paddle down the path of least resistance?",
