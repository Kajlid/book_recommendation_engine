  "description": "A collection of Phobos Award Winner and Vera Hinckley Mayhew Award recipient Nancy Fulda's writings over the past ten years. This book includes tales of computers that invent God, minds that travel through time, electronic ghosts, and deceased extraterrestrials. Some of these stories are award winners. Others are more obscure, but they all share one thing in common: They stem from a love of fiction and a fascination with the endless possibilities of our universe.",
