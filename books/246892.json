  "description": "Emmy-winning writer Peter Bakalian’s parody Obey! The Secret Parents’ Guide to Hacking Your Kids was sold in a world English rights agreement to Amy Cloud at Simon & Schuster’s Aladdin imprint. Rosemary Stimola at Stimola Literary Studio, who brokered the deal, said the “subversive” YA novel follows a young teen who “discovers a secret diabolical parenting manual and, risking the retaliation of FART (Families Against Rotten Teens), exposes it to the world and triggers a kid rebellion.”",
