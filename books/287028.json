  "description": "Badger  There’s a massive difference between wanting something, and needing it. That was a rude awakening the first time I saw her. Even though I wanted her, I refused to allow myself to have her.  There were two reasons for that choice. One was a promise I made to myself long ago. The second is because she’s off limits. No matter how much I wanted her I couldn’t give into my desires.  No matter how intriguing I find this woman, I simply cannot cross this line. That is - until secrets are revealed.  They rock my world and bring up memories I kept locked away in the depths of my mind, only allowing them to slip out on the darkest of days.  My question is this: can she handle the heinous truth of my past? Regardless of the answer I’m unsure if I’ll be able to keep a grip on her as they come out from the shadows, revealing my truth to everyone important to me.",
