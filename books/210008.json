For First Lieutenant Novak, this is less than helpful, as he has so far met his platoonâ€™s designated medic a grand total of twice, and has both times found Sergeant Winchester to be the optimum combination of reckless, arrogant, and downright insufferable so as to make cohesive platoon function near impossible.
