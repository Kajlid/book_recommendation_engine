  "description": "Life changes dramatically for Libby McKenna when a body is found at Fairway to Heaven, the iconic golf course she runs. Murdered Chairman of the Board Mickey Warren had enemies. These included a 'starter' ex-wife, the angry current wife, a deceived girlfriend, and the disgruntled business partner. Plus a bevy of 'buddies' resented Mickey's creative scoring when playing a round. When new sheriff Riley O'Connor asks for Libby's help, she agrees. But snooping around quickly becomes hazardous for her health. Can Libby find the truth before the killer scores another hole-in-one?",
