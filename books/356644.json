  "title": "The Alpha Bet",
  "description": "Some teenagers use drugs or sex to escape overbearing parents. I used books. All my life my mother has been hovering over me, afraid to let me experience anything. So I got really good grades, graduated from high school when I was sixteen, and escaped to a new life--my own life--at college. To jump-start my social life, I decided to rush the Alphas, the most exclusive sorority on campus. Things started to get complicated when I told one little white lie. (Okay, maybe not so little.) Then one of the sisters invoked the Alpha Bet, a super-secret set of alphabetical tasks we pledges have to complete to prove our loyalty. Now, the Alpha Bet has taken over my life. Can you spell B-E-T-R-A-Y-A-L?",
