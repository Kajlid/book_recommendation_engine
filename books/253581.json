  "description": "ASIN moved to  this editionHer lips have the power to boost. Her love can grant power unparalleled. In an ongoing conflict against ravishingly beautiful beings from another dimension, Aurora Haddix’s abilities allow her to turn the tide of the battle.  Born a Natch, one of the population naturally endowed with superhuman powers at birth, Aurora tries to make the right choice. Her handsome, overprotective best friend and her tortured, grizzled mentor want her to use her powers for good. Kiss a Natch and they become more powerful for a few minutes. Allow one inside her and their powers are intensified for a full day. She wants to help, but she can’t get their roguish, virile former comrade out of her mind—and he wants her to join his underground band of Renegades. Then there’s the dark elf king, the leader of the otherworldly Nelians determined to infiltrate Earth—Aurora’s number one target and the most devastatingly gorgeous man she’s ever seen.  Aurora’s body makes her the most sought-after Natch in a war that might end on her say-so. Only with the way her inner passion ignites at each touch, she’s not so sure of her true reasons for pursuing the four alluring men who seek to possess her.  Fans of speculative fiction fantasy and science fiction Reverse Harem romances from Ava Mason, Mila Young, Meg Xuemei X, Jasmine Walt, and Emma Stark will love this superpowers-meets-elven-high-fantasy love story.",
