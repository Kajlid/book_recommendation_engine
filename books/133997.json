  "description": "What if you are offered a terrific job opportunity 400 miles from home? What if your home is London and you hate small cities?At age twenty-four, with a passion for writing, fashion-devotee Victoria Track accepts a position as assistant editor in Dunbar. She travels from Edinburgh to the small city because, “At least it’s a decent place to live.”On the threshold of his thirties, displeased with the direction of his life, humble computer-whiz Noah Rail buys his childhood house in Berwick-upon-Tweed in the hope of finding happiness.Not wanting to completely abandon his shy best friend, he commutes to Edinburgh and keeps his boring but well-paid job. When said best friend unintentionally lies to his secret crush, Noah will begrudgingly go along.As Victoria and Noah cross paths, misjudgements and arguments will fuel Noah’s instant dislike for the young woman, but they’ll have to join forces to achieve a common purpose.Will this messy ride bring them to a common romantic destination, or is this going to be a derailed love?",
