  "description": "What would prove to be stronger? Love, or loyalty? It was World Cup Year, and top professional rugby player, Jakes du Plessis desperately wants to fulfil his childhood dream to play for the Springboks. However, to achieve his goal, he needs to adhere to the team’s strict vow of celibacy. ‘Focus, keep an eye on the ball – and stay away from women.’ What Jakes didn’t count on was a chance meeting with Angie Summers, an artist who shook him to his core and threw his well-laid plans into a tailspin. Not even his promise to his friends, teammates, over 9000 miles between them, and demons from his past could stop Jakes from falling for Angie. Unfortunately, not everything is plain sailing, and Jakes finds that it takes a team to help him overcome obstacles to find his way to his own Happily Ever After",
