I was sentenced to remain on this god forsaken island, until my official trial could be held and the police could gather more evidence against me. The only upside to this whole disaster, is my new family. My stepbrothers have each shown me some semblance of kindness since being here and for that I am forever grateful. The whispers from the rest of the college continue to haunt me. I try to block it out, but it continued to sink in, breaking me a little more each. The blackouts are increasing and part of me wonders, did I murder her? No matter how hard I try to remember, the memory escapes me but the darkness in my heart is telling me it’s possible. As the darkness rises, I push everyone away, fear of hurting them too, but it’s no use. They’re drawn to me, just as I am to them.  When power is unleashed, will Val let her stepbrothers save her or will she burn down the world around her in a frenzy of pain and fear.  ***This is a new Reverse Harem Series.
