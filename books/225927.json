  "title": "Ocular: Monster in the Mirror",
  "description": "This is an updated cover edition of B00MP1I9J6.Within every mirror there is a reflection and within every reflection there is a world. It may be as simple as your face in the morning or as complex as the world behind you. But not every mirror projects a simple reflection of what is placed before it. Some mirrors have depth and in that depth there hides another world. A realm you will never see unless you go looking for it. Sometimes you find it, most times you don't. Those that do open themselves up to a realm beyond our physical world. A place where dreams hide and nightmares come true. Where monsters are real and where a simple man can quickly find himself hunted by creatures he knows nothing about and has no control over. Though rarely seen by mortal eyes this realm exists and certain mirrors are doorways between the physical world and a realm in which demons have their being. So handle your mirrors with care because some of them are not what they seem and your life, should you get trapped by one, will never be the same.",
