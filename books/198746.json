  "description": "Imogene Vandergrift wants out of jail. And she'll say or do just about anything to make sure she can recover the millions in diamonds she has hidden away. Television reality-adventure star Jack Mackey wants nothing to do with Imogeneespecially after what she has already put his son Wesley through. Jack has assured Wes that the evil woman who pretended for years to be his mother will remain behind bars. But that was before Alex Harris mysteriously disappeared. Now the rules have changed. Wesley and his best friend Amanda decide it is up to them to find Alex, Amanda's soon-to-be stepfather. A little covert detective work leads them to Diamondback Cave. Although Imogene's diamonds are hidden inside, it is named for the rattlesnakes that infest the black hole in the ground. However, the cavern also holds other dangershenchman who may be working for, or against, Imogene. Can Wesley's friends and family survive these new attacks from Imogene Vandergrift? Will Amanda find Alex before it's too late for him to become part of her family? Will you be able to catch your breath as you dive into Diamondback Cave?",
