  "description": "Mirrors. Mirrors. Mirrors.They only show you what you want to see, what you choose to see. If you desire to see the truth, you’ll find it. And if you choose to see the lies, deception, greed, and vengeance, so shall you.Who says a picture can speak a thousand words? Mirrors reflect the color of the soul.Mine is dark, void and colorless.Darker than the depths of the ocean, void like the infinite galaxies yet to be discovered by mankind and colorless like a drop of water that can shift into any shape, form, color, and state.Everyone sees me as a fragile, suppressed being. Someone who sheds more tears than smile.All this is a part of the game I’ve been playing.Tonight, I’m winning.Tonight, I deceive someone I fell in love with.Tonight, I will gain what’s rightfully mine. Tonight, he’ll suffer. Tonight, his screams will quake the walls of hell. Tonight, the devil will fear the wrath that I’ll unleash and ask mercy for his soul.",
