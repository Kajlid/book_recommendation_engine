  "description": "The summer before senior year of high school is a stressful time of transition for most teenagers. For Samantha, it's a reminder that the life in front of her - a job at the mall, college, marriage, work, kids, and driving a minivan to soccer practices - is not the life she was destined for. Samantha has no idea how right she is. When her hidden talent is discovered, Samantha's life changes forever. And while it's not unusual for a 17 year old to find her first real love, rarely does a teenager have to decide whether or not to kill her new boyfriend's father. Samantha soon learns that her brains, skills and humor are the tools that will keep her alive when a surprising number of people seem to want her dead. If she survives her summer, she is going to have a heck of a story. A little bit of \"Juno,\" a little bit of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" and a little bit of \"Pulp Fiction,\" the novel \"A Shot through the Heart\" is a funny, fast-paced adventure that will keep you turning the pages!",
