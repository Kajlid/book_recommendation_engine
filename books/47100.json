  "description": "Dysfunctional was not just a word in our home it was the definition. From my earliest memory's there was always abuse. Physical, emotional, and eventually the sexual abuse my sisters and I endured. This while our mother passed from one husband to the next searching for Mr, Right. Until she came to number three who opened the door to terror's like we could never imagine.  Exposing abuse, and the abusers is key to ending the tragedy that is abuse. Because in the United States 750,000 children will be taken into a hospital for abuse each year. That is roughly 85 children a day. Not to mention those who will never be taken for care. Let this speak for all of us, the millions who have walked through that hell. But especially for those who never had a chance to speak. The four children a day that die because of their abuse. We the survivors of childhood abuse are but the living casualty's in this war. It is time for our voices to give hope to those who suffer today.",
