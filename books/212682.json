  "description": "A rock star with millions of adoring fans.A country girl with a broken heart. Rock star, Tyson Allen, is the hilarious, in-your-face bass player for one of the world's most popular bands. Behind his funny-guy exterior hides a tragic past full of unbearable horror. After turning to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, Tyson hit rock bottom on a New York City sidewalk. For several minutes, Tyson Allen was gone--dead. And now, he's trying to rebuild a life he nearly lost. He found a way to move forward and live lifeâ€”a way he was comfortable with. All was going according to plan until he met the new assistant for his band. In an instant, everything changes. Daisy Hammond has a slew of her own tragedies. And the last thing she needs is a crush on one of America's rock legends. But unlike Tyson, her kind and generous heart refuses to push people away. Working with the band isn't easy as Tyson doesn't want anything to do with her. Despite his standoffish and rude demeanor, Daisy can't deny the pull she has for him. Determined to stay away from the bass player with an attitude, she goes about her business without getting in his way. But one night, their desire for one another erupts. Now it's up to Daisy to pull Ty out of his shell before the tour ends and they go their separate ways. Will she find a way to break down Ty's walls before it's too late?",
