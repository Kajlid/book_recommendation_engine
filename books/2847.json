  "description": "West of the Nile in Upper Egypt, beyond the temples and tombs frequented by tourists, can be found only endless desert, a few scattered oasis towns, and the occasional half-buried ruin.From the shifting sands near one remote village a temple is being unearthed, attracting the attention of an American visitor. He possesses a few items not typically part of a traveler’s inventory, along with a very useful imagination and the dangerous habit of straying far from the well-beaten tourist track.The ancient Egyptians pursued eternal life, but along the trade routes and river they once plied, a different kind of pursuit is about to begin—one that can very easily lead to death.",
