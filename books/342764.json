  "description": "In the ice wilds of the fabled north, the lords of the moving mountains have always been the polar bears. Kings of the wild, the white bears have ruled since the beginning of time, believing that they were hurled to earth from the heavens. There is only one creature they fear—man. The polar bears are also haunted by a prophecy, that one day the ice will suddenly cry out and die, causing the fish to float and the seals to flee. Then, as a result, one will be born among them—a white cub with one black paw who can hear the very beating of the polar heart. It is he who will lead his kind, and the whole world, to safety.BOOK WILL NEVER BE PUBLISHED. PROJECT DIDN'T RECEIVE ENOUGH FUNDS.",
