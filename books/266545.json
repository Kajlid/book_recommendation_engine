  "description": "In 2017, Jack Dublin released the first volume of Christian-themed folklore in The Lost and Found Journal series. Now, the Miner 49er returns in Vol. 2, revealing a past that may force historians to rewrite their books! Brace yourself for adventures stretching from the Sea of Job to a vast world beneath the American continent where life is familiar but nothing is what it seems. Meet Dino Garosello, a carnival barker bound to a ghost town with a terrible secret; and Jason Kittridge, a bandit so ruthless his name was blotted out of every history book. Is it truth stranger than fiction, or fiction stranger than truth? You decide on this epic quest!",
