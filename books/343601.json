  "description": "And the winner is...Dana Johnson? \"What?\" Turns out Dana's friend secretly entered her in the contest to win a dinner date with NASCAR driver Braden James. Burned by her former fiance, Dana isn't exactly eager to be swept off her feet by someone who'll disappear after dessert. She tells Braden he's off the hook, but he says they're \"on.\" His sponsor--a matchmaking Web site--is counting on him. And he's counting on \"her\" to swoon on cue for the cameras. Not too difficult--Braden is much more than just a gorgeous hotshot. A foster-care kid who's seen his share of hard knocks, he's driven head-on through heartache and triumph. But when the last flashbulb pops, will their slow burn ignite into a very real romance?",
