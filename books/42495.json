He'd been thinking it was time to find a permanent partner to bond with. An alliance with one of the most influential wolf shifter families in New Orleans was a good move to protect his people if ever their secret existence was revealed. However, when his father told him he'd have to mate with the head of the Cain family, Gray drew the line. He would not under any circumstances ever mate with a man!",
