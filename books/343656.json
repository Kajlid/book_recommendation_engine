  "title": "A Streetcar Named Desire",
  "description": "A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is one of the most remarkable plays of our time. It created an immortal woman in the character of Blanche DuBois, the haggard and fragile southern beauty whose pathetic last grasp at happiness is cruelly destroyed. It shot Marlon Brando to fame in the role of Stanley Kowalski, a sweat-shirted barbarian, the crudely sensual brother-in-law who precipitated Blanche's tragedy.Produced across the world, translated into many languages, and recreated as a prize-winning film, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE has attracted one of the most widely audiences in contemporary literature.",
