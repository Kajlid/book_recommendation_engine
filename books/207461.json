  "description": "Ariadne tends to the shrine of the Labyrinth on Crete on behalf of her father, King Minos. She maintains the shrine and hosts the tributes upon their arrival. But she dreams of a new god who calls himself Dionysus. She listens intently to every tale told and would like nothing more than to join the Maenads, the women followers of the god of wine as they dance in his honor. It is just a simple dream until the next group of Athenian tributes, led by a youth named Theseus arrive to be sacrificed to the monster at the center of the great Labyrinth.",
