  "description": "A Memory of Two Mondays is a one-act play by Arthur Miller. Based on Miller's own experiences, the play focuses on a group of desperate workers earning their livings in a Brooklyn automobile parts warehouse during the Great Depression in the 1930s, a time of 25 percent unemployment in the United States. Concentrating more on character than plot, it explores the dreams of a young man yearning for a college education in the midst of people stumbling through the workday in a haze of hopelessness and despondency and alcoholism. Einstein Books' edition of \"A Memory Of Two Mondays\" contains supplementary â \"Tragedy And The Common Man\", an essay by Arthur Miller. â An excerpt from \"An Enemy Of The People\", by Arthur Miller. â A few selected quotes of Arthur Miller.",
