  "description": "Graduate student Emma Delaney loses everything in a fire that consumes her Chicago apartment building—including her nearly completed dissertation—and barely escapes with her life. With her home gone and her bright future dimmed, Emma rents a room in an old mansion, hunkers down to rewrite her paper—and discovers the man who rescued her living under the same roof. Chicago firefighter Dylan O'Shea is used to getting what he wants, but Emma isn't interested in a hot fling. Most men would assume as much, based on her prim-and-proper appearance. But Dylan isn't fooled. He senses much more simmering underneath—and does his best to wear down her reserve. As the two give in to their deepening attraction, Emma's research into a renowned Romantic poet takes her career in an unexpected direction, Dylan is forced to confront his painful past, and the very house they live in reveals old secrets that could destroy their passion.",
