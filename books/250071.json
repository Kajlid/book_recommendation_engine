  "description": "In the second Godwicks novel, the bestselling author of The Red \"transmutes spicy mythological tales into sensual fantasies and erotic romance\" (Publishers Weekly, starred review).On the day of Lia Godwick's university graduation party, her parents--wealthy art collectors with friends in high places--gift her a beautiful wine cup, a rare artifact decorated with roses. It's a stunning gift, and one that August Bowman, a friend of her parents and a guest at Lia's party, also has his eye on. The cup, August tells her, is known as the Rose Kylix, and it's no ordinary cup. It was used in the temple ceremonies of Eros, Greek god of erotic love, and has the power to bring the most intimate sexual fantasies to life.But Lia is skeptical of August's claims of the cup's mythology and magic--after all, he's a collector himself, and she suspects he just wants to get his hands on this impressive piece of art. So he dares her to try it for herself, and when Lia drinks from the Rose Kylix she is suddenly immersed in an erotic myth so vivid it seems real--as though she's living out the most sensual fantasy with August by her side . . . Realizing the true power of this ancient and dangerous relic, Lia is even more wary of giving it up, though August insists it is only safe with him. He's willing to pay the full value of the cup, but Lia has another type of trade in mind. One that finds them more tangled up in each other--and in fantasy--than either was prepared for.",
