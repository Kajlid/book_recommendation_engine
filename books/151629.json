  "description": "While the characters are fictionalized, this is the story of the author’s mother’s life. She had a secret that she took with her to her grave, a secret her children would eventually find out and love her more than they thought possible. It was 1939, and Kate Limric had met the love of her life. He was her first love and would be her only love for the rest of her life. But life doesn’t always work out the way we plan, and that couldn’t have been more true for Kate. She would face many difficulties, love deeply and fiercely, sometimes with much amusement and laughter, sometimes with tears, but her loving and caring for her family would always shine through, even in death.",
