  "description": "McGurk can't believe it! Who ever heard of a dragon needng to be rescued from an evil princess? But that's what the members of the McGurk Organization find when they travel back to the twelfth and land right in a hotbed of castle intrigue.It all starts when Brains Bellingham's uncle gives each of them a walkie-talkie. Now they can keep in contact twenty-four hours a day! But instead of improving communication, the black boxes somehow transport them to twelfth-century England, and a huge castle guarded by a dragon. The group soon learns that the castle is ruled by the evil Princess Melisande--and that the dungeons are full of her victims. One thing leads to another, and it's not long before the McGurk members are in the dungeons themselves, guarded by some evil-looking executioners.Of course, they've been in tight spots before, but this one does seem worse than most. Not only are they chained in the dungeons, but they're trapped in the twelfth century! THey'll need their usual twentieth-century ingenuity along with some old fashioned good luck to escape in this adventure, which may be their most exciting yet.",
