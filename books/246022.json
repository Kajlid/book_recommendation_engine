  "description": "There’s pretty much only one rule when you’re a guy.Don’t be a douche.Turns out, the fastest way to break that rule is to fall for your best friend’s sister.Ava’s brilliant, sharp-tongued, gorgeous, and five years younger than me.She’s the sexual equivalent of running with scissors. In a word, she’s dangerous. And completely off-limits.Falling for her could ruin everything.Yet I can’t seem to stop, even when her company is threatened by a lawsuit, and my promotion hinges on representing the opposing client—and winning.I can’t see a way out of this mess that doesn’t end in a broken friendship, a broken heart, or a ruined career.I may have broken the bro code when I fell for Ava. But do I have the balls to handle what comes next?",
