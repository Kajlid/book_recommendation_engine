Only retreat to an English nunnery saves the young Maiden's life, leaving a boy alone with his vow to one day win her back.A Passion Fated To Possess Them BothThirteen years later Revas will find not a grateful wife, but a fighting fury of a woman who despises Scotland, its clans, and the Highlander who calls himself her mate. Planning merely to seduce her, Revas begins to care. Determined to hate him, Meridene begins to surrender, Now amid evil and treachery, the kindling of love's bright fire can save a great land—or destroy a Maiden's hopes...her soul...her heart.",
