Working as a massage therapist at the resort has given her a chance to heal as well as access to the spaâ€™s secret dungeon. But when one of her regular clients ends up dead on her table, Natalie fears that the monster she once escaped has come back to claim her. As Natalie rediscovers the beauty of BDSM with her twin Masters, all three will be forced to confront her past.
