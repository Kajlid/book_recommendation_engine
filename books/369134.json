People talked about how there was a curse over the swamp. Something was making the alligators attack humans. And what about the man who got lost in the swamp for a week? When they found him, he babbled on and on about someone called the Swamp Witch. People say he's in an insane asylum now!I decided I had to find out the truth. But once I was deep into the swamp, I discovered there was no way out! I began to wish I'd never head about The Curse of Blood Swamp!",
