  "description": "Feuds. Dudes. Attitudes. You're not wearing that, are you?Hipster bible Nylon magazine plans to feature Winston Prep's exclusive-icious POSEUR label in its \"20 under 20\" fashion issue. But only one of the 20 designers gets to outfit the cover model. Is ghetto-fabulous Melissa the only one in POSEUR's freakishly fabulous foursome who's paying attention? They say the course of true love never did run smooth, and with Janie, Charlotte, and Petra each chasing the dragon of her own romantic bonfire, it's going to take a miracle--or something hysterical--to get all the POSEUR girls present and accounted for. Photo shoooot! Or you're dead.",
