  "description": "If you want to add something meaningful to your life, like traveling to exotic places, composing beautiful music, or experiencing a new friendship in a foreign language, you will need to figure out how to eliminate other things from your daily routine. Your time and money are not infinite so if you want to add something important to your life, there is no way to avoid removing something else.Unfortunately, these types of eliminations are very difficult to implement as they require removing something from your life that is already there for a specific reason. To make room for your passions are you going to sleep less? Are you going to spend less time with your family? Are you going to expend less energy at work? These are hard and often unrealistic trade-offs to make.The Minimalist Mindset is not a book about tidying up (that book has already been written) and it is not a book about the philosophical exploration of minimalism (that book already exists too). Instead, The Minimalist Mindset is a book about a down and dirty process you can use to make deliberate decisions about how to prioritize how you live your life. This book walks you through the habits you can implement to consistently make realistic and sustainable trade-offs so that you can prioritize your passions and retake your freedom.Best-selling author Danny Dover shows you a reproducible process he used to go from a boring life in a cramped apartment in Seattle, Washington, to a fulfilling multi-year adventure that included visiting nearly 100 countries, learning to play music, studying a new language, and the eventual completion of his more than 150-item Life List.In This Step-by-Step Guide, You Will Learn How To:\t•\tAutomate your finances so that you can effortlessly save more money than you thought was possible (Chapter 6)\t•\tSpend more time with the people you love, while still doing the things you care about (Chapter 7)\t•\tSay no, in a polite and effective manner, to incoming asks for your time or expertise (Chapter 7)\t•\tEarn the clout necessary to work remotely from cities around the world (Chapter 8)\t•\tTake control of your e-mail inbox once and for all (Chapter 12)If you are tired of working to enable others to follow their dreams rather than being able to pursue your own, The Minimalist Mindset is your escape hatch.
