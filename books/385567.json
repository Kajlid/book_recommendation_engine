  "description": "Arabella Birch had a less than happy introduction to Holland when she became involved in a road accident. It seemed destined that the first person on the scene should be Dr. Gideon van der Vorst, who took charge of the situation--and Arabella--in a very commanding way. When Arabella found herself involved professionally with the imposing doctor, she began to wonder if destiny had known what it was doing. Once her glamorous cousin Hilary caught sight of Gideon, it would be no use falling in love with him.",
