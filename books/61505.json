  "description": "Wren doesn't feel like the girl most likely to end up living happily ever after. Especially when Adam, aka THE BIG MISTAKE, comes back into her life. He wants a second chance but Wren's afraid to risk another dent in her battered heart. When Adam reconnects with Wren, he's torn between wooing her and pursuing Tomas, the sexy guy in the flat next door. They both make his heart sing-how can he possibly choose? Or maybe he's finally found a man and woman to give him the balance he craves. Tomas knows better than to let his personal life interfere with his job as an undercover officer but he can't get enough of Adam...or Wren. Or Adam and Wren, when they're hot, naked and writhing together in his bed. Suddenly Wren's gone from the girl most likely to get ripped off to the girl most likely to get off. But it's more than sex. She, Tomas and Adam have something special, something they're determined to protect at all costs.",
