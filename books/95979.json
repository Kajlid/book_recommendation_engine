  "description": "Her past is wrought with demons.His past is full of heartbreak.Yet he's the one person that can remind her what it means to live.Abbi Jenkins never thought she would leave the walls of the mental institution that's housed her for the last year. Now she has, but that doesn't mean she's forgotten everything Pearce put her through.She knows there's only one way to deal with the depression that claws at her mind each day, and ballet becomes more than a hobby, a dream. Ballet - and Julliard - becomes a reason to live. Something to hold on for.Blake Smith left London for one reason and one reason only. Running from the heartbreak of his past was never something he wanted to do, but with constant reminders everywhere he turned, it became his only option. When he arrives in New York City, he vows he'll keep the promise he made to his sister and get into Juilliard.But he doesn't expect to be paired with Abbi in class, the girl whose eyes show a world of pain he's seen before. Pain he knows too well. As each hour they spend together pulls them closer, Blake can't fight his need to save her from herself.Lines blur as their pasts are wrenched into the open, and they have to ask themselves whether they're too broken to ever to be fixed, or if they're the healing the other needs.",
