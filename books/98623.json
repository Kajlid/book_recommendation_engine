  "description": "The clock is ticking, and time is running out...NOT ALL THINGS BOUND IN CHAINS SHOULD BE FREEDTime for Melinda is fast running out. Time for her to make her escape. And time to make a daring rescue.The only thing fifteen-year-old Melinda has been thinking about ever since she found out that she was betrothed to a man twice her age was how to escape the madness of the cult she had been trapped in. But escape seems easier said than done, especially since Melinda is being kept under the watchful eyes of her Uncle, an Aunt who never seems to sleep, and the Elders.Melinda has the unique ability to see things no one can, like Angels and, once one Halloween, a demon. Her power also allows her to see a boy named Caleb, who isn't really a boy but has the fading aura of an Angel, get captured by the Elders. Kept in chains and tortured, Caleb's agonizing cries are a constant reminder of why she must get as far away from the cult as she can. She must escape, and soon, but not without trying to rescue Caleb.Does Melinda have the power to not only save herself, but to save Caleb? And if she can save him, has she saved an angel... or a demon?",
