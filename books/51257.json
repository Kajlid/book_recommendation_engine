  "description": "‘Pulp Fiction’ meets ‘This Is Spinal Tap’ in this tough, funny, sexy and fast-paced story. Pete Watts is a former undercover narcotics cop who got way too close to his job. He now runs a music rehearsal studio in which all manner of eccentric musicians come through. His soon to be ex-girlfriend is a talented singer with a sleazy manager who is in the habit of giving his clients drug habits, occasionally overdosing them to move their recordings up the charts, with the full support of the shady entertainment company for whom he works. This universe of people is inexorably drawn into a war between two violent drug gangs, viewed through the perspective of the Napoleonic leader of one gang. He has recently signed on a strange, but beautiful ex-mercenary, who wears makeup in the form of multi-colored tears running down her face. These tears are, in fact, decals on which different poisons are concealed, hence the title. Some survive the Trial of Tears, some don’t. The story’s taut climax is set in a posh townhouse in which only the courageous will emerge unscathed. While it certainly has its share of humor, action and suspense, it is also a story of friendship and redemption, as well as being a love letter to New York City. “Chris Semal's writing is subtle as a flamethrower in a petroleum refinery. His sense of urgency will make you grit your teeth from the first page to the last. An excellent new author who deserves to be read.” – Joe Schwartz, author of The Games Men Play \"An addictive and imaginative New York tale that intertwines the lives of interesting characters who are drenched with city style. This story is a smooth and enjoyable read that shows just how life can bend the rules of conduct.” – Jordannah Elizabeth, The Process Record Media Group",
