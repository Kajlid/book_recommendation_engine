  "description": "Nerdy high school outcast, CLARISSA LAWRENCE, has always felt like she didn't belong in this world. More than anything, she wants magic to be real--and not just because she's obsessed with Harry Potter and tries to go to Narnia by reading fantasy novels in her wardrobe.  Yet, when she stumbles upon real magic, and fairy tales come true, she doesn't expect to be the evil villain in her own story. Clarissa learns she's descended from an evil witch and is destined to kill her older sister.  When she meets a cute boy who offers to train her in magic, she must make a choice. She can have a safe, normal life and no harm will come to anyone. Or she can choose magic and risk everything and everyone she loves in order to be what she's always known she was meant to be . . . a wicked witch.  This is the first book in the WOMBY'S SCHOOL FOR WAYWARD WITCHES Series, but the first three books can be read in any order.  Other books in the series to be released soon:  Secondhand Hexes  Hexes and Exes  Reading, Writing and Necromancy  Budget Cuts for the Dark Arts and Crafts  Hex and the City  Spell it Out for Me",
