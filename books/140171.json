  "description": "Hello, my name is Israel Jacobs. I am 14 years old. I just returned from a most unusual, but exciting trip to Syria with my family. My mom is a world famous archeologist, who is bent on proving the Bible to the world. Although my mom's job is pretty cool, I'm not all that into the religion thing. At least I didn't used to be until now. My sister and I accompanied her on her latest archeological dig in Syria where I found a magical stone that transported me on adventure that you will never believe. Can you believe that I am actually witnessing what she is trying to prove? I still cannot believe it myself and I am actually witnessing it with my own eyes. Come join me on my adventure through time and on my own special quest. Come with me and we'll discover God together.",
