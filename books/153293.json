Her only anchor is Jesse O'Neil, her late husband's best friend. The charming former playboy has put his entire life on hold to care for Katy and her son. It's inevitable that sparks will flare between them, but all of life seems to be conspiring to keep them apart. Especially Katy's own heart, which shies away from trusting another firefighter. Will the flames of passion burst into a lifetime of love? Or will secrets burn away their connection, causing Dr. Garrity to be burned again?",
