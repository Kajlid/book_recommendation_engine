  "description": "Vincent van Gogh committed suicide in 1890, and his brother, Theo, died soon thereafter. His widow, Johanna, was left with many paintings and the desire for Vincent's recognition. In this historical novel, Johanna hires Armand Roulin, painted by Vincent in Arles, to research the artists and villages of France where Vincent lived. Along the way he becomes attracted to a young woman in Auvers, also painted by Vincent. Join Armand as he travels in the steps of Vincent and meets Dr. Gachet, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissaro, and other renown artists who worked with Vincent. This novella is a great follow-on to Irving Stone's classic, \"Lust for Life.\"",
