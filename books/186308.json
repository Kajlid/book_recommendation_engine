  "description": "Jesus stands on the road beside you now and says, \"Where are you going?\" Are you ready to enter into Deep Adventure? Are you ready to take up your cross and follow him? Are you ready to let virtue propel you into the wild adventure of God's will? Are you ready to walk the Way of Heroic Virtue? Host of EWTN’s “Deep Adventure Radio,” and two-time Masters World Champion Surfer, Bear Woznick is the Adventure Guide for Deep Adventure Quest Retreats, where people step out of their comfort zone and into the danger zone of God’s will. In Deep Adventure: The Way of Heroic Virtue, Bear shares his real-life adventures as a way to challenge you to go deeper with God and live a life of virtue. Pulse-pounding stories of ocean rescues, huge waves and deadly encounters with sharks show us that when people abandon themselves to God, they do not become some soft, pastel version of themselves. On the contrary, a life lived in pursuit of God’s will is the boldest, most rewarding way possible to live. If you’re tired of being spoon-fed the message that you just need to be “nicer,” this book is for you. You know deep inside that you are meant for more. You feel the call to be valiant and heroic for your loved ones and for the world. What you seek is profound, but you want a clearer goal and the means to accomplish that. Join us on this quest. Abandoning yourself to God’s will takes every ounce of your courage and dedication. You will be tested, but Jesus is the one calling and he will empower you in ways you’ve never even imagined.",
