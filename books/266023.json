Henry Bollingbroke has imprisoned Richard II, taking the throne of England. Hating Glyndwr, Henry refuses to honour a debt and seeks revenge, sending an assassin to kill him.

Will King Henry IV succeed in his mission to destroy Glyndwr? Will Tan-y-Mynedd succeed in finding the dragons eggs and secure the future of this ancient species? Will Owain Glyndwr become Prince of Wales? The Prophecy unfurls as Crach Ffinnant, dwarf, prophet and seer continues his adventures in Rise of the Dragon.",
