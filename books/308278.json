A handmade sailboat helped bring Morgan back to Grant but he never imagined they would put it in the water. Then Morgan sees something in the light that sets Grant on a mission to get them to the middle of the ocean. An unknown destination they have to be when the sun rises. It’s important enough that Morgan is willing to leave Durstrand. Important enough that he’ll face the challenges of his autism. So important, it could even be a matter of life and death.
