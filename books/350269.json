  "title": "Tempus Interludium Volume 2",
  "description": "The Various and sundry articles in this volume, were all given at various times throughout the many years by the late, beloved Moderator, Ernest L. Norman. Like Tempus Procedium and Invictus they were not written with any particular sequence in mind, but rather, as the need was realized, were they received from his Higher Self. Many of these articles were written as early as 1960-65, yet the most recent were written or voiced on the recorder within a few months before the Moderator left the physical plane in December, 1971. Because of the several letters written by Dr. Norman to new students, I (the editor) have often thought that Tempus Interludium II would be a great book to begin studying Unarius.",
