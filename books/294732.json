Ian Lauder hates Halloween and the annoying parties that come with the holiday season. A tech genius and workaholic, he has little patience for people, especially the woman who only seem to want him for his checkbook. He knows that most of his employees see him as rude, a jerk with a stick up his butt, and he’s never cared. Then he meets Kennedy.  Now there’s finally one girl that he wants to ride his broomstick.  *Warning! This book alpha is over-the-top, head over heels in love with his girl. If you're looking for a steamy insta-love story then this book is for you!",
