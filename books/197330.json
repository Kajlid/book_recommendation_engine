  "description": "A dead hero opens his eyes. To his horror, he finds he has been raised from the grave to serve as the minion of a desperate necromancer called Mordius. Our hero's body has been stolen from a battlefield contested by two kingdoms that have been at war for generations. No one knows why warfare is now the way of life, but what is apparent is that dark forces vie for dominion over the entire realm.Our hero has no memory of who he was when alive, and knows only that he was a soldier called Saltar... or so Mordius tells him. Like all the undead, Saltar craves the warmth of life and reluctantly accepts a bargain proposed by the necromancer. Saltar agrees to guard Mordius and help him retrieve an unholy artefact that will give the necromancer absolute sway over death. In return, Mordius promises to restore Saltar to full life...Necromancer's Gambit is a work of metaphysical fantasy, revealing a world of epic scale as the backdrop to the intrigues and magic of the darker side of the human psyche. It is told with a vividness normally only expected of film. The action and pace leave the reader breathless, exhilirated and hungry for more.",
