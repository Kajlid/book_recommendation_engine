  "description": "It gets hard sometimes, doesn't it. It gets so difficult only tears comfort your weeping soul. This collection of simple, emotional poetry gives me, and all of us, hope. That amidst the pain, the loss and suffering, there is always something to cling on. Something to lean on. Something to wait upon. Because one thing is for sure, if love can come to an end,so can pain.",
