  "description": "When nurse April Asbury arrives in Fertile, Missouri, she's looking forward to life in this picturesque town. But while Fertile might seem as pristine as April's starched white uniforms, it's anything but. Soon the spunky blonde is fighting her attraction to Joe Jones, who has \"heartbreaker\" written all over him; staring down malicious gossips; and fending off a suitor who's up to no good. In a town where tensions are rising faster than the river, and a widow schemes for her revenge, April must hang on tight to the man she loves...if they're both to survive.",
