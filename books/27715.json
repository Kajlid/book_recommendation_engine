  "description": "Written in the first person, Escape Company. begins with two men bound together by the same experience. With both of their wives in prison, they are fired with the same idea—how to get their ladies out. The idea becomes an obsession, with meticulous planning involving prison routines, deadlocks, and security cameras, not to mention razor wire and some very unfriendly dogs. Our two heroes spring their wives successfully and the idea occurs to them to form a limited company—limited to certain prisoners who merit release. So Escape Company. is born, a dedicated team of lawbreakers whose services are provided to inmates with large amounts of cash. There are rules of course. Terrorists, sex offenders, and psychos can stay where they are, but anybody else? Well, each case is decided on its own merits. Could such a scenario possibly work? Of course not…oh, but there was that breakout from Parkhurst not so long ago.Wasn’t there some incident at Barlinnie? Then, if you remember, there was all that hoohah at the Scrubs…. No, it couldn’t possibly work. Escape Company is pure fiction…isn’t it?",
