  "description": "Tentacles are a taboo subject for most, something most people look at from between their fingers as they hide. But for a growing number of people, it's a subject that is fascinating and sexy! Tentacle erotica has been around for ages, from \"The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife\" to \"Demon Beast Invasion\"—it's a genre that is here to stay. \"All Wrapped Up\" explores this genre through the lens of gay erotic romance, offering four science-fiction and fantasy stories featuring tentacled heroes in all their wiggly glory.The men in \"Ground Mission\" are podmates, a matched Simon Pollux, the lethal scout, and Adrian Lovasz, his willing and even more lethal combat specialist. In the midst of exploring an alien world, Simon is infected with an alien virus; to what lengths will Adrian go to ensure Simon's comfort? In the wood-locked town of Orm, ranger Koster meets the mysterious the guardian of the forest. Is he the one letting the forest turn to wilds, or is the forest turning to wilds on its own? In \"Wildwood\", Koster aims to do whatever it takes to set things right.Eli exchanges his a life of poverty in \"Dark Covenant\" when tricked into signing a contract giving himself to the masters of the Academy. His body, his movement, his life is theirs to do with as they wish, until the enigmatic Eramus offers Eli his power—if Eli will join with him. Sebastian Reed lives on the legal limits in \"Situation Normal\", barely scraping by in his hunk of junk ship until a Peace Officer, Ten, commandeers his ship... and his body. Not that Sebastian minds, except for wondering exactly where it is that Ten means to take him.",
