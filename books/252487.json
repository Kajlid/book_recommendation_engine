  "description": "From the International Best Selling Series Something So \n  \nZack \n  Finding my teammate in bed with my wife made the decision I had been fighting with for years easier.  It’s time to move on.  A fresh start and a new NHL team in a big city. Most importantly, it’s my son Jack’s best shot.  It would be both of our best shots.  \nDenise \n  After a bad childhood, I made sure I would succeed.  The problem is I die a little with each patient I lose. It’s part of my career at Hudson Children’s Oncology Hospital, but it doesn’t make the sting of loss any easier.  Seeking anything other than a life saved isn’t on my agenda until a NHL player walks into my hospital with his son.  We’re officially off script the moment we meet.  If this love is anything, it’s unscripted.",
