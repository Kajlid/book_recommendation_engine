  "description": "REISSUE by Judith IvoryAs befitting her name, lovely Submit Channing-Downes was the proper, obedient wife of an aging marquess—until her husband's death left her penniless and alone...with one last marital obligation to fulfill. Entrusted with delivering a small black box to its rightful owner, she calls upon Graham Wessit, the notorious Earl of Netham, whose life has been forever marred by rumor and scandal.But Graham wants nothing to do with a bequest from the man he holds responsible for his ruin—or with the bewitching emissary who brings it. In the face of breathtaking erotic mystery—in the throes of an inflamed passion unbeckoned but impossible to deny—a rogue's hardened heart may be undone by love...and a staid beauty in straits may learn the exquisite, sensuous freedom of surrender.",
