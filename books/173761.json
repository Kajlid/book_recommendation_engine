In these words from our forbearers, in brief accounts of the events leading up to their creation, Ted explores the aims of democracy-on the aims of Nation-building, American style. Subjects covered include the Magna Carta, The American Declaration of Independence, The Preamble to the Constitution and the Gettysburg Address. While the pace of life today offers few opportunities to contemplate works centuries in the unfolding, the author believes the effort worth the trouble.",
