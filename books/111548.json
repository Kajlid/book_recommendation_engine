In this contemporary erotic romance, Jace and Olivia continue their journey of two wounded souls determined to become one.

The domineering side of Jace takes a stand in the moment before it’s all too late and he whisks Olivia away to the only place he trusts to protect her. In his arms. In his bed. In his house. Bared and exposed – every secret is laid out for judgment and every shame is set out to heal. In the end, after the final revelation, can the two lovers prevail?",
