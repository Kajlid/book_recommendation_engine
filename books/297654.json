  "description": "Earth and other planets are ‘seeded’ by an advanced alien species that farms the planets for resources every two hundred thousand years. The planet’s seed ‘creators’ have planted this crop on Earth for eons and the seed dominates and flourishes with programmed attributes that facilitate its own destruction. The crop is hominid. Only a small force of intrepid soldiers remains as survivors in a war spanning far flung planets and galaxies joining forces to fight a lost cause against the aliens. Rik Onanes is the oldest son of a long line of soldiers called Lares. His family has traveled in time to continue their war with the aliens but eventually, they are running. Rik must confront his fear and cowardice to face the same terrifying enemy again in a new world that relies on him for its survival and in the process, he finds renewed meaning and purpose, restores his faith in human potential, finds his lost brother and resurrects courage for his call to duty. But is it too late?",
