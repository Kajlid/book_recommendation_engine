  "description": "A delectable prequel to the Temple of Indra mysteries featuring Sophia Marcil—the curious librarian. It’s Valentine’s Day and Sophia Marcil has all but given up on love—until her best-friend tricks her into attending a Blind Dating Fundraiser Event sponsored by the O’Kelley’s of Dublin. Sophia feels guilty about going, and then she falls headfirst for the fiery green-eyed mystery man out front. When the man turns the corner instead of joining them inside the event, Sophia’s hopes are dashed but she is surprised to find her appointed date for the evening is also a charming man—especially when he twirls her around the dancefloor and gives her the kiss of a lifetime. One problem—she hasn’t seen him. The event is a sensory dining experience like no other, complete with a blacked out room and blindfolds. But as the night moves to a close, Sophia’s date vanishes and the night is thrown into chaos when her ex-boyfriend appears, making it clear that her happy ever after may have to wait… Includes two recipes and a preview of the first Temple of Indra mystery, The Temple of Indra’s Jewel.",
