  "description": "PAIGE  When Erik left town, I thought my world had ended. Even at the tender age of ten, I knew how hard my life would be without him. And as I grow older, as the letters between us became sparse to nonexistent, I can’t help but feel like a wall has been built around my heart.  There is only one boy for me, and I know I’ll never see him again.  ERIK  She was my best friend, the only person I knew I couldn’t live without. But we had to leave each other.  Time went on, we drifted apart, and it always felt like I’d left a piece of myself back with her. But I’m a man now, a wounded Marine, and fate brings me back to the one girl who completes me.  Paige has always been mine, and now it’s time to prove that to her.  Warning: Tighten that seat belt because you’re about to go on an over-the-top, totally unbelievable ride. Featuring a possessive and devoted hero who saved himself for that one girl, it’ll still have that sugary-sweet aftertaste you crave. Don’t forget that cold glass of water, because you’ll need it for the heat this book—and Erik—is packing.",
