  "description": "Every fairy tale has a dark side... Elodie Rose has a secret. Any day, she’ll become a wolf and succumb to the violence that’s cursed her family for centuries. For seventeen years she’s hidden who and what she is. But now someone knows the truth and is determined to exterminate her family line. Living on borrowed time in the midst of this dangerous game of hide and seek, the last thing Elodie needs to do is fall in love. But Sawyer is determined to protect her, and the brooding, angry boy is more than what he seems. Can they outsmart a madman? And if they survive, will they find a way to beat the curse for good? From the Holy, holy crap, I really enjoyed this book…I was so absorbed in this book while reading it, I couldn’t stay away and I wanted to check out of everything I was doing so I could go finish it. I think of this as “glue” and have referenced in other reviews when a book is “sticky.” This book is quite sticky. Be ye warned…The storytelling and the layers of meaning and the multiple ways to view what was happening in the story made this incredibly fun to read, and I have recommended it several times to people already. I think that part of what draws readers to YA and YA romance is that emotions are overwhelming and scary, even if you’re an adult, and that feeling of being overpowered by your emotions coupled with the secrecy of teenage life makes for some compelling reading. In this particular case, both of those elements are present and strong in the story, and when combined with allegory and a recasting of a well-known myth, it’s delicious. –Sarah Wendell, Smart Bitches, Trashy Books",
