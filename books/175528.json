  "description": "The gods of the north and the Storm Lords who serve as their arbiters are absolute law. Dagr—a young warrior trained in the fine art of carrying out this law—must venture south, deep into the Othangan Empire. His mission? To rescue his own: fellow women of the north, who have been sold into slavery. Ingrid, one of these very women, finds herself unable to trust in the gods or the lords of her home. Instead, she must learn her own lessons, and adapt to the harshest truths of the Empire, or else be consumed by them. Will the Storm Lords and the forces they represent protect their children? Only time and patience will tell in this story of faith and ingenuity, magic and devilry, friendship, betrayal, and ultimately, sacrifice.",
