  "title": "The Glass Harmonica: A Lexicon of the Fantastical",
  "description": "\"A Lexicon of the Fantastical. It is no ordinary lexicon. It defies any description. Unless one were to call it the Webster of the Weird. But it is so much more than that. For it nimbly describes and defines all the inhabitants of that slightly delirious demimonde of dragons, sorcerers, and white knights that really existed a spell or so ago. When the world still believed in heroes and magic. And we did too.\"",
