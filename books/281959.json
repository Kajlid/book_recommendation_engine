  "description": "My name is Heath Germaine.As the starting cornerback for the Southeast San Antonio University football team, all eyes are on me. Under such crushing pressure, there’s no room for error in my bid to reach the NFL and help support my large family.With stakes this high, who can afford distractions? Not me, which is how I ended up in a fake relationship with the most irritating woman I know – Lauren Bagley. As a competitive gymnast, her only focus is securing a spot at the college nationals competition. If being her pretend boyfriend helps keep the idiot guys on her team off her back and the cleat chasers off mine, it’s a price I’m willing to pay.Nothing is real. We’re only pretending. Everything’s a game. So why does she suddenly matter to me?",
