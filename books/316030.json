  "description": "I didn't know who Dove's sister was when we first met.I didn't know that I'd been fooling around with her for a few months before Dove walked into my life.I didn't know that––if I've done the math correctly––I could be the father to her sister's child.But I do know this.Dove has the voice of an angel, and the heart of one too.I might not deserve her, but I refuse to let her go.She doesn’t know that I was with her sister before we met.She doesn’t know that her niece or nephew could be my freaking kid.And even though it kills me, I can’t let her find out.",
