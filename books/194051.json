  "description": "\"Any reader with a love for faeries, magic, and sometimes dark character motivations will love Tangled Web.\" - Online Book Club\"I couldn't put it down... This is a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy.\" Carrie Rachelle Johnson, author of Journey to Glory.When fifteen year old foster kid and diagnosed schizophrenic, Ryne, bumps into a strange man only she can see, the carefully constructed pretenses of her life start to crumble, forcing Ryne to choose between the safe, mundane, mortal world that’s labeled her crazy, or the magickal world of nightmares she has spent her life pretending doesn’t exist.  The truth will set you free. Not. At least, not for Arrynna Doe. The only thing the truth will bring Ryne is a straight jacket and a room at the local, state funded institution, again. So she lies- to her doctors, to her foster parents, to her best friend. Because, really, who’s going to believe there is a whole world filled with terrifying magickal creatures only she can see- faeries, witches, vampires, and werewolves, even dragons? That’s right, nobody! Ryne has her routine mastered- pretend you’re normal, lie to everyone you know, ignore supernatural beings. And the routine works, until the day she acquires stalkers. Faerie stalkers. As Ryne struggles to keep her days normal, she finds herself questioning the tenets’ of her life. Why can she see things that no one else can and why are these creatures suddenly interested in her? Because maybe there is more to it all than she ever dreamed. Will she discover the truth? Or is she just as crazy as the doctors have always said? Either way, Ryne is facing a crossroads, and pretty soon she’s going to have to make a choice.",
