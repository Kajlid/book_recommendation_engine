  "description": "To save the life of the crown prince, Starwick took a curse upon himself, but the curse leaves him in excruciating pain alleviated only by Tyrwick, the king's bastard son and a man who has always despised Starwick. If he wants to live they must find the man who cast the curse and take back the ring he stole, but Starwick's real challenge is not hunting a manâ€”it is fighting his own despair, reinforced by Tyrwick's cold disregard and his own shadowy life.",
