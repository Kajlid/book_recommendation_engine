With ten hours to go before completing her job shadowing project, seventeen-year-old Julie Little’s assignment has switched gears, and now she’s required to start living the lifestyle of every man (and woman) in uniform. Under Luke’s command, Julie is obligated to complete her remaining hours through early morning exercise training.

And just when she’s certain that she’s making progress in her relationship with Luke, Julie learns that the new guy in town has taken an interest in winning her heart… and as far as she’s concerned, there’s only room in her heart for one man… even if he still hasn’t figured out that they’re meant to be.",
