She loves its vintage glamour, lakeside setting and, above all, its precious memories from back when her late dad ran the place.   But handsome entrepreneur Joe is the new owner. And he has big plans.   When Lauren comes face to face with Joe after signing up to dance classes in its gorgeous ballroom, she can’t hide her hostility.   She’s not going to change her views. He’s not going to alter his project.   But could learning to salsa spark the chemistry they need to finally see eye to eye?  An enemies-to-lovers, forced proximity rom-com that will warm your heart and make you laugh out loud!",
