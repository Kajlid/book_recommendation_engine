With short stories from WWI and WWII, the reader is carried from one front of the war to another with emotionally compelling bursts. In Volume I, experience the intimate moments between a father and son high over Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941; squirm in your seats with the movie-goers at a German cinema in 1915; and travel a rail line with some children in East Prussia in 1945. Each story in this collection opens the door to a unique personal facet of war; exposing the reader to the facts, fictions, and fallacies of armed violence. Following each story, the reader is provided specific and revealing facts about the events narrated, offering both entertainment and education within the time it takes to read a blog-post.",
