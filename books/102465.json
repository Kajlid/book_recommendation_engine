  "title": "Sky, God And A Clown",
  "description": "Sky, God And A Clown is a story about a normal childhood and a privileged adulthood. It's about you, it’s about me and about most of us middle class youngsters. It’s about how a family shapes us like a potter's wheel shapes a pot and it’s about the small things in life which are so trivially engraved in us that we do not notice them. It’s also about how the norms and ways of society and expectations settle on us gradually like dust settles on the new bottle green leaves of a roadside sapling and how … one day the rain of love and loss washes all that dust away. It’s your story told by someone like you.",
