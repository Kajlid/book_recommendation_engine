Brooding Blake has been by her side through thick and thin, remaining a loyal friend throughout her climb to fame. But friendship isn’t enough for Ebony. Unfrotunately, it doesn’t look like their relationship is ever going to change. Until Walker enters their lives. Following several threats—the last being a message written in blood—Blake makes the decision to bring in fellow bodyguard—and best friend, Walker. Both men are determined to protect Ebony no matter what. When the outgoing, sexy Walker draws her attention, she discovers she doesn't desire just Blake anymore.
