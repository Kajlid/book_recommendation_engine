  "title": "The Prince",
  "description": "The Prince is a 16th-century political treatise by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli (1469–1527). As a young Florentine envoy to the courts of France and the Italian principalities, Machiavelli was able to observe firsthand the lives of people strongly united under one powerful ruler. His fascination with that political rarity and his intense desire to see the Medici family assume a similar role in Italy provided the foundation for his \"primer for princes.\" In his classic guide to acquiring and maintaining political power, Machiavelli used a rational approach to advise prospective rulers, developing logical arguments and alternatives for a number of potential problems; among them governing hereditary monarchies, dealing with colonies and the treatment of conquered peoples. Although written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for prince’s style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative.  The Prince sets down a pragmatic formula for political fortune. The Prince continues to be much read and studied by students, scholars and general readers.",
