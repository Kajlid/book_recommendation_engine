  "description": "For thousands of years, we have been enthralled by tales of Troy and its heroes. Achilles and Hector, Paris and the famed beauty Helen remain some of the most enduring figures in art and literature. But, did these titanic characters really walk the earth? Was there ever an actual siege of Troy? In this extensively revised edition, historian Michael Wood takes account of the latest dramatic developments in the search for Troy. His wide-ranging study of the complex archaeological, literary and historical records has been brought up-to-date. Detailing the rediscovery in Moscow of the so-called jewels of Helen and the re-excavation of the site of Troy begun in 1988, which continues to yield new evidence about the historical city, \"In Search of the Trojan War\" takes a fresh look at some of the most excited discoveries in archaeology. \"A dazzling and exhaustive analysis.\" - \"Washington Post\". \"This beautifully illustrated book...vividly evokes themes that are central to our civilization's quest for its past.\" - \"The New York Times Book Review\".",
