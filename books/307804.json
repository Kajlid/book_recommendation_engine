  "description": "Dave thought his life was pretty normal-- try not to die of embarrassment at school, sit next to Mae Fong at church, and stay out of his sister, Lizzie's way. He believed in God but never thought about it beyond blessing his dinner and going to youth group, until the Holy Spirit started talking to him. Now his whole world is upside down. Find out what happens when Dave's faith comes to life. \"Dad tried not to read the news on his phone at the table while he drank his coffee ’cause that drives Mom crazy. Mel tried to figure out which waffle on the platter had the perfect balance of crispiness and squishiness without touching them. All of us think it’s nasty when he touches food ’cause Mel picks his nose. Then there was Liz, with that empty look she had most of the time. She looked like just a shell, an exoskeleton, on autopilot. It seemed like her batteries were dying and she had no interest in recharging. If she ate anything at all, I didn’t see it. The voice spoke when I looked at her. I couldn’t hold onto what it said that time either, but whatever it was brought the sinking feeling with it. \"",
