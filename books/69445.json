While she's interviewing for a position she's overqualified for, she's determined to get her foot in the door by any means necessary--but she didn't count on accidentally mouthing off to the enigmatic billionaire at the helm of the company, Jacob Whitmore. After a hot tryst in the stairwell, he makes Leila a proposition--be his personal assistant and private submissive. Saying no could cost her dream job and a place among the wealthy and elite. But saying yes could cost so much more...The Billionaire's Contract is part one of the His Submissive series.",
