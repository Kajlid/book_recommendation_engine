  "description": "When Alyssa was a child, she decided not to believe in demons. If you don't believe, then they can't be real, right? But the demons don't care what you believe. Alyssa grabs her six-year-old daughter and escapes into the forest outside the compound. Her father's death haunts every step. He died trying to save her from the cult when she was a child. This time, failure is not an option. Keeping a few steps ahead of the elders, Alyssa crosses paths with a truck driver named Gabe. Suddenly she dares to believe she might succeed. Yet Alyssa can't bring herself to warn Gabe of the demon horde that's fast on their heels. Gabe's gentle kindness sends ripples of emotion throughout Alyssa's petite form. Emotions she's never felt before. But will he be strong enough to protect her from the approaching evil?",
