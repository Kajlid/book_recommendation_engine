  "description": "A heartfelt story of secrets and second chances from the New York Times bestselling author of The Seaside Saga.Sara Beth and Rachel have been wishing on stars for as long as they've been friends. Sara Beth dreams of opening an antique shop in quaint Addison, Connecticut. For Rachel, a little beach cottage will do, where sea breezes and salt water might inspire her sketches. Sharing wishes and cups of coffee, they've stitched pieces of their lives together like a soft patchwork quilt of friendship they thought they'd hold close forever.But while celebrating their birthdays one weekend in Manhattan, Sara Beth makes a life-altering decision. Excusing herself to use the Ladies' Room during lunch, she disappears, slipping the waiter a note to pass along, asking Rachel to cover for her.Sara Beth's escape begins a summer of change--of herself, of her marriage, of the lives of those around her back home in Addison. Most unexpectedly, it brings a solitary Mounted Police Officer into Rachel's life, one who gladly shows Rachel that it isn't always stars that deliver our wishes.",
