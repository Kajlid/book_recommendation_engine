  "description": "Part campaign memoir, part manifesto?from the new rising star of the Republican Party Mike Huckabee's run for the Republican presidential nomination was truly amazing. But beyond the headlines, few understand his transformation from a long-shot Evangelical candidate into a viable contender. Huckabee now presents the inside story of his low-budget, grassroots campaign. He treated middle-class and working-class voters with respect and spoke to their concerns about the economy, society, and the way our country is run. They responded nationwide with great passion, volunteering and making small donations, transforming his campaign into a true movement. His fans included not only Evangelical Christians, but also others who felt he was the only Republican who really shared their values. This book will remind the four million Huckabee voters that their support and hard work were not in vain. It will also be fun to read, full of unreported anecdotes from the campaign trail. Huckabee also lays out his optimistic vision for America's future. He explains how the Republican Party can unify its factions and win over middle-class and working-class voters. No matter what happens on election day 2008, Huckabee's fans will be looking to him for leadership as their movement rolls on.",
