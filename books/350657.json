  "description": "True Romance, directed by Tony Scott, is a hilarious, twisted road movie about which Interview raved, \"A pop-crazy, instant B classic with A clout.\" Alabama, a hooker, and Clarence, a comic-book store clerk, fall in love and hit the road in a purple Cadillac. They are going to Los Angeles to start a new life -- with a suitcase full of cocaine accidentally stolen from Alabama's defunct ex-pimp. Guided by the spirit of Elvis, Clarence attempts to sell the coke to a top Hollywood director, putting the young lovers in the middle of a standoff between the narcs and the Sicilian gangsters who rightfully own the cocaine. This publication of Tarantino's first screenplay, written when he was still a video-store clerk, contains the original ending and Tarantino's \"answers first, questions later\" structure, both of which were altered by Scott.",
