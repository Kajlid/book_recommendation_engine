  "description": "Arian has escaped from the planet Zeta, where sheâ€™s been raised to breed royalty.  She's brought with her family and slaves, hiding them from the Zetans on a new planet. While she scavenges space for supplies for them, she encounters a massive chunk of blown-up planet from the Sirian galaxy. Her computer claims the hollowed out core contains ancient artifacts.  There's no way she can pass up that treasure.  Unfortunately, her hacked computer never tells her the artifacts are actually metal skeletons whose bodies need to be grown into dangerously hot men.",
