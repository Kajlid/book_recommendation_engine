After all, he’s not getting any younger, although age isn’t why he retired from the military.After the incident they had no choice but to medically discharge him. Probably for the best because something inside him is struggling to break free.Adrift and on the prowl, he runs into his high school crush, Anika. She’s still as beautiful as before, meaning of course he puts his foot in his mouth, down his throat, and out his…Yeah, he’s still an idiot around her. He can’t help himself despite knowing he should stay away. The blackouts have started up again, resulting in a loss of clothes and a raw diet.Discovering he's a giant freaking cat isn’t easy to accept, especially since his family’s idea of sympathy is offering him a can of tuna and dangling a string.They won’t laugh for long once they realize he can’t control the beast.Only love can tame him.",
