  "description": "Ol' Halloween Night is what makes Halloween magical. Halloween night is cold, dark and dreary, yet, there is a glow about the night that makes us all giddy. It makes us all a little bit scared and a lot a bit excited. Halloween Night is the one night of the year when scaring is expected and welcomed. It is the night when you get to go to stranger's houses and demand they give you candy. It is the night you get to dress up as your favorite character and be whoever you want to be. In the end, it is a night of fun and adventure. That is what Ol' Halloween Night is, a book that depicts the fun and adventure but also the awesome creepiness of Halloween night. The book brings all of the Halloween characters to life. It brings Halloween to life.",
