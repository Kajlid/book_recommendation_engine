  "description": "A river of poison runs through Rose's veins.  Ten years ago, Rose Carrado was just a child who made the mistake of trying to catch snowflakes. Boston was overrun by creatures no human had ever seen, or even believed existed. Rose was easy prey. As she lay bleeding—dying—she came face-to-face with an ancient being, one who commanded her to live.  So she did.  Now a young woman, Rose lives with the consequences of that command. Changed by the creature who bit her, she's a reminder of a time humans want to forget.  But she was left with something else: a connection to those ancient vampires who saved her life so long ago. When brothers Ra, Seti, and Horus return to Boston, the ties that bind them to Rose snap tight. For the first time, they encounter someone who has the power to throw their unending existence into the best sort of chaos, and they won't allow anything—not life, not death—to take her from them.",
