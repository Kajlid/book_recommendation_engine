  "description": "Baby Piggy explains how she used to wear diapers. She used to get her diaper changed a lot every day, whether she liked it or not. She used to get diaper rash, and she used to get annoyed when her mother wouldn't change it right away. One day she wanted to be like the big kids. So she decided that she'd had enough of wearing diapers. Now she goes on the potty; whenever she has to go, she says, I have to go now; she wears big-kid pants and she can pull them up all by herself. She's getting bigger every day. At the end, she asks, \"Are you getting bigger, too?\"",
