  "description": "Twenty-four years into the Dead outbreak that ended the world, Soren Mitchell sticks out like a sore thumb in the remains of the human race. She's an anomaly: a hybrid of human and Dead, created by her mother's genetic immunity. Like her parents, she's fierce and strong. But despite their hopes for her happiness and safety, and even though she is no real threat to the colony, she has let the humans muzzle her and confine her within the walls of Dead Run River in search of a cure.When Kaegan Langford stumbles into the colony with an injured friend draped across his shoulders, her world is turned upside down. Intrigued and affected by her, he asks her to come to Empalme, Mexico with him to fight in the war between Deads and humans. It'll be a long, treacherous journey to the coast, but she's had all she can take in the colony.Battles with Deads, betrayal, injury, kidnappings, and a criminal-run train ride stand between them and the war. But in the end, it's not just the war with the Deads that could be the death of them.Tera Shanley's final book in the Dead Rapture series will thrill your heart...and your braaaains.",
