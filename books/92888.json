  "description": "US First Lady, Kathryne Mannocks has had enough. She’s done her best but refuses to continue being humiliated by her husband’s behaviour. And the goddamn security is choking her. Tripping over the final straw she angrily storms out of the White House to join former college friends for a reunion at the old hotel way out in the country. It gives her some freedom to be herself and plenty of fresh air and old friendships might help her regain perspective. Their stifling efforts to impose blanket security upon her have been stubbornly refused. She refuses to acknowledge she’s now left vulnerable and minimally protected.A group of terrorists stage a murderous breakout from a nearby high security prison. Armed with guns and explosives, Dravid, an Islamic jihadist and Eamon, a Free Ireland veteran, lead an uneasy and temporary alliance to further their causes. They make their way to the hotel and ruthlessly and bloodily capture a prize that will further their deadly objectives.But while two powerful governments find themselves held in a standoff, there are others at the hotel with the strengths to pit themselves against this post massacre mission.",
