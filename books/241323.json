The lass needs long, wet, filthy kisses—STAT—and he’s just the man for the job.It doesn’t take long for a wildly sexy, sinfully satisfying, no-strings attached arrangement to turn into something more. Something sweet and addictive and real. But Tommy and Abby are too royally stubborn to admit it.Opposites attract, everyone knows that. But can they last—can they love…for forever?",
