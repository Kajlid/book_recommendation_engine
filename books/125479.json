  "description": "Obsidian Raines is everything I hate in a new neighbor. He's smart, sexy, and a wealthy vampire. Now, I know what you're thinking, he sounds hot, right? Well, he is hot, but that's not the point. If you were a nymph you would understand. Life for us is no picnic; most of us end up stalkers, sex addicts, and prostitutes. I am no exception to this rule, which is why I was sent to the middle of nowhere Alabama to be alone. How was I supposed to know that he would inadvertently destroy all of my therapist's progress with the first word that came out of his brooding, sarcastic mouth? In between Obsidian and my new friendship with Alpha werewolf, Oswin Morris, I'm pretty sure that my 'punishment' will turn out to be a catastrophe only a nymph could be capable of.",
