  "description": "The Ch-khana haven’t given up in their efforts to annihilate the entire planet of Cassiopeia, and this second attempt leaves Raven both frightened and vengeful.  The Ch-khana from the Andromeda Galaxy had retreated to Earth after failing in their first attempt to obliterate the entire planet where Ani Maxima and her family lived. But it becomes soon apparent that they haven’t given up. After another massive attempt on the lives of everyone on Cassiopeia, Raven, Ani Maxima’s little sister starts plotting her revenge. Unfortunately, when a woman who has the mental capacity of a toddler seeks revenge, her choices may not be appropriate. Raven also has a plan to take charge of the Ch-khana destroyer that still remains in orbit above the planet. But little does she know that the ship isn’t quite so willing to have humans aboard. See, that ship still has a viable AI and it knows that the original crew has been incinerated somehow. It also knows when Ani Maxima steps aboard and that’s not acceptable.
