  "title": "Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics",
  "description": "Richard Holloway's highly acclaimed analysis of contemporary morality has met with great success in the U.K., while causing a great deal of controversy with its broadminded and refreshingly unhypocritical and honest views on life in modern society. Godless Morality tackles issues that affect us all -- it is a book with which every member of our society should engage. \"Holloway's language and style are engaging, his research conscientious and his conclusions thoughtful and frequently wise.\" -- The Sunday Times (London) \"A passionate, provocative and commonsense challenge to easy cant.\" -- The Observer (London) \"A Book of Morals for our brave new world, by a very wise man indeed. Inspiring. Fascinating. Full of hope.\" -- Fay Weldon \"This is a courageous book for a bishop to write, and everything it says about morality is right....\" -- Literary Review",
