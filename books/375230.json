  "description": "They say true freedom arrives when all the kids are gone and the dog dies. With his family grown and his husband Zack having decided to become a middle-aged clich√© and marry his secretary, Chris Thayer is about to discover that starting life over at 48 is just as complicated, frustrating and thrilling as the first time around. After relocating to the North Carolina beach community of Emerald Isle, Chris finds a new appreciation of his role as the heart of the home to his grown children and becomes involved in the patchwork lives of his neighbors. To his unending surprise, he also finds himself the object of a new man's affections, a rowdy jack-of-all-trades with an unnervingly direct stare. In the same quiet, understated manner that he demonstrated in his critically acclaimed first novel, Metes and Bounds , Jay Quinn gives the traditional Southern novel a decidedly untraditional twist. Jay Quinn is the founding editor and executive editor of Haworth Press's Southern Tier Editions. He is the author of Metes and Bounds and The Mentor and has edited Rebel Stories by Contemporary Southern Gay Authors . He lives in south Florida.",
