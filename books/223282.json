  "description": "It’s been an entire month since Shayler Thompson has orgasmed from something not made out of silicone. If her sour mood is any indication, she needs to get laid like yesterday. So when she walks up to a sexy nerd at the bar and propositions him, it seems like a great idea. Until he rejects her and calls her easy.Still reeling from his hurtful words, Shayler is surprised to find that the nerd, David, is a Teaching Assistant for the one college class she’s totally embarrassing herself in. When he offers to help her study, she accepts, thinking that maybe she’ll get laid after all. But David isn’t into casual sex, and Shayler refuses any sort of commitment. With enough chemistry to set his dumb Prius on fire, she’s sure one of them will eventually give in…she just really hopes it won’t be her.",
