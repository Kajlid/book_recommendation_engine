  "description": "Their lives just got complicated, but neither of them are the type to travel the easy road. \nBook Two of the Bash trilogy…Will Bud want to tear Bash to pieces? How is Dawg going to fit into all of this? Will the Disciples retaliate? And now that the District Attorney is in Angelica’s life, can she get him out?Bash may have claimed her in both wolf and human form, but Angelica isn't likely to just roll over and show him her belly every time he gives her an order. One night of incredible sex doesn’t mean the relationship will be smooth sailing. They both want it to work, though, and they’re both used to getting what they want. Warning: A touch more BDSM, tons of raw kink, blazing hot sex, danger, intrigue, and there might even be a sexy ménage.This is volume two of a three book story. Beware of the cliffhanger at the end, but book three will release a mere two weeks after book two.",
