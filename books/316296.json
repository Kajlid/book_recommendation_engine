  "description": "William Desjardin was dead: the victim of an interrupted home burglary, according to the police. Cassidy returns to Embarrass with Julia to support her with the funeral details, rehoming Julia’s mother, and settling the Desjardin estate. For Cassidy, being back in the small, northern Minnesotan town has brought back a number of good memories—most starring Julia herself. But it’s also triggered some memories she’d rather leave buried. And when an unexpected life insurance policy implicates Julia in her father’s death, the short visit turns into much more than a trip down memory lane.Book 5 in the Don’t Call Me Hero series.",
