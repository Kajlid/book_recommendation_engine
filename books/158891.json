Then his parents arrive after the police leave and rush him and his sister into the car, insisting they are going on a vacation. Ben's a little skepticalâ€”his family doesn't go on vacations. After they lose the police in a high-speed car chase and end up in a remote cabin deep in the woods, Ben discovers his parents' secret: millions of dollars were deposited into their bank account by accident, and they took the money and ran off. Ben isn't sure what to think. Are his parents criminals? And because he ran off with them, is he a criminal, too?",
