  "description": "The rain is falling and the dead are rising. It began at an ultra-secret government laboratory. Experiments in limb regeneration-an unspeakable union of Medieval alchemy and cutting edge genetics result in the very germ of horror itself: a gene trigger that will reanimate dead tissue...any dead tissue. Now it's loose. It's gone viral. It's in the rain. And the rain has notstopped falling for weeks. As the country floods and corpses float in the streets, as cities are submerged, the evil dead are rising. Andthey are hungry. Limited Edition 666 page Hardback.",
