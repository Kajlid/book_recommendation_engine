  "title": "SOPHIE SMALL AND THE VERY TALL STORY",
  "description": "Sophie Small is a twelve year old girl who lives at the very top of a tall high rise building. Her dad works the night shift at a local superstore and she’s left to fend for herself in the flat. She hates being alone. That is until the night journeys start and her adventures begin. The sofa quakes and shakes, a hole opens in the wall of the flat and Sophie and the sofa fly through. She rescues a dragon from a princess and attends the wedding of Henry VIII and Katherine Parr. When Sophie tries to tell anyone about the journeys they call her a liar. She has told tall tales in the past but why won’t anyone believe her when she’s telling the truth?",
