  "description": "What makes a boy turn to the dark side? Nature? Nurture?What can make a man turn his back on everything he’s ever held for true? Make him walk away from the money, the willing women, the power over people. From the terror he sees in their eyes when the storm giants come out to play.Doctor Dauffenbach’s widow is knocking on Everett’s door, talking like they’re still an item. It’s unfortunate there’s so many obstacles in the way of making her heart stop.Everett’s wife Kerri is beginning to suspect his history with the widow, and she’s forced to examine things about their life together that she’s successfully ignored since the beginning.Everett’s mom Bambi is on her death bed and still manages to foul things up for him. Maybe she did try to rescue him from the storm giants when he was a kid – but she never tried to rescue him from the things he saw under her roof.Everett’s son Raymond trusts him to keep the howling winds of chaos away. But to keep his family alive he has to break every promise, and return to the crazy-clown, evil-funhouse mindset he thought he’d left forever.Throughout, the treacherous storm giants will be his only friends. They’ll help him review the lessons he learned as a child: that blood isn’t shy about spilling, and that it always means something to somebody when people leak.Everett knows the catechism of violence to his core, and there can’t possibly be any fairy tale ending for him and his.Can there?",
