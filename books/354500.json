  "title": "Frigidity in Woman in Relation to Her Love Life, 2 Vols",
  "description": "No other scientist could treat this subject with greater understanding and human sympathy than Dr. Stekel. His authority is paramount and based on practical and not mere theoretical observation. Frigidity in woman has been a serious tragedy for the individual and it has wrecked many a potentially happy marriage. In this great work Dr. Stekel places before us a wealth of clinical experience. He tells the stories, dramatic and highly interesting, of many sufferers, analyzes their complaints, and shows how these complaints express themselves in organic symptoms. Dr. Stekel experiments in sexual science in the light of modern discoveries and lays down a new foundation for treatment.",
