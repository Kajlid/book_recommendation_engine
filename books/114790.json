  "description": "The Pacific Northwest, November. American Indian detective Archie Stevens is trying to decide if he has a future in police work. Caught between two worlds, Archie is a loner with a bad case of simmering, barely contained anger. Following up a trivial cold case nobody else wants, he finds the mutilated corpse of a former friend, an old cold-water diver who may have had information Archie needs. At first, the case seems straightforward. The diver was a poacher and his partner is the likely suspect. But Archie has problems with this scenario. The murder was particularly brutal and the victim tortured before he died. He also had criminal connections; his killing could be a case of gangland vengeance. The pressure to solve the case, which seems uncomplicated to Archie’s superiors, increases. Then a new element emerges. Archie discovers evidence that points to the apparently long-dead cult that once terrorized the district. Could it be that someone is emulating the cult? As Archie’s superb analytical skills take him deeper into the mystery, the danger intensifies. Pushed to his limits, he must reach out to others. Most important, he must reconnect with his own community and rely, once again, on friends he has estranged. To solve the case, to bring his quarry to bay, and to save the woman he loves, Archie must risk his career and his life.",
