  "description": "Washed up star catcher for the Chicago Cubs Blake Benson dodges death and gains a chance to redeem both himself and the team. Blake Benson was a star catcher in his prime. Now he's addicted to alcohol and finds himself in the unenviable position of third stringer with the Chicago Cubs team as it enjoys a 10-game lead heading into the home stretch of the season. Drunk and late once too many times, Benson is kicked off the team in Hotlanta, Georgia and sent packing to rehab...or so he thinks. The team plane crashes outside St. Louis and everyone perishes. Benson is the only remaining team member on the roster. He is given a chance to rebuild the team as player/manager and reconstruct an alcohol-free life. Benson struggles with the temptation of the bottle and the management of an unruly bunch of rejects, has-beens like himself, and some awesome rookie talent as he tries to win the division against the streaking, hot, and well-managed St. Louis Cardinals. It's a race to the end of the season where awesome self-discoveries await.",
