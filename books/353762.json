  "description": "Wes McLain returned from the Civil War with little money—and less hope. He had even given up on love. Until he saw her...Allie, the blue-eyed girl who had been called a savage, a wild soul—and was a prisoner of what seemed to be a horrible fate. But when Wes looked into her eyes, he wanted only to free her, and take her with him on a journey through the frontiers of Texas.But Allie had been brutally mistreated for years, and was now too afraid to speak. Wes will have to heal her, and it will take more than good intentions or a few moonlight kisses to win her trust. And when Allie's finally ready to speak again, she will tell Wes more than he ever imagined.",
