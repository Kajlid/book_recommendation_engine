  "description": "Hawke Navarro. A criminal. A murderer. The former President of the most notorious MC around. The law thinks he's dead, and he needs to stay that way.  But there's a problem, and her name is Tyler Wilson.  He promised her old man he would look out for her as he died in Hawke's arms. He wanted her to steer clear from the club and live an ordinary life. But Ty lingers. She grows and she's not the little girl Hawke remembered her to be. And soon he can't look at her as that little girl anymore. Not with those curves, or that face, or those sinfully tasty lips.  Hawke is determined to stay away; determined never to go back to that life.  But with a new threat on the horizon, Tyler's life hangs in the balance as trust is questioned and secrets threaten to tear her world apart, leaving Hawke no choice but to return.",
