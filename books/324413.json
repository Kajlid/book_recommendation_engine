  "description": "This badass bartender is as tasty as the whiskey he pours.Mitch ‘Moonlighter’ Tirone landed his nickname by excelling at two careers. Hardworking contractor by day, he trades the power drill for a bar apron at night, pouring ʼem strong at his old man’s gin mill. He’s cool as the brews he serves until he spies a flame-haired goddess cruising by on a bright pink bicycle. One gobsmacked glance, and ʼLighter turns loopy as a lush. First item on the gotta-have-her agenda: let’s find out what the beauty likes to drink…His mystery woman is the town’s sexiest teetotaler.Substance abuse counselor Andy Lachlan possesses a boy’s name, a centerfold’s figure, and a brutal past. Daughter of a violent drunk, alcohol is her no-go zone, and she’s passionate about assisting addicts while avoiding the liquor lifestyle like the plague. Hours spent advising clients or pedaling off the angst on a hippyish ten-speed don’t leave much time for fun-n-games, but this new girl in the ’hood isn’t about to settle for anyone less than the alpha abstainer of her dreams…Professional partier, and despiser of all things booze. The chemistry is combustible when bad boy and bohemian meet, but can the star-crossed lovers make it work and find the ‘heavenly mix’?",
