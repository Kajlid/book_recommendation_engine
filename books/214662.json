  "description": "Can you fake a happily-ever-after?Veteran running back Jude Owens is one of the best and most respected players in the league. A brutal concussion nearly ended his career, but Jude refuses to retire without earning the ultimate honor—a championship.But first, he needs me to clear him to play. As the Ironfield Rivets’ neurologist, I usually treat bad boy quarterbacks and beastly linebackers. I can’t be impartial when my lifelong crush hops onto the exam table. Not only is Jude gorgeous and a gentleman, he’s my brother’s best friend…and the father of my unborn baby. Or so everyone thinks.Jude offers to pose as my boyfriend and the baby’s father to save my reputation. In return, he needs my help to stay on the field. The pretend romance keeps me close enough to take care of him, but I can’t protect my heart. Our stolen kisses and nightly indiscretions make this fake relationship feel so very real.I can’t complicate our arrangement by falling in love, especially as Jude’s obsession with football blinds him to everything but the game. When his symptoms worsen, the only way I can protect him may be to sit him on the sidelines. But ending his career will ruin our Once Upon A Time.It’s up to me to save my prince charming.Even if it means I lose my happily-ever-after.",
