  "description": "I was given to him as a gesture of goodwill behind the guise of matrimony. Trapped in an opulent cage as shackles of gold held me prisoner in his underworld empire.Tormented by a cruel smile, gentle kisses, and honeyed lies, subduing me into a hope that he would be mine.And I bit into the fruit he offered, giving him my flowers.But the enchantment of his gentlemanly facade faded into the black sea of his atrocities. Engorged on the ripe fruit of love, its sweet nectar turned to poison in my veins.",
