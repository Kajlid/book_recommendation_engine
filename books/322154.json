  "description": "From USA Today Bestseller Elodie Colt comes a slow burn mafia romance full of suspense, angst, raw passion, and a hot Alpha who stands above the law. For fans of Natasha Knight, A. Zavarelli, and Rina Kent.She’s only a pawn in the kingdom he rules, but soon she will become so much more…People avoid me. Too blunt, rude, and brutally candid, they say. Well, that’s what you become when the nightmares devour you. A girl who needs tattoos to hide what can’t be erased, a shrink to cure what can’t be cured, and a sketchpad to escape a reality that always catches up to her.I hate people in general, but I hate men with a passion. I will never marry, never fall in love, and never kiss anybody. This is my choice, and I get along just fine.Until Daniel DeLuca. His name makes crime lords cower in fear and cops look the other way. Whenever his eyes burn into mine, something weird happens inside me. Something that scares the shit out of me.He’s a bomb detonating in my pathetically dull life. A rich-ass mobster wearing Armani, a dozen rings on his fingers, and an air of power that oozes more danger than the poisonous snakes he’s keeping in his office.His soul is as black as mine. Maybe that’s why I’m drawn to him. We live in the same darkness.And only the darkness can show us the stars.",
