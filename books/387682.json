Lui—and in the realm of paranormal romance, no one is better! With Soul Song , the sensational New York Times bestselling superstar brings readers another marvelous tale of passion and otherworldly occurrences centered around the mysterious Dirk and Steele Detective Agency—as a tormented young woman with the precognitive power to foresee terrible futures must place her own fate in the hands of a mesmerizing prince of the sea. A master at creating unforgettable love stories featuring shapeshifters, telekinetics, and extraordinary supernatural beings, Lui has earned herself a legion of fans, and Soul Song will merely add to their ranks. Christine Feehan, author of Dark Prince and one of the biggest names in paranormal romance, promises that, “anyone who loves my work should love hers.”",
