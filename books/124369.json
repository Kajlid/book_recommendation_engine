The moment they arrive in their new home hundreds of frogs rain from the sky. Her quirky new neighbor has a house full of knickknacks and odd tiny creatures beckoning from the shadows, and there's a terrible curse on the town that makes every summer storm a life threatening event. Welcome to the town of Deluge.",
