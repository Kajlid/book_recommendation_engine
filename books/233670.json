  "description": "Leksander is a Dragon Prince of the House of Smoke… and he is in love with the wrong woman.   Leksander never meant to fall for an angeling, and he certainly never meant to hurt her. The protection of humanity is his most sacred duty, but how can he do that when he can’t even protect the woman he loves? Saving Erelah means saving himself—he’ll be useless for anything else until he does, including finding a mate to fulfill a ten-thousand-year-old treaty to keep humanity safe from the fae. While he may not win her love, he will risk everything to save his angeling from her Fall…  The worlds of shadow angels and vengeful Dark Fae collide in this penultimate book in the Fallen Immortals series. Either Leksander and Erelah will save the mortal and immortal worlds with a Love that is True… or they’ll bring a Fall like the world has never seen.  The FALLEN IMMORTALS series is a modern Beauty and the Beast story with flaming HOT dragon shifters, vengeful Dark Fae, and beguiling fallen angels.
