For Evan James, one brief moment is enough to understand what has happened and to set off in hot pursuit of the little thief. When Evan returns to restore her stolen goods—a priceless antique medallion—Lady Venetia is struck by the young man’s beauty, refined manner and noble spirit. She invites him to a reception taking place that evening at her father’s estate. It would be a rare opportunity for Evan to mingle with London’s nobility and, one day, even to win the hand of Lady Venetia, whose dowry might save his family from financial ruin. And yet, something inside Evan makes him refuse, as if, deep in his heart, he already feels he belongs to another woman. A woman he has yet to meet. A woman who, when the moment arrives, will forever seal his fate…With her direct yet multi-faceted style, Elisa S. Amore skillfully weaves together love, mystery and action, bringing to life a tale that is passionate and intense, filled with boldness and romance, a story that serves as the perfect introduction and prequel to Touched - The Caress of Fate.Fans of Veronica Roth, Stephenie Meyer, Cassandra Clare, and Lauren Kate will love this series by Elisa S.
