  "description": "Dear Love Vixen:I've been a little ... down on my luck. (Like flat broke, homeless, and depressed). So my uncle has been letting me crash at his place and deliver coffee for his diner. It was temporary. Till I got on my feet. Anyway, I delivered coffee to this uber-hot executive type on Madison, and well ... mistakes were made. He thought I was his intern! And he put me to work. And I've always kinda wanted to work in advertising so I didn't correct him. I've been interning there now for two weeks, and the thing is, I think there's something developing between me and the hot boss. And I love this job (it'd be better if I was getting paid, of course). But when he finds out I'm not who he thinks I am, and that I never bothered to correct him, it'll all be over! What should I do? Mistaken Identity on MadisonDear Madison,What the whaaat? First it has to be said, “You go girl!” There I said it, now let’s break it down. You’ve been working for two weeks and are still fake employed, so that says you’re doing well at your fake job. I suppose you could just stop showing up but you don’t sound like the kind of woman to ghost.Having the hots for your boss, now that’s a real pickle. Sweetie, you know what you have to do. Tell the truth and it will set you free. You just might want to check with the coffee shop as plan B should your truth set you back on the sidewalk. Good luck, hon!The ♥ Vixen",
