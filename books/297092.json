  "description": "Nobody warned me these men are hot as sin.It makes sense, I guess. They are the Seven Sins, after all.And what’s a fallen angel doing hanging out with guys like this, you ask? Well… that’s a long story that starts with me breaking a teeny-tiny rule and ends with me getting kicked out of Heaven.Oops.But now I’ve got a chance to go back! There’s just one little catch: I’ll only be allowed to return to Heaven if I can bring the Seven Sins with me.Yup. You heard that right. I have to redeem them. All of them.It shouldn’t be so hard. I’ve got a plan of action all set.Step 1: Stop thinking dirty thoughts about them.Step 2: Recruit their help to close up the strange demonic portal that just opened in Manhattan.Step 3: No, seriously, stop thinking dirty thoughts about them.Uh oh. This might not be as easy as I thought…Note: Dark Kings is the first book in the Feathers and Fate series, a reverse harem paranormal romance featuring a feisty fallen angel and seven delicious, devilish men.",
