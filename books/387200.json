But his strange profession has its perils. Those who fear the newborn clones have hunted Asher and his friends for years, claiming the lives of countless innocents, including his daughter. Claudia hosts the two most popular shows on two worlds, exhausting herself to educate the children of Mars and risking her life to raise the morale of the entire population. But when one of her cohosts is brutally murdered, she'll stop at nothing to avenge his death and make Mars safe again for everyone.Across frozen deserts and over raging volcanoes, Asher and Claudia lead a group of scientists, clones, and bikers on a high-octane charge to end the first war on Mars.Heirs of Mars follows the lives of six men and women (not all of them entirely human) from the dusty wind farms of the Valles Marineris to the shining city of New Troy, and from the ancient tunnels beneath the Noctis Labyrinth to the sandy highways where daredevils race on single-wheeled motorcycles for a fleeting glimpse of fame and freedom.Bonus   This special edition also includes the short story \"To Serve in Hell\" from the collection Heirs of Preludes .
