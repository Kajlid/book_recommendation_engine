  "description": "Who can't relate to Sylvia? Single parent of a teenager, trying to make ends meet. Trapped in a stressful job with bosses from hell. But then her mother gives her a gemstone ring, telling her it was made by an alchemist in Prague. The ring, she says, has magical powers. Sylvia's life turns into a historical fantasy, as she seems to rise above all the stress and the mind games at work, and even manages to get her own back sometimes. But slowly she realises that the magical power of the ring has a sinister side. She is going to need to make a choice.",
