  "description": "Mason Dyers hates the tedious task of learning, particularly when he has to force himself to read boring textbooks. His teachers are tired of his laziness and he has not submitted his homework in two weeks. Luckily for Mason, he finds himself in possession of a Book Transmitter. A machine that can literally transmit all the contents of any book into his head in minutes! It's a dream come true for Mason, or so it seems, until he realizes using the machine has its consequences; and knowing without learning may not be all it's cracked up to be.",
