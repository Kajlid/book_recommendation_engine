  "description": "What's worse than your little sister being smarter than you? Her being more popular, too. But sibling rivalry might just become sibling camaraderie when cliques get out of control in this fresh and fun novel. Sammi Tremayne's life isn't perfect, but she's got it on an even keel. She isn't ultra-popular, but she isn't at the bottom of the middle school social ladder, either. However, when it's decided that her brilliant little sister, Jorgianna, should skip not one, but two grades and join Sammi in eighth grade, Sammi's world is turned upside down. For someone who has always felt in the shadow of her little sister, this is Sammi's ultimate nightmare. To make matters even worse, Jorgianna is taken in by the most popular clique in school almost the minute she arrives: a clique that Sammi has been trying desperately to join. Everything, it seems, is going right for Jorgianna and wrong for Sammi. But there's more to each sister's story than the other realizes. And when the popular girls start to show their true colors to Jorgianna, can these siblings finally put aside their differences and show the queen bees who's boss?",
