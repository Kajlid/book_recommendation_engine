By daylight, three Midwestern college students are just anonymous faces in a backpack-sporting crowd. By moonlight, they're responsible for some of the ghastliest crimes in American history. To them it's a joke. For the campus and surrounding town, it's a nightmare. And for anyone who crosses them, it's a crash-course in... The Gentle Art of Making Enemies Class isn't just something to cut... it's something to die for.",
