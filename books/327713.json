  "description": "Ghosts aren't dogs.They don't come when you call them. But sixteen-year-old Suze sure wishes that Jesse — the hot guy ghost who won't quit haunting her bedroom — would show up right now. Because Suze — a mediator, someone who helps guide wayward spirits back to where they belong — is in way over her head when she tackles the ghosts of four star high school students who were killed in a tragic car accident.... Trouble is, it's starting to look as if there was nothing accidental about it, and these four are out for revenge... and not against just the geek who killed them, but anyone who stands in their way.",
