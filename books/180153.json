  "description": "Appearances can be deceiving...  The geek next door - or the stuff of (naughty) dreams? As a Hunter, Jaynos has lived inside the twisted minds of the evil that is the Forsaken; the enemy he has protected mankind from for most of his considerably long life, while struggling to maintain his sanity despite the constant onslaught of pain and horror. Just as he begins to fear that he is losing his humanity, he is given a mission that changes everything. Now he must decide, his people or his heart?  The blonde-haired, blue-eyed bimbo – not! Sexy, witty, Candi – with an 'i' – is having some seriously yummy dreams about her neighbour, and she's not averse to acting them out. Only problem is, turns out he's a whole other species. Throw in a knitting needle wielding Nana, a father who owns a baseball bat - and knows how to use it – and a psychotic ex-boyfriend out to kill her, and this relationship is definitely off to a rocky start.",
