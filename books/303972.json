  "description": "He's back! In a voice more cantankerous and comically pungent than ever, George Carlin spouts off on everything from British royalty (\"A Day in the Life of Henry VIII\") to auto racing (\"Sports Should Be Fixed\") to American politics (\"Don't Blame the Leaders\"). With his manic mind and motor mouth in high gear, he rants against anyone who tells him to \"have a nice day\" and skewers the euphemism epidemic (\"To be honest, some of this language makes me want to vomit. Well, perhaps 'vomit' is too strong a word. It makes me want to engage in a involuntary personal protein spill\"). When Carlin's in a more reflective mood, he reveals, \"I couldn't commit suicide if my life depended on it,\" and ponders the really big questions, like \"Is a vegetarian permitted to eat animal crackers?\" and \"Griddle cakes, pancakes, hotcakes, flapjacks: why are there four names for grilled batter and only one word for love? \"What his candid take on \"life's little moments\" lacks in political correctness, it more than makes up for in gut-busting laughs. He's the guy who dares say what the rest of us hesitate even to think. And he does so in ways that are often raunchy and always riotous.",
