  "description": "Your whole world can change in a single moment.A reckless moment where you let go of your inhibitions and you lose control. I pride myself on never losing control, but somehow, I did with her. I let my desire overtake me, and I took a bite of that forbidden fruit that stood in front of me in nothing but a nightie. I fucked my best friend’s little sister, and I regretted it the moment I felt her wrapped around me. Not because it felt bad. No, because, since that moment, nothing has ever felt so right… My name is Tristan Knight and I'm not your average New York millionaire. In fact, there's nothing average about me. I was born in the projects, and I lived there up until the day I was adopted. My past is a distant memory of fuck-ups and bad luck.The only thing that kept me from ending up like everyone else on the street was the StoneHaven family. When I met them, I was determined to hate them all. They represented everything I didn't have. Power. Wealth. Control.At least, that's what I used to think.Now, as time goes on, I find myself falling in love with their shattered lives... falling in love with the one thing I can't have. Her. Emily StoneHaven.I can never be the knight in shining armor I know she wants, but I've already tasted her—and now, I can't stop this insatiable desire to be everything she needs.",
