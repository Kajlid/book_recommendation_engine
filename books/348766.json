  "description": "[From back cover] First Castel Haleyon fell, then Sea Island, then Morninglight, then Maraval--one by one, with their gaue-clad Phanes, ancient books and sutble essences, teh proud castles of Earch fell before the rebellious Meks, until only Castel Hagedorn was left. For 700 years the eks had served without complaint; they were indispensable--for no truegentelman would deman himself with the indignity of toil. Now, for no discernible reason, they were about to destroy the genteel civilization of Earth. But the cultured aristocrats were too proud to lower themselves by dealing with the Mek rebellion. Even as their turrets crumbled around them they chose to remain dignified and aloof. Someone had to do something...Hagedorn was the last castle.",
