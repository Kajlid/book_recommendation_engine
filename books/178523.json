  "description": "Ally Moran has always just known about things—things she shouldn’t really be able to know…  Suddenly when she starts having vivid visions about a former friend who is in desperate trouble, the adults in her life think she might hold the key to an ancient mystery.  Jack Ruiz has a troubled past, but is trying to make a fresh start at a new high school…  He just wants to keep his head down and graduate, hopefully before he turns 20. The last thing he needs is to get involved with a feisty redhead and her psychic visions.  While Jack valiantly attempts to keep Ally at arm’s length, she is equally determined to be a part of his life. Who will win this battle of wills?  More importantly…  Can this unlikely couple work together to find answers to Ally’s visions before someone gets killed?",
