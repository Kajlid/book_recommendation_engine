Why, marry him, of course.Julia Frant has secretly loved Alec MacLean, the wild Viscount Hunterston from afar.

At least marriage with do-gooder Julia will guarantee his fortune. But as his plain brown wren transforms herself into an elegant swan, Alec suddenly can't stay away from his last-minute wife--and when he kisses her, the inheritance is the last thing on his mind.
