  "description": "“A spellbinder…told in prose as taut as a garrote.”-Bradley Steffens, author ofIbn First Scientist“Robust and sophisticated story-telling...grippingterrorist plot...don't forget to breathe.\"-Margaret Richard, author ofBody Electric\"QUENTIN HAWK...a guy who'd put a bullet in your enemy's medulla,help you move your furniture, buy you a beer, and punch your arrogantboss in the mouth...A REAL HERO.\"-Robert Ross, author ofRed Hand Child, Flynn, Grisham and Connelly, make room for a new voice. From the first page, Brian Neary's Hawk delivers action, suspense and a gripping story that seems lifted right from today's newspapers. Yet everything about it is completely original. Extremely credible villains, so rich in political motivation and personal agenda, that after having finished the book, you'll find it hard to believe that Neary's bad guys don't actually exist. Likewise, the good guys; complex, intriguing, and volatile. Thoroughly irreverent; believable, intricate science; complicated story lines; a strong finish. Interest never wanes; you'll want to read it end-to-end. And woven unobtrusively throughout the plot, there's a romantic relationship - unique, passionate, unpredictable and once again, original, like none other I've read. Brian Neary is a new, dynamic voice in the spy/thriller genre. And his Hawk is a great read. Finalist - 2010 San Diego Book Awards - Thriller Category",
