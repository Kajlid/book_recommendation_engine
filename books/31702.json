  "title": "Skaia: Captives of Rome",
  "description": "Skaia was only a child when his village was burned and his family killed by Julius Caesar's troops in their attempt to add all of Gaul to the Roman Empire. Sold as a slave in Rome, he adjusts to his life in the Suetonius family, with the help of other slaves and the friendship of his young master, Glaucus. When Glaucus leaves for his tour of Greece, marking his official entry into manhood, Skaia is left behind, to the doubtful mercies of Glaucus' father, Thaddeus. Again, he adjusts and his life turns out far differently than he ever imagined, as he befriends and loves multiple generations of the family that owns him.",
