  "description": "It's the last week of summer. California's golden sun shines hot on Malibu Beach. Film stars, the rich, the beautiful, tan a sleeker brown. Cold Chardonnay frosts crystal goblets. The blue Pacific rolls up white sand. In a to-die-for beach house curtains are drawn. Doors are locked. The five Moss children—age five to nine—stare at a huge television from morning until they fall asleep in front of the glowing screen. Where are their mother and father? Marty and Paula Moss are finishing his new film in Italy. And the babysitter? Isn't she taking care of them? She was until three days ago when her body washed ashore. Drowned? Only the kids know. For reasons of their own, they're not telling. Day after day, sprawled in front of the television, shut in with their secret horror, the Moss kids fight off every adult invasion from the outside; be it cops, the FedEx man, postal people, curious neighbors, Marty Moss's prying secretary, and a mysterious man who peers at them nightly through a rip in a beachside window curtain. Somehow they survive.This is a novel of frightening suspense. It also provides a very private glimpse of a secret world many children inhabit today—a world more terrifying than you might ever view on the giant flat screen of your television.",
