  "description": "If you liked 'Home Ec for Girls...' then you might not like this. In four stories trapped in different literary periods, a young man makes repeated misguided attempts to rescue a young woman, variously assisted and obstructed by fathers, mothers, brothers and his personal demons. Each part is a Hoffmann short story re-told, filtered through the literature of the period and the narrator's increasingly distorting lens. By the fourth part the structure has broken down and the narrator breaks cover to address the reader directly, inviting and rejecting understanding in equal measure, confessing his sins and encouraging the reader to do the same, while his own characters criticise him and offer their opinions of the work. I am reluctant to make a definitive statement as to what the novel is about, as there is a danger that my opinion may be considered the one 'correct' answer, but for the benefit of the reader I might suggest the possibilities that it is about the search for an imagined ideal love; the struggle to maintain oneself intact amidst the flux of time and in opposition to other people; the progress, or lack of progress, of the protagonist through a psychotherapeutic project; or the process of writing of creating and loving and letting go of what has been created. This is me, creating and loving and letting go. This is me, still falling.",
