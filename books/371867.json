  "description": "When having money is all that matters, what happens when you lose it allPerfect, picturesque Orchard Hill. It was the last thing Ally Ryan saw in the rear-view mirror as her mother drove them out of town and away from the shame of the scandal her father caused when his business deals left her family penniless and almost bankrupted all their friends - friends that liked having trust funds and new cars, and that didn't like constant reminders that they had been swindled. So it was adios, Orchard Hill. Thanks for nothing. But now, two years later, just as Ally is starting to feel happy again, her mother has accepted a job back at the site of their downfall and that means that Ally is forced to face her old \"friends\" again. And as if dealing with past demons, and current grudges, wasn't enough things get even more confusing when Ally meets the handsome, wealthy and totally into her Jake Graydon, who just happens to live in Ally's old house and be part of the clique that she left behindâ€¦ complicated much? Ally was hoping to have left all the drama in the past, but she's quickly discovering that some things just can't be forgotten.",
