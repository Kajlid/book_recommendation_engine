  "title": "Cooking with Caroline: A Novel of Food and Friendship",
  "description": "Sometimes the only thing that keeps us alive is someone not willing to let go Not much stuff ever happens in Gull Cove. Not in the town, not in its one and only secondary school, and definitely not in the life of 16-year-old Kirsty Matthews. Pancake-faced and too chubby from being fed too much beige food over the years but not grossly overweight yet and planning to keep it that way, Kirsty is more of a people watcher than one to watch. Opinionated, with an eclectic taste in oldie music and an acerbic wit, she has one friend only and that's enough. Life is comfortably dull. But when Caroline Connelly, of Cooking with Caroline fame, comes home to Gull Cove to teach a cookery class, Kirsty is teamed up at the stove with resident pain-in-the-arse Jake Deacon and suddenly, between chicken roast and fishcakes, her world is turned upside down and inside out with an abundance of stuff that changes her life forever.",
