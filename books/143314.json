  "description": "28-year-old Jessica Banks does not want to be back in her New Zealand hometown one little bit. Goodbye exciting London, hello old-fashioned boredom.  And she’s got a lot to deal with. There’s her overbearing mother, her new fashion career, not to mention the sudden disappearance of her best friend. Thank goodness for Ben, her reliable, cute friend who always has a broad shoulder to cry on—at least when his gorgeous girlfriend isn’t around.  Then sexy tennis pro, Scott bursts into her life, serving up a hot and steamy love match. But off the court Scott is running a different racket—one that might just open Jessica’s eyes and heart.  With everything she ever wanted and feared in front of her, will Jessica finally find her way home?",
