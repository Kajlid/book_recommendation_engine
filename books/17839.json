  "description": "The time for pretending is over. The Shackleton Building has been turned into a concentration camp, and the last free people in Phoenix are forced into hiding. The fight is over unless Jordan and Luke can figure out where the Co-operative is hiding Tobias. And Jordan has to find a way to protect Luke before Peter rages out of control … or else history is doomed to repeat itself. With only weeks left until Tabitha is released, Phoenix’s biggest secrets are still yet to be revealed. And the clock is still ticking. There are 35 days until the end of the world.",
