  "description": "An interesting and socially-important psychological review of the criminal archetype, that views the phenomenon of criminalized drug addiction both from the inside, as well as from the academic perspective. Offers a unique, fascinating and heartfelt glimpse into the world of criminalized drug addicts, revealing both the self-indulgence and the outgoing humanity of the puer and trickster images that is so prevalent in the social order of this shadowed underworld. Dr John Smethers takes us on a deeply personal journey, looking at the root causes and effects of a sub-culture populated by society's social outcasts. Drug addicts, alcoholics and petty criminals are studied from the unique perspective of someone who has not only 'been there', but one who has also successfully struggled against the social and psychological forces that have lead so many of our young men into hopelessness and despair. This is a keen and insightful look into a little-known underworld which we all, in one way or another, have helped to create.",
