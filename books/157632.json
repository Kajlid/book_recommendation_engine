The note that his third-grade teacher Mrs. Quickett wrote to his parents: “I am very concerned with Anthony’s use of time in our classroom. He cannot seem to stay on track. He daydreams. He drifts. He forgets his assignments and rarely finishes his classwork on time.” The note he folds into a paper airplane and launches from the top of the Boulders. The note that soars away, much like Anthony’s imagination, and disappears through a magic portal into a strange land called The Realm of Inner Time. Join Anthony as he searches for the lost note with the help of a luminous creature–the Time Fly named Pteros Chronos, and Mr. Exactus Watchit, official Time Keeper of High Time. What they discover is far more than a paper airplane. Come along! You’re just in time! Reading Level: Grades 3 and up, Ages 8 +PRAISE FOR TIME FLIGHT\"His mind perpetually drifting where his creativity and optimism take it, distracted dreamer Anthony one day follows a paper airplane into a portal that takes him into another universe.
