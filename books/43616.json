  "description": "CJ's father, Charles Webber, had been a real bastard all her life. And when her mom died he'd told her that without Becky there to make him acknowledge CJ as his daughter, he was finished with her and she was never to darken his door again. The slap that bloodied her mouth at her mom's funeral had been more than enough to make his point. So she didn't, not even to come home to his funeral Austin Force wanted the property that the prick Webber owned. He wanted it for his pack and the house for his mom to call hers. But Webber dying had him dancing a jig and contacting the lawyer to make an offer. But finding that the man had a daughter and that she was his mate had Austin at his wits end. Austin didn't want to be impressed by her. He didn't want to like her. He wanted her to obey him, whelp a few pups so she wouldn't be bored and run his house for him. CJ wanted to do as she please which included maybe murdering the Alpha in his sleep. The two of them coming together is wonderfully steamy and sarcastic wit. Austin and CJ will make great alpha's...or will they?",
