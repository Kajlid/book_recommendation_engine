No work is more important.Jena is the leader of the line—strong, respected, reliable. And—as all girls must be—she is small; years of training have seen to that. It is not always easy but it is the way of things. And so a girl must wrap her limbs, lie still, deny herself a second bowl of stew. Or a first.But what happens when one tiny discovery makes Jena question the world she knows? What happens when moving a single stone changes everything?",
