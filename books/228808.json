  "description": "“So you see how the Lord constantly takes care of us?” Marcella said to her children as she walked nearly naked across the guest room that they occupied in the Wilcox farmhouse. “We had no money, and no place to go, but the Lord directed this nice man to take us in.”Timmy and Beth were already snuggled into bed, and they gazed at their mother who strutted before them in her stockings, garters, and pink pants. The lad’s small cock was stiff as he stared at his mother’s bare titties. Perfect plump orbs they were, bulging with bouncy firmness, their rosy nipples cocked.Timmy wriggled beneath the covers, and his sister gave him an inquisitive look. That funny thing, which she had noticed a few times, was happening to him again, she suspected. It seemed to happen when he looked at his mother, or at her, without their clothes on.Beth wondered what it was all about when her twin brother’s pee-pee stuck straight up against his belly, exposing the small sac that hung at its base. She wondered what was in that sac and why boys needed such a thing. Of course, Timmy’s peepee was to pee with, but she couldn’t figure out why it sometimes stood up, stiff as a stick. Their mother always noticed when it did that, too, and she made little remarks about the Lord’s power and patted Timmy on the head.",
