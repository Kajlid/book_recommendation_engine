  "description": "Riley Thomas has made some mistakes in life. She took a few wrong turns and has no idea what to do next. There's a blizzard baring down on the island and Riley is alone with two kids under the age of four. She's out of options, exhausted, and overwhelmed.An omega on her own always has to be on guard, but with her two girls counting on her to keep them safe, there's no time for a pity party. Seeing no other choice, Riley accepts an invitation to ride out the storm with one of the locals.Little does Riley know, everything is about to change.This book is set in the same world as the Ruined Records duet. However, Riley's story takes place four years in the future. There are a few things that will likely make more sense if you read Left in Ruins and Madness first, but it was designed so you can jump in here if you prefer. There are a few crossovers, but this is an entirely new cast of characters.",
