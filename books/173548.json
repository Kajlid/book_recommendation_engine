  "description": "Heath is Gabrielle’s best friend, but she takes the plunge and asks him for lessons – sex lessons. Reluctantly, he agrees, and what starts with a kiss, leads to so much more, because Heath has liked Gabrielle since he met her. That afternoon he teaches her what it is like to dive into the deep end and let pleasure take her away.",
