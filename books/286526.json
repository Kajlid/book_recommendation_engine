I didn’t marry my sugar baby, but she has pockets of sweetness that I’m addicted to.  We are one. We have always been a us. Possessive. Crazily in love. Living for each other in our ideal existence.  But the unexpected will rock our foundations. Who we are as a couple will define our relationship.  I know one thing for sure. I’m Gray Ellison … and there’s not a thing in this world which will keep me from loving my baby-girl until my last breath. She’s my heart. And will always remain my heart.
