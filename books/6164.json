  "description": "Blessed with the Welsh gift of \"sight,\" Lady Arianna saw the vision in a golden bowl. A knight with eyes gray as the English sea that had captured her, his sword about to pierce her heart. And she trembled, not with fear, but with a desire that engulfed her very soul.On the treacherous border of Wales, Raine, the Black Dragon, rides his charger toward Castle Rhuddlan and the lady within. Illegitimate son of a Norman nobleman, his past was scarred by denial and mistrust, and now his future lies in the conquest of a kingdom--and a woman's love.As the battle trumpet sounded, Arianna, her Celtic pride unyielding, saw her dream take flesh: Raine, the enemy who inflamed her blood with desire; Raine, the lover she must gentle and tame, and then, as ancient hatreds threatened their lives, either cherish...or betray.",
