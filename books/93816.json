  "description": "British theater star, Justin Holloway, is about to open in his first Broadway show. He should be stoked. But opening night jitters have gotten the best of him; and if one more person tells him to \"break a leg,\" he just might break theirs instead. When he pushes out of the theatre and accidentally knocks a woman into the street, he does the first thing that comes to mind—pretends he isn’t the show's lead and tries to charm her into drinks and dinner. Alexis Verdon is not a fan of musicals. Who really goes around singing grocery lists to the store clerk? Too bad she's promised her bed-ridden sister she would not only attend the opening night of Broadway's latest jewel, but also get autographs from the entire cast. As if that isn't bad enough, on the evening before her great sisterly sacrifice, Alexis is knocked flat on her butt by a handsome Brit who won't take \"no\" for an answer and insists on taking her out on of all days, Independence Day (hello, we wanted our independence from Great Britain for a reason)!  When their attraction leads to a steamy one night stand full of passion, lies and unspoken truths, will they find a way to turn one night into something more?",
