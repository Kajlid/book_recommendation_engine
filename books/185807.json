  "description": "Simon Sharp lost his parents to a plane crash two years ago. Now, it’s his fourteenth birthday and the only gift he wants is a place to belong. Unfortunately, he’s made a lot of bad decisions since the accident. Running away from halfway houses. Lashing out at people who care about him. And, worst of all, doing small jobs for a petty thief. Every payday makes the memory of his parents fade a little more.He hates his life. He hates himself.So when a girl in a colorful cloak shows up and tells Simon that he’s in danger and that he’s the heir to Lancelot, King Arthur’s most powerful knight, Simon assumes it’s a joke, but a drunk troll, a 7-foot man who calls himself Merlin and a hidden castle called New Camelot change his mind.Now, training as a knight with 149 other descendants of King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table, Simon finds himself part of a prophecy that promises the salvation of the world.But only through its destruction.",
