  "description": "A Sweet, Small Town Romantic ComedyHi, I’m Dee, and I’m captain of the friend zone.I didn’t ask for this dubious honor, but don’t worry, I like it this way. I’m happy not dating and just being “one of the guys” on my volleyball team.Until my scary new boss informs me that my job—I’m a developer at a dating app (ironic, right?) that I coded from scratch, an app that is essentially my baby—is in jeopardy.So I lie.Tell him that I’m living proof the app works, because I’m engaged to a man I met on it.And who do I name as my lucky (fake) fiancé?My best friend: Noah Jackson.Noah is my longtime confidant, teammate, and all around favorite person… and while he always says he’d do anything for me, this is surely overstepping the friendship boundary. Right?Apparently not. To my surprise, Noah agrees to go along with my crazy story and be my fake fiancé. And what’s more, he makes it look convincing.So convincing that I’m starting to wonder where the line is between friendship and “more”. And if it would really be so bad to cross that line and leave the friend zone for good…The Real Fake Fiancé is a sweet, laugh-out-loud romcom with all the swoony kisses and chemistry, but no explicit content. You’ll love this story for all of the fake engagement goodness, the cast of quirky small town characters, and a heartwarming, all-the-feels-giving HEA.",
