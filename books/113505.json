  "title": "Crusader",
  "description": "He was trussed like a calf for branding and dragged from the wilderness, the only home he had ever known. Then they made him fight, turning him into a prize possession for a greedy manager. Caught between two worlds, Harry Camden drifted into a life of drunkenness and crimeâ€¦until he met Crusader. More than sixteen hands of horseflesh and muscled like Goliath—a true king stallion. But only responsive to Camden's gentling touch. Could these two broken spirits make each other whole again?With Crusader, Max Brand has created an unparalleled novel of adventure, conflict and human achievement, a deeply touching portrait of the spirit of the American West.",
