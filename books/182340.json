  "description": "Alex Dane knew he shouldn’t have walked into this roadside bar. His gut told him that nothing good would come from entering the rundown, clapboard establishment. When he asked for the location of the bathroom, he knew almost at once that he had made a fatal error. The guy was on him before he knew it and he was out cold on the bathroom floor. He wakes up in the bed of a tall, dark, and handsome stranger - not a bad way to wake up, he might add. Craig Finnegan was sex on two legs, and just about the sum of every wet dream he’d ever had. Alex feels drawn to the handsome stranger, but can anything like this last for the long haul? For his own safety, Alex better hope it does.  Craig Finnegan couldn’t believe his eyes when his forever, human mate walked through the door of the seediest bar in the county. He was fresh faced and naive, with no idea what pit of vipers he’d just walked into. The attack in the bathroom just about made poor Craig come unglued, he would not find his mate, just to lose him again. With Alex now firmly in his life, the first hurdle of mate-hood is crossed, but now he has to explain the paranormal world to his very human and un-paranormal mate. He’s willing to take the chance. There are many more hurdles to cross, but if they can make it, they both will have finally found their forever home.",
