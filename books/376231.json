  "description": "Lex's ancestors have chosen a mate for him, there's only one problem. She's not the earthling he wants. Maya’s been raised to believe in aliens, and when she saves one from drowning, she can’t resist taking him home—and into her bed. Lex’s mission to collect his mate has been fraught with difficulties, and to add even more trouble to the mix, he finds himself attracted to the wrong earthling—a curvy human who makes him question tradition. Things get complicated in New Mexico because the military’s on the hunt for an ET, Maya’s determined to do what’s right, and Lex finds himself in the biggest battle of all—the one between his heart and his honor.For more info and an excerpt please see http://www.EveLanglais.com",
