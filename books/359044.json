  "title": "Nick Cave: Sinner Saint: The True Confessions, Thirty Years of Essential Interviews",
  "description": "Iconic drug-rock frontman, brutally poetic songwriter, cult novelist, and critically acclaimed screenwriter — Nick Cave is one of the most revered and singular artistic talents of the past three decades. This revealing collection of interviews tells the story of his 30-year career in his own words. Including his debauched years with the Birthday Party, the global success of the Bad Seeds and their ragged gospel-rock, Cave's addictions and artistry, and the roots of the barbed gothic romanticism that suffuses his lyrics. Displaying provocative intelligence and enigmatic vision, Cave offers valuable insight into the risks and gains of surrendering oneself to the rock’n’roll myth.",
