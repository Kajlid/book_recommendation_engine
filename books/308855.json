  "description": "Tomas and the Gypsy Violin is a simple but powerful tale about the transformative and healing power of music. It concerns an orphaned Roma child, Tomas, who is adopted by a Toronto couple. The traumatized boy is unresponsive to his new environment and withdraws into his own private world, but he comes out of his shell when he is reacquainted with the old and tattered violin he brought with him from Hungary, the only relic of his past life. A book about the love of music and the love of parent and child, it is also one of the few books that deal with the Roma community in Toronto.",
