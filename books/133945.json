  "description": "For ten years, Ash, to the best of her knowledge the last survivor of her family, has farmed her ancestral lands, trying in vain to forget her past - a past filled with bloodshed and rebellion when she became a pivotal figure in an ill-fated uprising against a repressive regime. Learning that her nephew may yet be alive, she feels compelled to search for him, for he may prove the heir to her family's power - a magical talent passed from generation to generation. But the joy of finding her nephew is short-lived. For when he, too, becomes embroiled in a rebellion which can only end in violence and massacre, Ash's own long-buried secrets rise up to haunt her. She knows that only she can turn the tide of history. But first, she must lay the ghosts of the past to rest and reclaim the special powers which are hers by birthright.",
