  "description": "Large Print Edtion, 15 pt font This book is NOT presented to you as fiction for a very special reason; it is NOT fiction! Of course, we can readily agree that some of the words in the book about life on this world are 'artistic license', but accept my statement that EVERYTHING about the life on 'The Other Side' is definitely true. Some people are born with great musical talent; some people are born with great artistic talent, they can paint and captivate the world. Other people may be highly gifted through their own hard work and assiduous devotion to study. I have little in the material side of this world -no car; -no television, no this and no that and for twenty-four hours a day I am confined to bed because, for one thing, I am paraplegic- no use in the legs. This has given me great opportunity for increasing talents or abilities which were granted to me at birth. I can do everything I write about in any of my books- except walk! I have the ability to do astral travel and because of my studies and, I suppose, because of a peculiar quirk in my make-up, I am able to astral travel to other planes of existence. The characters in this book are people who have lived and died on this world, and because of special provisions I have been able to follow their 'Flights into the Unknown'. Everything in this book about the After Life is utterly true, therefore I will not label the book as fiction. Lobsang Rampa",
