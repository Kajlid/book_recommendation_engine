The streets might be twinkling with fairy lights, but after the recent loss of her mother, she's never felt less festive.Forced to sleep under the same roof as her handsome neighbour Finn, Freya realises she's going to need a distraction—fast! So she sets herself a challenge: to cook the '12 Days of Christmas'. Her delicious food soon brings the villagers together, and as each day passes, old friendships are renewed, memories stirred and there's even the flickering of romance...She was only meant to stay for the holidays, but could Middlemass—and Finn—steal her heart forever?",
