  "title": "One Heartbeat Away: Your Journey into Eternity",
  "description": "The question of what happens to us after we die is on the minds of many? Can you prove to them that there is a God? What about evolution? Can the Bible be proven true? This book, which is inspired by conversations with lost people, is written specifically to those who have objections or are seeking answers for eternity, and guiding them to truth. Why have so many atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Catholics, prisoners, and soldiers become born again after reading One Heartbeat Away? As best-selling author Mark Cahill suggests, it's because once you know the truth about the Bible, creation vs. evolution, heaven and hell, sin, and the cross, there is only one logical decision to make. The truth does set you free! Get this book into the hands of family, friends, and strangers, and watch the Holy Spirit work wonders in their lives. It also appeals to Christians who want answers to the questions they get when witnessing. One Heartbeat Away promises to be as compelling as Mark Cahill's first book One Thing You Can't Do in Heaven. Both books have tremendous value in skillfully communicating the evidence for biblical truth and compelling the lost to come to Jesus Christ for salvation.",
