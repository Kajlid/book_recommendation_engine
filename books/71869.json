  "description": "In this heart pounding sequel to The Planner, Homeland Security is using the National Defense Authorization Act to incarcerate tens of thousands of Americans in secret government prisons where they are never heard from again. When Father Nathan O’Brien is arrested for refusing to preach the messages mandated by the Religious Unity Agency, Michael Linton and Jeff Conners call attention to abuses of government power by setting up “The Wall”, a website which publishes the names of all those who have vanished. Soon, the entire country is talking about the problems of indefinite detention, but before long, the Electronic Communications’ Agency dubs “The Wall” the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history and arrests Michael and Jeff as domestic terrorists. With Michael and Jeff gone, Michael’s wife Kris and her brother Keith know that the time has come for them to stand up for the Constitution and fight for the laws of our country.",
