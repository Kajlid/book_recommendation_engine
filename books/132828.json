  "description": "Bradley Parker has waited twenty years for Mr. Right, and on Valentine's Day, he finally finds him. It's love at first sight, and Brad even loses his virginity to the man of his dreams. But when he wakes up the next morning unable to remember anything-even what the man looked like-his best friend, Leslie, is convinced he imagined the whole thing. Brad knows he didn't make up the best night of his life, but he has no idea of the danger he's putting himself in as he struggles to recall the details of his perfect man. His search may lead him to parts of New York City he never dreamed existed and a war being waged in the shadows.",
