  "title": "Long Daze at Long Binh: The humorous adventures of two Wisconsin draftees trained as combat medics and sent off to set up a field hospital in South Vietnam",
  "description": "This is a humorous memoir about the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of two draftees who, like roughly 2.5 million other Americans, were sent to the war zone not as combat troops but as support personnel. The authors met on the day they were inducted in 1965 and then proceeded to follow identical paths for the next two years. This included bunking side by side for a year in South Vietnam as Army medics with the 24th Evacuation Hospital. Their stories were at times hilarious, at times horrific and at other times heart-rending. But every day was an adventure for these two young men who never knew what might be lurking around the next bend in the circuitous road of life. \"Long Daze at Long Binh\" is a lighthearted but highly informative look at what life was like in a combat zone where there were no front lines and no clear distinctions between friend and foe.
