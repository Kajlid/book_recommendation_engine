Each chapter includes a \"what to know\" section that breaks down core sustainability knowledge, like: • Energy efficiency and renewables • How to instill anti-waste and anti-consumerist values • Better transportation options • Understanding how and where we get our food • Developing a lifelong love for environmental activism and volunteeringShea highlights \"what next?\" action steps; a fun, enriching do-it-together activity; recommended books for parent and child; and additional resources for those who want to learn and do more. Growing Sustainable Together concludes with a practical appendix that gives talking points for enrolling teachers, school systems, and fellow parents in eco-friendly activities.",
