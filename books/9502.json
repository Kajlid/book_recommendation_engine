  "description": "At the outset of World War 2, Will Leary is sent to California’s Central Valley to investigate an agricultural anomaly the government fears is Japanese eco-terrorism; the soil is turning blue. The government suspects Japanese sabotage, but Will discovers the unwitting culprit is Sarah, the town “witch” who has the uncanny ability to read the Earth’s needs. As the destruction spreads, and the food supply is threatened, it’s not long before the farming community and the government are after Sara. Will goes to the ends of the earth to save her, only to find the very Earth beneath their feet wants her dead.",
