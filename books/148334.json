  "description": "Please note that this is the SECOND book in the War of Contractia.  This story is mostly told from the perspective of Peter as he begins Year 2 at the (magic) Academy of Contractia. As the cast expands though, you will walk into the lives of some of his friends, both new and old. His goals are ambitious and he cannot achieve them alone but, both for his own sake and for the sake of his friends, failure is not an option. You will meet powerful and sometimes truly evil new enemies. Should he be more concerned about an old foe though?  Please note that this book is unsuitable for young children mostly due to violent content and occasional (non explicit) references to matters of a romantic nature. There are also very rare innocent but compromising situations.",
