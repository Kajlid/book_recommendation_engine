The simple answer for most of us would be — you don’t.With blistering chemistry and irresistible magnetic pull, the scene should have been set for a fairytale romance.Then why didn’t Tricia think so?The problem was, although, in his forties, James was still an eligible bachelor.Yay would have been most women’s response, a hot rich guy with no baggage.However, to Tricia, although she was desperately attracted to him, his bachelor status made him out of bounds.She knew instinctively the heated way he had looked at her wasn’t just lust, it had said: a family home in the country, kids, and probably a dog… at the very least.Had he been a divorcee with kids, she knew she would have considered giving up her own lifestyle in a heartbeat.Who would have thought being a single man would have been a playgirl like Tricia’s hard limit?",
