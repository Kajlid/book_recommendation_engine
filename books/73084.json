  "description": "The first book in a sexy and sophisticated series of erotica, with a new twist: this time, women control their fantasies and men will do anything to satisfy themCassie Robichaud is thirty-five and widowed. After a life filled with disappointments, her days are dull and gray: she waits tables at a rundown café in New Orleans, and every night she heads home to a one-bedroom apartment alone. But when she discovers a notebook left behind by a mysterious woman, Cassie's world will never be the same. The notebook's shocking and scandalous contents lead her to S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T, an underground society dedicated to helping women realize their wildest, darkest, and most intimate sexual fantasies. The S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T motto: No judgment. No limits. No shame. Cassie soon embarks on a tantalizing and unpredictable erotic journey, completing ten fantasy-steps toward sexual fulfillment--discovering acceptance, courage, surrender, and more--with gorgeous men in rapturous scenarios beyond her imagination. As she is set free from her inhibitions, the satisfaction and bliss she experiences bring her a new confidence that transforms her forever. Equal parts scintillating, liberating, and emotionally powerful, S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T is a world where fantasy becomes reality.",
