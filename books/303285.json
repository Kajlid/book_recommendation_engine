  "description": "Black Mountain Academy was my only choice. It was meant to be freedom. But with those watchful eyes, it’s anything but the fresh start I crave. When you’re good, nobody ever remembers. But when you’re bad, they can’t stop reminding you. I was labelled a rebel, a party girl, a nuisance, even a… never mind, you don’t need to know that. That all changed when he gave me a label. I submitted to the nickname. I am a Deviant. I revel in the dark, alongside him. Forbidden. Against the rules. A bad idea. We can’t stop ourselves from breaking the moral compass. But the stranger is watching me. Every move, every breath, and every dream. He’s there, waiting, biding his time. In the end, he will get me. When secrets are spilled… Who will be the deviant then?",
