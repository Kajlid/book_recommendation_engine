  "description": "When Bri gets caught coming home drunk after the death of her sister, her parents think some time away might be good for her. She’s forced to spend the entire summer before her senior year at Cabin Creek Falls—a camp full of spoiled, rich kids where she’ll surely be out of place.  Her plan is to make it through the summer minding her own business and staying out of trouble. But it doesn’t take long for Carter—Mr. Popular—to notice her or Quinn—the camp’s diva—to stir up drama. To top it all off, Bri encounters a lonely teen boy and a deranged woman who no one else can see. Has Bri gone insane in her grief, or are the boy and woman actually real?  Which is worse?",
