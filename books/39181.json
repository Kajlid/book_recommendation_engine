But when Skylar is attacked, Byron knows he cannot stay away from Skylar anymore. Skylar has always been searching for his soul mate, that special person he would share his life and innocence with. When he meets Byron, he instantly feels the bond between them. In Byron's power and forcefulness, he finds an anchor. But even as they attempt to build a life together, there are still many challenges ahead. When Skylar unexpectedly becomes pregnant, Byron will have to learn to deal with fatherhood and protect his new family from an unexpected threat. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
