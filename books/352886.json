  "title": "The Hunter",
  "description": "When the escape of a terrible beast and the sudden appearance of a mysterious foreigner coincide to disrupt the season's festivities, nothing is as expected in the land of Brkla. A hero's swordplay punctuates the use of power and magic in this story of infiltration, intrigue and romance that challenges assumptions. In a world where the gods are seemingly quiet, two ideologies collide within a culture that thrives on intensity, pushing power to the limit, while aggrandizing martial skills. Competitions abound in which the victor's reward is the setup for a life of privilege fraught with deception. Into this milieu Mrsem intrudes, his origin shrouded by misdirection. As an outsider he is considered less, yet his skill in combat matches that of generations of bred and trained warriors. His lack of adherence to the cultural restrictions of segregation of the sexes and the four-tiered caste system causes powerful forces to immediately move to destroy him and take what he has claimed - a sensual girl of the highest class whose capabilities were vastly underestimated by all. Visceral fights, convoluted conspiracies and primal sensuality intertwine to reveal the story of the split of a great nation into two polarized countries and the subsequent history that irrevocably binds them together through the eyes of an adventurer and the object of his desire.",
