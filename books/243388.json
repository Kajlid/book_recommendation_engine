  "description": "It started with a bet on playground. Three boys wagered who would marry Rebel Rhodes—three boys won my heart. My Entourage: Dominic, Silas, and Jude. For years, everyone thought I had it all. Everyone was wrong. Especially my boys, who were unaware of the reality I faced in the shadows. Slut shaming from parents and peers. Harassment from other guys. It soon became clear I’d have to make an unbearable decision. Not because I didn’t love them all—but because I did.  After becoming America’s Next Pop Icon, I left the small Colorado town in search of a life not tainted with memories of becoming an orphan at six or love between four people society would never accept. Hollywood offered me a fairytale - a life I’d always dreamed of. Until it became my life.  Seven years later, my fairytale is nothing but a nightmare warring with a pimping agent and fighting off a formidable producer. So I orchestrate an escape to Italy, and everything’s going as planned until my presence is demanded in Vail, forcing me to make yet another impossible choice. Keep secrets from my boys to free myself - and countless other victims - from our abusers in Hollywood, or go home and reunite with three men who still love me and want a second chance at happily ever after.  Freedom is just a flight away, but I can’t lose my Entourage twice. I only hope going home doesn’t become the second biggest mistake of my life.  UnVeiled is a Reverse Harem Second Chance Romance.",
