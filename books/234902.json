  "description": "The final book in the Readers' Choice Werecat series has Jacks on a desperate hunt through the Amazon, the South Pacific, and the Yucat√°n in an epic adventure to end a war between shifters and mankind. A fugitive from two murder investigations in New York City and a bizarre, big cat attack at a bank in Barbados, Jacks flees to South America to find the ringleader of a shifter terrorist organization deep in the Amazon. The world is on the brink of all-out war between shifters and humans, and Jacks needs to somehow broker a deal for peace.But a special U.S. intelligence agency emerges as a new, possibly even more dangerous enemy. Both the terrorists and the U.S. government will stop at nothing to get an arcane codex that could unleash an unstoppable threat to mankind or exterminate werecats everywhere. While Jacks dodges danger from both sides and decodes the ancient book, he's left with the impossible choice of how to use it. Also in the Werecat series: The Rearing (Book One), The Glaring (Book Two), and The Fugitive (Book Three).",
