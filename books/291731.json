  "description": "I'M KEEPING HER. The sweet psychology student with a troubled past. Her ex is stalking her, but I won't let him hurt her again. I'll finish him if he even tries. Because I love the way she submits. Her sweet soft yes, sirs. The way she gives herself over to me. I should let her go--she has her whole life ahead of her. But I can't. I'm buying her a collar and making her mine. Mine alone.",
