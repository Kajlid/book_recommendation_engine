Step back into their world with this collection of bonus scenes that all lead up to a much-anticipated event on New Year’s Eve. Finding Their Forevers should NOT be read unless you have also read at least On His Six, Second Sight, and Fighting For Valor. This is NOT an independent short story, but a set of bonus scenes that provide glimpses into the lives of your favorite heroes and heroines.",
