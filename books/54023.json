  "title": "Il Mondo: One Man's World",
  "description": "Amid a childhood steeped in tragedy, murder, and abuse clouded by the family’s alcoholism and inner demons, one boy, crowned with an innate gift imposed on him by the miracle of human creation, at the age of fourteen, separates himself from the family ignominies and to stave off poverty. He is determined to override and erase the memory of his abusers and his grandfather’s debacle and the tragedy that resulted from it--his self-confidence prevails. The combination of foreboding and bliss convey a diverse story: from a group of religious people who sexually abused him, to the center of the glamorous celebrity world, to Mother Nature that, in a spectacular display, demonstrated his future, and how he comes to meet the President of America, Pope John XXIII, the King of Thailand, and numerous Hollywood luminaries.",
