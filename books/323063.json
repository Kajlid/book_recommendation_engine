  "title": "Dinosaur In The Park",
  "description": "Author Jorge William Nayor’s memoir, told in third person, is an account of his numerous stays in California penitentiary's, including the infamous San Quentin. “Dinosaur in the Park: Adventure Behind the Walls and Inside the Criminal Mind” written in a fast-moving, salty, no-nonsense style, is not the “typical” prison story. The book follows “Billy’s” life from early childhood to his days “on the lam” in New Hampshire. The sum of his experience, while unfortunate, is in no way presented as negative or even apologetic. It is simply one man’s experience, albeit unconventional, in navigating life ups and downs told in a credible, likable way. Front and center, the book highlights Nayor’s sense of adventure and indomitable spirit.",
