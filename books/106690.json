She doesn't plan on meeting Colt McCord, an irresistible cowboy who threatens to bring disorder to Graysen's ordinarily ordered life. Dodging an overprotective family, an unwelcome suitor, and certain heartbreak, Graysen struggles to break free of her limitations and submit her heart to Colt’s love. But learning to let go isn't easy, even with a man like Colt. Colt McCord, White Pine Ranch’s head horse trainer, loves the busy, back-breaking work of a cattle ranch. But when he meets a beautiful and spirited woman from Iowa, she makes him forget everything he'd known before, and he risks everything to be with her. Colt is accustomed to breaking horses, but can he tame Graysen’s wild heart before it is too late?",
