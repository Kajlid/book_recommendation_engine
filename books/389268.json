  "description": "Pete McCarthy established one cardinal rule of travel in his bestselling debut, McCarthy's Bar: \"Never pass a bar with your name on it.\" In this equally wry and insightful follow-up,his characteristic good humor, curiosity, and thirst for adventure take him on a fantastic jaunt around the world in search of his Irish roots -- from Morocco, where he tracks down the unlikely chief of the McCarthy clan, to New York, and finally to remote Mc-Carthy, Alaska. The Road to McCarthy is a quixotic and anything-but-typical Irish odyssey that confirms Pete McCarthy's status as one of our funniest and most incisive writers.",
