This is a different story, this is my story. I am Nemesis, my name means revenge. I will have it for what they have done.****War drums of the stone city rang furiously like never before. For the first time since its inception and founding, Redthrone was at open war with an enemy they had long since learned to fear. They tried to destroy her; time and time again she rose from the ashes. Kicked out, thinking it was over. It is not. Banished princess arrived home, looking for what is her right: revenge for all life in Redthrone gave her, payback to all who stood in her way. Several names on her lips, all dead without even realizing it. Highborn or lowborn, everyone behind that door stands to make a decision about his or her destiny on this day; stand by her, or die under the blade. Forced to live among the sheep unworthy of attention. To pretend what she is not, to hide. I am Nemesis, this is my home. Nothing here can scare me. Iâ€™ve come for what is mine. I have found what you wanted to hide.****Dive into dark adventure fantasy series that will change how you look at both.Make sure to let me know what you think of it. Andrea Kriksic",
