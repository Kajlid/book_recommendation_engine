  "description": "By the bestselling author of Must Love Dogs, the story of two grown-up sisters who fight like cats and dogsbut call each other at least twice a dayCook returns with another sparkling romantic comedy that's reminiscent of Must Love Dogs in all the right ways, but very much its own animalabout a relationship-challenged single woman, her quirky-to-put-it-mildly extended family, and the summer the shark movie came to town.Life's a bit of a beach these days for Ginger Walsh, who's single at forty-one and living back home in the family FROG (Finished Room Over Garage). She's hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy artist boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too crazy about. Geri, her BlackBerry-obsessed sister, is also nearly over the deep end about her pending fiftieth birthday (and might just drag Ginger with her). Toss in a dumpster-picking father, a Kama Sutra T-shirt-wearing mother, a movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer, an on-again-off-again glassblower boyfriend, plus a couple of Red Hat realtors, and hilarity ensues. The perfect summer read, Life's a Beach is a warm, witty, and wise look at what it takes to move forward at any stage in life.",
