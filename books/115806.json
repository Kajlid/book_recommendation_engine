And the most exciting thing at the Corgiville Fair is the goat race! Caleb Corgi has spent months training his goat, Josephine, for the big event. But Edgar Tomcat's goat is fast, too, and Caleb knows that Edgar is not above indulging in some dirty tricks in order to win.The sights, smells, and all the fun and excitement of a typical small-town fair are captured with humor and affection in Tasha Tudor's text and marvelously detailed watercolor paintings.",
