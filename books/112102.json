  "description": "This final book in a series of three concludes our adventure together and marks the beginning of another. Revelations within it can be quite profound to those with an open mind and honest heart. Though a minimum amount of imagination may be required to comprehend the awareness of its most abstract and reflective pieces, one should not get discouraged, but be patient, as time often unfolds perception in mysterious ways. As we proceed, our immense obstacle of human organization upon this finite planet, is entreating those of good conscience to unite. My intention is to have that happen within a term of reality, as the closer we are to envisioning a future built upon the positivity of true tangible change, the sooner we can turn our problematic pointlessness into a meaningful direction. My hope is that from within the depth of our being, we can unearth the passion necessary to abound.",
