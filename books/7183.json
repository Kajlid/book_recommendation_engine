Though she was a comely woman, she was an outcast, a despised half-breed. Yet before her was a letter from a passionate but unseen lover--the legendary Joshua of Jerusalem, a righteous Jewish man of great wealth whom everyone spoke of with reverence and awe. She had never seen him, yet he wanted her as his bride and promised to love her unconditionally...forever. He asked her to love him preeminently--above all other relationships, above her own desires, and above her own life. Yet they wouldn't meet in person until their wedding day more than a year later. Could she make such a commitment? Christianna thought so...until a surprise encounter with the mysterious but handsome Kosmos, who lavishes her with the personal attention she longs for. Now her mind is filled with doubt. Why was Joshua taking so long to come? Had she been a fool to believe that such a great man would want her?",
