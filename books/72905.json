  "description": "Ishmael was raging after zombies killed his wife and child. He became a legendary member of the reviled Militia, fighting the undead horde that had begun to lurch out of California three years earlier. Laudanum helped blunt the pain of what he had seen and done, and from what he had yet to do. Finally, bone-weary and spent after completing that last horrible task, Ishmael wallows in the November of his soul. He flees the plaguey land to ship aboard the ill-fated Pequod, ruled by mad dismasted Captain Ahab.Fedallah, ancient Parsee mystic and zomby master, shares arcane knowledge with Ahab in the quest for the White Whale, including the secret of two rare zomby types, and a recipe for immortality. On deck, all is not as it seems to Ishmael, whose dark past continues to haunt him.On The Pequod with crazy Captain Ahab, Ishmael and his tattooed friend Queequeg are in even greater peril than they were ashore. The secrets Ishmael discovers in Ahab’s log change everything he knows about Ahab’s insanity, the source of the undead plague, and the life-cycle of zombies.Couldn’t get through the original? Want to re-experience the yarn? Melville’s enduring classic has been shamelessly edited to cut the boring bits and the addition of Ishmael’s tragic backstory and Ahab’s logbook add dark fathoms of depth to Melville’s epic.",
