  "description": "On a bleak and lonely heath in northern Scotland they recovered the body of the third agent sent out on this mission. He had died - been murdered - of bubonic plague. It was up to Matt Helm to take it from there. For somewhere among those desolate Scottish moors was a half-crazed scientific genius who could devastate entire populations with one hideous, raging plague. It was Helm's job to get him . . . with the help of a beautiful American operative who was supposed to be his wife, and a beautiful Russian operative who made it clear she was his deadly enemy.",
