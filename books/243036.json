  "title": "The Russian Girl",
  "description": "“Sex, booze, and Russian intrigue . . . A cool cocktail mixed with parts of Updike and De Vries, with a peel of le Carré.”— The New York Times Book Review Richard Vaisey is a respected scholar specializing in Russian studies when Anna Danilova arrives on campus. A visiting Russian poet with a mission more than literary, Anna challenges his integrity—and his marriage. Richard’s beautiful but unspeakably monstrous wife, Cordelia, seeks revenge on her adulterous husband, determined to ruin him by canceling his credit cards and reporting his car as stolen to the police. But Richard must face even further humiliating consequences, for the seductive Anna is also an irremediably bad poet.   The Russian Girl is vintage Kingsley entertaining, thought-provoking, and wittily wise. “A brilliant satire . . . Kingsley Amis can skewer the modern world like no other writer.”— Los Angeles Times Book Review “Genuinely entertaining, and corrosively funny . . . Amis’s work is the result of beautifully organized and polished craftsmanship.”— The New York Review of Books",
