  "title": "The Minimalist Entrepreneur: How Great Founders Do More with Less",
  "description": "“Pay attention.”—Jason FriedA revolutionary roadmap for building startups that go the distance Now more than ever, you don’t need a fancy office, Ivy League degree, or millions of dollars in venture capital to launch a business that matters for the communities you care most about. Software, the internet, and remote work have made it possible for entrepreneurs to start for free, make a customer of anyone, and grow a profitable, sustainable company from anywhere. Packed with hard-won, battle-tested lessons from Lavingia’s own journey of building Gumroad, a platform for creators to sell their work, The Minimalist Entrepreneur teaches founders how    •  start then learn  •  build a community, then solve a problem for them  •  charge for something even before you’ve built anything  •  avoid running out of money and, more importantly, energy  •  run a tight ship amid the rise of the gig economy and remote work  •  own a business without it owning you back. The Minimalist Entrepreneur is the manifesto for a new generation of founders who would rather build great companies than big ones. This is essential knowledge for every founder aspiring to build a business worth building.",
