  "description": "Not all men are bad…Strong, independent, and happy on her own, Hillary has grown from the naïve person she was four years ago, after a brutal rape turned her into a werewolf. The normal life she’s made for herself is only upset when the moon calls to her and she has an uncontrollable urge to turn furry and chase small creatures. And she doesn’t need a man for that…until she finally meets another werewolf, this one a gorgeous, sexy guy who is determined to change her mind about one furry man in particular—him.No, some men are very, very good…The minute Zach scents Hillary he knows she’s the mate he’s been searching for. Though both the wolf and the man are itching to claim her, first he has to convince her that he’s one of the good guys, and that there are certain benefits to being an alpha werewolf. And there’s no better way of making Hillary see that than giving her himself—body, mind and soul.",
