  "description": "Jack-o'-Spec: Tales of Halloween and Fantasy features the many faces of science fiction, fantasy, and horror Halloweens: steampunk Halloweens, post-apocalyptic Halloweens, alternate history Halloweens, outer space Halloweens, and noir Halloweens, not to mention new speculative takes on Halloween perennials, such as haunted houses, witches, ghosts, vampires, and, of course, jack-o'-lanterns. Twenty-six authors have contributed short stories, flash fiction, and poetry to the anthology, transporting us to the mysterious realm of the Pumpkin King, introducing the trick-or-treating Norse gods, or describing a lover's visit on a brief reprieve from Purgatory. Contributors include Paul L. Bates, Bruce Boston, James S. Dorr, Lyn C. A. Gardner, Jude-Marie Green, Samantha Henderson, Geoffrey A. Landis, Elissa Malcohn, Gregory L. Norris, Jason S. Ridler, Marge Simon, John F.D. Taff, Cliff Winnig, and 13 more. If there is a holiday ripe for exploration, speculation and new myths, it is Halloween. Come and celebrate this night of nights with us. -- From the Publisher\"Reading Jack-o'-Spec is like stepping into a Halloween party that's been going on for 2,000 years. There's something delightfully pagan about these stories and poems, something that captures Halloween's dark, autumn atmosphere. Whether it's a mad scientist invoking Halloween ghosts on Mars, boys trapped in not one but two haunted houses, or a rich evocation of poetic seasonal spirits, Jack-o'-Spec has something for all Halloween lovers.\" -- Lisa Morton, Author, The Halloween Encyclopedia",
