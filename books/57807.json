  "description": "\"A frightening wake-up call... if Fast Food Nation made you consider some serious lifestyle changes, The Hundred-Year Lie will inspire you to go ten steps farther.\" -- Boston HeraldCombining the impact of the classic bestseller Silent Spring with Fast Food Nation, The Hundred-Year Lie: How Food and Medicine Are Destroying Your Health presents a devastating exposé of how chemicals in everyday products are ruining our health.  Over the past one hundred years, we have been guinea pigs in a vast chemistry experiment that uses our bodies, our health, and our good will to test the proposition that modern science can improve upon nature.  In The Hundred-Year Lie, investigative journalist RandallFitzgerald shatters dozens of myths being perpetuated by the chemical, pharmaceutical and processed food industries.  Find out why you would never be FDA-approvedand why humans are becoming one of the most polluted species on the planet:  The average American now carries a body burden of 700 or more synthetic chemicals, including Teflon, plastics, and dozens of pesticides.  Musk fragrances used in detergents and air fresheners are not filtered out by our current water treatment facilities, ending up in our drinking water.  The artificial sweetener aspartame, an ingredient in 1,200 food products from diet drinks to chewing gum, has been linked to eighty-eight toxic symptoms.  Fitzgerald not only sheds light on the problems we face from the unprecedented chemical onslaught, he presents suggestions for what we can to do to turn the tide.",
