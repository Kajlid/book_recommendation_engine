  "description": "Focus on the Critical  In business, survival depends on meeting objectives. Most failures in organizations today are not the result of a lack of smarts, they are caused by a lack of execution -- things just don't get done. Defining a clear strategy and setting goals is one thing, sticking to strategy and meeting those goals is quite another. The 4 Disciplines of Execution teaches how to focus on your top priorities and get the critical things accomplished. Whether you are a member of a team, lead a team, or lead an entire organization, this workshop will equip you to deliver on your top priorities consistently.  What You'll Learn  Four universal business disciplines that deliver results again and again:  a. Focus on the Wildly Important b. Create a Compelling Scoreboard c. Translate Lofty Goals into Specific Actions d. Hold Each Other Accountable -- All of the Time  Each discipline includes a business principle, old thinking, new thinking, and a metaphor that further clarifies the learning. A bonus section, \"Implementing the Disciplines,\" supported by a special resource CD, gives critical information about activating the power of the 4 Disciplines in your organization.",
