  "description": "A midnight food run nearly gets 28-year-old Katherine O’Brian killed. She’s the only person to see the man who brutally murdered a local woman and the killer is hell-bent on making sure she doesn't talk.Enrolled at the local community college, she meets Scott Mitchell; literally, tall, dark, and handsome. Scott left a broken engagement behind when he moved to Reno and the last thing he needs is more drama. But when he and Katherine are paired for a project, that’s what he gets. It can be very distracting when someone is out to kill your lab partner. There’s definite chemistry, but with a growing friendship and Katherine’s life in danger, romance will have to wait. Together, they’ll try to figure out what the police haven’t been able to—the identity of the killer, before Katherine is his next victim.Scott and Katherine will face jealousy, misunderstandings, lust, and rivals, not to mention attempted murder—and all before their first real date.",
