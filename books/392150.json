  "description": "BEWITCHED, BOTHERED, AND BEWILDERED ... Even fierce Norse warriors have bad days. Holy Thor! 'Twas enough to drive a sane Viking mad, the things Tykir Thorksson was forced to do --- capturing a redheaded virago, putting up with the flock of sheep that followed her everywhere, chasing off her bumbling brothers. But what could a man expect from the sorceress who had put a kink in the King of Norway's most precious body part? If that wasn't bad enough, his own skald was putting Tykir's embarrassing escapades into sagas for all posterity to laugh about. And he was beginning to realize he wasn't at all immune to the enchantment of brash red hair and freckles. But he was not called Tykir the Great for nothing. Perhaps he could reverse the spell and hold her captive, not with his mighty sword, but with a Viking man's greatest a wink and a smile.",
