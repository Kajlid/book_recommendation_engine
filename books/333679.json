  "description": "He’s my ex boyfriend’s uncle. The man who dropped us off at prom.\n\nAnd I can’t stop thinking about him.\n\nThe plan was simple: I’d blow out of our small town in a blaze of glory, find a job in the city, and start my fabulous life. I was set.But three years since graduating high school, and I barely have ten bucks to my name. Life has well and truly kicked my ass, and somehow I wash back up in the town I couldn’t wait to leave.I guess it’s familiar, even though my parents are long gone. I guess he’s familiar too. Is that why I can’t keep away from Everett Bray?It’s wrong to want him like I do. Wrong to lay awake at night, longing for him.But sometimes when I catch him staring, I think…Maybe he wants me too.\nTake Me Home is a steamy forbidden instalove novella, starring a plucky, down-on-her-luck girl and her off-limits crush.",
