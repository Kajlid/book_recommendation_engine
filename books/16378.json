  "title": "1939 - The War That Had Many Fathers: The Long Run-Up to the Second World War",
  "description": "The author’s research leads to some surprising conclusions. Documents from foreign ministries, and notes and memoranda from British, French, Italian and American leaders, ministers, diplomats and military commanders, prove that quite a number of countries were involved in instigating World War II. Interconnections, hitherto overlooked, are made clear. “This war”, writes Schultze-Rhonhof, “had many fathers.” Much in our German history from 1919 to 1939 cannot be understood without cognizance of contemporary events in other actions and reactions are closely linked together. Yet it was not only contemporary events in neighboring nations which contributed to the start of the war, it was also, and not insignificantly, the joint prehistory of the disputing parties. Almost every history has a prehistory.",
