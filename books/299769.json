  "description": "Having grown up as the daughter of Madame Lucille, “Fortune Teller to the Stars,” traveling from town to town, wondering which of the many men her mother brought home would become her next stepfather, Maz Lombard just wants a nice, quiet life. But Maz’s soon-to-be-ex-husband, Lenny, recently left for Santa Fe after his very public affair with a fetching young day-care teacher imploded, and her daughter Hope is convinced she’s inherited the family “seeing” gene and is scaring her classmates with séances and dark prophecies. When Lenny shows up wanting another chance, and Madame Lucille pulls into town with her newest husband, any hope Maz has for a simple, ordinary life goes out the window. But seeing her family in all its complicated, infuriating, and mystifying splendor might be just the thing to help Maz define herself on her own terms and live the life she’s always wanted. And what’s so crazy about that?Includes a new essay by the author and a preview chapter of her terrific new novel, A Piece of Normal",
