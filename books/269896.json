  "description": "\"Because He's Perfect\" is a charity anthology with all proceeds being donated to the Movember Foundation.Twenty-one authors, ranging from first time writers to long-term storytellers, seek to dispel the myths from the romance world, about what a perfect hero should be. Emotional or physical disabilities and illnesses are nothing to be ashamed of - in fact they can make a man. With the inclusion of a poignantly emotional foreword by NYT best-selling author, Carrie Ann Ryan, this anthology will take you on a journey through comedic laughs, sweet contemporary romance, and into the world of darkness and bizarre.Joining the authors on their quest are one graphic artist, two photographers, and two models donating their time and efforts to this project, which has inspired all involved.We hope you will enjoy what you read -- \"Because He's Perfect\"!Foreword:Carrie Ann RyanAuthors:Alice La RouxAlly VanceAnna BlakelyAnna EdwardsClaire MartaDani Ren√©Danielle DicksonElle BoonJo-Anne JosephKA SandsK.L.
