  "description": "Modern woman meets primitive man… Janet’s tribe travels to the base of a large mountain, where Chief Marro, who presides over more than a thousand people, lives. Phil doesn’t need to look through a camera to recognize an active volcano when he sees one. But the angry mountain is the least of their worries, because Janet captures the charismatic chief’s attention, despite the fact that her mate, Gundre, is a longtime friend. Having met Janet’s fiancé at the site in Cactus Hill, archaeologist Amy Sandhurst finds Brian compelling and is instantly attracted to the handsome stockbroker. He’s moving on with his life, leaving New York for Colorado, and Amy must decide what she wants… but the mystery surrounding Janet’s disappearance continues to grow. Janet feels torn—adoring her new family, yet the pull of Marro is far too strong to resist. Their chemistry is hot and explosive, but so is the mountain, which could kill them all. Marro has forbidden her to leave, wanting her for his own, but once the volcano erupts, the tribe must flee, the disaster separating lovers and ruining lives.",
