  "description": "How far can fate make you fall?  When Adelaide turned twenty, losing her parents and gaining custody of her fifteen year old sister was not part of her plan. If being a shifter in a world where her kind is hunted wasn't bad enough, she now has to protect her sister too. Adie has no choice but to move into the old house her parents left them, or risk being on the streets in a dangerous world. Only she didn't expect to be living next door to a strange, and very attractive, group of men who are far more than human. They offer her protection in exchange for keeping their reason for hiding with the humans a secret, and helping them. But protection comes at a cost and the cost is something none of them could have expected. A cost thatâ€™s been destined. A cost that fate has weaved for Adelaide. A cost that even princes cannot escape.  (Her Guardians series spin-off) Reverse Harem 17 +",
