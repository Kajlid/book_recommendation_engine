  "description": "The unthinkable happened five years ago. Now two writers have set out to find what's left of America. New York, Washington DC, San Antonio, & parts of the Central & Western states are gone. Famine, epidemics, border wars & radiation diseases have devastated the countryside in between. It was a 'limited' nuclear war, just a 36-minute exchange of missiles that abruptly ended when the superpowers' communication systems broke down. But Warday destroyed much of civilization. Whitley Strieber & James Kunetka, old friends, take a dangerous odyssey across the former USA, sometimes hopeful that a new, peaceful world can be built over the old, sometimes despairing over the immense losses & embittered people they meet. In an eerie blend of fact & imagination, Strieber (author of The Wolfen & The Hunger) & Kunetka (author of City of Fire: Los Alamos & The Atomic Age, 1943-1945 & Oppenheimer: The Years of Risk) cut thru the doublespeak of military bureaucracy & the rhetoric of the 1980's peace movement to portray America after Warday.",
