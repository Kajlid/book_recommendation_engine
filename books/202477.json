She?d never be his type of woman, so why torture herself? When sexual awareness strikes during a friendly football game, she?s stunned. He?s guilty for injuring her and looks after her, but Lauren resorts to wisecracking to distance herself from him. Seth?s confused by the new emotions swamping him. This is Lauren, his best friend, someone he has fun with, not someone he has fun with! He doesn?t plan to settle down, and he won?t risk their friendship when they have no future. They resist the new attraction, and the efforts of their families to push them together. When a wedding loosens their inhibitions, keeping the new aspect of their relationship a secret is harder than they would have thought.",
