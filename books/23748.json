  "description": "Kate Middleton’s royal wedding to Prince William on April 29, 2011 will be the fashion event of the century. And with the whole world watching, Kate’s royal wedding dress will redefine elegance and grace for the next generation of royalty—just as Princess Diana’s legendary wedding gown did a generation ago. When British designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel designed Diana’s dress, they helped her become the most beloved princess in the world. Like Ann Lowe’s wedding gown for Jacqueline Kennedy or Vera Wang’s many celebrity wedding dress designs, the gown that the Emanuels created for Princess Di changed the future of wedding fashion. Now, you can revisit the beauty and innovation that went into Diana’s wedding dress in this lavish, full-color book, written by the dressmakers themselves—the perfect way to make the magic of Princess Kate’s wedding story come to life.",
