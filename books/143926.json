  "description": "Laura becomes her own person after her twin dies. She learns from her mistakes and realizes she must work hard to get what she wants and what she deserves.BOOK The Spoon Tree, A Family Series ~ A Spoon for Laura ~!Abby was very young when she had Laura and Carrie. She raised them by herself, and as best she could. One thing Abby noticed from very early on was that the two girls, who shared a womb and were raised by the same mother, were very different.From the time they were born they established their uniqueness with their very own sense of fashion, their choice in books, hairstyle, friends, interests, boys, and even food.They became their own person by fighting their natural yin-yang existence. And even though their actions mostly seemed like an opposite reaction, the sisters both needed and loved each other very much.When Carrie died, the opposing force in Laura went away, and with it whatever balance Laura extracted from their push-me-pull-you relationship. Carrie’s death affected them all, but her presence was what always made Laura a half as well as a whole.A Spoon for Laura is the story of Laura after her identical twin sister dies. How she copes, how she finds balance, how she strives to become whole.It’s about stepping up where she wasn’t needed before, and it’s about learning how to meet half way.",
