  "description": "The humans were not allowed to know the true magic of this world. If they were to experience the world’s true magic, they may damage or even destroy it. It was therefore decided: the magic must remain hidden from the humans... forever.Eight-year-old Grace Darling lives in the small village of Witern Wood. She and her best friend Christian have had many adventures within the woods but have never once come across the ancient gate that lies concealed behind a large holly bush – the entrance into Liberty, a magical land, where everything is currently not as it should be. An evil force is lurking, depleting Liberty of all that is good. The malevolent Nomeds feed frequently and with each meal they become more formidable. The noble Zavier, leader – or ‘Berthold’ – of Maytime Meadow is tasked with the collection of the rest of the realm’s Berthold. These leaders must gather in front of the Great Prophet, who has foreseen a way in which the Nomeds may be defeated.Zavier selects some of his herd and the small and chirpy Chester to accompany him on a magical and treacherous journey across Liberty. The group face many challenges, a race against time and an increasing threat from the evil Nomeds. Will they make it in time… and what exactly has been prophesied?",
