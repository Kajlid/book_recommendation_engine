  "description": "Daniel and Tate.Just friends.100% straight.And competitive as hell.DANIELWhen I’m stuck in an unfamiliar city, attending maths lectures for my final high school exams, I resign myself to two days of boredom. That’s when I meet Tate. Something about his toffee-brown eyes and fearless attitude immediately draws me in and I quickly learn we have a lot in common:1) We’re both from the same rural town.2) We’re both staying at the same hotel.3) We’re both extremely competitive.I can’t say no to a competition, no matter whether it’s a swimming race or an intense match of truth or dare, no matter how much Tate makes my heart flutter. But as we spend the summer holidays together and our games get increasingly sexual, I’m forced to face the terrifying truth: I might like Tate more than a friend.TATESomehow our competitions somehow turn R-rated. Honestly, I’m impressed Daniel’s brave enough to keep going, even when it means kissing and touching each other and taking our clothes off. But there are a lot of things about Daniel that are impressive — he’s kind, thoughtful, and absolutely gorgeous.Not that I have feelings for him. I don’t. We’re just friends, and besides, I’m 100% straight. This thing we’re doing? It’s just a game. A game I intend to win.The Straight Game is a slow burn M/M New Adult Romance with the strangers-to-friends-to-lovers trope. It can be read as a standalone.",
