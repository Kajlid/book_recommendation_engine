But an embarrassing injury in the middle of the US Open sidelined my career, landing me in the hands of my new athletic trainer.Reggie is a big old jock with an easy smile, and my grumpy butt has never met anyone like him.We start hanging—at the gym and at his place, on the tennis court and out at the bar.I haven’t had a real friend in years, and Reggie’s big heart warms me deep inside. He finds something I’ve tried to keep buried, and when we end up sweaty in a hotel bed one night, my world turns upside down.Then comes the cabin weekend, and all the long massages at the gym…Reggie gets his big hands all over me, and I can’t stop thinking about him.It’s chill, though, because we’re a couple of straight guys, and this is just a bromance.A sweaty, grunty, sticky bromance.It can’t be more than that, not with my tennis career waiting—and no matter what my heart insists.Filthy Bromance is a friends-to-lovers romance with a grumpy tennis star, his big-hearted athletic trainer, and a mess of unexpected feelings. It features dirty talk and exploration on the way to a well-earned HEA. Book two of Love Unexpected, it can be enjoyed as a standalone or read along with the series.",
