  "description": "In the year 1912 cities around the world waged war against the fly in a desperate attempt to control disease. In England, twelve-year-old William Alton lost his mother to the white plague and his sister to summer complaint. When Will and his father emigrate to Canada for better opportunities, he also looks for answers. Why does everyone he know have to get sick and die? On Will's second day in his new school,Central Public, the health officer announces The Hamilton Spectator's fly killing competition. Will seems to have his answer and an opportunity to help his father with the downpayment on a home. At the same time he can teach the wealthy bully in his class a thing or two and perhaps impress other classmates including Rebecca and Ginny. The only trouble is he's useless at catching flies. Can he use his head instead of his hands, the way his father suggests? Or will he never get his revenge?",
