  "description": "Another movie star’s memoir saying how wonderful everyone has been? Not quite. Jimmy Carlton leaves a successful career with the BBC for an actor’s life in Hollywood where he becomes a household name and a rich man. But Jimmy has a past his fans know nothing about and Winging It shows us his life with total honesty. He is frank about the men and women he meets in the (male) producer who trades a movie contract for a night with Jimmy; the virginal goddess film star who insiders know to be a nymphomaniac; the all-action male who always gets the girl in the last reel but with whom Jimmy has a passionate gay relationship. Then Jimmy comes as near to death as it’s possible to do without ending up in a mortuary. If that really was the face of God he saw as life seemed to be ebbing away then everything has to change. But was it?",
