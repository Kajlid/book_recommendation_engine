  "description": "Her young man stepped out of nowhere onto a mountaintop...  Her high school counselor came from Hell. Literally...  Haley learns she has a unique gift. She normally lives her life escaping notice, but now two gorgeous strangers are interested in her. Very interested. Seth is the best-looking young man she (or anyone else) has ever met. Every girl in school is after him and the competition turns strangely vicious. She soon realizes that he is not fully bound to this world. Although they both feel the mutual attraction, thereâ€™s something holding him back... The second stranger is equally attractive, but more frightening. When she is with him, she somehow loses her self-control. To say more would give away too much, but Las Vegas will never be the same...  Blood of Gold is the first novel of the Seeker Series, stories of paranormal romance and suspense. The book is 90,000 words long, 380 pages in print form...",
