  "description": "Hell hath no fury like a feline enraged. Though Joe Grey and Dulcie are merely housecats, they each have a strong sense of justice -- to complement their uncanny ability to read, speak, and use the telephone. And they're furious that Max Harper, police chief of Molena Pointand preferred target for Joe's harmless pranks, has been accused of a gruesome double murder.The fleet-footed sleuthing duo is intent upon restoring an old friend's good name. But finding the missing little girl who was sole witness to the crime won't be easy -- especially with a hungry cougar on the prowl, a cat-killer on the loose ... and the kittenish antics of Joe and Dulcie's playful new \"ward\" causing big trouble that could take more than nine lives to survive.",
