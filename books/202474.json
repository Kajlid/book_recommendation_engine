  "description": "In his black-walled fortress at Inuyama, the murderous warlord, Iida Sadamu, surveys his famous nightingale floor. Constructed with exquisite skill, it sings at the tread of each human foot. No assassin can cross it unheard. Brought up in a remote mountain village among the Hidden, a reclusive and spiritual people, Takeo has learned only the ways of peace. Why, then, does he possess the deadly skills that make him so valuable to the sinister Tribe? These supernatural powers will lead him to his violent destiny within the walls of Inuyama - and to an impossible love for a girl who can never be his... Set amid the savage blood feuds of medieval Japan, 'Tales of the Otori' is an epic saga of revenge and treachery, honour and loyalty, magic and unconquerable love. This pack contains 5 paperbacks: Across the Nightingale Floor; Brilliance Of The Moon; Grass for his Pillow; Harsh Cry of the Heron; Heaven's Net Is Wide.",
