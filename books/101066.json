  "title": "Writing That Risks: New Work from Beyond the Mainstream",
  "description": "These twenty-nine authors break rules and bend genres. Inspired by literary risk-takers like Italo Calvino, Margaret Atwood, and Junot Diaz, they are award-winning and emerging writers from around the world. Ranging from surreal to experimental, fabulist to slipstream, these works marry imagination with meaning to create fiction, poetry, and nonfiction that is provocative and fresh. In these pages, you'll meet the mother of a shape-shifting kindergartener, a drug mule in communion with an ancient god, and a woman made to feel through her husband's skin. Open the book and join us on an adventure into the unexpected and wondrous.Contributors: aJbishop, Catie Jarvis, Christina Olson, Dan Sklar, David Ellis Dickerson, Edmund Zagorin, Erin Fitzgerald, Jenny Bitner, Joanne M.
