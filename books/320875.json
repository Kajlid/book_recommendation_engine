  "description": "Rule 1 for dating.Don't hook up with your coach's, trouble-making niece.Once upon a time, the Vlasta Vipers hockey team was so incredible — on and off the ice — they were almost mythical.All the other college athletes across the country wanted to be them.All the chicks who glided into their gazes were excited to bang them.Their reputation was that of Gods who wore skates instead of sandals.And thanks to a certain center's constant leadership on the ice, they are true champions once again.Captain Patrick Peck lives and breathes hockey, yet one glimpse at his head coach's loud-mouth, full of life niece who has just moved to Vlasta, and suddenly, he wants more.More days of watching old TV shows and less days of listening to hockey podcasts.More nights of hearing her scream his name and less nights of scheduling extra practices.More memories out of the rink and less memories of only being loved in it.Will this overly focused center be able to balance hockey and love, or will he be forced to abandon one for the other?",
