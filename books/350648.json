  "description": "Readers were beguiled by Rob Brezsny's new approach to the humble horoscope when his \"Free Will Astrology\" column first appeared. Instead of the generic, one-size-fits-all style of similar columns, Brezsny used witty parables, tender rants, cultural riffs, and love letters in his playfully positive readings. He brings that same sensibility—and the same message of a benevolent universe—to this self-help book for people who may be skeptical about self-help books.  Brezsny persuasively advises readers to go along with the universe's good intentions. But his rejection of cynicism isn't rooted in denial. On the contrary, he makes a case for a cagey optimism that requires a vigorous engagement with the dark forces. He asks us to rethink life as a sublime game created for our amusement and illumination.  The book is a chameleon of a tome. You can read it straight through or open it at random for tasty hits of inspiration. You can even start at the end and weave your way backward. This abundantly illustrated book also offers many playtime activities and exercises that invite you to participate through your own writing and drawing.  Originally published in 2005, and revised and expanded in 2009, the 2022 e-book edition includes a new foreword and a new piece, \"Strange Blessings.\"",
