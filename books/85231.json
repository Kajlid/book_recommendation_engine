  "description": "HALIFAX by Joan Mauch is the story of a middle-aged woman leading a life of quiet desperation. Living with her nagging mother in the shadow of her accomplished sister, she works at dead-end jobs to make ends meet. One day at the amusement park, a gunman breaks into the fun house where she works threatening to murder those inside. In a single moment of violence, she manages to kill the man and save the children. Rather than being repulsed by having taken a life, she feels empowered and now itches for the trigger of a gun whenever she's the subject of ridicule. Fearing she may be turning into a serial killer, she flees to Halifax where she becomes entangled with two people who have murderous pasts of their own.",
