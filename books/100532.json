  "title": "Under the Shadow of Hope",
  "description": "The hope is the narrator's hope for peace and freedom from all forms of oppression. The shadow is both that of dictatorial regimes and that of her past, a shadow that continues to haunt her life. This book paints a portrait of an idealist who had to contend with repression from her earliest school days and had to flee with her family while she was still a child. She had seen her father and later her best friend return as shadows of themselves. The crime they all had committed was being Kurds in Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime. Despite this, despite escape and assault, the narrator manages to maintain hope. This portrait may leave you with a heightened sense of reflection because it is authentic.",
