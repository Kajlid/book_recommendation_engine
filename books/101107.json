  "description": "A romp on the RivieraKate, a journalist in a small northern town, dreams of a glamorous life in the South of France. And they don't come much less glamorous than covering black pudding competitions for the Slackmucklethwaite Mercury and living with your parents in a semi called Wit's End. When a short, fat and ruthless tycoon takes over the paper, slashes budgets and sacks staff, things go from bad to worse. Except the tycoon's handsome son, Nat, incredibly, is interested in Kate. More amazingly still, he wants to help her with her Riviera dream. In love and heady with happiness, Kate jets off with Nat for the Cannes Film Festival and life in the Provencal sun. But Nat is not to be trusted. Nor is the postcard-perfect village of Ste Jeanne quite all it seems. Can a double-crossing interior designer, a grumpy countess, a handsome, headstrong artist and a gangster with a heart of gold show Kate the way to happiness again",
