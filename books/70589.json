  "description": "Boys who like boys who like girls.Twenty-five year old Jag Huntington loved straight men. He couldn’t help it. Something about their macho-allure intrigued him. But Jag had never even managed to have a straight man as a friend.His best friend Tyson Hopper, and Tyson’s boyfriend Howard Steinman invite Jag out for a night with the gay-boys and Howard’s sister, Virginia.When Virginia brings her straight boyfriend, Carson Phelps, Jag’s attraction to the thirty year old stud was instant. But there was not mutual attraction, not even curiosity.It wasn’t until Virginia insinuated that Jag and Carson should be friends, ‘close’ friends, that Jag began to wonder if he had a chance.Carson liked hanging with gay men. They were fun. His straight buddies didn’t get into dancing, music, or anything he really wanted to do. The idea of having a great gay friend appealed to Carson. Self-assured, Carson didn’t flinch at the racy conversation nor sexual overtones of his gay companions’ conversation. He liked it.There was something which intrigued both men into crossing the line of friendship into a physical relationship, but for Jag, it was devoid of any emotional attachment, which he craved from Carson.Would Jag and Carson’s friendship ever evolve into anything more than a couple of friends; one gay and one straight?Or was there really something extra special about a boy who loves boys, who loves girls?",
