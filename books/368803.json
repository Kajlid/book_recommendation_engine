  "description": "Back in 5 Minutes ~ an expression of depression Volume 1Back in 5 Minutes is a collection of poetry, lyrics, short stories, excerpts of scripts and artwork from established and emerging talent. The 'expression of depression' series of anthologies arose from a journal and pad of art therapy pictures recorded during a stint in rehab. The idea was to collate similar pieces from as many writers and artists as possible; the desire was to provide empathy and inspiration for anyone going through a similar experience of isolation and mental struggle.Back in 5 Minutes is the first volume in a series of six.Featuring work by Sadie Frost, Clint Catalyst, Alice Temple and Lucie Barat\"Back in Five Minutes is a searingly honest and inspiring testament to the fact that all art, by its very existence, is life-affirming. The impulse to create is often, in the words of Leonard Cohen, the crack that lets the light in.\" ~ Jillian Lauren, Author of 'Some My Life in a Harem' (Plume, April 2010",
