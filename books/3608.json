  "title": "The Object-Lesson",
  "description": "Inspired by Samuel Foote's poem, 'The Grand Panjandrum', The Object Lesson presents a stunning series of seemingly random and unrelated events. A missing artificial limb, ghostly spectres and the statue of Corrupted Endeavour all have a place in this enigmatic tale, which combines elements of French surrealism, Japanese haiku and lots of good fun. With its humorous obscurity and puzzling intrigues, The Object Lesson delights and provokes.",
