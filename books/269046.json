  "title": "Quizicat Questions Van Gogh",
  "description": "If you thought Van Gogh was simply a crazy chap who cut his ear off, think again. Through the questions of the ever curious Quizicat, we are guided through the artist’s whole life and discover that he was not only an extremely accomplished painter, but also a caring human being.The 15 colourful printer-friendly ‘Busy Quizi Action Pages’ at the back of the book help children to question their own experiences, developing independent learning, and research skills. This photocopiable material is a practical resource for classroom teachers in schools, for homeschoolers, and learners studying at home.Combining closely interwoven, full-colour images with the text, this book takes a much needed, fresh approach to finding out about art, art history and the great artists of the world. Its appeal stretches well beyond “art specialists” to a much wider audience. Demystifying art, as she does, Sheila’s work encourages you to have a go at making things yourself, in your own style.",
