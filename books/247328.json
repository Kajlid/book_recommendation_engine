  "description": "His new governess is everything he shouldn’t desire…  The Marquess of Chiltern knows he can never love again. After his wife’s death, he dedicated his heart to his daughter. Now little Annabelle needs a governess, and Miss Julia Mallory needs a respectable income. It all seems so easy…until her dark eyes set him alight with forbidden longing.  Julia has a secret which could ruin her chances of an ordinary life. If the Marquess discovers her true background, she’ll be out on the streets without a reference. She has lived under the shadow of illegitimacy since she was a child, and nothing will make her give up her chance to escape it.  If only the past could stay in the past. When history comes to haunt them, is their fledgling love strong enough to fight for the future they deserve?",
