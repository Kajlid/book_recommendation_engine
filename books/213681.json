  "description": "It’s Halloween at the Roanoke Academy for the Sorcerous Arts, and Rachel Griffin is stirring up the dead!As Halloween approaches, Rachel Griffin is starting to fit into life at Roanoke Academy for the Sorcerous Arts. She’s made friends with the world-famous Sigfried Smith and his dragon Lucky, and with the princess of Magical Australia. Though, at thirteen, Rachel is the youngest student, she actually has a boyfriend—an older boy, no less, the infamous Gaius Valiant.On her very first night at Roanoke Academy, Rachel discovered that mysterious forces were at work, forces that threatened everything she held dear. Before she could catch her breath, she was in the thick of a magical battle that threatened the lives of her fellow students.Despite her short stature and tender years, Rachel has already fought demons and fire-breathing dragons, and she has seen unseen things hidden from sight of others. But when the magical Elf who watches over her warns her of a terrible danger, Rachel is unable to convince either Roanoke Tutors or Agents of the Wisecraft that malevolent forces are gathering and a larger battle looms.Even the ghostly gaiety of the Dead Man’s Ball, on All Hallow’s Eve, can’t distract Rachel. The doom she has feared is more imminent than even her Elf could have imagined. And neither time, distance, nor her gifted magical family can save her from a dire fate in a distant land . . .",
