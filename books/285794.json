  "description": "Mantrum: An emotional outburst or an expression of anger by an adult man.  I’ve never understood the attraction women have for an alpha male, until I meet single father, Rex Winters.  Tall, chiseled, and persistent, he tries to avoid a parking ticket by asking me out to dinner. But I know men like him. He’s a repeat offender--habitually getting into trouble and always ready to sweet talk his way out of it.  But his charm won’t work on me.  Not when he’s the reason I’m forced to attend a six-week anger management class. And especially not when I find out all six feet two inches of Rex and his two hundred pounds of sexy muscle will be joining me every single time.  It doesn’t matter how much he flirts, or how attracted to him I am. I’m the girl who enforces rules for a living and he’s the guy who breaks them.  Do opposites really attract?  I guess we're about to find out.  *This is a romantic comedy standalone*",
