  "description": "There's never been a metropolis, slum, or building that Jaeger couldn't infiltrate, escape, and/or loot--until now! Multiple award-winning creator Carla Speed McNeil collaborates with color artists Jenn Manley Lee and Bill Mudron to create the very first full-color Finder graphic novel. First serialized in the pages of Dark Horse Presents, this Finder adventure now includes sixteen extra story pages and extensive annotations by McNeil. Finder: Third World also proves to be a massive, eye-opening turning point in the life of Jaeger, a major character in this mysterious, complex, sci-fi flavored world and the intriguing, wily heart of Finder itself!",
