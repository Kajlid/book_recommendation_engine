  "description": "Yes, this new release is by Maurice Sendak! Bumble-Ardy is, in fact, the first book illustrated and written by him since 1981's Outside Over There. Its piglet main character and his story had distinguished beginnings: Bumble-Ardy originally appeared in a Sesame Street animated short created by Sendak and his friend Jim Henson. Its robust pictures and rowdy rhymes are vintage Sendak: \"At nine past nine the piggy swine/ Broke down the door and guzzled brine/ And hogged sweet cakes and oinked loud grunts/ And pulled all kinds of dirty stunts.\" Simply masterful.Barnes & Noble has said: Since the publication of his classic Outside Over There in 1981, Maurice Sendakâ€™s book illustrations have focused on interpreting the texts of such authors as James Marshall, Tony Kushner, Wilhelm Grimm, Ruth Krauss, Herman Melville, and Mother Goose. And beginning in 1980, with his sets and costumes for The Magic Flute, Sendak launched a busy second career as the designer of stage productions of opera and ballet. Now comes Bumble-Ardy, the first book he has written as well as illustrated in thirty years.Bumble-Ardy has evolved from an animated segment for Sesame Street to a glorious picture book about a mischievous pig who reaches the age of nine without ever having a birthday party. But all that changes when Bumble-Ardy throws a party for himself and invites all his friends, leading to a wild masquerade that quickly gets out of hand.In this highly anticipated picture book, Sendak once again explores the exuberance of young children and the unshakable love between parent (in this case, an aunt) and child.",
