When the Ankou agrees to help her find the princess, and to train her in exchange for her help in breaking his curse, she accepts. But how can she kill an immortal? Especially one whom she is slowly growing to understandâ€”and maybe even to love?Together, they will solve mysteries, battle monsters, break curses, and race not only against time, but against fate itself.",
