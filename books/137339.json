  "title": "Dialogues Between Man and God: Encountering Christ and Buddha",
  "description": "The book constitutes the final part of \"Tathagata - A Divine Comedy for Our Time\" where Tathagata transcends the limitations of the ego-bound world and sees himself as the Christ-Man, who embodies in himself the mystery of existence of both Man and God. The dialogues between the Christ-man and God touch upon the return of God to human life and reveal the nature of the incomprehensible existence of the Divine Being through an allegorical language, which grazes between the realm of knowledge and reason and a world which lies beyond all knowing and understanding by the human mind.If one wonders about God, whose nature of existence cannot be explained in any language known to man, this book may help to gain a closer understanding of the way the Divine may appear and act in human life.In modern time science denounces the ideas of Divinity and considers the believers of God as people with brain dysfunction. This book is a product of such a \"dysfunctional brain\" to whom God has spoken. These dialogues between man and God will throw new lights on the existence of Christ and Buddha, who do not exist in the physical plane but manifest through human mind, and appear in the inner realm as the presence of the Divine power which animates all creations in the universe.",
