  "description": "I was born to rebel.Against love. Against authority. Against myself.Perfect precision, that's how Emmy Paquette planned her life. Dancing is her whole world, the one her grandmother wants for her, the world her mother had wanted, too.Until her heart pulls her in a different direction. Writing for the school paper excites Emmy in a way dance never has. Uncovering the truth trumps pirouettes and countless hours in the studio and being true to herself is more important than keeping dangerous secrets hidden. When her ex-boyfriend threatens her, Emmy knows she's on the right track to unmask the facts that could ruin his reputation...and ruin the careers of some administrators.Then she meets the guy with the scars. Philip Quinn saves her from her ex. He may be the one person who can save her from herself. On the brink of exposing them all, the powers above her shut down her story. But Emmy is not one to back down. Emmy has to stand on her own two feet, fight for her values and for what she needs--for what she's earned--and learn that justice always comes with a cost.Loosely based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Rebel Hearts is a new adult coming of age romance with suspense, courage, and a strong woman who knows to follow her heart.Originally published as Rebel Princess and part of the Modern PrincessCollection.",
