  "title": "Freshman Pledge: The Magic of Love",
  "description": "Tommy Ford's terrible childhood dramatically changed after his grandmother taught him about life, love, and her wiccan ways. Heading off to college to start anew, Tommy hopes to find that one special person to share his life. Mark Young thinks he has it all: handsome good looks, athletic ability, family wealth, and a pre-planned future. Mark is senior quarterback and a member of the fraternity Kappa Lambda Pi. What else does he need? After Mark chooses Tommy as his little brother during the Kappa Lambda Pi pledge period, Tommy uses his positive attitude, charming personality, and just a little bit of his grandmother's magic to get Mark's attention. Is it magic or is it love that brings these two together? Is it real or temporary? Either way, the magic of love will turn both their worlds upside down!",
