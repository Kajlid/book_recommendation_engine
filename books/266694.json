  "title": "Humble Pie",
  "description": "For the first time Gordon talks frankly about his tough and emotional childhood, including his father's alcoholism and violence and the effect on his relationships with his mother and siblings. His rootless upbringing saw him moving from house to house followed by bailiffs and debtors as his father lurched from one failed job to another. He recounts his short-lived career as a footballer, how the whole family moved to Scotland when he was signed by Glasgow Rangers at the age of 15 and how he coped when, just two year later, injury dashed his hopes. Having dropped out of football Gordon looked around for another career and, much to his father's disgust, went into catering. Gordon explains how his career developed from there; his time in Paris where he got a job without knowing any French and made his mark, leading to his collection of Michelin-starred restaurants. Then there is the fame that has come with his draft. Gordon talks freely about how he copes with the impact of fame on himself and his family, his television career, the rapacious tabloids and his own drive for success.",
