  "description": "When Lady Hariawan insists that her small traveling band take in a wounded stranger rescued from slavers, Sairu knows no good can come from it. Commanded to tend the stranger’s wounds and bring him back from the brink of death, she finds her attentions uncomfortably divided.  The situation grows dire when Lady Hariawan travels into the Realm of Dreams, far beyond Sairu’s protective reach. How can she guard her mistress from the perils of that world which she herself cannot see or touch?  Discovering that the rescued slave is himself a Dream Walker, Sairu sees an opportunity to extend her protective circle around Lady Hariawan. But will Jovann prove a help or a hindrance as he falls ever more deeply under the spell of the beautiful temple lady?",
