  "description": "TO THE GLORY OF GOD! Hello PaPa, Oh Father, if only I could teach someone Your loving laughter, reach someone to tell of Your sacred heavenly realm. Oh, if they will only trust in You, Father! If only they will stay and bathe in the radiance of Your angels all around. Their hearts open up like blossoms of flowers reaching their thirsty petals to the rain and their grinning faces to the sun, which warms them. Love brings out the colors of joy, and the songs of angels intertwine with Your sweet breath. Finally Your children's eyes are lifted up to the Glory of You, Heavenly Father. To the Glory of God!",
