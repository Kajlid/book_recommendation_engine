  "description": "Mia was rapidly running out of time. Her boss wanted info on Gabe Roman-Kane, and he wanted it now. Her orders? Get in and take him down. No matter what. He was the one thing she never counted on, or planned…  She never expected to fall in love with him, or the lifestyle. He made her feel things she never felt before. Safe, protected…loved. For the first time in her life, she wasn’t looking over her shoulder and it felt amazing.  She wasn’t about to give up the life she never expected with Gabe, but as the clock ticks, her options are fewer and far between. Someone was going to be betrayed and either way, it was going to cost her something, maybe even her life.  Question was, was Gabe and their love worth it? Or would she betray the only man who ever truly loved her?",
