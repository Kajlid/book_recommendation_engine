  "description": "It was one night together.  I wasn’t supposed to see him again. I never thought I would.  And then, the six foot three cement graffiti wall of badass strides back into my life, and does it full force. Now he’s protecting me from his past and I’m protecting myself against the heated chaos he erupts in my body. It doesn’t help that he can do playful and sweet, when he’s not doing bossy.  But the overly confident, playboy Deaglan Kane is danger, has no boundaries, and is totally off limits.  And I know behind his walls there’s a man with a dark and damaged past. A man more dangerous. A man who may be the greatest threat of all.  The Irish Crown.",
