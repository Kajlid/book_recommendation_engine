Her ailing grandma needs a full-time caretaker, something she can’t afford.

Never in his life has he felt so content and comfortable than with her. Never did he think he was capable of feeling so much for somebody.Soon they’re falling hard into total bliss and blazing passion.

Or will being open about their love ruin everything?",
