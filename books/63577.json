  "title": "Captain Pike Looks After the Baby",
  "description": "Captain Pike discovers that looking after a baby isn`t quite as easy as he thought it would be in this crazy piratical mix of cutlasses and lullabies, treasure maps and nappies. Having a baby on board ship doesn`t go down well with the other pirates -- they`re tough buccaneers, not baby minders! But when Captain Whitebeard and his crew attack the ship, it turns out some pirates have a soft spot for babies...and at last Captain Pike learns how to cope with his offspring. With a story to really make children giggle and bright, colourful illustrations bursting with energy and comic detail from an exciting new artist, these pirates are hard to resist!",
