  "description": "Confronting Capitalism examines the world wide movement against globalization. The uprising against the World Trade Organization in 1999 was the most visible and dramatic protest in the United States since the Vietnam War. Subsequent protests in Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Prague, Cancun and many others, have shown that there is a growing movement opposing globalization. The book roots these events globally in an anti-capitalist history that includes the resistance to the IMF and the neo-liberal project in Venezuela, Korea and Chiapas, the mass organizing campaigns of the nuclear-freeze movement in the 1980s and the innovative direct action tactics of environmentalists in the United States.Confronting Capitalism is an updated and expanded edition of The Battle of Seattle, originally published in spring2002. The new edition offers updated articles, a new piece by Michael Hardt and reports and theory from the global South, including Nigeria and South Africa. The book features contributions from Naomi Klein, Stanley Aronowitz, Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, Eric Drooker, Barbara Epstein, Alexander Cockburn and many more. An important handbook for in the classroom or on the streets, Confronting Capitalism invites readers to join the intensive debates within the anti-globalization movement and to make some history of their own.",
