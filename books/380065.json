  "description": "If you were free, completely free with no ties or you could go anywhere, do anything - what would you choose? In 1971, Terry Tarnoff, fed up with a government he couldn't trust and wanting no part of a war he didn't believe in, packed a bag, picked up his guitar and sixteen harmonicas and headed out into the world. What followed was the ultimate drop-out adventure. For eight years Terry travelled the world. He saw it the blues clubs of Amsterdam and the jungles of Africa, he smoked chillums with the lepers of India, trance-danced at a death ceremony in Tibet, developed a heroin habit in Bangkok, nearly died driving through the poppy fields of Thailand with a kamikaze cab driver and found the girl of his dreams in wintry Stockholm. THE BONE MAN OF BENARES is about true love and spiritual-awakening. It's about turning on, tuning in and dropping out. In a world full of larger than life characters, and where the only limitation is your own imagination, Terry Tarnoff went in search of answers - and, amazingly, found some. Along the way he had the craziest road trip you'll ever encounter.",
