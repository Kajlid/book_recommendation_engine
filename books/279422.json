  "description": "Hutch is a newspaper columnist, single dad . . . and last defense against a lunatic's high-tech killing machine. Special Forces veteran-turned-billionaire Brendan Page has some dirty not-so-little secrets. He's built an empire on supplying futuristic weapons and highly trained soldiers to the world's most powerful armies. But he's saved his most destructive weapons for himself. John Hutchinson, a Denver newspaper columnist and avid bow-hunter, has figured out the truth about Brendan Page and is determined to bring him down. But he's up against a warmonger linked to assasinations, kidnappings, and terrorist activities. Hutch quickly uncovers a plan that seems unfathomable in its recklessness and loss of life. Yet he's just one man up against impossible odds--with no Plan B. Thankfully, it's just the kind of environment Hutch thrives best in . . . if he can survive the next three days. Deadlock will grab you from the riveting first page to its white-knuckle climax. \"With a blistering pace and irresistable characters, Deadlock is the best of high-octane suspense.\" - Gayle Lynds, New York Times best-selling author of The Last Spymaster",
