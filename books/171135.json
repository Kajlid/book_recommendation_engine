  "title": "Oh Heavenly Dog",
  "description": "It started out to be one of those days for Benjamin Browning, private investigator. He was summoned from his sickbed by a mysterious phone call, traumatized by a high-speed drive through London traffic with a race-car driver, attacked by a broken umbrella and dropped into the arms of what surely had to be the girl of his dreams. Then he came face-to-face with the most challenging case of his career...his own murder!Heaven not only waited for Mr. Browning but sent him back to Earth to solve the case in the body of a dog. It's rollicking entertainment, tickling suspense and surely one of the most unusual love stories ever.",
