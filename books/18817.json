  "title": "The Candle Star",
  "description": "After a tantrum, Emily Preston is shipped from her plantation home to her inn-keeping uncle in Detroit. There she meets Malachi, son of freed slaves, who challenges many ideas she grew up believing. But when Emily stumbles upon two runaways hidden in her uncle's barn, she finds that old ways die hard. And Mr. Burrows, the charming Southern slave catcher, is only yards away, lodged in the hotel.The Divided Decade Collection includes three stand alone stories that view the American Civil War through three different lenses. All are set within Michigan. The Candle Star features the Underground Railroad. Blood of Pioneers illustrates the trials faced on the rural homefront after the menfolk leave for war. And Beneath the Slashings is set within a Northern lumber camp filled with returning soldiers. The books can be read out of order or read alone, depending on the theme that most interests the reader (or most closely relates to a classroom curriculum). All three have been highly acclaimed by teachers and home schoolers. Each has lesson plans and additional resources available.",
