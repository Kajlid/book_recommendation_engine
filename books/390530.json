  "description": "'Knowing' screenwriter Ryne Douglas Pearson brings to life a novel of vengeance, revelation, and redemption. Three shots. Two killers. One secret that must be kept. Five years after his sister, Katie, was murdered, Chicago Police Chaplain Father Michael Jerome has moved on with his life. But he has never forgotten that terrible time. Has never stopped wondering who killed her. And why. When a dying criminal's confession points Michael toward answers to these questions, he embarks on a journey of discovery that takes him from the halls of Congress to death row at an Indiana prison, and ultimately leads him to Christine Wheeler. A friend from his sister's past, she expresses doubts about the circumstances of Katie's murder. Doubts that force Michael down a path where revelations shatter a lifetime of illusions held about those closest to him, and uncover a web of deceit crafted to keep a dark truth from ever being known. But every secret he uncovers, every lie he unravels, leads him to realize that someone is desperate for the past to stay buried.",
