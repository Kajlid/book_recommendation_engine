  "description": "A large fortune and a genius for unreality was the legacy Willy Trout left to his daughter when he took his own life. Monolithic Eva Trout - large and silent as stone - cherishes strangely spectral images of romance: a castle overlooking a lake; a pale, sleeping figure who she watches over; a phantom bridegroom.Eva's solid presence has become a fixture in the community at the heart of fruit-farming Worcestershire where she was placed by her indifferent guardian. Her impulsive move to an isolated mansion near Broadstairs causes startling disruption in the lives of Eric and Iseult Arble, between whom she provides the spark of friction vital to their relationship, and in the pious chaos of the Reverend Dancey's household where she is in affectionate conspiracy with twelve-year-old Henry.Her unexpected return from America eight years later in the company of an inscrutable small son again causes havoc among those who love her, while the final enactment of her life-long fantasy brings sudden, stunning tragedy.Few living writers can match the elegant entertainment of an Elizabeth Bowen novel. The formal grace of her style, her flair for mischievous social comedy and the flawless detail of her dialogues and landscapes make this novel an extraordinary pleasure to read and Eva Trout impossible to forget.",
