  "description": "A changed billionaire, a broken Hollywood starlet, and their path to healing together.\n Harley Stone knows what it means to go through trials. Life growing up wasn't easy and even though she's made it big in the movie industry, there are things from her past that just won't let her go.  Carter Bragg fell hard and was rejected hard. It wasn't the first time, but for some reason her rejection hurt the most. When Carter sees Harley a year later at a party hosted by a Hollywood director, he thinks maybe he'll get a second chance. Too bad she walks in on the arm of her newest co-star.  But things aren't always what they seem. And when a visit to a movie set ends with a flip of the script, Carter wonders if he can work the same kind of magic on his own story with Harley.
