  "description": "Amy is Adopted. Her real parents didn't want her so they gave her away to go live with strangers. Are you a good girl?! Thus begins Sarah Montague’s hilariously perverse You Can Be Anything! From A to Z. Like a fiendish rebuttal to Oh, the Places You'll Go! penned by the gene-spliced spawn of Charles Addams and Edward Gorey, this alphabetical anthology reveals the dark side of adulthood in twenty-six pitch-perfect, deadpan scenarios. It’s the perfect book for the genuinely jaded.",
