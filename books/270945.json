  "title": "Revenge",
  "description": "My name is Shadow. Assassin, taker of lives I’m what fears are based on, the one who exists in the shadows, only seen when you look death in the eye, and beg for its forgiveness. I am the nightmare whose name you whisper in the dark of night. Your jailer, judge, and executioner all rolled in one. In my world, my brother and I are ghosts, and we don’t give out second chances. I thought I knew everything about the world I was born into, but I was wrong. It took one failed mission to turn my whole world upside down, and I discovered everything I thought I knew was all a lie. Revenge is still my mission, but now the targets have changed.     Warning: 18+ This is a Dark RH and contains certain triggers",
