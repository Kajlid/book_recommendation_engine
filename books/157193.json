  "title": "Not Dead Yet: An Anthology of Survivor Poetry",
  "description": "This collection of poetry and art contains stories of courage and triumph over the things in life that try to kill us but only make us stronger. Whether we are victims of violence, tortured by our own demons, suffering from illness, or otherwise beautifully broken, we rise from the flames to proclaim that there is no shame in living with scars, only in giving up the precious gift of life... and we are Not Dead Yet. Featuring poetry by award winning international poets and emerging writers, as well as stunning full-page artwork from talented visual artists from all over the country, this full-color anthology contains more than 100 stories of pain, love gone wrong, family crisis, trauma and hope that will inspire you to never give up.",
