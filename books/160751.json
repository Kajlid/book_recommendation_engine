  "title": "Simon Ships Out A heroic cat at sea. Based on a true story",
  "description": "When Simon, a mischievous young cat, is smuggled on board HMS Amethyst, his simple life amidst the streets of Hong Kong is transformed into an adventure fit for heroes. But alongside new friend Peggy, the ship’s dog, he discovers a mortal enemy in king rat Mao Tse Tung. Under heavy fire from the Chinese Communists, the ship runs aground, stranded for 101 agonising days. Despite severe injuries, Simon and the crew bravely battle their respective foes, enabling Amethyst to make an epic escape. Heralded worldwide as heroes, they sail into Plymouth to a jubilant welcome, but further heart-rending tragedy. Bringing joy and compassion to those on board, Simon is the only cat to have been awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal, the highest honour for animal gallantry in wartime. Based on the true events of Amethyst’s ‘Yangtze Incident’, Simon's quirky yet emotional cat’s eye narrative is sure to move and entertain all who read it.",
