  "description": "Daniel was an Untouchable destined to be trained as a companion to a high-ranking Cubus. A red-eyed Incubus screwed all that up at a dinner party, and Daniel is now a confused Changeling with a libido far exceeding anything he could ever have dreamed off. Seldon failed in keeping the Untouchable under his care safe, and he accidentally dosed the too young human. His worst fears came to pass when Daniel turned out to be a Changeling, and Seldon now has to face the Cubi justice for turning someone so young. Luckily, Seldon has a powerful friend at his sideâ€”one who also has an eye for the young beauty.",
