  "description": "When bodyguard Ryan Harris finds an intruder in his apartment, he’s shocked to realize it’s his former stepsister, Isabel Rodriguez. Naked. In his shower. Estranged from his father, he’s only met Isabel a few times, but he’s seen enough to be distracted and unnerved by how gorgeous she is wet and two feet away from him. And did he mention naked? But Isabel insists her name is Julia. It’s either a con or a case of amnesia. Either way, he can’t lay a hand on his stepsister… or can he? The rules have never stopped him before and they’re not about to now. Isabel doesn’t know how she got into her stepbrother Ryan’s apartment, or that they’re related. She only knows that she feels safe with him. Not to mention very sexy given the way he looks at her. Determined to be underneath that rock solid body, she can’t seem to keep her clothes on around him, even when he tries to resist. When Ryan gives in to the sexual tension between them, there will be no forgetting this steamy night of passion. No one knows why she’s lost her memory, but she can ignore the uncomfortable reality when she’s protected by Ryan and his hot-blooded strength. But when her memories come crashing back in, will the waves drown out stepbrother Ryan’s deepening feelings for her? For fans of hot alpha heroes, bestselling author Erin McCarthy introduces her new series, SOUTH BEACH BODYGUARDS. In a city synonymous with sexy, the hot men of Miami Security will always protect your back with very personal one-on-one attention…",
