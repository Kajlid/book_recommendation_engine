  "description": "Have you ever experienced your life as useless and painful? Do you get to a point that you just want to end it all? Do you believe that there are advantages and disadvantages in the lives of most human beings?It is indeed a pleasure for me to share with all of my readers the aspirations, impartations, failures, and experiences I have endured. There were the positive spiritual events that really shaped my life. It is important that you read each chapter intensely so you can be helped and blessed, especially the trigger points that changed my life. I was a little girl born out of wedlock to a mother who was a deaf-mute and who fell in love deserting me as her child. My life was as if I was living motherless not from death, but because my mother chose not to be a parent. I was living from house to house on the streets with nowhere to go. In my life, I was misused, abused, raped and stripped of all my dignity.My journey was painful, but God had a plan for me.",
