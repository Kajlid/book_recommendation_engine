  "description": "Brendon Sullivan is sick of everyone treating him like a chick just because of his pretty face. Tonight's the worst, Jake's older brother and friends tricking him into a game of 'Truth or Dare,' where they're determined to embarrass the hell out of him by making him suck Mitch's fingers. Bad enough, but after his best friend Jake Coy sees, he suddenly wants Brendon to play a different game, just the two of them.Jake doesn't seem to care that Brendon isn't a perv like him and has no interest in being his friend's pseudo-girlfriend just because he hasn't gotten laid in half a year. Which only makes things more awkward when Brendon finds his friend just so damn persuasive.Confused as to how he became so messed up so quick, Brendon returns to the Coysâ€™ house, Mitch and Dave there to help Jake convince his best friend into one more naughty game of 'Dare.' This somewhat dark slice of suburban youth contains explicit sexual m/m content between multiple partners, graphic language, first time experiences, one very pretty bottom and three hot, athletic young men, and very little plot. All sexually active characters are 18+.",
