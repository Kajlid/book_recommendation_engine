  "description": "First Harvard, and now the national expansion of East Park Exposed. Evan Cosette will have to choose one or the other.But not yet. E.P.E.’s new owner, A.J. Harrison, wants the fall launch issue shot in Boston. It will be Evan’s last go as Rylan Willow—sensual starlet of the underground magazine that made her famous.And she’ll have to shoot without Dallas.Finishing up his Master’s, Dallas needs to spend his semester in Costa Rica working on research. And that’s not the only thing separating him from Evan. With lingering thoughts about her relationship with Dallas being based on nothing more than lust and lies, Evan calls it quits with the gorgeous grad student from East Park University.The breakup doesn’t make the Boston shoot easier.Under A.J.’s reign, Britain’s artistic liberty is gone, and the issue becomes less of a clever erotic read and more of a Halloween-themed smutfest. Much like Evan’s modeling, Britain’s photos grow sloppy and uninspired.But a reminder of the pleasures of sex and art is around the corner for both girls. Someone is leaving a trail of seductive clues for Britain on the set of the cover shoot--a historic manor.And Dallas makes his return to steal Evan’s heart for good.With a familiar narrator from EXPOSURE and a fresh, new point-of-view character, this is the blazing-hot sequel you’ve been waiting for.",
