  "description": "Set in the ruthlessly competitive world of elite boarding schools, this debut psychological thriller reads like a cross between  Black Swan  and Donna Tartt's  The Secret History A rising star in the world of ballet, Nia Washington fought her way up from the streets and was nearing the pinnacle of her profession when an injury and a broken heart derailed her career. Taking a temporary job at an elite boarding school was supposed to give her time to nurse both body and soul. It was supposed to be a safe place to launch a triumphant comeback.  Shortly after she arrives at the beautiful lakeside campus, she discovers the body of a murdered student, and her life takes a truly dark turn. It's not long before she is drawn into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with a ruthless killer. And Nia isn't the only target. She must use all of her street smarts to protect her dancers, save a wrongfully accused student, and rescue the man she loves. A stunning and suspenseful tale of passion and betrayal, Holahan takes readers deep into the mind of a murderer and the woman who must put an end to the killing.",
