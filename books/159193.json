She needs to find her own truth because, for far too long, Lexi Hart had been living someone else’s.Growing up within the whole Lone Riders lifestyle, she still finds it difficult, even after thirty-five years, to love the club she was born into; the club her grandfather had created.

Even more dangerous. With one man proving more dangerous than the others… and now she’s back in Paradise. Where that man is…Can he help her find the truth she so desperately seeks? Those answers she’s looking for? And when dark secrets from the past begin to be revealed, and dangerous games start being played, can the Lone Riders pull together to survive the storm that’s about to hit Paradise…?*Please be aware that Revolution contains strong language, adult content and sex scenes*",
