  "description": "Finding a teenage girl and her foster baby brother in the basement of my high rise office building wasn’t on the agenda. With her bright eyes and smart mouth, she made me uncomfortable, so I shipped her off to a boarding school immediately. I demanded regular updates to ensure my investment was sound, and in return received letters that ranged from cold to exasperating. When Lila was finished with high school, she wasn’t a student anymore, and she had me wanting to teach her a few things I had no business teaching her.Hendrix sees me as a child and not a woman, but if there’s one thing I learned from the foster system and then during my exile at boarding school, it’s that you can’t make anyone love you. What I also know is you can’t stop yourself from loving someone. Hendrix is the one I want, but he's too worried about doing right by me to see it. Even so, I can feel the heat in his eyes along with the love in his heart. I just have to convince him that needing each other is exactly what love is all about.",
