  "description": "While Eric Burdon may be best remembered for his unforgettable vocals on the Animals' platinum hit, \"House of the Rising Sun,\" this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member has never stopped having adventures. Burdon was ripped off by unscrupulous agents, accountants, and record labels, hounded by the police, and framed for a crime he didn't commit. Yet through it all, he never became bitter. He was the first rocker to play behind the Iron Curtain. He sang with Jimi Hendrix, chased Jim Morrison out of his house with a .44, and introduced John Lee Hooker to the toughest venue Hooker ever played. Eric Burdon explains how he became the \"Egg Man\" in the Beatles' \"I am the Walrus.\" With the enthusiasm and good humor of his live shows, Burdon recalls the tense reunion between John Lennon and Lennon's long-estranged father; racing motorcycles across the California desert with Steve McQueen; picketing the offices of MGM Records for nonpayment of royalties; performing in wartime Sarajevo with a symphony orchestra; getting run out of Meridian, Mississippi for promoting black music, and singing his heart out year after year. A complete discography and fifty photographs, many never before published, are included in this unforgettable memoir. \"Burdon has lived like a real rocker.\" -New York Times Book Review \"Riveting and informative.\"-Los Angeles Times \"These reminiscences will delight Burdon's fans . . . in general.\"-Library Journal",
