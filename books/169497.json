  "title": "Tower of Glass",
  "description": "The five interlocking stories in The Tower Of Glass create a singular, powerful account of a nation in turmoil - and a prophetic warning about an oppressive government's need to control not just the society but the mind. Through symbolism, wry humour, and outrageous sexual frankness, Ivan Angelo tells of businessmen and whores, poor working people and Death Squads, truth and illusion, and methods of political manipulation and terror. From the gritty, bawdy story of \"Bete the Streetwalker\" to the Kafkaesque portrait of a prison made of glass, the fictional pieces demonstrate Angelo's masterful wordplay, and his ability to take formal and structural risks without a false step.",
