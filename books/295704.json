  "description": "Some say death comes in threes.  For the Amish community of Alabaster, it seems to. They’ve maintained an uneasy alliance with the vamperkinder, the altered humans that rescued them from the zombies seven years ago. But after several vicious attacks—nighttime slaughters that could only have been perpetrated by the kinder—the union of the two peoples is shattered.  Meanwhile, a resurgent zombie horde and mysterious nightly howls signal doom, not only for the Amish, but for the entire galaxy.  As more and more planets fall, the Raven survivors hunt for a solution.  Can they restore the peace? Escape the horde? Save the galaxy?  Or is it already too late?",
