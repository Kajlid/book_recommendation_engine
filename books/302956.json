  "description": "Things heat up (and take an unexpected turn) when a self-proclaimed romantic requests the help of a broody small-town mechanic. Grayson Blake is a jackass. There’s no other way to put it.He comes into Fireside every day and orders a beer. It’s nearly impossible to get him to have a conversation while he drinks it. Smiles—or anything remotely close to it—are even more rare. Despite his cantankerous personality, he’s so freaking gorgeous. His thick black hair, broad shoulders, and the tattoos that mark his calloused skin draw me in like a magnet. I don’t even care that he’s ten years older than me. I’m here for the age gap. And his broody, bad-boy persona is entirely more attractive than it should be. I have a thing for the rough-around-the-edges mechanic. And I’ve heard through the grapevine that he has a thing for me too. But getting him to admit it will be as easy as catching lightning in a bottle. Author's Note: This is a complete standalone novella. Cherry Falls is filled with returning characters and iconic destinations that will begin to feel like family. When you leave the city, and drive into Cherry Falls, it’s like you’ve finally come home.The cherry on top? Each book delivers a swoon-worthy romance!So welcome to Cherry Falls, we hope you stay awhile!",
