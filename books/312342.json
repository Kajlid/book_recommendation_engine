  "description": "It’s supposed to be an easy job. I’m hosting an open house for some new properties on the outskirts of the city. But while babysitting my sister’s dog, Tinkerbell – I stumble upon something.I ignore it. I don’t want to get involved. I’ve got enough to worry about working seven days a week as a realtor, trying to support my big sister, Jackie, and her art career. We lost our parents when I was young and she’s always been there for me. I’m twenty-one now. It’s time to pay her back.But then a tall, brooding, intense stranger comes to visit one evening. Kristian Cameno is seven feet of pure muscle, his hair moon-silver, his jaw powerful, and his eyes dark. He wears steel suits and expensive silver watches.He tells me he knows what I did. He knows I stole what’s his.I tell him I didn’t. I explain the misunderstanding, but Kris Cameno doesn’t quit. He tells me he doesn’t care about that anymore.He wants me—he’s claiming me. I’m his. I belong to him now.“Forever,” he whispers in my ear.With that whisper, my life is changed forever. I know I should fear this man, but he has me burning in ways I’ve only ever read about. Our lust is primal and animalistic, and when he claims me, I feel free and wild.There’s something else there, too, something warm, something fuzzy. There are moments when this beast of a man smiles at me and I see a future.But surely he’d laugh at me if I asked for more? What is he going to do when he discovers I’m a virgin? Was what I found his or was he doing something good trying to make sure it didn’t get into the wrong hands?It’s all such a mess, but I guess this is what I deserve for being a realtor for the mob.",
