  "description": "Rumfeld Dixon, CEO of Dyna-Tyme Genetics, is convinced that the United States is on a destructive course of action. With Federal policies fueled by corporate greed and corrupt political decisions, he sees no hope for economic recovery in the foreseeable future. Fortunately, Dyna-Tyme Genetics has developed a unique method to send a human back in time. Carleton Venable's familial ties to the Civil War make him the perfect candidate to travel to 1862 and make changes that will affect the outcome of the war and transform the American way of life. Even knowing he shouldn't get caught up in Rummy's scheme to change the outcome of past events, his father's gambling has put the family farm in jeopardy, leaving him no choice. Besides, his lifelong interest in time travel was just too enticing to pass up this once in a lifetime mission. Some intensive training and a simple injection is all it takes to send him back 150 years. Arriving safely, events begin to transpire as planned... for a while. It is only then that things start to go wrong... horribly wrong! Will he be able to save the American way of life he loves in the present... in the past?",
