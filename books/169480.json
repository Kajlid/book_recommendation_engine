  "description": "This is a stand-alone novel and does not need to be read in order. Josie Decker has spent her whole life as an unloved and unwanted bother. Like a wild horse captured and bridled, Josieâ€™s spirit is broken. She devises a plan to start her life anew; silently biding her time, she waits for the perfect moment. When that moment arises, Josie takes the opportunity and runs freely into an uncertain future in Torey Hope. Kyle Martin is a tattooed, pierced, bad boy with a heart of gold. Marching to the beat of his own drummer, Kyle meets his perfect match early on in life. Devastating circumstances beyond his control plunge Kyle into dark despair and suffocating blackness.

Kyle and Josie cling to each other as they battle guilt and crushed spirits. Through it all, with a lot of help from an unexpected accomplice, Kyle and Josie come to view each other in a new light. When the past catches up to them and causes their lives to come crashing down, will Kyle and Josie get the chance to see where their future is headed? Or will they be forced to admit they waited too long to embrace what was right in front of them the whole time?
