  "description": "“The darkest days are ahead of us,” Andrew whispered as the drape of shadows slipped away, allowing Blair to awaken. And in her heart of hearts she knew it was true. The unmistakable signs were all around her, growing within her. She was becoming something more than human. All she could do was accept the inevitable. “I’ve become a freak … an alien. I no longer belong to the human world,” Blair told her true love, and he held her close, determined never to give her up.“I’d stay in this darkness forever as long as I could be with you. Wherever you are … that’s my home.” Everett meant every word. In fact, he’d willingly give up his own life to protect the girl he’d always loved.But there was a storm brewing … a firestorm so strong and catastrophic that it could keep them apart forever.That storm roared into town wearing a brown leather bomber jacket and riding a motorcycle.Ash was like a secret in human clothing … a dangerous secret. Everything about him was mesmerizing – right down to the swirls of ink that flowed over the smooth muscles across his chest and around his arms. Being with him was like playing with fire.Blair knew all about playing with fire.She knew something else, too. A small quiet voice deep within whispered that she really would be separated from everyone and everything she’d known and loved.Because some secrets run too deep.",
