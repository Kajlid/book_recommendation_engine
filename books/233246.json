For her, however, this calling is blocked by her grandpatch and family patriarch, Allonzo, who tries to turn her chair into her curse. Despite him, she forges on, building her career as a writer and director, staying close to her dream. After Allonzo's passing, the stage pulls her once more, and she makes one more attempt to grasp her dream on the center-stage, auditioning for 'The Next Heartbeat'. Soon, however, she truly feels cursed, as accidents place her life inexplicably into greater danger. But her grandpatch can't really have anything to do with this, can he...? Just what in the world is going on?",
