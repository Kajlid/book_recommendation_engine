  "description": "“Phelps is a true-crime veteran.” — New York PostCherry Walker was a devoted, trusting, uncommonly innocent young woman who loved caring for a neighbor’s little boy. But when she was asked to testify in court against his abusive mother, Cherry never got the chance. She couldn’t lie if her life depended on it—and it did. Cherry’s body was found on the side of a Texas road, after being doused with lighter fluid and set aflame. Attractive, manipulative, and violent, mother of four Kim Cargill had a wealth of dirty secrets she’d do anything to keep hidden. This in-depth account by bestselling investigative journalist M. William Phelps takes you inside Cargill’s shocking trial—and into the mind of one of the most conniving female psychopaths in recent history—and on death row.“Anything by Phelps is an eye-opening experience.” — Suspense Magazine“Phelps dares to tread where few others into the mind of a killer.” — TV Rage“Phelps is the king of true crime.”  --Lynda Hirsch, Creators Syndicate columnist“One of our most engaging crime journalists.” —Dr. Katherine RamslandINCLUDES 16 PAGES OF DRAMATIC PHOTOS",
