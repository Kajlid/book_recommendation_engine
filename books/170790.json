When an attractive reporter arrives and starts asking questions, he'll need to do everything in the world to convince her not to.   She might have bitten off more than she could chew  At the center of Tamara's story is the hunk of an enforcer for the Roadside Angels: Alexander Cole--a man whose attractiveness and brooding nature she finds herself unable to tear away from, and a man who may or may not be entirely human.",
