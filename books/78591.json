  "title": "Peace Is the Way: Bringing War and Violence to an End",
  "description": "“There is no way to peace, peace is the way.”This statement has never been more true. Now, Deepak Chopra expands on A. J. Muste’s insight, teaching us how to expand awareness, stop reacting out of fear, and reject war—one person at a time. As Dr. Chopra says, “Violence may be innate in human nature, but so is its love. The next stage of humanity, the leap we are poised to take, will be guided by the force of that love.”",
