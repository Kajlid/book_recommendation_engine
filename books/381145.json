  "description": "Are you tired of having problems? Want them to stop? Wish you could transform yourself as a person with just two trips to the bathroom? With advice like this, Just Stop Having Problems, Stupid! brilliantly satirizes self-help books in the wise and weird voice of \"Dr. Matt\", the self-proclaimed \"most famous fake doctor of our time\".In what fans are calling \"the best self-help book ever\", Dr. Matt delivers the same witty personality that fans have come to know from his blog and podcast, and examines the nature of personal problems and the self-help books that attempt to solve them. Yet, somehow, Just Stop Having Problems, Stupid! manages to contain actual wisdom. It's hilarious and clever, both at the same time. As Dr. Matt says, one copy of the book may not be enough. After all, you may have more than one bathroom.Other books by Dr. Matt include, \"When It Comes To Relationships, You've Been An Idiot. \"",
