  "description": "I wasn't sure it was the Jack Daniels or it was Demon. When his tongue found it's way into my mouth I could feel a fire starting to burn between my thighs. The moment I saw Demon at Twisted, I knew he was down for a sultry good time. He stepped back and I couldn't help it but I started to cover myself. He smacked my hands away, the scars that nobody has ever seen suddenly felt like they were on fire under his gaze. \"What happened?\" It almost brought tears to my eyes. \"An abusive ex.\" I replied mournfully. Rebecca fights with her past demons and tries to hold on to her future. Her babies are her life. Jack is a forbidden obsession at first, but could be more if luck is on her side.
