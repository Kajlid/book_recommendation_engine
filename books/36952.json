  "description": "When Kyra decides to research the villain for her latest thriller by going to a BDSM club, she doesn’t expect to be shown the ropes by sexy Dom Andrew Ryan. He awakens in her yearnings she didn’t know she had, and leads her to question everything she thinks she knows about bondage and sex, pain and pleasure. And he cooks too!Drew never wanted a regular steady relationship. Catch and release, that’s the best way to be with subs, especially novice subs like Kyra, who have a tendency to get attached. Teach them and move on. But Kyra has so much to learn. Teaching her what her body wants is immensely satisfying, and so is having her in his bed and at his dinner table. Together they just might cook up the perfect recipe for submission.",
