The secluded city is ruled by “The Remnant” which strictly bars its citizen’s individuality and freedom of speech. Haleigh, the main character who is clairvoyant, is sent by her doctor to a school called the Winter Clinic where she is grouped with other non-conforming students to persuade each of them to submit to The Remnant’s requirements. Soon, Haleigh and her new found friends are on a fast and exhilarating journey discovering a new world outside the shroud. Throughout the book aspects of freedom, nature and art are celebrated as though seen or experienced for the first time.",
