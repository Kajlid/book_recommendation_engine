  "description": "It’s only been about ten days since the rogue pack came to Chicago. Ben had been hoping for a little more down time before the next wave of impossible problems. His personal life is becoming more complicated than ever, but that won’t stop a coven of witches and an ancient rogue vampire from throwing more fuel on the fire. Of course, all those problems may pale in comparison when another sorcerer comes to town. He’ll need to think fast if he’s going to survive a foe with a strength and power that far exceeds his own.",
