  "description": "Tarquin and Chase cook up a storm together on their YouTube show “Two Twinks Cooking.” Tarquin loves Chase, but Chase only wants to be best friends with Tarquin.Or does he? On the show, there’s a lot of innuendo, hilarity, and more than the love of food going on between the two boys. Off the show, Tarquin is concerned and confused. But the limits of their friendship are tested after their show is picked up by a large studio…and everyone assumes they are already a couple. Will they become boyfriends for real? Or is Tarquin doomed to have his love go unrequited? That will all be up to Chase, because Tarquin knows where he stands!",
