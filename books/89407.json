  "description": "Nothing says \"oops\" like your naked ass skidding in the salmon mousse. . .A year ago, pastry chef Serafina Wilde's seemingly perfect life fell to pieces. So now, when her eccentric Aunt Pauline calls from Santa Fe needing her help, Sera jumps at the chance to start over. Pauline even offers to let her take over the family business, \"Pauline's House of Passion,\" and turn it into a bakery. . . provided she agrees not to ditch the \"back room.\" Cupcakes and sex toys don't exactly mix but Sera is willing to try, and what she finds in the beautiful City Different is the best life has to offer -- if she has the courage to go for it.",
