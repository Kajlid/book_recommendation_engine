  "description": "\"Riveting…while evocative of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Picnic at Hanging Rock , Kohler's writing is so smoothly confident and erotic that she has produced a tale resonant with a chilling power all its own.\"— ElleIn Sheila Kohler's brilliant 1999 novel, a beautiful schoolgirl mysteriously disappears into the South African veld. Forty years later, thirteen members of the missing girl's swimming team gather at their old boarding school for a reunion, and look back to the long, dry weeks leading to Fiamma's disappearance. As teenage memories and emotions resurface, the women relive the horror of a long-buried secret. A stunning and singular tale of the passion and tribalism of adolescence, Cracks lays bare the violence that lurks in the heart of even the most innocent.",
