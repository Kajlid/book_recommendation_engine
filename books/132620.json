  "description": "Emma Dresden has it all. She’s spent her entire life surrounded by wealth and privilege on New York City’s Upper East Side. But she's suffocating. Determined to escape the eternal Gossip Girl episode that is her life, Emma enrolls in Newport University - the quaintest, most down-to-earth school she can find on the East Coast. Sharing a college dorm room with her best friend Jaq - a French fashionista with a heart of gold - Emma’s life couldn’t be sweeter. But Newport has a lot more to offer than frat parties and term papers as her perfectly ordinary world gets turned on its head. Emma soon finds herself in the middle of a century-old feud between vampires and Vikings, part of a twisted love triangle with an evil seductress, all while falling for an amazing guy no parent would ever approve of. No one said college was going to be easy.",
