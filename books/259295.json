  "description": "How can it be anything but good to remove bad people from the world? There are no innocents! But who decides who is good and who is bad? “The Buddhist and the Bomber” is a novel with everyday dilemmas at its heart. Why not just live an easy life, shutting ourselves off from the troubles of the world that are not of our making? If we choose to resist prejudice, hate, injustice and violence, is the only effective means through violence also? Or is a political or sociological solution viable? What happens to our loved ones if we choose to fight, knowing death is probable? When Michael is radicalised and joins a terror cell, the only thing standing between him and a suicide attack on a fascist rally is the deep love for his dog and for Mimi, the girl he has been chasing since adolescence. Are either of them capable of preventing a catastrophe? This sensitive and emotional novel comes over as cross between Garth Stein’s \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" and Mohsin Hamid’s \"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\". Set against a backdrop reminiscent of the current terror situation, it offers a powerful and compelling look at faith and religious belief in the modern world.",
