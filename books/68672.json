  "description": "Names! They fascinate writer Molly D. Campbell. Always curious about how a name might influence personality, Molly began a Twitter stream of names with one-sentence descriptions that soon took over her imagination. Loretta Squirrels, a moonshiner who also beats up her husband, gained notoriety on Twitter. Loretta was swiftly followed by eccentric dentists, dogs with human characteristics, cab drivers, Country and Western singers, and a movie star or two. Each story in Characters In Search of a Novel is a quick & often rib-tickling read—this book is just what you’d want on vacation, in a waiting room, or on a long plane ride.",
