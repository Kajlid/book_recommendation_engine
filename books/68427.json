  "description": "My life? It's complicated. Fourteen days ago, my mother died. The thought of never seeing her again was unbearable. The secret made it worse. Then came my accident, the coma, separating from my body, and most shocking of all, this extraordinary world between life and death. Just my luck, this is where I found love. In a realm I don't belong, where time isn't on my side. I could go back, but . . . how do you let go of the one dream that could fix your broken pieces? Go or stay. Live or die. Like I said, it's complicated.",
