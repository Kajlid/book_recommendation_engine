  "description": "Lauren Wood is used to coping on her own, while keeping a low profile on her farm in rugged Australian back country. Should the stalker she's hiding from track her down, she's prepared with a ready made panic room... of sorts. Unable to live openly, life is passing her by, Lauren is lonely... tired of running... afraid. After a fall from her horse while out riding, she's stranded and injured far from home. Unexpected help arrives in the form of Matthew Carmichael who is also out riding... Luckily for her. Handsome and considerate, she has no choice but to trust him. When Matt stumbled across Lauren, minus her horse and unable to walk, he's ethically and morally obliged to help her. Unable to care for herself, it's necessary for him to take her in under his roof. As their attraction to each other grows, can he push past his own emotional burden of the past?",
