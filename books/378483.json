  "description": "Henry and his dog Mudge go camping with Henry's parents in this seventeenth Ready-to-Read book of their adventures.It's time for a camping trip with Henry's parents! They'll go on hikes and smell good smells. They'll see deer and raccoons and waterfalls and rainbows. Henry's mother will cook camp food and Henry's father will sing sappy old songs, and they'll all lie on their backs and look at the stars (except for Mudgeâ€”he'll chew on a log, instead). And at the end of a perfect day, Henry and Mudge will snuggle in their tent and dream wonderful green dreams.",
