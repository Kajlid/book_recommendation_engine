She wants more for Simon than the ties that bind him to their dead-end town. He has one shot at a better life, and she’ll stand aside so he can take it.Nearly four years later Charlotte is still nowhere to be found, and it’s not as if Simon hasn’t been looking. How can he forget the girl who still haunts his dreams?When the Night is Over is the first book in Lily Foster's new Blackbird series.
