  "description": "When Hannah’s mom passed away from cancer, she was devastated. To make matters worse, she is forced to live with her perverted stepfather until she can find a place of her own. Night after night, he brings home young girls that resemble Hannah, totally freaking her out.  But there is only so much freakiness Hannah can stomach and she soon flees home to establish her independence.  Desperately needing cash to support herself, Hannah gets a job as a webcam model who gives live strip shows to horny men in exchange for money.  But things get hot and sticky when she encounters a client that has a very hot body. Rippling with muscles and a big meat stick, Hannah has never been turned on this much by a random stranger.  This would be one of her hottest shows for sure…except there is just one problem. The incredibly hot stranger turns out to be Hannah’s stepbrother Chase.  Now, Hannah cannot un-see the mental images of Chase’s sexy body.  And as it turns out, Chase can’t un-see hers either…",
