It’s smoke and mirrors; misfits and flames.It’s the place where tricksters come to play.They sent me away with a broken wrist and a broken heart.Now I’m back, with fire burning in my veins.I live for the pounding drum beats, for the savagery and applause.The circus calls to my soul; three men more than anyone else.The ringmaster, the acrobat, and the fire-eater.My boss, my ex’s brother, and the thief in the shadows.I don’t trust them for a second, but I’ll play their wicked games.Autumn Tricksters is the second book in the Year of the Harem series. It is a standalone reverse harem novel, and contains explicit language, high heat and m/m content.",
