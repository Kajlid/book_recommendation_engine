  "description": "Imogene Glass isn't a Fixer who makes waves - she leaves that part to her friends. They fight. She Dances the universe into harmony. Until she gets called onto the carpet for choosing the easy road instead of the right one. Her next assignment is an observation-only mission, one where she's supposed to keep her eyes open and her Talent off. Which only sounds mildly frustrating - until she gets there. Fortune's Dance is the fourth book of the Karmacorp series, a unique blend of science fiction and paranormal fantasy. The series starts with Destiny’s Song, and reading them in order is a very good idea. :) A note from  I tell stories of hope, resilience, belonging, and finding what (and who!) matters. I do that in a lot of different genres, but you’ll always get those things in an Audrey Faye book. :)",
