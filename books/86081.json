  "description": "I didn't mean to let everything get so bad.I never had control over the variables in my life, and that was okay. That's just the way it was. But the drugs were supposed to be my constant, my escape, my refuge. They weren't supposed to pull me under and hold me down, bring me to the brink of death and keep me in that in-between state. They weren't supposed to turn on me, just like everyone else.My name is Logan May Reynolds, and this is my story.*Contains mature content. Recommended for readers 17+.",
