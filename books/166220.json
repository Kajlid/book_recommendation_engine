He is the Raven, Hraban, and son of great lords. Yet, his fatherâ€™s return to their burning village does not only upset plans of Rome and the scheming Germani, but those of Hraban, who finds the ancient virtues of his kin are very strained with strange morals of Maroboodus, his father.Will Hraban find a way to survive the plots of his many enemies, serve his father and keep his honour while entire nations struggle to unite against Rome and those, who would betray the Germani?The Oath Breaker is the first book in a new series of historical novels set in the dark lands east of Rhenus and fabulous, ancient Rome.",
