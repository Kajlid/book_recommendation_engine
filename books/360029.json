His body is the last one archaeologist Neil Watson expects to find in the ruins of an old chantry chapel...Neil naturally turns to his old friend from student days, Detective Sergeant Wesley Peterson, for help. Ironically, both men are looking at an invading force - Wes, the WWII Yanks, and Neil, a group of shipwrecked Spaniards reputed to have met a sticky end at the hands of outraged locals as they limped from the wreckage of the great Armada.

Wes's case grows more perplexing, while Neil uncovers a tragic story from the distant past.
