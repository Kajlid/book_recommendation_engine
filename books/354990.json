  "description": "A freak snowstorm leaves a young woman stranded - and unconscious.Coming to, she has no recollection of who she is or how she got there. All she recalls are the warm arms of a stranger carrying her to safety ...She awakes in an idyllic country cottage, belonging to Vincent, a recently widowed city banker. Dashing and polite, the woman can't think of a better knight in shining armour. Vincent's 6-year-old daughter Jadie can hardly contain her excitement at their guest, chattering away excitedly. Trouble is, she's been mute for the past two years...As she struggles with flashbacks to her past, memories come back which aren't her own, bringing with them a stream of questions. What secrets does Vincent hide? Why has Jadie been silent for so long? Will she ever discover her true identity? Or is she, as Jadie believes, an angel come to save them all?",
