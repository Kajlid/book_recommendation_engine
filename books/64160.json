  "description": "“Attention, ‘Game of Thrones’ fans: The most enjoyably sensational aspects of medieval politics\n—\ndouble-crosses, ambushes, bizarre personal obsessions, lunacy and naked self-interest\n—\nare in abundant evidence in Nancy Goldstone's \nThe Maid and the Queen\n.” (Laura Miller, Salon.com)  Joan of Arc, the brave peasant girl who heard the voices of angels and helped restore her king to the throne of France, astonished her contemporaries and continues to fascinate us today. Until now, though, her relationship with Yolande of Aragon, the ambitious and beautiful queen of Sicily—mother-in-law to the dauphin—has been little known. In a stunning work filled with intrigue, madness, and mysticism, Nancy Goldstone solves the thrilling mystery by showing that if you pry open the Queen's secrets, you will find the Maid's. Caught in the complex dynastic battle of the Hundred Years War, Yolande of Aragon championed the dauphin's cause. As French hopes dimmed, a courageous young woman arrived from the farthest recesses of the kingdom. But how did she gain an audience with a king? Was it only God's hand that moved Joan of Arc—or was it also Yolande of Aragon's?",
