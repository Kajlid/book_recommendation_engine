  "title": "Hard Money: The Naked Truth Behind the Red Light",
  "description": "“Something for the Ladies, and something for the Gents. ‘Hard Money’ has a bit of both. It pulls back the covers and reveals all the naughty bits you always wanted to know about, but were too afraid to ask . . . .”\nHard Money\n takes you behind the scenes and closed doors at a Sydney brothel, where anything goes, and everything has a price. This anthology bridges the gap between literature and erotica. Soft enough for a woman, but hard enough for a man, the collection of stories that is Hard Money will entertain, amuse, and perhaps even arouse you. It is not suitable for children, but is definitely filled with “need to know” erotic information for mature readers. Hard Money was written by a woman, with a soft-edged, humorous writing style that appeals to both sexes. Pay your fee, step inside, and turn UP the lights . . . you will get your money’s worth.",
