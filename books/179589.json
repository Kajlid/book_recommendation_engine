  "description": "Do you believe in soul mates? Do you believe that somewhere there’s a person who makes you whole? If you ran into her at a coffee shop or on the street, would you know her? Would you have the courage to put yourself out there, to risk it all for love? Zane Winslow was sexually assaulted just days before her high school graduation—targeted because she was a lesbian. The horrific nature of that violation has left her unable to engage in intimate relationships. When Jaina Wakefield’s mother was incarcerated, she and her brother were placed in foster care. The years spent lingering in that system left her battling lifelong issues of abandonment. She trusts no one enough to risk being hurt again. Sex is fine, but relationships are out of the question. When circumstances result in Jaina embarking on a search for her bio-family, her path will cross with Zane’s. Both recognize the other as a soul mate, but will their love be strong enough to overcome a lifetime of baggage?",
