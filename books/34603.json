  "title": "Crutches For Ducks",
  "description": "Enter the slightly odd world of Phil Whiteland and slip back a few decades to a time when a John Bull Printing Outfit was the height of toy technology, when the telephone never stretched more than two feet from the front door, when every boy's knee was covered by a three inch square of brown sticking plaster and when a trolley-bus into town was a great adventure. This bumper collection of 'nostalgedy' stories (what happens when you mix nostalgia and comedy) coupled with some contemporary observations, guarantees a smile on every page and a chuckle in every chapter. Settle down for a step back in time and a giant leap forward in enjoyment, and if anyone asks you what you're doing, just tell them \"Leos for meddlersâ€¦\" (Complete with pictures - you have been warned!)\"Crutches for Ducks\" is the second book in the 'nostalgedy' collection which also includes \"Steady Past Your Granny's\" and \"A Kick at the Pantry Door\"",
