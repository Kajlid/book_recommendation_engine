It wasn’t long before the dead outnumbered the living a hundred to one.Shane and the rest of the survivors can’t live off the museum forever. The food is almost gone; madness is beginning to set in. It’s time to go outside, to search for some kind of life, to survive as best they can for as long as possible.The frost has thawed…This is the end of the line.",
