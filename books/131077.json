  "description": "Somebody opened my coffin that night in the middle of a cocktail party. I'd been all but dead these 15 years, turned into a household pet by a wife and kids.But now the girl whom I'd known by the code name Tina had walked back into my life -- and 15 years of settled, complacent living slipped away. I was back in that time when our world had been savage and alive, when I had been a lethal young animal trained to kill in cold blood -- and she had been my partner.And I knew that I was ready to follow her again to the depths of that private hell we had shared.",
