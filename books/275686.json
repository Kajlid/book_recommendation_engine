Permanently. We just need leverage ... irrefutable evidence of their corruption. And we need it now. Before the vote that will change everything.Only there are a few other issues to deal with first. Dante in prison for murder, blood coated roses showing up on my doorstep, and my bio-mom reaching all new levels of insanity.For the first time we might be completely out of our depth ... but we won’t give up.Not until the final battle is played out.
