My boyfriend and I are looking forward to our future together. I’m content—until I meet him. He’s dangerous, damaged, and I know it’s best to keep my distance, but damn I’m drawn to him. Art is a beautiful disaster, tearing my carefully laid plans apart, causing havoc. Little did I know my choice would set in motion the destruction of my perfect world. The consequences will be catastrophic once the dust settles.WARNING: This book is heartbreaking, dark, dirty, and is only for true dark romance lovers. Arthur is not the hero—he’s the anti-hero. While the setting of this story is in a high school environment, its recommended reading age is eighteen+ due to mature content, explicit sexual scenes, and graphic language. You may need to take a shower afterwards. Please take my warning seriously before reading this book. IT’S NOT FOR SENSITIVE READERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!This is the first book in a duet and cannot be read as a standalone.",
