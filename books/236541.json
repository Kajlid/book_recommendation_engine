  "description": "Vespasian Colville’s life is unraveling. Expelled from college, he spends his time writing passionate love letters to a disinterested widow. The only job he can get is freelance work for one of the local newspapers.Carine Bouchard’s pleased to be drafting what she’s certain will be a sensational first novel, while earning a modest salary as an advice columnist for the Daily Picayune. Until the editor makes Vespasian her new writing partner. . . . There’s nothing new about it. They’ve known each other since childhood. Carine believes he’s a slacker and rakehell. He finds her bookish and boring. She wants to cut him down at the knees. He wants to remove her thick eyeglasses. Sparks fly as they struggle to agree on responses for their column—especially after she enlists his help in adding intimate details to her novel. But when they receive a letter from a young woman being poisoned by her own family, their fledgling partnership faces the hardest test yet.*Received Honorable Mention in Romance in Library Journal's 2017 Indie Ebook Award.",
