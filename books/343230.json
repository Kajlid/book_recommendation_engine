  "description": "When an injury throws a young, battle-hungry orc off her chosen path, she may find that what we need isn't always what we seek. In Bookshops & Bonedust, a prequel to Legends & Lattes, author Travis Baldree takes us on a journey of high fantasy, first loves, and second-hand books.Viv's career with the notorious mercenary company Rackam's Ravens isn't going as planned.Wounded during the hunt for a powerful necromancer, she's packed off against her will to recuperate in the sleepy beach town of Murkâ€”so far from the action that she worries she'll never be able to return to it.What's a thwarted soldier of fortune to do?Spending her hours at a beleaguered bookshop in the company of its foul-mouthed proprietor is the last thing Viv would have predicted, but it may be both exactly what she needs and the seed of changes she couldn't possibly imagine.Still, adventure isn't all that far away. A suspicious traveler in gray, a gnome with a chip on her shoulder, a summer fling, and an improbable number of skeletons prove Murk to be more eventful than Viv could have ever expected.",
