  "description": "US Coast Guard veteran, Shawn Nilsen flees Seattle with a broken heart after learning her fiancé eloped with her best friend, financing their honeymoon and wedding by stealing the money in Shawn’s savings account. Upon arrival in Kodiak, Alaska, Shawn is hired by Cap Richards as a deckhand on the commercial fishing boat, The KayLeigh.Not expecting chauvinism, Shawn is taken aback when meeting Drake, Cap’s son and the deck boss. Drake is superstitious about women on fishing boats and takes an immediate dislike to Shawn. He tests her tenacity and spirit repeatedly, while accusing her of simply wanting an adventure to brag about when she returns to Washington.With long, cold days at sea, reminiscent of the television show, Deadliest Catch, the crew’s interactions repeatedly test Shawn’s mettle and resolve as their pasts are revealed. Will Shawn survive commercial crab fishing in the Bering Sea? Will she change Drake's mind about women on fishing boats? Will Alaska heal her broken heart?",
