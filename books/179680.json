  "title": "Wedding in Vegas",
  "description": "READER'S VIEWThis book had me gripped from the first page and had me swooning after both main characters. Thila was a strong, beautiful and educated woman - something that is often missing in many romance novels, in favour of the secretary-and-the-boss type relationship. The fact that Thila was interested in more than just romance and that she had her own career and goals was gripping to me and I could see myself liking her more and more as the story progressed. Arnav was a character I really liked reading about. As Thila is used to being the boss, I liked that Arnav took control of situations, but also knew when to back down. He was definitely a swoon-worthy main character and I would love to read more about both characters.There were a couple of parts within the story that were raunchy and steamy, so if you don't like those aspects then this book may not be for you.A dream-come-true-wedding in Vegas with a quickie living-in-the-real-world-divorce in Reno would solve Thila’s predicament and help her keep her wedding appointment in a week’s time. After all what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But what happens when the six foot two ‘incident’ follows you back home?",
