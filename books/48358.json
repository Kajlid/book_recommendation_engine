But when the cities go to war, all of Lexedore is thrown into turmoil.Only Tarkanyon the Outlander can restore peace. But his journey to the cities uncovers something more sinister behind the war, and that the Wealth, a magic thought to only belong to the long-gone race of Genicoins, is returning in the most unexpected of places.Meanwhile Gerald, a soon-to-be-lord of the kingdom of Dernium, discovers that he will play a major role in Tarkanyon's mission and, even, the future of Lexedore.This new updated and re-edited version of the original \"When Twins War\" is now available in two parts, BOOK I and BOOK II.",
