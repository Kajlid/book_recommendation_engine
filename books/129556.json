  "title": "A Garden of Thorns: My Memoir of Surviving World War II in France",
  "description": "A Garden of Thorns is Roger de Anfrasio's true story of survival during World War II. Roger was only nine years old when the German army invaded and occupied Dijon, France, his home town. He struggles to understand food rations, and fellow citizens who become traitors or resort to prostitution. At age 13, he becomes a junior agent performing reconnaisance missions for the French resistance. While vividly describing World War II, A Garden of Thorns is ultimately Roger's (and France's) story of survival, endurance, and recovery.",
