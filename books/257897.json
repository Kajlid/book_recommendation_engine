  "description": "Sexy, emotional, often funny, always messy, true love romance Yasmin has been in love with Tristan Goodman since the day she started her job in his family's magicks store in Hollywood. She knows love spells are bad news, but figures it will be okay-just this once. When Yasmin's spell mistakenly lands her in the middle of a gang war, Detective Luke Salzone can't believe what he saw. She should have been hit by one of those bullets, but she only seems to have a suspicious bruise in the center of her palm. Suddenly Yasmin finds it isn't Tristan walking her dreams at night, it's Luke . . . and maybe he has some magick of his own. Catch up with the Goodmans-a family of eighth generation witches living in L.A. Follow them from Hollywood Boulevard to the beach, from heartbreak to true love. Can be read as a standalone. This series has real emotion, hard won happy endings, and smoking hot romance.",
