  "description": "Abigail is starting a new middle school, a Catholic school, because she's been expelled from her old one. She's sure that this place will be just the same as the last, and no one will listen to her here either. Even her parents don't seem able to really hear the truth about what happened at the previous school. But now she finds herself in a community of people who do listen, who want to be her friends, and who help her discover a talent for theater that she never knew she had. Converting to Catholicism began merely as a way to annoy her parents, but quickly it becomes more. Could she be developing real faith? Kimberly Brubaker Bradley masterfully tells the tale of Abigail's spiritual journey and the faith that comes to those who need it.",
