Coraghessan Boyle 's development from \"a prodigy's audacity to something that packs even more of a mature artistry.\" They cover everything, from a terrifying encounter between a bunch of suburban adolescents and a murderous, drug-dealing biker, to a touching though doomed love affair between Eisenhower and Nina Khruschev.",
