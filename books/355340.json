  "description": "In this title, sports nutritionist Matt Fitzgerald offers the first comprehensive and science-based approach to weight management for runners, cyclists, triathletes, swimmers, rowers, and cross-country skiers. For endurance athletes, the power-to-weight ratio is critical. After all, an extra 10 pounds demands more than 6 per cent more energy at a given pace. \"Racing Weight\" explores weight management as a means to better performance. Losing those last few pounds can seem impossible, but \"Racing Weight\" will help you hit your fastest numbers. Endurance sports coach and certified sports nutritionist Matt Fitzgerald offers a safe and healthy 5-step plan to help you get leaner and lighter for competition. By improving the quality of your diet, managing your appetite, and timing important nutrients, you can perform better - and look and feel great. After finding your ideal off-season and racing weights, you will learn how to improve diet quality; balance your intake of carbohydrate, protein, and fat; time meals and snacks; manage appetite; and train for lean body composition. Fitzgerald grounds his approach with practical examples of good nutrition, featuring personal food journals from elite athletes competing in six different sports and a selection of 21 recipes from professional triathlete and dietician Pip Taylor. \"Racing Weight\" is an essential guide to help endurance athletes make the subtle but important changes they need to start their next race at their optimal weight.",
