  "description": "If you had a giraffe and he stretched another half … you would have a giraffe and a half. And if you glued a rose to the tip of his nose … And … if he put on a shoe and then stepped in some glue … And if he used a chair to comb his hair …\n\n\n And so it goes until … but that would be telling. Children will be kept in stitches until the very end, when the situation is resolved in the most riotous way possible. Shel Silverstein's incomparable line drawings add to the hilarity of his wildly funny rhymes.",
