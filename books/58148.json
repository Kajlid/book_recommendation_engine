  "title": "The Countess Angelique",
  "description": "When she landed on the virgin shores of America, Angelique was unaware of the rich abundance of pleasures-and perils-that lay ahead. Sacredly recovered from a joyous reunion with a long-lost husband, she became a pawn in the bloody struggle between virile settlers and hungry-eyed savages. The dazzling, elegant courtesan who has broken the heart of every nobleman in France was quickly transformed into the most daring and south-after pioneer woman in the wilderness.",
