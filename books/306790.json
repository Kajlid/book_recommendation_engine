  "description": "Helena Truit, Hel, had spent her entire life from the age of seven cleaning up after her parents. Because of her they spiralled into a world of drugs and gambling, which meant it fell to her to dig them out.Drowning in debt and thrown from their cluster, Hel gives up her promising future to slave away all day and night just to scrape together enough to make payments to loan shark Bram Woodroe, alpha of the Woodroe Cluster.If rumours are true, this dangerous man is one of the top names in sex-trafficking and when her parents sank too deep, they offer him the only thing they have. Her. Marrok Lovel was will-bound at fourteen to serve Woodroe. At Twenty-eight he is now the strongest and most ruthless of all his enforcers. For fourteen years he learnt to shut away the world outside, block out the horrors of what he was doing, that was until he was sent to collect payment for a debt long overdue. He’d collected women before. They always cried and begged, but not Hel. Instead, she awoke something in him that had been sleeping for a long time. The need to protect. Saving Hel from her fate would mean going against his alpha, bringing down his operation from the inside. It’s a death sentence, but maybe some things are just worth dying for. Trigger warning, contains a scene of sexual violence",
