  "description": "ChanceThere are certain rules of friendship that are pretty much written in 1. Don’t hit on your buddy’s girl2. Back your buddy up when he gets into a bar fight3. Bail your buddy out when he gets hauled in by the sheriff for ‘requisitioning’ a pair of goats. Helping your buddy’s kid brother lose his virginity? …yeah, that’s not on the list. It starts as a simple favor. Now that he’s home from college, my best friend’s brother Tucker needs a place to stay and I happen to have a spare room. Then it becomes a confession. Tucker tells me he’s a virgin. And he’s on a mission to swipe that V card once and for all. Ultimately, it turns into a challenge. While Tucker searches for the perfect guy to pop his cherry, I find myself growing more and more agitated with the situation. I know why, of course. He’s my best friend’s brother, a kid I’ve watched grow up; it’s perfectly normal for me to want to protect him from all the assholes and users targeting him via his way-too-many dating apps. It has nothing to do with the strange way my stomach seems to flip at the sight of his smile, or that the sound of his voice somehow makes me tingly all over. Or that I can’t seem to stop thinking about what it would be like to run my hands over his body. Nothing at all…Come visit Finchley, CA, where the sun’s always shining, the locals are always gossiping, and you won’t walk two steps without bumping into a member of the Goode family. If you’re lucky, you might find gold; or, even better…true love.",
