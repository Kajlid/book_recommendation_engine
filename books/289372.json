But the station is a three days' journey away, and it's unlikely their small group can endure that long out in the dark.Because the danger they're facing comes not only from the ravenous hollow ones... but from each other.This terrible new world has left scars, and the people left behind in it are nearly unrecognizable. As Clare fights to protect her ragtag family, she begins to realize a horrible not everyone can be saved. And sometimes the worst monsters wear a human smile.",
