  "description": "Growing tired of being chased by Vepar and her death squad, Violet and her friends embark on a plan to turn things around. The Demon Lord doesn’t know it, but the hunter might soon become the hunted.  Bob hasn’t given up on punishing Violet for her past humiliation of him. If he gets his hands on her, he’ll make her regret the day they first met when she’d chopped his fingers off. Staying out of his clutches is on the top of her list of things to avoid, yet it won’t be easy.  Violet’s next trip to hell will be fraught with danger. Not just for her, but for her best friend as well. Sam is perilously close to becoming human again, which means he is fragile and easily broken. She must hunt down the Demon Prince, find the object that he has in his possession and keep Sam safe from harm.",
