  "description": "The Brotherhood has a secret to keep and they will go to any lengths to do just that, especially now that the monsters have come out of hiding. Mac and Vesta Vadoma are kidnapped just as they find the key to uncovering the secret of the Brotherhood. Determined to find her parents, Caislyn Vadoma casts a spell to ask the universe for help. What she gets in return are a strange prophecy, an invitation to a rave, and Jaxon Delaney - an art sales consultant trying to get her life back together after an abusive ex-boyfriend nearly kills her. Thrown together in a whirlwind of events, Jaxon and Caislyn find out that the brotherhood isnâ€™t the only one keeping secrets. The twenty-somethings must deal with learning about their true heritage and a stalker vampire who has a bad habit of showing up when they are knee deep in crap with no way out. Figuring out if he is the one putting them in danger or if he is actually helping, becomes a distraction the girls can't afford. Before they can find Caislyn's parents, these two unlikely friends must learn to trust their instincts as they accept their true natures, learn how to control their new found powers, and what it means to be the center of a prophecy that has them fighting for their lives. Birthrights is the first book in the Awakening Trilogy.",
