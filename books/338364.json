  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Danny arrives at his favorite place to find a turn of events that will change his life forever. Unaware of what the future will bring, he follows the stronger compulsion, the curiosity of youth. The adventure begins when, at the instruction of the guardian, the Alfar leads the lad into his cave and the next dimension. He receives an unusual weapon. The purpose and the intent of the gift, he is unsure of. With the companionship of a colorful mountain man and a beautiful lady, he ventures into battle. He meets with the forces of fairies, elves, and a leprechaun. The youth finds the strength to confront the armies of Ahrim--agargantua, evil witches, Bhutas and humanoid lizard beings. The outcome rests on his ability to call upon the strength and power that lies within each of us and on that being that watches over all.",
