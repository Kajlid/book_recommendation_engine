She should have known it was an omen.Now, the positive chi of her ordered world is in tatters. The Principal has broken his leg and been replaced by a man she thought she would never see again, a man she felt an instant and electric attraction to. The parents are complaining and her colleagues are behaving oddly. IN fact, she's so far in lust with her new boss she can't even think and it's doing very odd things to her behaviour as well. Things she would rather not contemplate.Stalkers, saucy love affairs and a mild case of OCD.What's a girl to do?",
