  "description": "As your future doctor, Maureen Miller is getting the best twenty-first century medical education post-financial crisis America can buy. Her profession's in flux, her life's sometimes a mess, but if she doesn't know how to solve any of her problems, at least she can search for answers online: Do you get a good cell phone signal in the hospital? How do you help solve the financial crisis in American health care when you have a hard time finishing a premed problem set? Which kind of empathy training is the best if you want to learn how to make better eye contact as you enter electronic medical records? And what do you say to a patient, anyway, who looked you up on the Internet and wants to know why you run a hip-hop website on the side? An Amazon.com Kindle Single, \"A Taste of My Own Medicine\" gives readers a taste of what medicine's been like for Miller so far--a warm, warped take on our weird new era in health care.
