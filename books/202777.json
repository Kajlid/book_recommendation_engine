  "title": "The wave: an Egyptian aftermath",
  "description": "Set in Egypt, The Wave is an engrossing example of the 'weird' tale that Blackwood helped to pioneer. If your idea of the perfect horror story is more about small, spine-chilling details and big ideas, rather than a nonstop parade of grisly gore, you should explore the work of Algernon Blackwood. It is a story of a love triangle in ancient Egypt that had a tragic ending, resulting in two deaths. Now, it is England, and the protagonist is a young boy who dreams of a wave. He believes that one day that huge wave will crash down on his life destroying everything in its path. His entire life is driven by this dream, as he gets more information from it - the love triangle resurfaces, he is one of the players that has been reincarnated for a specific purpose. Will they play out their same roles, or achieve new ones?",
