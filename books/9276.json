The Catalyst of Confidence offers a theory of confidence rooted in self-understanding and human potential. From the Back Cover...What is genuine confidence? Is it sheer, raw belief in oneself--or something more? Where does it come from? Is confidence innate to personality, or is it within our ability to develop?Through twelve digestible and studiable lessons, explore the building-blocks of genuine and lasting confidence: the development of beliefs, the psychological effects of concentration, the importance of habits, how to respond to failure and overcome fears, how to identify deceptive choices, develop emotional intelligence, act despite doubts, and much more!Thought provoking and contemplative, with a strong focus on action and application, The Catalyst of Confidence offers a highly condensed, fast paced, and incredibly resonant, perspective on the potential we inherently possess as human beings. It is what every young person ought to know, and what every adult ought to be regularly reminded.",
