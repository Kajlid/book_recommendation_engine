  "description": "As a college student, Mia Browning shared a carefree weekend with drummer Ryan Blackstone. Soon after, Mia learned she was pregnant, a fact her politically-ambitious parents would not allow to stay true. A forced abortion left her broken and alone. Ten years later, Mia has found healing and embraced a new life in Christ. Mia arrives at church one Sunday, to find that the new worship minister is none other than the blue-eyed drummer of her past. Seeing Ryan again after all these years is complicated. Serving at the youth camp means they are often thrown together, creating an unexpected friendship. Growing closer seems inevitable, but will they both have the courage to let go of the past and move forward into something deeper? For those days when life feels complicated, here is a book that invites readers to remember the truest thing about all of us: that we are loved by God and saved by His grace. This book is a warm hug, a lighthearted laugh, and an invitation into joy!",
