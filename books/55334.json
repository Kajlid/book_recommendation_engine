  "title": "Disfortune",
  "description": "Disfortune is not in the mainstream of American poetic speech, nor is it easily placed into any of the well-known poetic speech-camps that have arisen on its margins. Terse, haunting lyrics expose the irreducible contradictions of living, wherein \"the talking-singing, the whole talking-/singing ball of yarn, begins to unravel.\" Deceptively casual in tone, these poems offer startling confrontations with \"the unoriginal/oblivion,\" with \"the contrived delicacy/of what is emptied and kept.\" Joe Wenderoth sees \"fortune\" as the mute history of events proceeding toward the ultimate security; his poems arise from \"disfortune,\" from the need \"Just to sing the song that's kept you/quiet/all this time.\" This book is a rare occurrence, marking not only a new intimacy with the world, but also a remembering of the determined motion of intimacy itself.",
