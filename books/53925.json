  "description": "A secret organisation exists without detection and operates right under our very noses. Its sole purpose is to save dogs from neglect. It is manned by a tunnel digging terrier who carries a diamond encrusted nail file. A large dog for which the complexities of door handles are a complete mystery and who, instead, opens everything with his head. As well as, a commando, khaki wearing Blue heeler who is armed with a hunting bone and a smell grenade. And thatâ€™s just to name a few! In this fun children's book, The Golden Treasure, our dedicated operatives are sent to find a secret treasure which has been stolen by the evil cat, Speed Bump Charlie. So secret is the Golden Treasure that the operatives are not even told what it is. They are simply told that it will find them at a cat show! But what about the new puppy recruits? Will their special skills and enthusiasm be a match for the wicked cunning of Speed Bump Charlie? Will Commander Rocky be buried alive? And will our team return the Golden Treasure safely to its rightful home?",
