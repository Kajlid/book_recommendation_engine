  "description": "Put a cup of tea in your hand, and what else can you do but sit down? This new book celebrates that most British of life’s the tea break. There is, however, another element to this ritual that is a biscuits. Finding the right biscuit for the right occasion is as much an art as it is a science, and it is a task that Nicey has selflessly worked on for most of his tea-drinking life. From dunking to the Digestive, the Iced Gem to the Garibaldi, everything you’ll ever need to know about British biscuits is in this book, and quite a lot more besides. So go on. Put the kettle on, take a weight off, and enjoy.",
