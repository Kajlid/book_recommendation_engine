  "description": "In Giulia Sagramola's first long-form graphic novel, we follow the story of two sisters, Rachel and Sylvia, as they come of age in a typical Italian town.The two find themselves faced with the tough choices of teenaged life, which mirror the fires in the surrounding hillsides of the town, as one decision or another leads to unsettled feelings and desires.  This wonderfully and meticulously illustrated tale takes all of the consternation and heartbreak we know too well from teenaged life, and puts it on display in a beautiful and subdued package. Summer Fires is presented here for the first time in English.",
