  "description": "The world knows Erasmus Cress as a British boxing champion and a single dad, but what they don’t know is that he’s also an O thief. Yep, that O. The OMG, don’t stop, please, don’t stop, O.\n\nThe infuriating beefcake rendered yoga instructor Libby Lamb an off-balance O-deprived mess with one arrogant glance, which turns out to be an occupational hazard when her job is to remain calm, cool, and collected.\n\nShe never expected to become the boxer’s nanny, but she’s got bills to pay and brothers to support. Not to mention, the beefcake’s ripped physique might be the key to reclaiming her O and restoring her inner peace.\n\n\nHere’s the deal. She’s out of options, and so is he.\n\n\nHe’s training for the fight of his life, and he needs someone to care for his son.\n\nHe says he doesn’t do relationships. But when their eyes meet, and the gloves come off, there’s no denying his yang is hot for her yin.\n\n\nThey clash at every turn, but Erasmus soon learns that the fight that matters the most might not be the one in the boxing ring. When it’s all on the line, the true battle will be the fight for Libby’s heart.\n\n\n\nThe Nanny Love Match Series Books:The Nanny and the NerdThe Nanny and the HotheadThe Nanny and the BeefcakeThe Nanny and the Heartthrob",
