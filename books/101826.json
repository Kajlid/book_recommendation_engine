  "description": "From the monuments of Italy, through literary New York and rural Maine, to the dusty ranches of Mexico, twenty-three-year-old Katherine Shea is propelled on a restless journey of discovery. But her free-spirited movements are shadowed by a string of unexplained murders, and as the victims pile up slightly too close by for comfort, Katherine finds relief and inspiration in the gory manifestations of cannibalism in literature, art, and history.Slowly she senses that at the centre of the mysterious deaths trailing her every move lies a bloody and unpalatable truth, and with mounting dread she closes in on the real reason for her own obsession with aberrant, savage behaviour…A modern gothic novel of shocking proportions, A Carnivore’s Inquiry  is an addictive, uncensored exploration of humanity’s disturbing appetites and its ruthless capacity for survival – no matter what the cost.",
