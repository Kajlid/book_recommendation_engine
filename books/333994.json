  "description": "First published forty years ago and still widely referenced, Edward Relph′s Place and Placelessness has taken its place as a classic of the phenomenological approach to the study of place and has influenced a generation of scholars.   For this reprint Professor Relph has written a new introduction setting his original work in its contemporary context. He shows how the concepts of place have been modified and yet continue to be of vital importance in interpreting a world which travel and commerce have made very different from that of 1976. In his sense of place has the potential to serve as a pragmatic foundation for addressing the profound local and global challenges, such as climate change and economic disparity, that are emerging in the present century.",
