  "description": "A guide to the nature and function of Hinduism. Hinduism is unique among the great religions in that it had no founder but grew gradually over a period of 5000 years, absorbing and assimilating all the religions and cultural movements in India. Consequently it has no Bible, Koran or Dhammapadam to which controversies can be referred for resolution. Many works such as the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad-Gita are authoritative but none is exclusively so. As in Christianity there are several Hindu schools of thought and Hinduism clearly outlines their common beliefs and particular differences.",
