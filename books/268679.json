  "title": "The Heresiarch and Co.",
  "description": "A collection of outrageous short stories about heretics, provincial romantics, and adventurers in crime, The Heresiarch & Co. was Apollinaire's first book, and reportedly remained his favourite. Making full use of his encyclopedic knowledge of obscure historical, ecclesiastical, and geographical information, Apollinaire's stories rely neither on the dream, nor on juxtaposition, but nonetheless represent a technique that Andr√© Breton called a \"formula\" for Surrealism; its \"music,\" he said, is \"like gold pebbles rolled in a torrent.\" Apollinaire himself wrote about IThe Heresiarch Co.,/I \"This is a book for those who love literature, powerful and disturbing, strange and logical. The author, amid so many fantastic, tragic, and sometimes sublime inventions, intoxicates himself with a charming erudition with which he also intoxicates his readers.\"",
