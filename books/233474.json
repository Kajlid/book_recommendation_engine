  "description": "When Gabriel broke down my door, he took over my body and life. Never with force, but always with clever manipulation. He stripped me of my independence, my defenses, and my clothes and turned me into an addict. My addiction is him.Once, I had dreams and a future. Now, I have fears, scars, and insatiable needs. I'm damaged beyond repair, but if I'm to survive the most dangerous man in Johannesburg, I can't allow him to break me, because broken toys are destined for the garbage dump.",
