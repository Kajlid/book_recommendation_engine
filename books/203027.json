  "description": "Book #1 of a new 2 Book seriesDahliaI knew I should have listened to my inner voice. I should never have said yes to helping out my friend, but I did, and the Russian with the dangerous eyes shocked me by how easily he stirred outrageous desires in my body and made me lose complete control. I did the only thing I could. I walked (all right, I ran) away to the sound of his cheap parting shot, ‘you'll be back when you need my help.’ But I haven’t been able to run away from him in my dreams. God knows I’ve tried. Then something unthinkable happens. My sister goes missing while on a backpacking trip, and the ruthless predator is the only one who can help. He sits in his study, a beautiful, powerful man with eyes cold enough to freeze my blood.He says he can help, but nothing is for free … Zane She ran like a spooked deer, but I always knew she’d be back.Now she thinks she can just waltz in here and pretend like nothing’s happened.
