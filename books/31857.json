  "description": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author comes a revised, repackaged novel sure to please her many fans. She writes \"high speed comic mayhem\" (Detroit Free Press); she's \"a blast of fresh air\" (Washington Post); \"side-splitting funny\" (Publishers Weekly) and \"a winner\" (Glamour). In other words, she's Janet Evanovich.Berry Knudson had a talent for disaster, but when she climbed a tree to rescue a kitten, she wasn't prepared for the scrumptious hunk undressing in a nearby window, or her dive downward that smashed Jake Sawyer's pizza and won his heart! But was there room in her chaotic schedule for a risk-taking inventor with dreams? She took classes, delivered pizzas, and cared for three eccentric old ladies she rescued from the train station. But Jake thrived on a challenge, and he could be very inventive. Could he teach her there was time to make butterscotch pudding and let herself be loved?",
