  "description": "Endre Lovinger was only seventeen years old when the Nazis invaded Budapest, Hungary, in March 1944. Taken from his family at gunpoint to work on a Jewish Forced Labor Brigade, he eventually escaped and found himself on the run trying to keep one step ahead of the Nazis and certain death. After more than seventy years of buried memories, he finally opened up and shared his past in letters to his oldest grandson who was attending the Air Force Academy. In Dear Andrew: Letters and Memoirs of a Holocaust Survivor to his Grandson, Andrew Ross (Endre Lovinger) tells of his heartache and triumph in uncertain times.",
