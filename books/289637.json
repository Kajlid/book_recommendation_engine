  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  A deadly, unstable shooter.  A trap Malcolm and Seong-Jae can't escape.  And more than one life on the line as they find themselves facing down one of the Golden Ratio Killer's proxies in a high-stakes hostage situation that could ramp up the serial murderer's mathematical body counts exponentially.  And if Malcolm and Seong-Jae aren't careful, they'll be among the tally.  While back home, Huang's life hangs in the balance—and Anjulie walks a thin line between justice and deception.  Everything's spiraling out of control.  And the more they fight to survive, the deeper they sink into a twisted game governed by not one, but two minds.  With Sila and the Golden Ratio Killer as the players...  Will our heroes end up as nothing more than pawns?  ABOUT SEASON TWO  Malcolm Khalaji and Seong-Jae Yoon are back on the case — and partnering with the FBI on a horrific serial murder case that will test Malcolm's faith and revive the darkest parts of Seong-Jae's past. With an enigmatic killer leading them on a wild goose chase through city after city and body after body, both Mal and Seong-Jae will find themselves pushed to their limits as they discover the worst of what humanity can do.  Even two minds against one may not be enough as they track the devious Golden Ratio Killer, and try to find the key to his pattern. But the trail of breadcrumbs left by the white rabbit will lead them suspiciously close to home, and a connection they never could have predicted. With their worlds exploding around them and everyone they know suddenly cast into doubt...  Can their partnership — and their love — survive the greatest trial of their lives?",
