  "description": "The tale of a dog who wouldn't let go and the woman who followed his lead.Teresa Rhyne vowed to get things right this time around: new boyfriend, new house, new dog, maybe even new job. But shortly after she adopted Seamus, a totally incorrigible beagle, vets told Teresa that he had a malignant tumor and less than a year to live. The diagnosis devastated her, but she decided to fight it, learning everything she could about the best treatment for Seamus. Teresa couldn't possibly have known then that she was preparing herself for life's next hurdle - a cancer diagnosis of her own.She forged ahead with survival, battling a deadly disease, fighting for doctors she needed, and baring her heart for a seemingly star–crossed relationship. The Dog Lived (and so Will I) is an uplifting and heartwarming story about how dogs steal our hearts, show us how to live, and teach us how to love.\"This poignant and fast–moving memoir of Teresa and Seamus—both definitely Type A personalities— is proof that even a hard–charging lawyer is no match for a big–hearted beagle. Their mutual triumph over terrible trials is a testament to the healing power of dogs. Four paws up!\" —Martin Kihn, author of Bad Dog (A Love Story)\"This encouraging tale of finding love and love in unexpected places is full of small yet valuable life lessons that any animal–lover would appreciate.\"—Publishers Weekly\"A book that dares to be honest and sad and hilarious all at once. It will help inspire many people to respond to the unexpected in their own lives with humor and grace.\"—Susan Conley, author of The Foremost Good Fortune",
