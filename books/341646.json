And to Lissy’s surprise, her little origami bird opens his eyes and says hello! So she quickly makes more friends. And soon Lissy has more friends than she can count! But what do you do when your friends have to leave? If you’re Lissy, you make another friend . . . but this time one that stays. Utterly imaginative and charming, Lissy’s Friends is a fresh take on the importance of friendship.",
