  "description": "Bonn Maddox is ambivalent toward the massive ill-gotten fortune he inherited, but he does prize a water-stained document that hangs in his father’s study. It’s generations-old … a black market treasure. Inspiration turns to obsession. The butcher considers his calling a societal reckoning: a deep moral debt owed for his family’s predatory greed. The maimed vigilante enlists a pair of eccentric Germans to grow his operation. Discreet, reptile-like savants, they are financial gurus but have their own secrets. When Henna Maxwell, a toxicologist with a rare passion for venom, seeks refuge, Bonn may have risked his freedom. The death count soars. New York City’s top homicide team has profiled an inhumanly strong and opportunistic loner who’s always a step ahead. Has the hunter graduated to Brownsville? The detectives—an ex-boxer and his pregnant partner—have unknowingly assumed terrible risks. They couldn’t guess how personal the killer’s hunt has become. Now, more than just thugs are in trouble … those who consider themselves untouchable are next.",
