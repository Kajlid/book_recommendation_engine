  "description": "When an ice cream van is stopped at a cross roads, its brake light out, what are the chances its driver will be terrified by the police, his wife unable to communicate her distress as she tries to protect her children?  What are the chances that the brand new police officer on duty will be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, fresh from his third tour in Iraq.

And will Bashkim Ahmeti, our eight-year-old hero, let him?",
