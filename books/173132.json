  "description": "If you could plan your life before you were born, what could that life look like?A forthright, efficient executive in her mid 40’s, Rebecca Wainwright, has the world by the tail. Her perfect life capsizes when her father suddenly dies and she explodes into darkness, depression and panic attacks. Seeking solitude to recover her health, she takes a drive to escape the stifling burden of her family’s concern and to search for a sanctuary that she can call her own. She stumbles upon a deserted old stone cottage for sale. As she approaches the house she has a sense of déjà vu and homecoming that mystifies her. Although appearing empty, she soon discovers that the home is occupied by the lonely, frightened spirit of a young woman.Victoria Anne Smythe-Stratton, a young woman in late 19th century, falls in love with a Scottish mason, William McBride, much to the disgust of her aristocratic mother. Henrietta. Their mother/daughter relationship, which has always been strained, shreds even further on the birth of Victoria’s first child, a girl. Tragedy overcomes the family and the young mother becomes an earthbound spirit resolutely waiting for her husband to come home.Why is Rebecca so drawn to this cottage? What happens when the practical, logical, 21st century woman meets a 19th century ghost? How are these two women connected? Perhaps a past life? How will Rebecca find her answer?
