Jagi Lamplighter...Sixteen tales of wit and wonder, of mischief and magic, where simple folk and extraordinary individuals wrestle down their own fears to find the courage, cleverness and, occasionally, faith to face life's dangers and enchantments:A young man trapped in dreams finds an unexpected way into the waking world.A technician on a zero-g space station discovers there is more to him than meets the eye.Time cops must unwind crimes that might not have been committed yet.A brilliant young psychiatrist tests his theories on an unearthly patient by a moonlit pond.For a young girl, Anne Bolyn's poppet is the stuff of nightmares only she can banish.Enjoy these and more, including three stories in the author's Prospero's Children universe:Mephisto goes to the mountain--dragging Erasmus and Mab along--and chaos ensues.Mab joins forces with a former MD to rescue her autistic son's favorite toy, and end up facing down a faerie slave ring.And Miranda herself stands up to the past--and a vampire--to end the threat of a deadly delicacy.Come! Enjoy the wonder!",
