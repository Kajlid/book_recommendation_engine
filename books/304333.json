  "description": "I had it all. Killer job, to-die-for apartment overlooking the Hudson, and the successful, doting boyfriend. Well, he was successful, at least. Guys who dote don’t break up with you via Post-It. After that, I did the one thing I swore I’d never do. I went home to the smallest small town there is—a place so backward my family was still engaging in a hundreds-of-years-old feud with the Tuckers. Maybe it had evolved from the days of shooting one another to slightly more benign things, like filling family stores with crickets and moving a two-ton moose around town. But still. This was not NYC. It was meant to be a stop-over. But when one of the local little old ladies died suddenly and willed her dilapidated haunted house to me, things got complicated. Because she didn’t just leave the house to me. She left it to me and Michael Tucker jointly. Because who doesn’t want to live in a haunted house with their enemy? Only I’m not sure Michael Tucker is my enemy. In fact, he’s turning out to be kind of… hot. In a strong single dad kind of way. And I’m not sure how much I really want to get back to New York City, anyway. Falling into Forever is the fifth book in Delancey Stewart’s Singletree – a series of interconnected stand-alone romcoms that will charm you and make you swoon. It’s a book about haunted houses, making choices, and re-thinking the things we’ve been told about other people all our lives.",
