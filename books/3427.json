  "title": "Gianna: Aborted...and Lived to Tell About It",
  "description": "At the tender age of 17, Tina was frightened and pregnant. Feeling abandoned and desperate, she stepped into the clinic to have an abortion. But in the midst of it, something unexpected happened . . . something wonderful. Instead of snuffing out the growing life within, the procedure failed. And with defiance and courage, a baby girl made her way into the world. Gianna is the incredible true story of one girl's remarkable journey from abortion survivor to steadfast defender and lover of life. This book isn't about issues â€•it's about a young woman's determination to make the most of her God-given opportunities.",
