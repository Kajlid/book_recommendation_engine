  "description": "Missa is a sweet, and imaginative little girl who has found a way to masterfully navigate through life's challenges by blowing bubbles. You'll soon find that these are not regular bubbles. In fact they are quite MAGNIFICENT, because they are just as ready as Missa to take on any obstacle, big or small, with a positive attitude. Missa's room is a mess and she is unable to find her favourite violet bow. She lets her imagination come to life and with her new bubble friends, monkey and shark, she learns the valuable lesson of keeping things tidy, while still having fun.",
