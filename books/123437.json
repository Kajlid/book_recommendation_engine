  "title": "Victoria's Vow",
  "description": "In England in 1880, Barstow asks Victoria to marry him. In reply, she promises to give him as much sex as he desires. No reasonable sexual act will be off the table. She will satisfy him with any perversion that he could buy from any whore, freely, with enthusiasm, and as often as he likes. In exchange, she asks only that he be discreet and faithful. He is enthralled and immediately accepts her conditions. She will never break her word, no matter the cost. What could possibly go wrong?",
