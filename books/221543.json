  "description": "Iâ€™m back, and there is no time to rest now that I am the Eventide Speaker. While I was able to purify the town, the Everely Woods are still very much defiled to the point that no Divine Being can enter them. The only logically thing for me to do is to go inside them myself to find the true source of the defilement. Camping out in cursed woods? What is the worst that can happen? Besides having to deal with ghosts, a creepy doll factory, zombie nymphs, and evil Satanists. Questions will be answered, mysteries will be solved, and hopefully all of us will make it out alive.",
