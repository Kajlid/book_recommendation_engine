  "description": "After using magic to save the town, Drac and Diana are thrown out of town because the fear the townsfolk have for magic. Although the townsfolk are terrified of magic they fear the demons that Drac and Diana saved them from more, which leads them to not allowing Drac and Diana to leave the outskirts of town. Finally Drac and Diana are fed up with this arrangement so they attempt to escape their captors, only to be attacked and thrown back out. Licking their wounds, Drac and Diana try to make peace with what their lives are, only to be asked for help by the townsfolk.",
