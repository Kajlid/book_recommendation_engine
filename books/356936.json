  "description": "A WOMAN RIDING FOR REVENGE, A MAN GAMBLING FOR LOVESamantha Kincade was after a man. As a bounty hunter that was her job. But in a rowdy Colorado saloon, a gambler with golden tiger eyes saw through her boy's disguise. A little frightened, and more than a little fascinated, Samantha knew the blazing eyes belonged to Trace Harden, the half-brother of Hannibal Cotwell, the killer she had sworn to find. Any kin of Cotwell's was an enemy, and Samantha's trigger finger itched when she looked at Trace. But a force more powerful was pulling them together, a love that could free each from a turbulent past and give them a future together. First the two loners would have to trust each other-and dare to join their untamed hearts in a wild land.",
