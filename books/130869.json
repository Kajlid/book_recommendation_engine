  "description": "Something is rotten in the amateur production of Hamlet at stately, magnificent Scamnum court. Sinister messages--quotations from Shakespeare--have been delivered to the players, who are guests of Scamnum's owners, the Duke and Duchess of Horton. But the play goes on and, with diabolical ingenuity, the murder of England's Lord High Chancellor is enacted at the very moment of his staged slaying in the role of Polonius.(from the back cover)",
