  "description": "More an origin story than a traditional novel, Jack July's Amy Lynn follows the coming-of-age of a charming little Southern girl. Raised in a family of bootleggers and scoundrels, the motherless Amy is adopted by her Aunt Carla Jo, who teaches her everything about being a woman. A triumvirate of male Southern characters teach her other lessons: how to survive, how to live off the land, and how to be a winner. By the time Amy enlists in the United States Navy, she is the sort of heroic figure who commands respect - and over the course of her service in Afghanistan as a corpsmen attached to a Marine unit, she surprises everyone with her strength, skills, and heart.",
