  "description": "Anne loves her husband. He is a strong, tender man and a committed father, and he knows everything about her…well almost everything. After nearly twenty years together, she still finds it hard to tell him what she wants. Lately some of the books she’s been reading make her wonder what it would be like to be more adventurous.  Matt has it on good authority that Anne’s book club is reading stories that are anything but vanilla. When a friend offers him the use of Studio 1247 to make his wife’s secret fantasies come true, Matt has a chance to plan a weekend that will stretch both their limits and hopefully push them back into each other’s arms.",
