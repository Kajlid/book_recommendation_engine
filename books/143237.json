  "description": "They say that truth is stranger than fiction. But for Laura Turner it's also just as deadly...   Landing the lead female role in the latest blockbuster action film was a dream come true for the struggling actress and there wasn't anything she wouldn't do to keep it. But when the director insists on the input of a real-life Motorcycle Gang member for authenticity's sake she starts to wonder if maybe she has made a mistake.  Roman is gorgeous, mysterious, and thoroughly distracting. Swaggering around on set in his leather's and impressing cast and crew alike, Laura can't help but fall for his brooding charms, too.  But when their professional relationship starts to take a seductively delicious turn things start to heat up and not in the way Laura would like.  Someone out there has a problem with Roman revealing gang secrets. And because of her new-found status as Roman's old lady, that means someone out there has a problem with Laura, too.",
