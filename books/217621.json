  "description": "He's a dirty kisser... and even dirtier in the bedroom. \"Stay away from Andrew Finch.\" That was my uncle's warning when I started interning for his company. I took it to heart. How could I not? There was no way I was going to risk my blossoming career by disobeying. But on my first day, pushed together too closely in a stock room, I methim. I didn't know guys like Andrew existed outside of Men's Fitness magazines. His eyes cut through my clothes, and I'm sure his smirking mouth could get a girl off easy and quick. Not that I'd know... I'm a virgin, after all. I want to listen to my uncle and keep my distance, but Andrew makes it impossible. We don't just work together, he lives in the same building as me! When he offers to help me move, one thing leads to another. I never had a chance. Andrew is wildâ€”a real kinky kind of alpha. You won't believe what he does to a pair of my panties... or whatI>/i>do with them when he's done. But I shouldn't have given in. Now that I've had a taste, I can't stop myself.",
