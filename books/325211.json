  "description": "BECOME A FAERY, STAY ALIVEWhen I accidentally gave Auden all of his magic back, I *may* have set myself up on a path leading toward disaster.After all, nonmagical things can't survive in Avalon. And a faery without magic is pretty much just a human girl with way too much hair, circling Avalon's drain.To stay alive, I'm going to have to change even more than I already have… assuming that's possible.And if it isn't, I'm going to have to high-tail it back to Earth.After rescuing Hannah and Elyn, of course.Because us ex-average-human chicks have to stay together, after all.It sounds easy:Become a faery, stay alive.But nothing in Avalon is as simple as it seems… including me.",
