  "title": "Atlas Loved",
  "description": "Inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and the \"The Last of Us\" games by Naughty Dog Studios, written with the most accurate detail possible to being human, and presented as a first-time fully self-published book from W.M Angel, Atlas Loved is a story unlike others. Set in the era of 1960 to 1982, following a young novelist who lands in France for the first time to get new inspiration for his up and coming novel that would soon become a best-selling book in America. But, not all is as it should be, and the young, prestigious John Holloway gets thrown into a dark world of love, betrayal and even death. Soon to become a washed up novelist that has to face his own demons, Holloway finds himself to be lost in a world that becomes a haze through the over-indulgence of alcohol, cocaine and emotional scars that bind him to the past in ways more twisted than most. Alone and abandoned by everything he knows, carrying on only for someone he loves, he must go through his regretful past only to be faced with two choices through the turmoil of Rosalynn Draper's love affair, as well as his childhood friend confronting him on his overindulgence and self-harm, John Holloway goes through a difficult journey where he lands on a last path that leaves him with only one decision and two choices . . . Each one equally worse. Life . . . Or . . . Death.",
