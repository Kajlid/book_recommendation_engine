  "description": "It was a lonely lighthouse, tucked far out on a Peninsula. Its function was to protect the ships at sea from the treacherous shoals of coastal Maine. Jacob and Sarah had done their job well all these keeping the lamp lit and sounding the warning horn whenever necessary. And now, unable to help, they watched as the violence of a late winter storm took out its fury on a helpless schooner.Sailing from distant Ireland, the ship held many of the Irish immigrants who were escaping from the lingering effects of the terrible devastation of the potato famine.Would there be survivors from this catastrophe? This is the tale still told today that surrounds that mysterious event.",
