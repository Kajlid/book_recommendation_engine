  "description": "One group. Six idols. Seven hearts.\n\n\nTae, Dante, Minhyuk, Nate, Kyun, and Jun are the members of H3RO, a K-Pop idol group. Threatened with disbandment, they have one chance left: get a number one single in their next comeback, or their contracts – and their dreams – will be cancelled.\n\n  Holly is the illegitimate daughter of the Chairman of Atlantis Entertainment. Leaving Chicago and moving to Seoul seemed like the hardest thing she would have to do... until she is given the seemingly impossible task of proving her worth as an Atlantis heir by managing H3RO.\n\n  Holly and H3RO must work together to beat the odds, to write, record and produce their own album. An album that will seal their fate - good or bad - in the music industry. But can they manage a miracle with Holly’s jerk of a half-brother (and Atlantis Entertainment’s Vice-Chairman) hindering them at every turn?\n\n\n** IDOL THOUGHTS is the first full-length, slow-burn Reverse Harem novel in the H3RO Trilogy. **\n\n\n\n\nFind out by pre-ordering IDOL THOUGHTS at this limited-time price, now!",
