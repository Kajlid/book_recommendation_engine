  "description": "This Book is part one in a three part trilogy.New York's death penalty was abolished in 2007, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled the death penalty statute unconstitutional because of a defective protocol it determined was coercive in nature.Seven years later that had changed . . . and by the following winter of 2015 over a hundred inmates on its now infamous death row had found death by a lethal, three way injection system. That number would increase each year until finally reaching a point well past any previous mark set. In 2022, however, it was all to change, again.ThE WaReHOuSe> project was moving along nicely. New York Governor Mr. Hugh Clayton and his Chief of Staff Mr. Benjamin Bailey were at the precipice of solving mankind's most trying riddle. And with the help of a software engineering genius (code named Bios), and a world renowned neuroscientist (code named Cluster), they had not only cracked the code to the psychopathic mind, but they had also developed a protocol of their own. And with their program now ready to go live, all they needed to complete this masterpiece was its final test subject.You are invited to witness history in the making as the future of technology unravels the folds of the human psyche. DNA, the very code of life itself, gives up its secrets as the technology, the software, and the program 'fixes' one criminal mind at a time.But be careful what you believe because when the plot turns back onto itself like a double helix, all bets are off as the reader is faced with the heart pounding . . . beginning.",
