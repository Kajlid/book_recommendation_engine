  "description": "Eleven chilling tales, dredged deep from within the dark mind of Ian Woodhead... The ghost’s huge mouth fastened onto Graham’s head and took out a section like a child biting into a ripe plum.... The girl held Trevor by his neck and pulled off another piece of his cheek with her teeth, she looked at Aiden whilst chewing and winked... Not for the faint of heart.",
