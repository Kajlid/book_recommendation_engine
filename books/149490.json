  "description": "Rebecca Ravenshaw, daughter of missionaries, spent most of her life in India. Following the death of her family in the Indian Uprising of 1857, Rebecca returns to claim her family estate in Hampshire, England. People are surprised to see her...and highly suspicious. Less than a year earlier, an imposter had arrived with an Indian servant and assumed not only Rebecca’s name but also her home and income.That pretender died within months of her appearance and was hastily buried at midnight. The locals believe that perhaps she, Rebecca, is the real imposter. Her home and her father’s investments reverted to a distant relative, the darkly charming Captain Luke Whitfield, who quickly took over.Against her best intentions, Rebecca falls in love with Whitfield, forcing her to question his motives—does he want her or Headbourne House? If Luke is simply after the property, as everyone suspects, she may suffer a similar fate as the first “Rebecca.”A captivating romance set against a backdrop of intrigue and danger, Mist of Midnight will leave you breathless.~~~~A discussion of potentially sensitive content may be found on the author’s webpage for this book for those who would like to preview it before reading.",
