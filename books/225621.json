  "description": "I'm a monster. And she’s my angel.    I’m a ruthless perfectionist who’s never needed love. It’s a worthless emotion that makes you weak, and I’m anything but weak. I haven’t let a soul get close to me. No one’s ever made me feel a damn thing.  Until Shawnie. My angel.  I knew from the moment I saw her that she was different. She’s scarred and broken, running from a past that haunts her. But her wings aren’t broken like she thinks. Her past hasn’t destroyed her, and I can show her what she’s worth.  I want her with an intensity that I’ve never felt before. Her large light amber eyes shine with vulnerability. Her lush curves and full, kissable lips call to me in a way that leaves me breathless. They beg me to take her and make her mine.  But my secrets threaten to take too much from her. I should stay away. There’s a darkness in me that craves the depravity she desires. She wants to serve and obey, and I’m more than happy to fill those needs.  For the first time in my life, she makes me feel like a man and not a monster. This time, I won’t be denied.  **No Limits is a full-length Dark Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
