  "description": "My son is a good man. I know what you think about him, because I know what he's done, but you have to understand that it's not his fault. He was something of a misanthrope in his youth and that can be attributed to his father. Please understand that I will take the blame for my part in wrecking his soul, but it's so hard to resist a boy so sweet. He's always loved me most of all and I took advantage of that. Until you feel what I felt in his arms don't judge me too harshly. Don't hate my son for the sins of his mother. I betrayed his trust. I made him into the man he's become. God help me. This is my confession.",
