  "description": "The PLOT thickens! Already fed up with her restrictive new life as a PRINCESS, Jenna runs away (with a boy!) from boarding school, only to get caught up in a TRAP to overthrow her uncle, the king! Life as a princess = a dream come true, right? Not so much! Between palace rules, a mean-girl roommate at boarding school, the ever-present paparazzi--and, BTW, her unrequited crushing on Jonas--Jenna finds herself wishing for plain old anonymity again. So she runs away--only to be captured by the villainous Bolstrom, who's been planting seeds of unrest in the newly unified nation of Scandia and plotting to overthrow Jenna's uncle, the king! Aided by her sassy BFF Bea, Nahira's rebels, and maybe even that mean roomie, Jenna must stop a civil war--when all she really wants is her first kiss!",
