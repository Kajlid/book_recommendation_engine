  "description": "“Full and deep and immensely moving . . . a standout shocker.”— Library JournalThe child called Laura was the worst case Dr. Richard D’Ambrosio had ever encountered. As a toddler, she had been held in a frying pan and horribly burned. Now she was twelve, labeled schizophrenic, and housed in a gloomy institution run by Catholic nuns. Scarred physically and emotionally, she had never spoken a word. But the Sisters believed she would speak—if they could find someone to unlock the terrifying memories that kept her mute.That person was Dr. D’Ambrosio. Here, in an unforgettable story of professional skill and human courage, he records his rescue of that one little girl.  No Language But a Cry has transcended its status as immensely interesting case history to become an incomparable testament to the awesome power of faith and love.",
