  "description": "Orion's Daughter is a deeply felt and lush narrative that explores the vulnerable and poignant moments in a young woman's life. Touching on themes often not spoken about, it is a story about betrayal, teen pregnancy and the great mysteries that lie beyond our normal every day reality. Reluctantly, clairvoyant Natalie embarks on an adventure that unfolds in the beautiful tapestry of a New Jersey summer and spreads west to Colorado. Her story takes her down a new road paved with turmoil, ghostly visions, an unsolved murder and the intersection of infatuation and love.",
