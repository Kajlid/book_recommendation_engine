Cursed by her sister Brooke, Alexis Powell arrives in the Victorian Era where she meets Ezra, a man recently murdered by an assassin his brother Amos, hired. Now he’s a supernatural creature and with a touch Ezra sees into Alexis’ mind. Intrigued by her memories, Ezra offers Alexis his help only to be rebuffed for his kindness.  Alexis runs away, but Ezra can’t shake off what he saw. He follows her through the streets of London, but vulnerable after the loss of his Father, Amos’ harassment, and Alexis’ many rejections, Ezra eventually decides to leave her alone.  Alexis is unable to find work and threatened with starvation. She steals a tomato and Ezra finds her facing the local magistrate and an angry mob. He fights and pays for her freedom.  Finally accepting the help Ezra offers, Alexis moves into the manor he shares with his brother. Romance blossoms but the bond between Ezra and Amos is worse than Alexis’ and Brooke’s. While Ezra and Alexis seek a way to send her home, Amos looks for a way to kill them.",
