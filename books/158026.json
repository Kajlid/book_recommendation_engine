  "description": "The Creator invented the game. The stakes were nothing less than the immortal fate of mankind. Yet when fallen angel Jim Heron was challenged to play, he had no idea the voracious demon Devina would be so formidable an adversary-or that the carnal depths to which he was willing to go could prove so fatal.Devina's more than ready to claim victory in this war and has her next scheme already underway: Sissy, a defenseless woman under the influence and an unwitting player in the fight for Heron's heart.At the defining crossroads between salvation and damnation, Heron is ready to do anything it takes to succeed-a suicide mission that will take him into Heaven and Hell, and into the darkest and most sensual shadows that lie in wait at the end of the world . . .'Everything J.R. Ward writes is a must read . . . she never disappoints' Christine Feehan",
