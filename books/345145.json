The magicians are hunting the Ryves family for a charm that Nick's mother stole—a charm that keeps her alive—and they want it badly enough to kill again.Danger draws even closer when a brother and sister come to the Ryves family for help.

The only way to do that is to kill one of the magicians they have been hiding from for so long.Ensnared in a deadly game of cat and mouse, Nick starts to suspect that his brother is telling him lie after lie about their past. As the magicians' Circle closes in on their family, Nick uncovers the secret that could destroy them all.This is the Demon's Lexicon. Turn the page.",
