  "description": "In the war against vampires, mankind has only one The Dark-Hunters. Ancient warriors who died of brutal betrayal, the Dark-Hunters have sworn themselves into the service of the goddess Artemis to protect us. Itâ s a pact with pretty good perks. Immortality, power, psychic abilities, wealth and a cool wardrobe. But it comes with a few fatal sun poisoning and a new, irreparable dental problem. But aside from the fangs and nocturnal lifestyle, itâ s not so bad. Until Kyrian meets the most frightening thing imaginable. An accountant whoâ s being hunted by one of the most lethal vampires out there. If Amanda Devereaux goes down, so does he and no offense, he doesnâ t want to die (hence the whole immortality thing). And he doesnâ t want humanity dead either which is a good thing for us since he and Amanda are all that stands between us and oblivion. Letâ s hope they win. From the wild imagination of Sherrilyn Kenyon comes the humorous and suspenseful manga debut of the #1 internationally bestselling Dark-Hunter series. The world of manga will never be the same again.",
