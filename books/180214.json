  "description": "Life’s a real bitch and then you die and they make you the queen of hell. Joanna Messina’s time in Elin hasn’t all been hell, however, and her relationship with Elin’s High King, Ruarc Trevelian, has been the best part of her stay in this strange world. He’s protected her, given her his family, made her the most powerful woman in his kingdom and kept to his promise to love Joanna on her terms. But long before she ever came to his world, his family’s past was riddled by betrayals, treason and murder. The Trevelians nearly destroyed themselves and Ruarc’s destiny was irrevocably altered as a result. Now an enemy from that past has come back to seek vengeance, and the first victim will be Joanna. There are worse things that can happen to her than merely dying.",
