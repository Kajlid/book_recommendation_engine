  "description": "This thriller novel is filled with instances of dark and irreverent humor and purposefully pokes fun at things that are generally taken seriously.Also, if you are someone who might be offended by an asexual, Machiavellian villain or a charming, metrosexual, serial-killer-like assassin, this is definitely not the book for you.On the other hand, if you love an intricately woven plot with humor, over-the-top action, mystery, and suspense, then read on.Here are the main players in our deliciously deadly Dr. Rafaela Ramos - She's beautiful. She's the CIA's biochemical assassin. She thinks sheâ€™s untouchable.Antonio Peloso - He's as bushy and hair-sprinkled as he is eccentric. Will his brilliant mind and Werther algorithm trap the much sought after Rafaela at last?Gunter - The camera loves him almost as much as he nurtures and adores his razor sharp knives. Resplendently dressed in carefully sewn sequins, he pirouettes on video over his awestruck victims, while paving the way for Antonio's diabolical plan.The Beautiful biochemical assassin, Rafaela, works for the CIA making untraceable hits, wherein she infects targets with viruses that cause \"natural\" deaths.Burnt out, she decides to take a few days off to help a fellow scientist do the more meaningful biochemistry she longs to someday embrace.Little does she know, her colleague is unwittingly being used as bait. His request for her help is step one in luring her straight into a deadly web.",
