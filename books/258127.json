  "description": "What if Greek Gods and Monsters took over modern-day Earth?\"I am Andrus Eaves. I live in the New Greece Theocracy, a nation ruled by gods and monsters. All my life, I have trained to serve the Theocracy, to be its sword and shield. But as I come close to becoming a warrior, I begin to see through the lies. I begin to see inside myselfâ€”that I am not who I thought I was, that my world is not what the Theocracy told me. Today, I come into my power. Today, I take up my sword not to oppress, but to save us all.\"Together with a renegade witch and priest, Andrus must unlock the magic destiny of his secret past. Fight after fight, the desperate heroes clash with Titans, evil priests, warriors, centaurs, and harpies!",
