  "description": "In the year 2519, people on Earth don’t grow old and die any longer, their bodies are frozen and they start a new life in the virtual reality of the Game.  Jex is almost eighteen, working twelve hour shifts, and dreaming of when she’ll be legally adult and begin her long-planned idyllic life in Game. When a bomber attacks a Game server complex, one of the virtual worlds of Game crashes, and eleven thousand immortal players die during emergency defrost. Death has struck Game for the first time in centuries, and Jex is questioned as a suspect in the bombing.  With this on her record, Jex will never be allowed to enter Game, but then one of the legendary founder players of Game offers her the chance to join his investigation into the bombing. Jex must help Hawk catch the true bomber to protect the worlds of Game and save her own future, but the bomber is far more dangerous than anyone realizes.",
