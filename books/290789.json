  "title": "In Spite Of Us : A Love Story about Second Chances",
  "description": "Sandy is sober, moving toward God and a better life. Deb is not sober. She believes a sober life would be like staying awake through major surgery—seeing—feeling—hearing—all. God is not a destination on her map. What happens when this unlikely match agrees to a blind date? Remarkably, a second date. The awkward, mishap affair is like a stroll through a maze of dominoes triggered to collapse with the next breath. Solo, they’re a mess, but as a duet? God help them! They are modern-day characters right out of the Bible. Remember the sheep? That pesky fellow wandering off causing the shepherd to leave the ninety-nine and take care of it? That’s them. What lengths will God go to save this couple from their worst enemy—themselves?",
