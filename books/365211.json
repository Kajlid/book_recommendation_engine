  "description": "In 1502, Europe was different; it was a violent, superstitious place and beginning its cultural rebirth, a change slowly forcing out the supernatural and giving way to the age of reason. One man had to confront this change, not as a change for humankind, but within his own existence. Born a man of faith and later educated in the foundation of reason and rational thought, he becomes a being whose very existence is embedded in centuries old superstition. His struggle is not with what he has become, but with the loss of his wife, his lone female child he would never meet and more importantly his doted upon niece â€“ Karina.",
