  "description": "After leaving the wrong man, Leah Griffin's not ready to look for the right one. All she wants is to survive the conference she's planning and spend some time with her best friend Kate Edwards. She was not expecting the conference services manager to be so tall, dark, and handsome—or so eager to please. It's Brandon Long's job to make Leah happy, but after a scorching interlude in her hotel room, neither can deny business has become pleasure. Smart, driven, and successful attorney Kate Edwards has spent her life making the right choices. But in contrast to those right choices, she's involved in a long distance, secret love affair with a coworker. Charles Dixon is a bad choice she can't help but make—over and over. A conference and a promotion bring Kate back to Pennsylvania, and suddenly, Dix wants far more than a few nights in random hotel rooms. He wants something permanent, and Kate has to figure out if sometimes a wrong choice isn't exactly what a woman needs.",
