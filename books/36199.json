  "title": "The Stature of Waiting",
  "description": "We set great store by activity and busy-ness. We want to be 'in control'. We value what we 'do' more than who we are. So when we become ill, or retire from work, or suffer an enforced period of inactivity, our self-esteem is threatened. This classic of spiritual writing transforms our understanding of the experience of illness, or of being out of work, of feeling inactive and powerless.",
