  "description": "Not everything in Heaven is as holy as it seems...In Crimson Ties, the second installment of the Crimson Nights Saga, Laziel is nowhere to be found, and with the ferocity of Malachi Denali's vampiric temperament growing out of control, Rome's Vatican enclave and those that dwell there risk everything to keep their King’s throne out of Darklon De Sangue’s treacherous hands.As Darklon's mental state deteriorates, his treasonous plans to overthrow Malachi know no bounds. With Arial dancing upon a deadly double-edged sword and working to gain Darklon's trust, this continuing saga keeps everyone on tenterhooks as new treaties are strengthened and friendships are forged by oaths and blood.Will Laziel return in time to save Malachi from those that threaten the male he loves, or will the fury of Malachi's disdain for emotion see Laziel ascend if he refuses to accept the hand that destiny has dealt him and the gift of his angel's love?With emotions running high, and Malachi's past turning up to haunt them both in the form of the mysterious Vischeral Bourne, the twists and turns may prove too much for Laziel and his vampire. While Malachi and Laziel struggle with fate, an alliance with the wolves and the secrets behind the Nephilim and their sadistic Queen threaten to rock the very foundations of the supernatural world.Who knows what ties will bind and which will fade away.With a high element of supernatural romance and erotic sexcapades between male lovers, Crimson Ties may not be to some people’s taste, but for those brave enough to step into the wicked world of Laz and Lachi, we hope that you will read and thoroughly enjoy…Crimson Ties, The Crimson Nights Saga",
