The tower has been neglected, cheapened by the horrors that happened on the land. Tony Barone, the executive of an advertising agency, plans to rent out Floor 17 at a discounted price, dragging with him his four employees and his ten-year-old daughter, Selena. Madson Tower has something sinister at work within its walls... and to face it, they'll all have to first face their own mangled pasts and bad memories.",
