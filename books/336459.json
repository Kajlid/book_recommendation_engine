  "title": "Goodbye to Lovely: The harrowing true story of a woman’s struggle with urban poverty, domestic violence and addiction",
  "description": "Born into a poor working-class family in London's inner city, the cards are stacked against Anna Cooper from the start. First, as a victim of her parents' dysfunctional relationship, she has to endure periods of her early life in care. Then when she meets Billy, she thinks that all of her dreams have come true. Unfortunately, she is instead catapulted into a nightmarish vision of psychopathic control, sexual abuse and domestic violence. At a time when women's rights and domestic violence are barely recognized, will she find a way to escape her predicament? What are the long-term consequences of her situation likely to be? In his retelling of this harrowing, true story, Buck Starmer has done little to embellish, or even make it more readable, sticking as far as possible to the originator’s own terminology and way of speaking. The names of people and places have been changed in order to protect their identities.",
