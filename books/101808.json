  "description": "Sex would never be enough... Nathan Livingston has more in his life than he can handle--a high-powered job in D.C. politics, a sixteen-year-old daughter he's raising alone, and another daughter who ran away from him, whom he hasn't seen in two years.He doesn't have anything left to invest in a real relationship. A night of hot sex with Lynn every three months is as much as he'll allow himself, and it doesn't matter that it never feels like enough.Lynn shouldn't be involved with someone as high-profile as Nathan, since it could negatively affect her successful web magazine, but she just can't resist their nights together.Then his complicated personal life catches up to their no-strings-attached affair, and they both find out everything they're missing.",
