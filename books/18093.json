  "title": "Waiting for Willa",
  "description": "Wilhelmina, is the simple signature at the bottom of a letter from Willa Bedford, but to her cousin, Grace Asherton, it has ominous overtones. A nearly forgotten schoolgirlâ€™s game, it is the long-standing signal for alarm agreed upon long before Willa went to Stockholm to live. Grace takes the coded message seriously and wires her cousin that she is on her way, and much, much more.What follows is a perilous search through the fascinating night world of Stockholm. Romance, terror, and a succession of shocking surprises await Grace-and the reader-as the pieces of the puzzle gradually fit together. WAITING FOR WILLA bristles with the kind of foreboding suspense Dorothy Eden's many readers have come to expect from her.",
