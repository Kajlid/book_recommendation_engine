  "title": "Carly's Song",
  "description": "Carly Richards had come to New Orleans to escape her painful past. She certainly had no intention of getting involved with some reckless musician with an overzealous approach to living and an all-too-real lust for her. Sam Canfield was simply the sexiest man she'd ever seen, but Carly was determined to resist being mesmerized by his sensuous spell.Sam thought he'd seen it all in his day. But one enchanted evening, his world was turned upside down when a redhead with lilac eyes stumbled into his path, and an old friend he'd thought long gone made a magical appearance on a misty street corner. Soon, the handsome sax player found himself conversing with an elusive angel, struggling to put his life together, and attempting to convince the reluctant Carly that together they'd make sweet music of their own.",
