  "description": "Newbery Medalist Virginia Hamilton tells 24 stories that kept her ancestors' culture alive during slavery, from spirited animal trickster tales and robust tall tales to spine-chilling tales of the supernatural and moving narratives of slaves in search of freedom. Twelve of these tales are on the 78-minute CD, including the hauntingly beautiful title story, \"The People Could Fly.\" Booklist praised the recording as \"an outstanding and most welcome production that both complements and extends the original work.\"",
