  "description": "For the hardback, see ISBN13: 9781534416970.Twins Cameron and Cassia Kuhn have never known their parents. They’ve been told their mother died, but their father’s fate remains a mystery. Cass is certain their father abandoned them, but Cam isn’t so sure. He wants to prove her wrong; he must, because they need a father to help them battle the surgeries Cass faces due to her spina bifida, and to lend their Oma a hand in taking care of them. Cam’s wish is granted while walking home from school the last day before winter break when he sees a sign—a glistening, golden sign with elaborate flourishes, that reads: The Hotel Between. And so the adventure begins. With doors that open to countries all over the world, magical trollies, corridors that can be transported across the globe on a whim, stone elephants that turn to life, sweets made from rocks; everything is possible in The Hotel Between. But this is no vacation. Cam has a hunch that the coin his missing father left behind is the same coin given to staff and guests at the hotel. His father is somehow connected to this magical place, and may even be lost within its hidden halls. But every journey has its risks, and The Hotel Between is full of secrets. Cam must learn who to trust as he braves the world in search of his father and finds his own destination. Publication is planned for fall 2018.",
