  "title": "The Gentleman Bat",
  "description": "Join the charismatic gentleman bat on a night time stroll down cobblestone streets where the town is lively and energetic.  Along the way he meets his lady friend. Dancing and merriment fill their evening until the weather takes a turn.  But not to worry, when you're called the gentleman bat, you always come prepared. The Gentleman Bat is an original story with a timeless appeal. While it takes place in the Victorian-era, it has the universal appeal of two friends, or perhaps more than friends, enjoying a walk together.  But what really sets The Gentleman Bat apart are the illustrations. Piotr Parda's watercolor and bamboo pen and ink paintings are meticulously crafted. The Gentleman Bat is sure to become a favorite book for children and the adults in their lives.",
