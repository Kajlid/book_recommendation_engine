  "description": "Twin brothers. Best friends. Hol and Sel Danner enjoyed a near-idyllic childhood in the small town of Frederick, Maryland before the Civil War. Going to school, camping in the mountains, discovering girls, falling in love…the boys are connected by an almost mystical bond. The two share more than a face and a shape. They share each other’s thoughts.But the specter of slavery hovers at the edges of their otherwise carefree lives. As the nation divides and prepares for war, Hol and Sel are divided from each other for the first time in their lives. Separated by different ideals, they choose to enlist on opposite sides of the Civil War. The Danner twins’ journey through this bleak chapter of American history is the story of two young men fighting their way back to their home, to the women they love, and to each other.",
