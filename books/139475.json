  "description": "Will an awkward first impression...\nThe last thing Chloe Russell expects from life is a successful match. After all, when a girl has been dubbed \"Miss Bumblebroth\" after a disastrously clumsy debut season, landing a handsome, titled husband is an unprecedented stroke of luck. But marriage to Lord Michael Lyndon--a true Corinthian if ever there was one--may prove more vexing than a spinster's fate. For while Michael is determined to rescue her from her regular faux pas, Chloe wonders who will rescue her vulnerable heart from her husband's charm.\n...Lead to lasting love?\nMichael still can't understand why his father presented awkward Chloe as a possible bride, yet with no illusions of romance, he believes one woman will serve as well as another when it comes to matrimony. Unfortunately, Chloe doesn't do anything well, a situation Michael vows to correct. But Chloe's lively spirit needs no encouragement, and soon Michael wonders if his wife is saving him instead--from a lifetime without the surprising joy of her love.",
