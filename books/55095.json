  "description": "Midnight Louie is back!...along with the human the black tomcat condescends to spend his days with: Temple Barr, a redheaded publicist whose love for expensive shoes is matched only by her affinity for trouble.This time trouble shows up on her doorstep, in the form of a boyfriend previously gone missing...during a murder investigation. No fool she, Temple decides it's time for a break. A romance writers' convention--complete with a male-model Incredible Hunk pageant--sounds like just what the doctor ordered.Unfortunately, a pair of dazzling Cinderella shoes goes missing, one of the would-be Fabios ends up dead, and Temple's investigations into the matters get more complicated--and more dangerous--than she planned.Luckily, there's a smart and smart-mouthed cat prowling around.",
