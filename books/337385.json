  "description": "Start off your day with George and Martha, the most lovable hippo friends around! George and Martha discover the importance of honest communication—and that sometimes it’s better to let your best friend sleep in rather than bring their bed along to the picnic. A man with a talent for friendship, James Marshall defined its very essence in his stories about the world’s two best friends. Each of these five brief tales is filled with humor, and James Marshall’s drawings are guaranteed to spark feelings of empathy, delight, and self-recognition.",
