  "description": "Seth Lorcan thrived on undercover work and he was good at it. But his latest assignment brought him dangerously close to the edge--and made him a target, from both the bad guys and the good. And if he didn't act fast, all the information he'd risked his life to obtain would be gone, just as quick as the memory card could be destroyed. What he needed was a ride out of there...even if he had to take it. Carjacking--carborrowing--was his only option. But Seth got more than he bargained for when he took Alessandra Brockman...that was for sure.Al wouldn't let him hurt her or anyone else. Especially when she realized just exactly who Seth was.",
