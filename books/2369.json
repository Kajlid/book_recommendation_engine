  "description": "Jamie McKelvin is Alpha Prime, king of the shape shifter wolves - and alone. Driven by dity, honor and the heritage of Alpha Primes, he's long since given up finding the one female who is his. Emma's dark history has given her a beautiful daughter and the horrifying discovery that humans are not alone on earth. The last thing Emma needs is a complex anybody, much less a dominant Alpha King. Even if she wasn't his biological mate, he'd love her gentle heart, brave soul and intoxicatingly full figure. Claiming a reluctant mate is difficult - keeping her, the most dangerous thing they will ever do. Emma and her daughter are unwitting keys in an ancient battle for power. Ensuring their future will require a horrific price. Jamie is prepared to pay with anything except Emma. Her trust in him as Master is the one thing that can save her, and Jamie will stop at nothing to acquire it, even if the cost is losing her ability to love him. Grimly he clings to the belief that mate bond is the last wildcard even the fates can't control.",
