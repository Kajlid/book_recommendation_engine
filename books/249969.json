  "description": "What happened to Jennifer Havel that turned her into info-terrorist and media-slut Jennie 2.5, heroine of the internationally-acclaimed graphic novel CHANNEL ZERO? CZ: JENNIE ONE tells the story as she drops out of art school and builds her socio-political consciousness during one of the most turbulent and violent periods of American history... the passing of the Clean Act and the loss of free speech. Artist Becky Cloonan puts the perfect images to Brian Wood's story: a perfect complement to the original Channel Zero but with a style all its own. A must-have for even the most casual Channel Zero fan.",
