  "title": "Intuition Magic: Understanding Your Psychic Nature",
  "description": "Most of us have experienced bursts of intuition or “paranormal” events. Are they all products of imagination or confusion? The truth is that we all have psychic abilities. We simply have to accept their validity and learn to use them properly. Linda Keen’s unusual experiences began when she was a child. For years, she kept her secret world to herself for fear of rejection and alienation. But eventually she found companions who validated her experiences and helped her to refine her abilities. In Intuition Magic, she discusses how she developed her abilities to such a level of mastery that she eventually co-founded the largest school for psychic abilities in the Netherlands. Linda has placed a great deal of her teachings in this book. Here you can learn the power and magic of your own intuition, following her step-by-step instruction. You’ll discover how to read and adjust auras, protect yourself from “psychic noise,” get grounded, maintain healthy chakras, and apply your new intuitive skills to everyday life. Intuition Magic is designed as a road map to assist the seeker within this immaterial world of intuition and spirituality. You know you are ready. Enjoy your journey.",
