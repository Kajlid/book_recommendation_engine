  "title": "Knight In Medieval England 1000-1400",
  "description": "The author draws on fresh research for a new interpretation of the actual role of the knight in England during the middle ages. The knight underwent a process of evolution from a mounted warrior of modest means to an important member of the medieval hierarchy, with important local administrative functions in addition to military duties.There was an underlying sense of danger about the knight, with the monarchy, the church, and the poet all trying to fix his place in society. The monarchy wanted each knight to be part of a higher noble's retinue, the church wanted to orient him to crusades and disciplined crusading orders, while the poet emphasised adherence to lofty ideals.For those interested in the visual splendor of knighthood, the book is extensively illustrated with medieval seals, sculptures and manuscripts, including over 100 coats of arms in full color.-- Fascinating account of the knight's actual role in medieval society.-- Explanation of the relationship of the historical knight to the fictional knight of Piers Plowman, Canterbury Tales, and other literary works.",
