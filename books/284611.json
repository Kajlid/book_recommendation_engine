And now my enemies have left me with a horrible accusation hanging over my head, using so many tricks I can barely defend myself.If I want to clear my name and keep my freedom, I have to turn to the guys who once made my life hell. They've changed their tune and made amends, but how far can I really count on them? Especially if they discover that my greatest foes are within their families.I'm going to have to find out. The truth can't stay hidden forever. But no matter what the villains in the university and beyond it throw at me, I won't give in. I'm the last of the Bloodstones... and hanging onto that role may be the only way I can save everything that matters to me.*Horrid Charms is the fourth book in a university-age paranormal academy series. Expect magical villainy, a tough heroine who bends to no oneâ€™s will, a dollop of steam, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance where there'll be no choosing required.*",
