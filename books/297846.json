  "description": "An LGBTQ Post-Apocalyptic Romance“Kid has a point, though. You’re not worried about bringing a strange man home?”Alison gave him an unsmiling look. “Just don’t try anything.” Her free hand clutched the knife at her belt. “You wouldn’t be the first man I’ve ever gutted.”When a stranger finds his way to their camp, Alison is wise to be wary. She can't be too careful in the devastated world they've found themselves in after the Fall. She had the children, Manuel and Tammy, to consider. Dangerous animals and raiders were the norm these days and protecting their livelihood was her top concern. She put all her effort into surviving; rebuilding the semblance of a normal life for them.Still, there was something about the newcomer that Alison just couldn't place. The gentle tone when he spoke. The way he moved. Especially the way he looked at her from under his long lashes. It all brought back memories and emotions she hadn't experienced in quite some time. She couldn't just turn him away when he needed their help.And in the end, she might not admit it, but deep down, the way his attention made her feel was enough reason for her to not want him to leave. >>>Immerse yourself in a short story of a burgeoning new Earth...and new love.
