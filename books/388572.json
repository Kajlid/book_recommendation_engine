  "title": "The Buddha Said...: Meeting the Challenge of Life's Difficulties",
  "description": "Osho, one of the best-known and most provocative spiritual teachers of our time, presents The Sutra of 42 Chapters—a scripture compiled in the first century C.E by a Chinese emperor. Using wonderful anecdotes throughout, Osho weaves his own unique insights into this profound ancient wisdom and expands its meaning for our time. As we travel with the Buddha on a path of radical wisdom, we’ll laugh or shake our heads at the folly, the ineptitude, or the goodness of the characters in the stories—and gain knowledge and understanding at the same time. Osho engages us at every level to help us experience the Buddha’s teachings and take in their timeless truths. A powerful, inspirational gem of a book.",
