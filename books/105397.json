  "description": "During a small-town skirmish, Would-Be Witch Tammy Jo Trask foils a kidnapping plot with a spell that shrinks her nemesis, Jenna, to a doll-sized diva. When the reversal spells to restore Jenna’s size don’t work, Tammy Jo and gorgeous wizard Bryn Lyons are forced to turn to the ghost of a Victorian-era prostitute who haunts Galveston Island.Since Sullied Sal only appears to tourists during the yearly celebration of Dickens on the Strand when Victorian food, fare, and fashion are once again the norm, Tammy Jo and Bryn join the festivities. Unfortunately, being squeezed into a corset is just the beginning of the trouble in store for Tammy—and the island—when Tammy Jo and Bryn seek the advice of the gaudy ghost.",
