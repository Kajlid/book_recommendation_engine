When he is hired as a dance instructor by Jessica at Sean Callaway's Ashbury Studios, he is ready to get to work, even though his mind is focused on only one thing: helping out his brother. Melanie Dover is on the brink of a major pop star career as her alter ego, Melody. Although it isn't the type of music she loves most, she's willing to do anything to be in the music industry. With her ambitious father by her side, she's ready to take on the worldâ€”if she could only learn the dance steps to her songs. When Austin and Mel meet, the sparks that fly are not left to fizzle on the dance floor. But with each of them running towards goals they are not sure of, can their path to love ever align?",
