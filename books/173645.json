  "title": "The Story Between Us: Living and Relating From Being",
  "description": "This book is a map of the 3 'worlds' that make up our reality - physical, stories and being, and a guide to navigate between them.The book uses simple language and doesn't require knowledge or beliefs, yet it's not meant for everyone, only for those who want to 'see' and be 'seen' beyond the masks of personality.Who am I? describes the path to knowing yourself, healing and releasing your past to enter the world of being, and what you gain and lose by the exchange.Who are you? describes the shared dance of 'seeing' and knowing another, and how to link as independent beings, and Who are we? is a 'language' of sharing being in a group.If you have no choice and simply 'must know', then read it, and breathe :-)",
