  "description": "Libby Carmichael has just met her Soulmate. It’s just too bad he’s behind bars.When you only see the world in black and white until you meet yours, it's pretty easy to figure out when you’ve found your Soulmate. What Libby can't figure out is why fate,destiny, or the powers that be have decided that Andrew McCormack is her one, true match. Libby is smart, organized, and always has a plan for what's coming next. So when she sees Andrew for the first time and her world is instantly filled with color, she's thrown for a loop.Namely because he's in a dingy grey jumpsuit.And handcuffs.And being booked into a juvenile detention facility.Surely a boy who's been convicted of a headline-making, violent crime isn't who she’s meant to be with. There's no way she belongs with someone like that...right?",
