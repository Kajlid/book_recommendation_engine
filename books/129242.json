  "description": "Gregori's last mission is to save Earth from the demons threatening to take control. He doesn't care if he survives as long as he averts the impending apocalypse-until he meets Adelita, a human refugee, whose spirit and determination give him a renewed reason to fight. And live. He's falling for her, despite the fact he's told her nothing but lies and there can't possibly be a future for them. Adelita can hardly believe the archangel Gregori, sent to save mankind, has lost his faith and his edge. After he saves her from a demon attack, she vows to help him recover both by any means necessary. But can she keep her own faith when she learns the truth about who and what Gregori really is? The Maelstrom Chronicles series is best enjoyed in order.Reading Book #1 AngeliBook #2 Traitor",
