  "title": "Literary Feminisms",
  "description": "It is now almost inconceivable that students of literature can pass through universities without encountering the feminist revolution in literary theory and criticism. Feminist literary theories are pluralist, borrowing from other types of theory, such as marxism or postmodernism, but they always remain woman-centered. Courses in women's writing, literature and gender, and philosophy and literature proliferate--requiring readers to reconsider many of the basic assumptions on which the study of literature was originally founded.",
