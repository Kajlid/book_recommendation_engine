  "description": "Much of the flaws that afflict the individual and the community stem from the singular defect of Anger. Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He). and His Messenger (Peace be upon him) have given us instructions regarding the malady and advised us to keep it in check. This work is an extensive discussion on these instructions. We hope that this concise work will aid the one who is afflicted with this flaw to find cure in, Insha Allah; while the one who is free of it will find enough incentives to keep his emotions under control.",
