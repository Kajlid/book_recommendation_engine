  "description": "The magical world calls to me but I want nothing more than to heal.  Working in the ER gives me a chance to help people while hiding from the magical world. It’s a place where few magical folk ever visit, and never by choice.  When a patient comes into the ER with a magical injury, I’m forced to use my magic to heal, but doing so draws the wrong kind of attention to me. This time, I doubt Aron can help, especially since I know my type of magic isn’t dark magic at all.  It’s worse. Much worse.  Wanting nothing more than to hide from my powers, I’m thrust into the center of a budding war between factions of mages. The Dark Council wants to use me, but I worry as much about the mage council discovering what I am. They’ll do worse than burn off my magic. They’ll be forced to kill me.  With my work suffering, I have to find a way to end the magic attacks, or I might not only be forced into the magical world, I might lose my job.  Postmortem is a fast-paced fantasy mystery with a mixture of medicine and magic that will leave you breathless.",
