  "description": "In the horror show of Gods and Monsters, Eden Ryel was the star. Conceived of her mother, a Merovingian--a direct descendant of Christ--and her father, the half-human son of a fallen angel, her very existence had prompted The Great War. Prophesied to be the Keeper of the Balance, Eden struggles to realize her purpose.  Levi, the overconfident and charming half-human son of Lucifer takes nothing seriously. Not even when he finally meets the young woman who is destined to end his existence. A common bond is formed under the pressures they face from both sides, but their respective religious texts predict opposite outcomes. Either way, they must choose: war, death, or love.",
