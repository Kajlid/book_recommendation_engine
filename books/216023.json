  "description": "This journal is for family and friends of people suffering from long term, chronic illnesses. Caregivers of such patients often experience their own illnesses as a result of giving all of themselves to their loved ones. Stress, physical exhaustion, depression, changes in mental and physical health, and many more things are often side effects that come with caregiving. This journal will help caregivers with having a safe place to express their challenges, fears, and hopes. It offers prompts that will encourage a caregiver to think about caring for themselves in the same way that they are caring for the people or person they love.",
