  "title": "The Persian Woman",
  "description": "THE FIX WAS IN . . . until a tough Navy SEAL and a beautiful Muslim FBI agent put aside their differences and take on corrupt politicians, lazy law enforcement, and a fearsome jihadist to save millions from a deadly bio-terror attack. From the mean streets of Tehran to the dusty back roads of Texas, The Persian Woman takes you across a noir landscape of jihad, bio-terror, and forbidden love, and perhaps even gives you a glimpse into the secret world of angels and demons. Torn from today's headlines, it is a thriller for our time, and a love story for all time. \"The best book I've read all year,\" says one reviewer. Get this book now and find out why. And be sure to check out the acclaimed \"Official Trailer\" for The Persian Woman at thomasbookerwriter.com, where you can also learn more about the author.",
