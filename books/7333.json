  "description": "Lyn Taylor, Taylor's Outfitters and Guides, loves her job, but doing a job in a man's world as a woman was becoming increasingly difficult -- not easier. Gaining the respect from men she guided on hunting trips in the Idaho wilderness in the late 1970s was practically non-existent. Engaged to a lumber mill owner who decimated the land around her home and family business was getting very old and breaking off her engagement was the right thing to do she had decided. She had also decided she hoped she never met another controlling, demanding man again, let alone a lumber mill owner. Nic Randall, Randall Lumber of Montana, is sent by his father to the Idaho wilderness to scout the area for its timber before it is available by the Forest Service to bid on it. The best way to scout the area is to hire Lyn's guiding business, but when Nic meets Lyn and finds out she's their only choice for a hunting guide, he's ready to call off the whole thing. Women don't know how to hunt! Women don't know how to keep quiet when out hunting! Women need everything but the kitchen sink at the camp site and they don't like bugs in bed with them. And Nic adheres to this philosophy of his, but he can't back out of the hunt, so he has no choice but to use Lyn's business and eventually comes to realize Lyn is not your average, ordinary woman. After a few fights and feuds over whose territory is whose, they eventually come to realize that not only do they love their jobs, but fall in love with each other as well.",
