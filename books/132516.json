  "title": "The True Story of the Three Little Pigs",
  "description": "A contemporary classic celebrates its 25th birthday. Twenty-five years in the Big House and A. Wolf is still sticking to his story: he was framed! As for that huffing and puffing stuff? A big lie. A. Wolf was just trying to borrow a cup of sugar to make his poor old granny a birthday cake. Who should you believe, the pigs or the wolf? You read. You decide. A quarter-century after publication, with over two million copies sold, The True Story of the Three Little Pigs remains as funny as irreverent as the inventive minds of Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith. Viking is celebrating this landmark anniversary with a handsome gift edition, featuring a stunning new jacket with lots of silver. And there's a surprise inside as well!",
