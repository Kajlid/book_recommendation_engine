  "description": "Recovering from a tragic accident I found recalling my past was my answer. When I was ten it was a magical time when I was given a chance by my grannie to have one wish come true...for a little while. I found Evernow, a realm between time and no time where only those who die with a pure heart can go. I was invited. There I discovered my true heritage, the power in a silver necklace, why there is no magic in our world and how evil can come to even the perfect places, but still be defeated with the help of a child. But we have to grow up, even if the perfect life we experienced has to be left behind. Let me tell you of my adventure during the summer when I was ten and you, too, might become a believer in magic once again. My only wish is to return and remain forever. Madison's memory reveals a fantastic world she entered to rescue her Grampy and return a necklace to the rightful owner. But ill intent found this sanctuary created for all magical creatures. Its good light can burn evil, so protection is conjured from the lost essence of the purest of creatures - unicorns. And an elf prince is held captive as ransom for the object of real power the realm was illegally entered to recover. Only the child can enter the lair to free the prince, but she has a lot of help and protection, and it is they who are in most danger. Quote from book: I kept going back for a long time, every chance I could during our stays with Grannie. I was sure it was a special place for something special to visit for me to see. And, finally something did.",
