  "description": "[Siren Sensations Erotic Alternative Contemporary Consensual BDSM Romance, M/M, some spanking, HEA] Noah's deep in the closet partially because of his high-profile job, but mostly because of his ultra-conservative family. He's never been with a guy before, until a night at the Toucan resort with Jackson turns his world upside down in the best way possible. Except a work emergency calls him away before he gets Jackson's last name...or phone number. Jackson doesn't know if the cutie ghosted on purpose or through a simple misunderstanding, but at least he has work to focus on. Except now that Jackson's had a taste of Noah, he wants more--wants all of him. After a chance encounter in the unlikeliest of places, Jackson knows he's willing to do whatever he must to convince Noah this could be for life. Except Noah's family is a problem and could cause problems for both of them. Can Jackson convince his boy to trust him to fight for their love, or will Noah's fear drive them apart?",
