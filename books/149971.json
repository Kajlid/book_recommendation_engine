  "description": "We were introduced to Ana Molotov, aka “Sandy” in Kill on Command, where she manipulated, lied and intimidated everyone that got in her way - if that didn’t work? She just killed you. Not the kind of girl you bring home to meet Mom. But what if she was? Now meet Ana Molotov. With dreams of one day being a coach and a teacher, she’s a month away from graduating from Yale. Her plans of heading back to her home in California are derailed when her involvement in a tragic accident attracts the attention of rogue CIA operative Robert Waters. Waters threatens her and her family and gives her a choice that’s a no win situation for her – work for me or see your father die a grizzly death and find yourself in jail. Waters pushes Ana into a dark world where she struggles to cope and to survive. It’s a world where Ana Molotov doesn’t stand a chance. Enter Ana’s coping mechanism, “Sandy”. Sandy not only manages, she thrives and dominates. However, the longer Sandy is at the forefront, the more it is killing Ana.",
