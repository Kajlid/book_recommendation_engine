  "description": "There’s a dark new trend in Tokyo’s fashion industry and it has nothing to do with little black dresses.For three models sharing an apartment in Japan’s megacity, life couldn’t be more different. Jess can’t wait for the summer to be over so she can finally leave the business behind forever. Blake can’t wait for the week to be over so she can get back to partying at the latest trending nightclubs. And Hailey can’t wait for this casting to be over so she can cuddle up in a ball and cry. The only thing they have in common: no one wants to think about those dead girls. All plans are put on hold when Jess, Blake, and Hailey are selected to compete for an exclusive campaign that will transform one of them from commercial nobody to international ‘model of the moment’. Of course, nothing is ever what it seems in the fashion world. As the trio embarks upon a series of bizarre challenges, they are forced to confront their deepest secrets and ask questions they don't want to know the answers to...like who really killed those girls? And are they going to be next?\"While reading it I had this feeling that someone was looking over my shoulder & following me everywhere I was going.\" - The Cozy Little Book Nook\"Chanel no 5- scented fodder to a fashion-obsessed mind like mine.\" - Up Close and Literal \"A rollercoaster of confusion and terror…Every time I thought things couldn’t get any stranger/creepier they did...\" - Reading With Wrin",
