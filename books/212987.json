  "description": "Leah, Raff, and Belle have been raised in separate “foster-homes” until they turn fourteen. On that day, the law states they must leave everything for an unknown future. When they are magically transported to another world, they discover not only each other, but a prophecy that has waited 1000 years for their arrival. To fulfill the prophecy, they must find and reunite three missing pieces of an ancient amulet, and in the process learn to control and use their unique Gifts. Dark forces conspire to prevent the resurrection of the Amulet, and the journey becomes one of survival. Turning fourteen was NOT supposed to be this hard!So, you've read the blurb...what else can I tell you? Well there are flying horses, battles with monsters, good guys, bad guys, and some pretty weird but lovable minor characters. And of course, being a story about young teenagers, there might be a slight crush or two going on.I hope you grow to love these kids half as much as I do, and that you are eager to read more of their adventures in The Children of When - Valleron, the soon to be released 2nd book in the series.",
