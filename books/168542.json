  "description": "Tonight wasn’t about love, it was about greedy desire. \nWhen tennis star Jo Parker-Barrow meets MMA fighter Zane Ryan at a US Open party, she has no idea who he is. She just knows he’s handsome and sexy. Throwing her usual caution to the wind, Jo allows herself one hot night with a stranger.\n\nBut Zane doesn’t want to remain a stranger. He pursues Jo until she can’t say no, but neither can she say yes. She’s had her fill of men who take risks for a living, and Zane is a mixed martial arts fighter at the top of his sport. Can Jo love not only the man but the fighter as well?",
