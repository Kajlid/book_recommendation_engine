  "title": "The Song Remains the Same",
  "description": "The Song Remains the Same spans two generations in Detroit and chronicles the coming of age of its mother and daughter main characters. Shaped by the historical, social and political climates of their times, the women grapple with the realities of friendship, love and loss, and the beauty of finding meaning in the midst of the complexities of being alive. Two very different tales unite to create a forceful multi-generational novel that shows that throughout time and despite many seeming disparities, there is a similarity to every generation and an inherent humanity to all experiences.",
