After her attempts to escape cast the pair adrift and into a series of near-death situations, Lola realises she's never been so scared in all her life. Her only hope of getting out alive rests with sexy, dangerous Max. But trapped on-board with Lola, his mind's soon on other things... With everything hotting up in more ways than one, is Lola Carlyle about to reveal all?",
