  "description": "I picture myself differently to the woman cringing in the mirror. The years have found my face, cream cakes everywhere else, but with house and husband as my only treadmills, why am I surprised? The girl I once was has silently slipped away and now I exceed average only in ways I don’t want to. When did all that happen? Why wasn’t I asked if that was okay?A chance event and meeting a man from fantasies past - finally I am awake to life’s little game. Desire and the determination to live again now fill my days and fuel my nights while my hormones rage in what could be their last hoorah. Just one night might show me everything I need to know. After all, the thrill of the chase isn’t only felt by the hunter.Main ThemesContemporary Woman, BBW, Marriage, Relationships, Mild kink, Discovery of BDSM",
