  "title": "Who's Your Hero?: Book of Mormon Stories Applied to Children",
  "description": "Children's Book of Mormon Picture Book If you think children ages three and up should help more around the house, complain less while doing it, and have the courage to always choose the right, then this book is a must-have! Who’s Your Hero? teaches young children about heroic examples from the Book of Mormon, but even At the end of each scripture story, children will learn a timely, heroic lesson for today. For example, Ammon loves to do chores around the house (just like he loved helping King Lamoni with his horses), and Nephi doesn’t complain when it’s time to go to bed (just like he didn’t complain when his father Lehi asked him to do hard things). Family home evening ideas and activities are also featured. Who’s Your Hero? is ideal for starting children early on to love the Book of Mormon!",
