For the first time Southern whites and blacks are working together. But with the black market, rationing, and the Mafia; Detroit is also a powder-keg. Through this tense world cuts a killer, a self-appointed soldier savaging the defenseless. Lieutenant Zagreb's job is to catch the killer, keep the city from exploding, and save his own troubled soul.",
