  "description": "From International Bestselling author Sana Khatri comes an over-the-top cheesy and sizzling standalone contemporary romance where unwarranted presumptions are made, blood-curdling questions are asked, and washboard abs â€“ yeah, they are drunkenly licked and counted.A broken door.A super annoying and adamant rat.Almost-falls via banana peels.A destroyed phone.And a few wild presumptions.When A-list Hollywood star Gallan Underwood, and graphic novelist Zaira Khan, are trapped inside a trailer, their night turns into a roulette of opportunities, dying dignities, and confessions. Sparks of chemistry allow exploration of a mutual attraction, leading to a bevy of hesitance and truths.Will these two weirdly hilarious souls be able to battle their feelings, their emotions, and everything else that falls face-first into the crazy uptown that is their lives?",
