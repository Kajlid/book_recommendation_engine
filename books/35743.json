  "description": "\"'The Words that Created God tackles the world's weightiest subject with the lightest touch and, in the process, pulls off a near miracle: a fresh take on the most familiar text in the history of the written word. This book isn't just thought provoking, it's revelation provoking!\" Despite the powerful simplicity of the First Commandment-\"I am the Lord, your God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me\"-the moral structure of the Ten Commandments does not come from God. Quite the opposite: without the Ten Commandments, we cannot even conceive of God. The Words That Created God starts with the history of the writing of the Bible. It shows how scholars have clarified the original meaning of the Ten Commandments and then takes the reader on a personal journey, with Moses as the guide, through the individual moral challenges underlying each one. The book finally re-orders the commandments to show their true significance for understanding human social evolution and the moral choices we each make every day. An epilogue looks at a disturbing cycle in history, in which it has so often been the religious faithful themselves who, in the name of God, have violated the Ten Commandments and sent whole nations-starting with the Kingdom of Israel itself-backward toward chaos, immorality, injustice, and indeed, godlessness. It is a book only an atheist could have written.",
