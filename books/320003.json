  "description": "I’ve dedicated my life to slaying vampires. Now I’m about to offer up my blood.When my brother gets into some serious trouble with the Vampire Clan of Baltimore, there’s only one thing I can do to save his ass.I’ll offer myself up as a blood tribute, infiltrate their underground palace, and find a way to get him out. But playing the part of a simpering blood bag is harder than I expected, especially when my first impulse is to stake every vamp I meet through the heart. To make matters worse, I’ve somehow caught the eye of three different vampire men:Bastian, an ancient prince with features as cold as ice and eyes that burn like fire.Rome, a darkly sexy rebel who just returned from a hundred year banishment. And Connor, a newly turned vampire whose lopsided grin is so devastatingly human that I almost forget he’s the enemy. Even though I want to hate them all, they keep getting under my skin in ways I can’t explain. But if I let myself lose focus for even a second, it won’t just be me who pays for it. My brother will suffer too.I’ve danced with the devil plenty of times…But this time, the dance might kill me.Blood Debt is the first book in the Kingdom of Blood series, a reverse harem vampire romance. Warning: the heroine is tough but flawed and the (anti)heroes are sexy and dangerous. If you love books by Jaymin Eve, Ivy Asher, Tate James, Eva Chase, and Kelly St. Claire, then dive right into this dark and twisted world!",
