  "description": "She became the air he breathed. Her passionate gift of surrender matched his dominant soul. Then she was gone. He'd never accepted that she'd wanted to leave. Ensuring she could find her way back to him was the drive that shaped him. Fifteen years later it was way past time to accept she'd chosen not to return.Second chances were wishful thinking. Jill wasn't looking for one. She didn't have time for pipe dreams and she had no illusions about the stranger Holdin had become. Famous, rich and now retired from football, he might not remember her. If he did, he might not care to hear what actually happened so long ago. She desperately hoped she had something he would care about though.A second chance was all Holdin needed. Ensuring possession of Jill was a battle he intended to win.",
