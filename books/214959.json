Bill is married to his wife Susan, a retired teacher, who became a neighbor after both had been widowed. They enjoy an active life which includes traveling in their motorhome with their Tuxedo cat, Mitzy.As a black youth of the post war baby boom generation the author struggled with secret rage and a confused life view that fueled his self-destructive rebellion and desertion from the Marine Corps in 1967. His cross country trek ended in a skid row rescue mission in Los Angeles, Ca. There the 17-year-old fugitive was forced to confront his personal demons.Mr. Ingram's odyssey of rebellion and redemption led to his discovery of life saving and life affirming principals. His introduction to the Primitive Christian practice of Meditation, taught by a Los Angeles preacher and his foundation, began his journey of self-discovery and awakening.The answers to the mysteries of life were never more needed than during our present age of loud and competing voices that pressure and control us. This book is for anyone interested in clues to the true purpose of life. Is there a real moral compass? What is your true Identity? It's for church goers and the unchurched, all religious believers, spiritual seekers, and skeptics.",
