  "description": "Creativity is often thought to exist among a handful of people on earth. This is a false notion, and undoubtedly a main reason of lowered self-esteem among the majority. The aspect of ingenuity, the art of producing something from nothing, the absolute skill of creativity--it all resides in every human being. Then what exactly is it that made Warren Buffet, \"Warren Buffet\", and Steve Jobs, \"Steve Jobs\"? If every man and woman on earth has a spark of creativity hidden inside of them, then what is it that differentiates them from the elite masterminds of the world? This difference will be explored in this book where we will explore their roads to success. \"Success Begins From Where You Are!\" is a book that will prove that all you need is a push to reach the top. It will help you get a kick-start towards the summit you are destined for!",
