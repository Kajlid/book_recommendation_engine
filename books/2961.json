Ever since he's been labeled a \"reluctant reader,\" his mom has pushed him to read \"real\" books-something other than his beloved Calvin & Hobbes.As Derek forges unexpected friendships and uncovers a family secret involving himself (in diapers! no less), he realizes that adventures and surprises are around the corner, complete with curve balls.
