In this tomb--er, tome, many questions will be answered: Who is the newest sensation in Young Adult romance stories? What happens when a centuries-old wizard becomes the target of a hoarding intervention? Where does a vampire go to get a good drink? And what is the favorite sport in Heaven? The answers to these and many other rhetorical questions lie within these pages.",
