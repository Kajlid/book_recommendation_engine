  "description": "Silhouette didn't mean to die.  Becoming a Ghostwalker, however, was a very deliberate decision.  A twist of fate in the lives of children will take them to the High City of Lydia -a place of wonder on the verge of falling apart. Its Queen is threatened by her disgruntled people, and shadows whisper of dark magic in its streets. When Silhouette finds herself in its darkest places, her mission is clear: protect Alyon, no matter the cost.  The Bastard Prince is the sole hope of restoring order to his home. The only problem is he wants nothing to do with the crown. He finds an unlikely friend in Silhouette, never guessing the weight of the secret she carries, or the fact that her life is running on borrowed time. When Destiny comes crashing down on them, further sacrifices will have to be made.  And the promise that saves him will be her undoing.",
