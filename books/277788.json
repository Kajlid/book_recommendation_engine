  "description": "Meet Mimi (Fleming at school/surgery/the butcher's, Mimi Malone at work/dinner parties with attractive men!) Mimi may 'have it all', she has the house, the children, the part-time vanity job, the skinny jeans, and the feng shui guru, but life chez Fleming it's not as cushy as she'd like (husband Ralph prefers the trout stream in Wiltshire to the fast lane of W11). And when Mimi meets Si, the new billionaire on the block, at a sushi party, she soon faces a choice of keeping up, or keeping it real...Then there's her best friend Clare, neatfreak garden designer, deep in bio-panic about her childlessness with eco-architect husband, Gideon.Clare monitors all illicit activity in the private West London compound - from light adultery to heavy building work - and she is watching Mimi as spring turns to summer, and summer to winter...A wicked comedy of manners filleting life on a \"Notting Hill\" communal garden, where lucky residents fall into one of only two social-economic groups: the haves - and the have-yachts...So, take your GBP3m key (it costs that much because if you lose it, you basically have to buy another house on the communal garden to replace it) and enter Lonsdale Gardens, meet the rest of the rich neighbours and see what really goes on behind that famous garden gate.",
