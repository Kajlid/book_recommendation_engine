  "title": "The Wolf Tamer",
  "description": "It isn't the lore that surrounds the hunter, Teon, that leads Kali to him, but the fear and hatred Nash, the werewolf, bears for the hunter who nearly killed him before. The discovery that Teon is a man she could love leaves her torn between fear and hope--the hope that he can save her--the fear that the hunter in him will know her for what she is. Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and some violence.",
