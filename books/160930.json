  "description": "From the editors of Dark Faith, Maurice Broaddus and Jerry Gordon, comes a collection of supernatural crime noir.  You think you're safe. What a joke.  You don't think about the places you pass every day. The side streets. The alleys. The underbridges. All you'd have to do is take a step to the side.  Then you'd know.  The streets are filled with shadows.",
