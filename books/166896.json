Together with her twin brother Charlie, she tackles the challenge of unraveling this mystery. Little do they realize that unlocking the lighthouse's secrets will take them on the adventure of a lifetime, to distant planets, throughout time and the multiverse, and to a place where everything is possible. Together with Charlie, an identical Charlie from a parallel Earth, mysterious Eve, enchanting Ben, and unconventional but endearing scientist Dr. Waldo, can Emma chase down Vik, a man under the influence of an entity called The Void, before he destroys all the universes?",
