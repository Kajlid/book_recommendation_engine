Harmony Evans, once the sweet, gawky teenage sister of his best friend and teammate, has grown into a smart, gorgeous woman with moves he finds hard to resist. But he knows he can't get involved with his best friend's sister--it's guy code. Harmony has always gone after what she wants with single-minded determination, from her independence to her education to her career in interior design. She never expected her youthful crush on Barrett to develop into something deeper. And she's not about to let some ridiculous man rules or her brother stand in her way. When the chemistry is this combustible, lines tend to get crossed. And when Barrett and Harmony's secret gets out, it just might be game over . . .Contains mature themes.",
