  "description": "Mrs. Berlinski, reclusive widow of a famous concert pianist, decides to finally talk to a journalist about her life. But her revelations about a love affair six decades earlier leave the journalist in a quandary, as she can't go public with the information. And yet, she can't stop listening either. Three days later, the journalist is left with one burning question: is Mrs. Berlinski's tale one of great love or great foolishness?  Based on a true story, Interview with Mrs. Berlinski is a many-layered look at love, and the lies we tell ourselves and each other in the name of it.",
