But the team's new addition may have to work for a warm welcome. . .Defenseman Devin Miller has bounced from team to team and city to city, but he's finally ready to settle down—professionally and personally. The Warriors seems like the perfect fit. Now all he needs is the right woman to start a family with—and he's willing to put in the practice to find her. Sports anchor Carla Sinclair already doesn't like Vancouver's hot new acquisition. So when she's persuaded to interview him, she's not prepared for the chemistry between them. But though Devin seems eager to show Carla his moves—on and off the ice—he keeps his personal life off-limits. Frustrated by him in more ways than one, Carla decides to track down Devin's secrets on her own—and soon must decide if their attraction is worth the hit to her fragile heart. . .96,000 Words",
