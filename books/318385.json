In this stranger than fiction true story, Carl Katz contends for survival against a relentless enemy.“The story is wild… [it]sounds like fiction, but it is all true… a reality that might seem too strange and too crazy for us today,” Leo Baeck Institute, New York, & Berlin.“Meticulously researched and superbly written… an enormously important contribution… [and a] potent antidote to the increasingly prevalent distortion of history…” World Jewish Congress.In this much anticipated sequel to the bestselling, Roses in a Forbidden A Holocaust Love Story, Never Enough follows the defiant, German-born, Katz as he navigates Hitler’s Germany.
