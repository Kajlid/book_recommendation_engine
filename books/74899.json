  "title": "Secrets to Writing Well - Volume 1",
  "description": "I'm going to put it bluntly. Not every author who writes well gets published and not every author who gets published writes well. I am going to try and help you write well and hopefully get published too.As Charles Dickens once \"There are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.\"We are going to look first at the elements that go into writing a fictional story; what they are, how to use them effectively and how to put them together to make a good story. We are going to start with a basic story and work on developing it together so you can observe the actual process. Then you can feel free to go off an do one on your own.This volume will cover Setting, Point of View, Tense, Mood, Plot Types, Dialogue and Character Development. It is written by Richard S. Hartmetz, who has had more than a dozen books published and is the CEO of Starry Night Publishing. Richard is a long-time teacher of writing workshops.",
