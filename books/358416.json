  "description": "A 'new world order' is a vision long shared by political leaders, industrialists, and intellectuals around the world. 'Peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law', what a wonderful idea! Strange then, that they have tried to conceal the reality of their vision from the wider public. For over thirty years, the European project was sold to the British people as little more than a benign free-trade agreement, despite the fact most of our new laws originate in Brussels and we are being asked to relinquish most of our independence under the European Constitution.A must read for all free thinking people!",
