  "title": "The Perversions Of Quiet Girls",
  "description": "The Perversions Of Quiet Girls is a semi-autobiographical novel penned by an anonymous author, first published in Paris in 1971. The novel was banned in the United States until a 1981 Justice Department ruling declared that its contents were not obscene. It was also banned in Turkey. The narrator Ashley Dvorak works in the personnel division of the paternal Longacre communications company. Although the narrator's experiences are highly sexual and at times non-consensual there has been some doubt over the years that the novel was meant to be a work of fiction and reads more like a memoir. An Amazon exclusive, enjoy.",
