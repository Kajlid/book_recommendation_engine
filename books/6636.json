  "description": "Sam Adams had the perfect a beautiful wife and son, a job that he loved, and a comfortable home in the suburbs. But a flat tire one Easter Sunday led to the ultimate nightmare.  Now Sam must put his life back together. He rents a small cottage on a secluded country estate.  His new landlord is beautiful, mysterious, and blind. Far from being a helpless victim of her blindness, Evelyn Richmond is playing a strange game with Sam's mind--and soul. What does the seductive and enigmatic Mrs. Richmond really want? Is she merely a bored and lonely woman--or a dangerous sexual temptress? Sam finds himself obsessed with and possessed by this sensuous and unsettling woman, caught in her carefully spun web of dark secrets and forbidden eroticism. Sam Adams has no idea how far Evelyn Richmond will go, beyond what limits she will push him, or where their bizarre courtship will end. Nor will you...If you think that you are beyond surprise, that nothing can shock you...think again.",
