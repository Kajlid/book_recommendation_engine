  "description": "Once a promising legal eagle, heartbroken and unemployed Emily Chung is sent to live with her no-nonsense Uncle Raymond, strange but passionate retired actress Aunt Bridget, talkative oddball cousin Daniel and cunning feng-shui believer grandmother in Penang Island, Malaysia after a devastating incident almost costs her her life. In a bid to help Emily move forward and pick herself back up, Emily’s uncle offers her an internship at Serendipity Sanctuary, a non-profit community food centre for the underprivileged with close ties to the family.What starts as butterflies in her stomach under the rambunctious pastry chef mentorship turns into a cool-headed environment when she meets Michael Kim, the solo traveller volunteering as a pay-it-forward. The encounter unfurls her past clandestine romance with former renowned K-Pop-idol-turned-soloist Edward Ahn and the devastating heartbreak that led her to cast away a strictly confidential fairy-tale chapter, and, her desire to love again.As Emily struggles to contend with her past and rebuild her present, she learns that to get a grip is to find courage and strength in spite of the adversities; by replacing attitude with self-respect—from coping with the bad faith of a long-time friend to a near-death experience, she realises the importance of family and unconditional love. But, will she be ennobled by Edward’s unimaginable return? Or will she be swayed by Michael’s warm-heart and benevolence? Can Emily survive the sweet storm and learn to open up once more to what love and life have to offer?",
