And the last person he wants to do it with is Penny Jones.Fiery, headstrong Penny has zero in common with the cocky, too-hot-for-his-own-good Bishop, and she'd like to keep it that way. But the more Bishop gets under her skin, the more she wants to let him in. And the more Penny lets him see, the more Bishop wants to know this stubborn girl with the killer body and soulful eyes.The simmering heat between them won't go away, no matter how hard either of them tries. Their time together in Alaska may be running outâ€”but so is their resolve for not taking a chance on love.",
