Today of all days, they’re relying on each other for strength. Today they are being presented to the Shadow Falls werewolf pack. It’s law; Ariana and Lizzie have no choice. The werewolves haven't taken anyone in decades and the pair were sure this year would be no different. But as the day dawns, Ariana can't shake the uneasy feeling that something isn't right. Devin, the Alpha, may keep his emotions in check when it comes to his pack, but he can’t help the grin pulling at his lips when he sees his mate. His confident, strong-willed mate, Ariana, doesn’t bow to anyone, but he’s determined to win her over. Betas Caleb and Dom have an even harder battle to fight with their shared mate. Lizie may seem wild and feisty, but she’s terrified and for good reason. They have no idea that their mate has a secret she’s been hiding for years. A secret so dark, she’s never told a soul. But there’s nothing she can hide from her mates.",
