  "title": "Dreamtime",
  "description": "This revised and substantially expanded edition of John Moriarty's first book interweaves fresh songlines and aislings in a work now recognized as a classic of spiritual writing. Mediated by stories and personal excursions in literature, philosophy and sacred texts, and containing a new Epilogue, Dreamtime takes issue with the Cartesian consciousness of a Cartesian world.. \"Although Dreamtime is often thought of as an Australian aboriginal phenomenon, this book posits a European, Christian and Irish Dreamtime, as much cultural as geo-physical. The task of the poet-philosopher, it suggests, is to enlarge our capacity for symbolic understanding, while keeping the path to Connla's Well open and inviting us to inhabit a shared Dreamtime.",
