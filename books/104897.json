The mortals' only hope is that Thor can fulfill an ancient prophecy, but the plan is doomed to fail without help from young Loki. The former Lord of Lies' only chance of success is to utilize all the skills of deceit that made him so hated in his past life...but will he find redemption or damn himself further? And in the war's aftermath, Nightmare is gathering enough energy to rule the world...and the mother lode is inside Loki's mind. Aided by an undead handmaiden and a demon puppy, Loki will risk everything on a scheme so crazy, it could only have been hatched by a god of mischief!
