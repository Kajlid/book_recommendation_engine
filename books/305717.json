  "description": "Prudence Wallflower tours the country, making live appearances. She connects people with loved ones who have passed on. However, her reputation as a clairvoyant medium is failing, and even Prudence has begun to doubt herself. She has never seen a ghost, but receives impressions from the dead. This all changes when the ghost of a detective appears to her in bodily form and demands her help to solve a murder. Prudence finds herself out of her depth as an amateur sleuth, and to make matters worse, she is more attracted to this ghost than any man she has ever met.NOTE. The mystery in this book is 100% solved and completely wrapped up. This is a series, so the romance is not wrapped up in this book. The romance is a continuing theme. Please do not read if you expect the happily after romance to occur in this, the first book of the series.",
