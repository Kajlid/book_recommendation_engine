  "description": "Trapped in a corrupt hellhole with thieves, sadists and killers, Mike didn’t think things could get any worse. He was wrong. When everyone around him opted to do the easy thing, he chose to do the right thing. He chose to stand up.  Several years on, and a new Hell has found him. A virus has infected billions all over the world, turning its victims into vicious zombies. The UK and Ireland have remained uninfected...until now.  Lawlessness threatens to take over the streets as the government does everything it can to keep control. With the city in lockdown and every resource stretched to breaking point, Mike finds himself in familiar territory.  The stakes could not be higher as Mike has to fight for his family’s very survival. His greatest weapon is the will to do anything for the ones he loves, but will that be enough?",
