  "description": "Taming a RogueLady Emmeline Prescott is shocked when Sir Alexander Thornton, the most incorrigible scoundrel in England, suddenly notices she even exists—and starts flirting with her! The dashing cad has a well-earned reputation for carousing that brings a blush to her cheeks, but more distressing still I is the unwanted desire he arouses in her!To win a wager, Alex must win a kiss from an innocent maiden, But first he must get past the giggly girl's chaperone—her straitlaced older sister, Lady Emmeline. And to his dismay, it is the enchanting, levelheaded Emmeline who intoxicates him with her soft sensuality and eminently kissable lips. Yet such a conquest is unthinkable—unless Alex abandons his cherished reprobate ways...and surrenders to his heart's traitorous yearning for a true and passionate love.",
