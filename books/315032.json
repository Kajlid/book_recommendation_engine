After heartbreak and loneliness, she had finally lowered her barriers and allowed a man back into her life. Every day she spent with Gene made her more sure that he was the man for her, the man she wanted to spend her life with.Gene Bain relished the feelings Emily roused inside of him. They hadn’t known each other long, but Gene was already sure that he wanted to take their relationship to the next level. When their ships reunited in Haifa, Israel, Gene was ready with a plan: a plan involving a ring.But despite the love growing between them, Emily and Gene were already married... to the Navy. With new mission assignments in hand, Emily and Gene would find themselves separated again, forced back into danger. Would their love survive, or would they be lost at sea?This is the second book in J.E. Adams’ Always and Forever series. The story can be read on its own, but works best when read after the first book in the series, In the Stars. Across the Sea is a full-length military romance featuring steamy scenes, committed love, and no cheating. Happily ever after is the mission.",
