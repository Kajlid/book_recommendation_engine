  "description": "A second career failure of twenty-eight year old Sammy Loggins marks the beginning of a humorous and painful journey to rebuild his life. While convincing his family that he is desperately seeking new and professional employment, he finds himself secretly building a business that surprises even himself – as a truth-teller in The Reflectionary. The truth telling craft is easier for Sammy to preach than to practice while he and his dysfunctional family begin unlocking secrets from the bedroom to the boardroom. Even the state of Texas is not big enough to handle the personalities, comedic tragedies and sexual adventures that lie within. The ending is sure to leave readers laughing, cringing and begging for the next book in The Reflectionary series.“In his first published book, author B. T. Thomas brings Sammy Loggins to life in a hysterical and lamentable comedy that will evoke laughter, tears and some squirming/cringing. Readers will experience Sammy’s moments of joy and happiness, pain and sorrow (as well as explicit sex scenes and some violence) as they join Sammy in his pursuit of truth and love. It is a book you won’t want to put down...and you will find yourself rooting for Sammy along the way.”Show more Show less",
