  "description": "The town of Norbold, England is famous for its low crime rate, thanks to the zero-tolerance policy of Chief Superintendent John Fountain. And Norbold's newest police recruit, Hazel Best, is happy to help keep it that way. But numbers never tell the whole story, do they?Jerome Cardy knew he was going to die. He also knew that it would be made to appear an accident. He might not be able to prevent it, but Jerome was determined to make sure that someone knew what was going to happen―even if that someone was a man with a concussion lying with his dog in a jail cell next to him.After Jerome is found beaten to death by a fellow inmate in another cell, Ash is unable to forget Jerome's last awkward words to him: \"I had a dog once. Othello. That was its name. Othello.\" Certain there is a hidden message in these words, Ash is determined to discover the truth. But it won't be easy―no one believes his account of that night. And Hazel Best must decide whether pursuing the truth is worth her career.",
