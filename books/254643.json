  "description": "-GOOD LUCK ON THE HUNT. Newly-appointed Commander Kalix has been tasked with a crucial mission for the Sarazen race: discover the fates of the remaining human starships, and bring home the survivors—if there are any left, that is… His crew come upon the wrecked remains of the Sestrenka, and the chattering captain’s logs set them on the trail of a human colony established over twenty years ago. Moika, the hope of the starbound human race. But as Kalix and his warriors grow closer in their search, the distress signals show there is something terribly wrong on Moika. Something deathly wrong.  -LEAVE NO SKIN EXPOSED. Alec, Firstborn Moika, is a hardened young woman and the defacto leader of the colony on Moika—because all that remain are she, her sister, and a ragtag band of Moika-born children. The hostile natives who dwell in the water, known only as “Scylla,” have decimated the colony’s population. When all hope seems lost, the Sarazen appear and offer the survivors sanctuary: an end to their suffering, an end to the running, and an end to the killings. A return to civilization. But for Alec, who spent most of her life herding and protecting the colony, it’s a bittersweet rescue. All she’s known is fighting but suddenly the gauzy promise of peace is dangled in front of her. Will the deep anger she feels at being an outsider ever subside?",
