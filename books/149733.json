  "title": "Misunderstood: An Anthology for Those Hiding Behind a Mask of Hope",
  "description": "Being a misunderstood youth in today's society can mean many things to many people. For a parent, it can be a confusing time. We often attribute misunderstandings to their use of technology, in lieu of the imagination that we expressed at their ages. For our children, it can be a frustrating experience. They desire relief form the pains they endure each and every day, whether emotionally, physically, or in secret, yet they fear the stigma of a drug induced cure. This book is about the frustrations, fears, facades, and frailties that our youth is faced with each and every day. It is an attempt to express the power of hope and desire for relief. The contributors within have agreed to share their bravery in the form of pictures and words, reveling the reality behind the mask that our youths wear each and every day.",
