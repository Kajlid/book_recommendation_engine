  "description": "Meet Alexander Baron, a 39-year-old man who has just turned into a 40-year-old man, something that feels, to him, like a major transition, a transformation even. Divorced and unemployed he takes a bus to his hometown; just like he used to, 20 years ago. Take an in-depth look at the processes in his brain, as he reacts to the revealing events of that day. Witness his actions, as the conflict between theory and practice climaxes, in a finale that will leave some smiling... and some not. This is an anecdote about the clash between silent thoughts and loud words; about the battle between conscious intentions and instinctive actions. It’s a story about the conflict between nature and nurture and the struggle between good and bad. “Bus Ride Back” is the first, from the series of fictional short stories, called, “Damn! I’m 40!”ASIN: B01D060KWS",
