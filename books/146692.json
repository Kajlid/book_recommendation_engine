  "description": "Tara is an exchange student from India. After her betrothed's request for her hand in marriage, she works whatever leverage she can to delay the inevitable. The bargain? To allow her to attend university in the United States in exchange for her virginal self as his bride. Four years later, Tara not only resents her upcoming nuptials, but is ravenous for a man who has kindled her carnal desires in the worst way. For the first time in her life, Tara considers refusing her family and fiance's control, and taking full advantage of Rati's gift instead. After all, who is she to deny the Hindu Goddess of Love and her gifts of lust, passion, sexual ecstasy, and carnal desire?",
