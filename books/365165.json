  "title": "Addicted to Twilight: Confessions of a Twilight Mom",
  "description": "Once upon a time, she was a typical \"stay at home\" mom; her one and only preoccupation was her family. Little did she know, a simple twist of fate would catapult her into a world she never imagined herself a part of. A humorous recap of how this obsession slowly took over her life, and in the end, the deeper inspiration she gained from her new preoccupation. This hilarious story of an overly obsessed mom and her overly obsessed friends will provide a light-hearted, laugh out-loud read for both Moms who love Twilight and adult enthusiasts alike. It's not only a fun look at this irrational preoccupation, but theories behind the addiction, the inspiration she gained from it and a tribute to Stephenie Meyer, the author of the saga we all love and admire.",
