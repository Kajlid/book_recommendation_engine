  "description": "A romantic comedy where heartbreak, loss and confusion become the catalyst for happiness via good friends, champagne, a tree-hugging massage therapist and an adventure across outback Australia to the Top End and beyond... Shelley assumed life was normal. Work, husband, Friday night drinks and perhaps some day in the future she envisaged more serious pursuits along the lines of mortgage and babies. However, everything was turned upside down when she found her husband in bed with another woman. Her marriage in tatters, career in peril and her life in chaos, Shelley is forced to accept change. Enter good friends, champagne, a tree-hugging massage therapist and a glimmer of hope that change might not be the enemy Shelley thought it to be. Beginning on the fringes of majestic Sydney Harbour and moving through the coastal regions of Northern NSW and Queensland, Shelley takes the reader on a journey across outback Australia in a story showing that sometimes a woman needs to lose everything to find herself. An adventure of self-discovery, romance, intrigue and a comedy of errors. Everything that comes with Chasing Change â€¦",
