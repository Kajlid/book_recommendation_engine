  "description": "Book thirteen in the Cattle Valley Series After the tragedy at Cattle Valley Days, Carol McGowan woke in the hospital to find George Manning hovering over her. George confessed he'd fallen in love with her, but Carol is skeptical. She knows George is bi-sexual and has been in an ongoing secret affair for years. She's been down that road before and ended up on the wrong side of lonely. Carol learned from her previous relationship and isn't in any hurry to jump back into another m√©nage. George Manning has spent the last nineteen years hiding his love for his closeted friend and country music legend, Trick Allen. After almost losing Carol, George decides to grab hold of the love in front of him, instead of the dream he's always chased. Trick Allen spent years building his career. With the reputation of being a typical love 'em and leave 'em superstar, Trick hid his love for George from the rest of the world. When presented with the choice of losing George forever, or stepping out of the glittered closet he'd become accustomed to, he is faced with the ultimate decision. Is a real life worth risking his career? Three people, with very strong personalities, try to blend love and home amidst a national outcry of vehemence.",
