  "title": "The Lost Gospel Q: The Original Sayings of Jesus",
  "description": "Discover the remarkable teachings of one of the most profound lost Gospels of the Bible, The Lost Gospel Q , with renowned authors Marcus Borg and Thomas Moore.The image of the historical Jesus takes form in the words of the Gospel Q. The Lost Gospel Q represents the very first Gospel, older than the traditional Gospels and written by Jesus' contemporaries. It preserves Jesus' original words â€” the Sermon on the Mount, Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer, parables, and his counsel for a compassionate life. The original of the Gospel Q was lost for 2,000 years, but for the past 170 years historians and theologians have been digging through the many layers of the New Testament to uncover one of the most remarkable lost Gospels of the Bible.",
