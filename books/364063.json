  "description": "Blackmailed into sex. Blackmailed into a love that would turn her life upside down and lead to a world of transforming passion and desire such as she'd never imagined existed—that's what happened to Helene Blanchard the day she went to meet the mysterious stranger at that down-at-the-heels motel. She went in a tough, young executive, and emerged as someone else—someone sexual, sensual, and entirely fulfilled.Helene Blackmailed is the story of one woman's transformation under a man's demanding passion, a passion that respects neither limit nor law in its desire to make her utterly his.More than a simple tale of sex and domination, Helene Blackmailed explores the psychological struggle of a contemporary woman trying to reconcile her worldly independence with her newly discovered desires for the thrill of sexual submission, a struggle in which Helene emerges victorious and even stronger than before.",
