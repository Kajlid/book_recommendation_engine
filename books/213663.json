  "description": "Finn was the type of man that dreams were made of. A charming country boy. Handsome, hard working and loved his mama. Underneath? A freak in the sheets. Raven knew he was everything she wanted. But he was her secret.Raven was supposed to be off limits.Forbidden.That didn’t stop Finn from wanting her, so he took her. After one taste he knew he wouldn’t be able to stop. Everytime she screamed his name an indelible blemish was etched onto his soul. Claiming him just as he had claimed her. What they were doing was reckless which only added fuel to the flames. With each encounter they edged closer to the fire. Closer to disaster. There was no way for things to end well, but there was no way he could stop. Lines get crossed, blurred and scratched down his back as they both give into their Secret Obsession",
