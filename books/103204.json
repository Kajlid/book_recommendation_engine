This fighter is much more than just a cage fighter; he’s the leader of a motorcycle gang. This woman is considered his property, and Caleb ends up leaving the facility with her on the back of his own bike. After a near miss, Caleb takes her back to his apartment because she claims to have no home. He cannot trust her. Especially after she throws herself at him as payment for allowing her to stay in his apartment. Something about her reminds him of his little sister, which keeps him from throwing her out of his apartment onto the streets. But she quickly stops reminding him of his sister.

Worse yet, how do you get your best friend’s face to stop haunting your dreams?*Warning! This book contains adult content that may not be suitable for children under eighteen.*",
