  "description": "Who says a small town is a dull place to live? The logging community of North Branch, Michigan, is still a small town in 1895. But Mabel and Len Williams and their circle of friends could never be called bored. . . Mabel finds that her position as the minister's wife doesn't protect her from small town gossip. After all, isn't it a little odd that Hudson Curtis, pastor of a neighboring church, happens to show up every time Mabel comes to town? And wasn't that his buggy seen turning down Mabel's lane the other afternoon? Even Mabel's best friend, Sarah Jane, seems troubled about somethingâ€”but for the first time in her life, she won't discuss it with Mabel. Good thing Mabel knows she can trust God in the troubled times as well as the good. The Grandma's Attic Novels bring you the story of Mabel O'Dell's young adult years as she becomes a teacher, wife, and mother. Be sure to read all of them! Gifted storyteller Arleta Richardson grew up an only child in Chicago, living in a hotel on the shores of Lake Michigan. Under the care of her maternal grandmother, she listened for hours as her grandmother told stories from her own childhood. With unusual recall, Arleta began to write these stories for an audience that now numbers over 2 million. \"My grandmother would be amazed to know her stories have gone around the world,\" Arleta says.",
