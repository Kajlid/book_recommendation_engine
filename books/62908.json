On his first day of kindergarten he bit a boy hard enough to scar the kid for life. Since then he’s been a social outcast at a New York private school.Through an unexpected turn of good fortune, he lands a scholarship to study in Paris, where everything starts to look up. On the first day he befriends two military brats, and he may finally get a taste of what it’s like to be a normal teenager.It doesn’t last.His host family — an alluring young tattoo artist and her moody, handsome boyfriend — inadvertently introduce him to the underworld of werewolves where there are two types: the born and the bitten. Those born to it take the form of elegant wolves, while the latter are cursed to transform into the half-man, half-beast creatures of horror movies. The bitten rarely survive. Unfortunately, Connor is on the wanted list of a four hundred-year-old bitten human who’s searching for both a cure and a means of wiping out werewolves for good.Connor’s loyalties are tested as he becomes embroiled in a conflict where werewolves, mad science and teen angst collide.RATED T - Teen 13 and up: May contain violence, crude humour, suggestive themes and/or strong language.Alcohol - Reference to alcohol use Blood - Depiction of bloodViolence - Includes scenes of violence",
