As the four prepare to celebrate Christmas without her, Lilli is drawn into a lonely world of memories, forced to confront the horrors of the Nazi persecution she managed to survive. After losing her entire family in the Holocaust, Lilli finds that it is this final death―that of her daughter―that allows her to reach out to the next generation and, with them, forge a unique path toward peace and reconciliation.",
