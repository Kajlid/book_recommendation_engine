  "description": "The Hells Vipers have a rat. Someone is giving out personal information to a rival club, and the rivalry has now turned deadly. Not only are club members being targeted; their families are in the cross-hairs as well.  Nuke, the Road Captain for the Hells Vipers, has a reputation for being a little crazy and a force to be reckoned with. At 6'3\" he's a blonde, tatooed, muscular fighting machine that does what he wants when he wants, and he only wants two things: to find the snitch and possess Jasmine's heart, body and soul.  Jasmine Simmons is a nurse who gets caught up in the chaotic world of the Hells Vipers after doing a friend a favor. Sheâ€™s never met anyone like Nuke before, and she starts to find him irresistible.  She soon realizes, however, that she might be in way over her head when the threats against the club take aim at her.",
