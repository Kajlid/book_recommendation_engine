Swapping rebellion for reserve, she returns to her imposing childhood home, Castonbury Park, seeking her family's help. Penniless Claire needs a sensible husband...and fast!But when the dark gaze of head chef Monsieur Andre catches her unwanted eye, he's as deliciously tempting as the food he prepares.
