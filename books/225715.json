  "description": "This powerful new collection of Yusef Komunyakaa's poetry delves into an age of war and conflict, both global and internal, racial and sexual. \"Sweetheart, was I talking war in my sleep / again?\" he asks, and the question is hardly \"Sometimes I hold you like Achilles' / shield,\" and indeed all relationships, in this telling, are sites of violence and battle. His line is longer and looser than in Taboo and Talking Dirty to the Gods , and in long poems like \"The Autobiography of My Alter Ego\" he sounds almost breathless, an exhausted, desperate prophet. Warhorses is the stunning work of a Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning poet who never ceases to challenge and delight his readers.",
