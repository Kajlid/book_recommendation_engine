  "title": "AmericA, Inc.: A Novel in Stream of Voice",
  "description": "Written in 2007 with uncanny, prophetic accuracy, in this dark comedy the USA has incorporated in 2020 into an oligarchy, or corpor-nation, headed by a President + CEO like Donald Trump. Sub-divided by a great, brick wall into the northern Bluefish and southern Redfish States, AmericA, Inc. is run by President Travis Bash. Perpetually at war, riddled by special interests and voracious for capital, Bash drafts Bob, a destitute Yale poet, to transform America, Inc.'s corporate culture. Bob's job is to market to voter-shareholders the vulgar, bewildering and corrupt culture of this brutal corporate nation to increase share value. Nothing is sacred in corporate America or American culture in this hilarious, cautionary satire about a \"corpornation\" gone berserk in the relentless pursuit of profit. In a blend of high and low comedy, AmericA, Inc. rings true in a witty, merciless lampoon of the omniscient intrusion of the savage greed of big business into culture, politics, law, religion and everyday life. Lentz innovates with an accessible narrative style in stream of voice to bring characters to life by their dialogue. In AmericA, Inc. Lentz extends the literary bloodline of the rich satire of William Gaddis, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, George Orwell, Moliere and Jonathan Swift.",
