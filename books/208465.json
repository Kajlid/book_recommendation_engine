At the age of twenty, Chakliux occupies an honored place as his tribe's storyteller, and is sent to a neighboring enemy village to secure the peace by marrying the shaman's daughter. But a shocking double murder sets the storyteller on an extraordinary journey across the frozen wastes in search of the strange truth about the offenses for which his people have long suffered..and about the hateful, scheming woman who raised him, who may turn out to be his most dangerous enemy.",
