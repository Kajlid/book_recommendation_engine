  "title": "Arrows Across Eons: Becoming Tina Turner",
  "description": "God? Tina Turner? A twelve-year-old kid? Somehow everything is profoundly connected in the most magical of ways. A young Canadian girl resists everything that doesn’t feel right and finds shelter and inspiration in the powerhouse example of Tina Turner. Years later, the grown-up child moves to Los Angeles and literally bumps into Ike Turner, who then delivers her to Zelma Bullock–queen mother of Tina. Coincidence? Not likely. Just the Divine Design at play. Arrows Across Eons: Becoming Tina Turner is a tale of synchronicity in action–a story about coming of age and coming out. It is a chronicle of personal transformation and spiritual uplift, a literary account exploring how we can evolve our consciousness and our conscience–one shimmy at a time.iBooks ~https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/arro...Amazon Kindle ~http://www.amazon.com/Arrows-Across-E...Amazon Paperback ~http://www.amazon.com/Arrows-Across-E...",
