  "description": "The moment she opened those gorgeous red lips to tell me no, she was mine.I was a powerful Russian arms dealer and she was an innocent schoolteacher. If she had a choice, she’d run as far away from me as possible. Unfortunately for her, I wasn’t giving her one. I wasn’t just going to take her; I was going to take over her entire world. Where she lived.What she ate.Where she worked.All would be under my control. Call it obsession.Call it depravity.I don’t give a damn… as long as you call her mine.",
