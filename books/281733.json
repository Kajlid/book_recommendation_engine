  "description": "He was mine for ten years, and now he belongs to Hollywood.  Spencer Lowe, Hollywood’s newest golden boy, has hit the big time. Coming from a small town in England, he never imagined starring in a movie or becoming a household name. Offers from producers come as fast as offers from women.  Indie has been in love with her best friend for years, and their short-lived love affair was the best time of her life, but she had let him go so he could follow his dreams. Now she’s alone, stuck inside a nightmare she keeps hidden.  With the premiere of Spencer’s first movie coming up, he books a ticket for Indie and takes her to LA. She wants to give in to their chemistry and dive back into a relationship with Spencer, but if she does, she risks exposing the family secret she’s been guarding her whole life.",
