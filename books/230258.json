  "title": "Take Me Back",
  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Meghan March comes a hot new standalone second chance romance.   We fell in love on a beach, got married in paradise, and rode off into the sunset. It should have been perfect, but saying “I do” doesn’t guarantee a happily-ever-after. Two years later, I barely recognize either of us behind the walls we’ve built. It’s time to bring it full circle. Back to a tropical paradise. Back to find out if we can still make this work. I’m not willing to give her up, but to save us, I have to risk everything. Two damaged people. Countless secrets. The fight of our lives. We might be broken, but we’re not done.  Take Me Back is a standalone second chance romance, not related to any series.",
