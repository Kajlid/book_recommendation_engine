He follows his intuition to travel far away, all the while fighting to keep his humanity from the wolf's all-pervading instincts.

In this dreamtime, Melody and Connor discover that each is more than what they appear to one another. Trevor has been watching Melody ever since she was a little girl, manipulating and manoeuvring to have her as his own. When she agrees to him courting her, Trevor knows that he is close to realizing his return to full power as one of the Brotherhood. One way or another, he will have Melody. When Melody discovers Connor is real, new questions about her past and her sanity come to the fore. How can it be possible to love a wolf, let alone spend the rest of her life with one, when Trevor is there for her? Can Connor become the man Melody needs in her life? More importantly, does he want to?",
