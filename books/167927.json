Little did she know that her whole life has been spent in hiding from nefarious secret societies and the Royal Navy . . . who are both now on her trail.An adventure woven through an alternate colonial Philadelphia—a world ruled by alchemists who mix magic and science; a world filled with those who would help, and those who would use others for their own dark ends.[A Riddle in Ruby is the first book in a trilogy.]",
