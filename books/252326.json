Until that is Princess Shiloh goes missing, reputedly taken by the psychotic, ultra-violent, city-destroying goblin, Gilfillan, a creature so evil that even the gods fear him.A mad king makes mad decisions and tasks the completely unsuitable Kenneth to recover his daughter - in one piece.Joined by Denton Lightfoot, a musician and sometime dealer in \"information\" who has kleptomaniac tendencies, the two set off on a manic adventure to find, recover and return Princess Shiloh, or die in the attempt.
