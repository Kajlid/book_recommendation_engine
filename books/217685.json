  "title": "The Claiming of Snow White",
  "description": "This is an erotic interpretation of the classic fairy tale of Snow White. Snow White is a submissive young Princess who escapes into the deep woods and is rescued by seven lusty dwarves who train her to be their pet and plaything. Snow White undergoes dark and often BDSM sexual encounters as she slowly realizes that through her complete submission to dwarves and men, she will become the woman she was always meant to be. This is a work of fiction that contains sexually explicit materials meant for those over the age of 18 and contains elements of dubious consent, pet play, dominant male, submissive female, and m√©nages.",
