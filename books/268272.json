  "description": "“Just pretend that the man you wish to marry is standing before you,” the designer instructed Anthea as she waited to model the wedding dress in the grand finale of his Spring Collection. But the man Anthea wished to marry was out there in the salon — with the woman who had taken Anthea’s place as his future bride. Still stunned after being dumped by her fiancé, and with her father recently remarried to a woman who doesn't want her around, Anthea decides to flee to Paris with the hope of making a fresh start. But, too proud to ask her father for money, she struggles to make it on her own. That is, until she decides to spend the last of her money on a new hairdo, and her luck begins to change. Spotted by a woman who works for Florian, the most exclusive fashion designer in Paris, Anthea is recruited to fill-in for a model who recently broke her leg before a major show. Intrigued by Florian, Anthea is soon drawn into this new world. Is it possible she will find romance in the City of Love after all? Mary Burchell was the pen name of Ida Cook (1904-1986).

In 1965, the Cook sisters were honored as Righteous Gentiles by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel. Mary Burchell published more than 125 romance novels in total and helped found the Romantic Novelists’ Association, standing as its president from 1966 until her death.",
