  "description": "LGBT ContemporaryCelebrating \"Coming Out Day\" 2010It's August of 1970, and the friends of 21-year-old Oliver Duncan are having a blast at his bachelor party. Except Ned Surwicki. He isn't an Ivy Leaguer. He doesn't appreciate female strippers. And although he's been Oliver's best friend since they were 14, Ned isn't much inclined to celebrate his pal's impending marriage. Ned is gay, something he's known since he kissed a boy and got the melty tingles. He's also in love with the groom-to-be. Naturally, Ned is miserable.On the night before his wedding, Oliver realizes that he's miserable, too. Who should come to his rescue but best friend Ned, of course.Thus begins a romance that spans forty years, requires one coming-out after another, and survives a broken engagement, a menage with War and Pees, world travel, an ill-advised marriage, scores of fuck buddies, a father who thinks his son is destined to be a clone of Liberace, parents who reject their son, and, worst of all, the failure of two misguided men to pursue their fondest dream.The most important coming-out for Ned and Oliver is summed up in a declaration they spend too many years trying futilely to \"I love you. That's never going to change.\"Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find Male/male sexual practices, menage/moresome (m/m/m/m).",
