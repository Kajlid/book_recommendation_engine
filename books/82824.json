  "description": "One moment can change everything, forever.For Jim Parish, that moment came on an ordinary morning like every other morning in a thoroughly ordinary existence, as he was walking to a bus stop on his way to a perfectly ordinary job. A splash from a passing car driving through a puddle soaked his trousers, stopping him in his tracks. He heard a scream from above and looked up.A jumble of white and blue with flying black hair toppled out of a third floor window, followed by a horrified wail from the woman who lunged out and just missed brushing her fingers against the falling bundle, desperately clutching empty air and leaning out so far that she nearly fell herself. Jim watched with his mouth open; before he could assess the situation he instinctively put his arms out and, to his amazement, caught the child and pulled her safely to his chest.That one moment in itself would have been enough to shake the foundation of any world, but this was no ordinary girl who had fallen into his life. A chaotic storm swirled around this tiny nucleus, pulling Jim into a highly improbable stream of seemingly random events. He would discover love and fear, hope and terrible loss, and learn the immutable lessons of probability mathematics. The chances of the socially awkward Jim Parish becoming involved with a beautiful PhD, an unusual pair of FBI agents, a mysterious government think-tank, and a vicious serial killer and might have seemed impossible; but as Jim learned, any event, however improbable, becomes a near certainty once it has actually occurred.",
