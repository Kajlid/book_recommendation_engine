But nobody has said that life was a calm and orderly it isn't. One isn't a tattered leaf nor a grain of one can, to greater or lesser degree draw his road map and follow it.” —L. Ron Hubbard When one follows these principles and assists others to do so, one’s own happiness and survival can be improved.",
