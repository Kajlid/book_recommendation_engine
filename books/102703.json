  "description": "A Deal with a Devil Story The devil covets more than his soul.... Six years ago, Logan Hart sold his soul to the devil to become the greatest bluesman of all time — and now the devil has come to collect. The irony is that Logan squandered his gift. High on fame, money, and drugs, he ignored his muse and neglected his music. And despite escaping showbiz in a moment of clarity, it’s too late to redeem himself. All that’s left is to try to go out with some dignity. Alas, the prospect of an eternity in Hell isn’t helping much with that goal. But Farfarello, the devil who bought Logan’s soul, isn’t ready to drag him down to Hell quite yet. He’s just spent six years working his ass off to whip a bluesman into shape, and he refuses to let that—or the opportunity for more sinful pleasures with Logan — go to waste. * * * * * * * Word 19,100; page 72",
