Living vicariously through her best friend Claire's perfect life wasn't the plan, nor her ideal. However, Matty learned long ago that it's easier to run and hide from life than to deal with the pain of the post-traumatic stress she’s suffered from since being raped at sixteen.When Claire announces her family is moving, she asks Matty to come too. Having grown up Navy, Matty’s no stranger to picking up and starting over. However, moving half-way around the world to play nanny to Claire’s children doesn't sound like the new beginning Matty yearns for. Nor does she want to leave without first confronting her fears and coming full-healing-circle. She can’t let another decade slip by before she’s able to trust again.Endorsed by Award-Winning Director and Survivor Advocate, Angela Shelton, WAITING FOR PAINT TO DRY is a late coming of age story of what it takes to save and find yourself again.",
