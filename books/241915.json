  "description": "Political propaganda would have us believe vampires are our friends. Fanged teddy bears misunderstood thanks to archaic lore. Activists picket for them to be welcomed into our society.  They claim vamps don't kill. They preach we are safe. They ... are dead wrong.  One year ago a hive slaughtered my family and left me for dead. Found by a team of scientists with their own agenda, I was forged into an unstoppable weapon.  I possess their strength, with none of their weaknesses. I can move among them free from their crippling hunger. I am their greatest threat.  Armed with this arsenal, vengeance will feed my desire to penetrate the seedy underbelly of their fetishized lifestyle and expose them for the monsters they truly are.",
