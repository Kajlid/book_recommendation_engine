  "description": "“Stunning... Youthful angst is rarely portrayed as this terrifying.” —Library JournalDennis Cooper and Keith Mayerson’s boundary-breaking graphic novel Horror Hospital Unplugged is back in a long-awaited reissue. Crystallizing a primal period of creative experimentation for both Cooper, whose Frisk­-era storytelling is at its finest, and Mayerson, whose gritty, unadorned visual style would later explode into color, Horror Hospital Unplugged is a vital piece of underground comics craft. The moody, kaleidoscopic, and sexually charged story of would-be rock star Trevor Machine, and his flirtations with love, fame, homosexual identity, and the disaffection of youth, is a provocative immersion in world of ambition, confusion, and debauchery — and an crucial glimpse at the early creative achievement of two cult icons.",
