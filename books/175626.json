  "description": "Someone was going around setting fires, and they were not the Detective Ben Jacobs is trying to get into my panties kind of fires one would hope for. Weâ€™re talking scorching heat, charred bodies piling up kind of blazing infernos that had the residents of Fathom Lake in a panicked tizzy. When more set of crispy remains were found another date of mine flat-lined as I got called into work, and my secret was revealed. It seemed Fate was going to continue to put her boot right up my butt until I faced facts. There was one man that could put out the fires burning inside me, and he just happened to be the one person I had to avoid at all costs now. Fate, it seemed, was a wicked tease and not at all a fair player in the game of life.",
