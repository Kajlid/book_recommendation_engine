  "description": "\"I was pinned between the two most dangerous things on the island! I was either going to be murdered by the pirates, or eaten alive by the tiger, and right now, I wasn't liking either of those options.\" Robin Caruso is a typical teenage girl, who wants to live anything but the typical life. She longs for adventure and attempts to persuade her parents to allow her to become the youngest person ever to sail around the world solo. At first, they refuse, but after their daughter is branded a hero during a dramatic at-sea rescue, they have little choice but to consent. Months later, the preparations are made, but a last minute injunction is filed to prevent the voyage from taking place and Robin must stage a daring escape before she is able to get underway. Chased by the authorities, at the mercy of nature, modern-day pirates, angry natives and her own doubts, this is truly the journey of a lifetime. Join us for an adventure on the high seas with Robin while she risks life and limb to circumnavigate the globe in her one-person sailboat, learning that true courage comes from within and that living is the greatest adventure of all.",
