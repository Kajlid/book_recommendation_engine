  "description": "When Gabe and Ella Griffin venture out for a day of sailing, terror and suspicion arise when the coast guard finds their boat floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with only Ella on board. Unconscious and in a pool of blood, Ella cannot seem to remember what happened. With the last two hours of her life a complete blank, she seems the distraught wife in search of the truth as to what happened to her missing husband. Or is she? With no body, no witnesses, no murder weapon, and no apparent motive, the police are at a complete loss. On the surface, their marriage seemed picture-perfect but what happened in private, behind closed doors, was anything but. The beginning was the type of love story she'd always dreamt of. Nothing that perfect can possibly last forever, even Ella knew that. What she didn't know was just how short-lived the fantasy would be, nor how dark the reality that would replace it.",
