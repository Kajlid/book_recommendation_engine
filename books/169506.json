Oblivious to this all, Jesse Nolan wakes up to yet another unremarkable day as a Detective in the famously crime free, Los Angeles Police Department. However, thatâ€™s all about to change. As the first murder in living memory is thrust upon him to investigate, inconceivable events lead to previously unimaginable actions, as this futurist utopia quickly erodes in front of him to reveal something much more sinister; Room 39.",
