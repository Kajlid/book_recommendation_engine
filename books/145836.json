  "description": "Sometimes the best relationships have unlikely beginnings. When ex-pat American, Anna Stevenson, is diagnosed with breast cancer her life appears to hit rock bottom. Bereaved, broke and exiled in south-west France, the only solution is a lodger. But she didn’t bargain on scatty British exchange student Lizzie Matthews, and Lizzie didn’t bargain on the grouch queen landlady from hell. Fortunately, a stone’s throw from Anna’s apartment there’s a sanctuary, the magical Jardin Massey, a place where legend has it, angels restore what is lost. Here the present is overlaid with the past. Easy to mistake disorientated 16th century monk, Guillaume, for a 21st century traveller sleeping rough. As Anna seeks support online to come to terms with her disease, a cancer website blog delivers a crushing revelation, brutally thrusting her estranged daughter back into her life. Blighted lives intertwine, each with their own demons to fight, each in need of the restorative power of a mysterious garden that guards its secrets. Guillaume dubs Lizzie’s iPhone ‘the box for summoning angels’ with a medieval take that is truer than he knows. THE ANGELS OF THE JARDIN MASSEY celebrates the modern miracle of technology and the timeless miracle of relationships that make angels of us all.",
