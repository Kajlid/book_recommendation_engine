  "description": "\"Masterfully written... mesmerizing style...\" Marg Gilks, Editor, Scripta Word Services.Psychic Gareth Pugh and daughter Adrianna leap back in time through the minds of others; dead others. Gareth's mission, to reach the beginning of earth time, and confront Earth's God. He's just not too good at getting there. Dead people can be unpredictable. Even dangerous. Adrianna flies with him down the ages, determined to fix their dysfunctional relationship, and to cure herself of her deepest fears.Brutal Dr. Buckleigh picks up the scent, missioned by the elitist Foundation to eliminate Pugh and Adrianna, and any evidence of God and time travel. His flunkey Cabot Greenaway gladly takes up the hunt, sadistically lustful to own Adrianna, in a space/time of his choosing...... But nobody factored in Rasputin, ancient Welsh magic, Stonehenge or Black Holes.",
