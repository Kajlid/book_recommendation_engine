  "title": "A Princess for a Bride",
  "description": "I was born the middle princess of a tiny country in the Alps, which means my primary duty in life has always been to make a good marriage for my family and country. That's why I'm marrying Edward Channing. He's rich, handsome, arrogant, and silent.  Seriously, he almost never talks to me at all.  He might be marrying a princess, but he obviously doesn't want to spend any more time with me than he has to. I have no problem with that. We can live entirely different lives and pursue our own interests. I'm sure we can make this arranged marriage work.  Of course, we do need to produce an heir, but I'm trying not to think about that.",
