  "description": "Every strategy in Camellia Rhodes' plan to conquer the fashion world had been correct, catapulting her up the haute-couture ladder until she finally landed the role of her dreams: editor-in-chief of Flair, one of the top fashion magazines in the country. But the controversial fashion editorials she mandates to garner attention for the magazine prove to be more than a misstep, as numerous long-time advertisers end their contracts with Flair. With the recession taking hold of the economy, the publishing company shutters the magazine, and shuts Camellia out of the organization for good. With no opportunities to be found in New York, Camellia winds up in Markleeville, Michigan, with one lonely street making up the entire downtown and the most popular ladies boutique sporting a regular Panty Bonanza (“All the undies you can fit into a big Ziploc for $9.99”). Just as she is starting to lose her sense of self, Camellia discovers Shelby Jenkins–a tall, willowy fan of Flair and a modeling agent’s dream come true. Camellia is certain Shelby is her ticket back into the arms of the fashion world. But while Shelby is willing, her mom's health issues could spoil Camellia’s grand plan.",
