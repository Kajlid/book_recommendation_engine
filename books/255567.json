  "description": "It's eleven years later, and we're still living separate lives. While I know she isn't comfortable with my lifestyle after everything she’s been through, I can't be without her anymore.    I need her.     She's my wife.  She's my heartbeat.  She's my every breath.  She's my everything.    I want to know every detail of her life. I want to be part of it all. I want to work as hard to get there as she did to get here.    She's always been my girl—even at the age of eight. As I face her now, there's no doubt she'll be mine until I draw my last breath.    It's time for our forever to begin.",
