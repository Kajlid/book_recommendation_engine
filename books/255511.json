The lectures are followed by verbatim transcripts of work Perls did with workshop participants. This Gestalt Journal Press edition includes an introduction by Michael Vincent Miller that explores the political and cultural milieu when Gestalt therapy leapt to the \"theatrical forefront\" of the human potential movement.",
