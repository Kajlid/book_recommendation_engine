The possibilities are endless with just the right, slightly kinky, a bit sadistic, clearly dominant guy.Turns out, Andre is that guy, and the naughty, nasty, natural-born slut, Alysia may see her dreams come true.Is that the end of the story? A happily ever after? Not hardly! Master and slut will be in for a whole lot of headaches and heart aches before this sexy, no-holds-barred BDSM tale finally comes to an end.",
