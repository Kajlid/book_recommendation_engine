At the moment, she’s in Sri Lanka, trying to find Bart, who disappeared two months ago. There’s just one little problem: an untimely fall from an elephant has left her with a very big case of amnesia. How can she save her husband when she doesn’t even remember who he is?This is Allison’s most exciting adventure yet as she tangles with the Tamil Tigers, a group of revolutionaries who are orchestrating a civil war in Sri Lanka and smuggling sapphires out of the country to fund their cause. Then there’s Oz Barlow, who claims to be her husband. Will he tell her the truth and help her find Bart?",
