  "description": "Late one night, while driving home after a shift, Richmond City Detective Brayden Milbourne, finds a man stumbling alongside the road, bloody and confused. Shocking enough to find him; more shocking is that Brayden knows the man. He and Jamie Ketelsen had hooked up during a memorable weekend not long ago.  Fun then, but now, Jamie is a CIA field agent with a major problem. He can’t remember his name or how he got on that dark road. He doesn’t remember Brayden either. The situation only gets more complicated when it becomes obvious that Division P, the government agency that deals with psychic agents, needs to be involved.  Can a man who only has the present connect with a man who might have to arrest him for his forgotten and dangerous past?",
