Though Lily awakens to a morning that seems just like any other in her lonely desert life, she is forced to flee with all haste when her mother Rose is accused of the Anathema. As Lily leaves the only home she has ever known, her mother is full of revelations: magic is real, Lamoranth is dangerous, and Lily is not an Outcast, but a fairy destined to live in the Fae Wood. When a deadly enemy strikes, Lily struggles under the weight of iron, grief, and important promises.

Along with her unexpected companions, the Fae warrior Alder and the ancient vampire Vadom, she will cross the vast expanse of her beautiful but dangerous world, fighting battles both within herself and against the foes who threaten the Fae. Though her mother's secrets come to light at journey's end, Lily knows she can find the strength to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  How far would you go to keep your promises to someone who died for you?",
