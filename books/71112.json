Both are available at all good online distributors.** Finding Esta is a paranormal mystery with an urban fantasy twist! For Luna, each day is not about living and succeeding, but about survival. Luna has never been popular, in fact, even her parents loath her. She can hardly blame them; her psychic issues do make her a little odd and her only friends -- Flo and Ada- are Shadows who exist inside her troubled mind. Although the normal world is all she's known, it's a place where she's never belonged, nor been understood. For Luna, each day is not about living and succeeding, but about survival. That is, until her work as a journalist leads her to investigate the disappearance of baby Esta, snatched from her home over twenty years earlier. Soon, our psychic heroine stumbles upon a series of revelations in a clandestine realm of vampires, weres, and magical alien-supernaturals. Revelations that make her oddities appear perfectly banal in comparison, and obliterate every preconceived idea of the normal world. Her hunger for truth drives her forward. Yet constant physical changes, undefined blood in her veins, heightened power of psychic gifts she's always hated, and an ache to belong somewhere, to someone, all force her to discover incredible things about herself. Things she could never have imagined. Ignorance may be bliss, but the truth will set Luna free, if only she can face it.",
