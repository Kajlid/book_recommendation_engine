  "description": "Step one: add some gasoline.Step two: light a match.Step three: watch the devil’s house burn.As far as plans go, Sandra Moore rather likes hers. It’s simple. It gets the job done. It reduces the devil’s house to smoldering ruins.Life is good—at least for the year she has left of it, assuming the devil doesn’t kill her first.Instead of the quick end and the retribution she deserves, Sandra gets the client from hell for the case of a lifetime, one that could forever change the war between the heavens and the devil’s many hells.",
