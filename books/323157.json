  "description": "Ferin Dekker is wealthy, powerful, and the secret ruler of the mysterious Dracon clan. Lea Venlay is the daughter of his people's enemy, yet she intrigues him to no end. Determined to find out what it is about Lea that captivates him, Ferin spirits her away into the mountains, seeking answers. Lea can't believe she's been kidnapped by a man she's been unable to stop thinking about. But Ferin is Dracon, and if he knew about the books and research she's done regarding his secretive clan, he'd be more apt to crush her than kiss her. And then there's her disagreeable family to contend with. But Ferin surprises Lea by not seeming to care about her secrets. He, in fact, offers to help her learn more about his kind. And despite her vast knowledge of the Dracon, she's stunned to find their mating practices not at all tame...or monogamous. Can Lea take a chance on loving a Dracon, or is their future nothing more than the fading flames of a Firebreather's passion?
