  "description": "Rules of the Ring…No unsportsmanlike conduct Matchmaker Lindsey Tuttle always thought Rich Estrada was a whole lot of sexy. What's not to lust after? He's a gorgeous, flirty mixed martial arts fighter. When they find themselves heating up during an unexpected—and superintense—make-out session, Lindsey is ready…until Rich ends it with no explanation. Three rounds…Now it's almost a year later, and Rich has a broken foot, which means a frustrating recovery back in Boston before his next fight. But this could be the perfect time for a rematch with a sexy little matchmaker….And minimal clothing!There's no denying the chemistry between them. It's full-contact, no-holds-barred attraction…and only one can be on top!",
