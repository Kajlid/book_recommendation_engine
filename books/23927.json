  "title": "C. S. Lewis on Faith",
  "description": "'Faith' could be described as a strong or unshakable belief in something, especially without proof or evidence. Everyone has faith in something or someone, even if it's just that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that your friend will meet you at the time and place appointed. But this selection from the writings of C.S. Lewis deals with a very specific form of faith, the Christian faith. An insightful look into the very private struggles of C.S. Lewis as he sought to define his own beliefs.",
