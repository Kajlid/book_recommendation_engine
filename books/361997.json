  "description": "(A game with no sides. . . A game with no rules. . . A game where no one can win. The impossible happens-when enough plutonium to incinerate the globe is stolen from inside Russia. Only a few have power enough to execute such a scheme. . . Only one man has the daring. Now Tarp, a Western agent, is called in to play on the enemy's team. And he must remove the other players - one by one. From Cuba to London, Paris to Moscow. . . to a rendezvous beneath the frozen waters of the Falklands, Tarp stalks a man who has betrayed the whole world. A man who is nowhere and everywhere at once)",
