  "description": "\"I died.Nothing is as it should be on the other side...Come with me to Purgatory.\"All his life, Tosho, a 16 year old apprentice mason in post WW2 Germany, did everything to be the exact opposite of his Nazi father. He thought he had a lifetime ahead to build a better world. He was wrong. When he is brutally murdered, heaven is nowhere to be found. Horrified, Tosho discovers he does not have a soul, making him an abomination. Instead his body is haunted by a feisty spirit who angered a violent rebellious group in his past: the Power Thieves. They remember, and they will not be stopped before erasing both Tosho and his spirit from the afterlife. Tosho is chased, attacked and cursed. He would have endured it if his new friends hadnâ€™t been threatened too. Tosho owes them, for they were all victims of people like his father. He is ready to sacrifice everything to right the wrongs that have been done, even learn to fight, destroy his body and forget his dream of a better world to be in.",
