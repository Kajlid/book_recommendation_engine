  "description": "\"An unmatched champion for the America First movement, Kari Lake in her first book, Just Getting Started, outlines her journey from being the most beloved newscaster and broadcast journalist in Arizona to the leader of the largest grassroots movement in the state's history. Kari Lake shares an exclusive, uncensored look inside her journey. From the time she walked away from the media, to the beginning of her bid for governor, her David and Goliath primary campaign, her endorsement from the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and the events of the general election campaign that led to the sabotaged Arizona election of 2022. This is the story of how a wife and a mother of two became what the mainstream media called \"The Most Dangerous Politician in America.\" This is the story of a Mama Bear who believes that politicians should answer to We the People. It's a story of a woman who takes a sledgehammer to every obstacle she faces. This is the story of how Kari Lake is Unafraid.\"--",
