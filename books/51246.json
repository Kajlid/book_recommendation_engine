  "description": "Things That Chap My Hidethings I want to punch in the face: 1) a humorous way to convey annoyance or frustration over those little things in life that bug; 2) petty peeves warranting a tongue-in-cheek lashing but involving no physical retribution; 3) an expression made wildly popular by the blog Things I Want to Punch in the Face.Synonyms: chap your hide, get your goat, rub the wrong way.Antonyms: make out with, love so much you should marry it, float your boat, blow your skirt upJennifer Worick had a bad day. And then a bad week. She channelled her aggravation into creating the blog Things I Want to Punch in the Face, which became a sensation. Although her bad week passed, she has continued to take note of the little irritations that torment us all daily. Old guys with ponytails. 20-minute coffee prep. Bizspeak. Vanity plates. Celebrity baby names. Excessive punctuation. It’s astounding how the little things can drive a person insane.Now the book has arrived and stars more than 100 of Worick’s most punch-worthy aggravations, rated on a scale of 1 to 5 fists. She rants, she vents, she amuses with little factoids about the things that annoy the crap out of us. In short, she has created a hilarious gift book that has something for everyone to hate, from the last swig of beer, to SkyMall, to utilikilts, to people who don’t believe in TV.You’ve never had so much fun with annoyances before.",
