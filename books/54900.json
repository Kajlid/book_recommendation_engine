  "description": "In the future, wars will no longer be fought by men of flesh and blood. Instead, robots march forth into battle, to finish a job left half-done. It is not their war, not their cause, and yet they fight and die for the cause, heroes one and all. Hammerstein: the leader. Joe Pineapples: the ultimate assassin. Blackblood: the traitor. Mongrol: the killer machine. Deadlock: the crazed priest of Khaos. Mek-Quake: the coward. Ro-Jaws: the garbage eater. They are the Mek-Nificent Seven, they are the A.B.C Warriors - atomic, bacterial and chemical war robots, programmed for destruction - and this is their story.Collects:- ABC Warriors (Prog #119)- The Retreat from Volgow (Prog #120)- Mongrol (Prog #121-#122)- The Order of Knights Martial (Prog #123-#124)- The Bougainville Massacre (Prog #125-#126)- Steelhorn (Prog #127-#128)- Mars, the Devil Planet (Prog #129)- Cyboons (Progs #130-#131)- The Red Death (Prog #132-#133)- Golgotha (Prog #134-#136)- Mad George (Progs #137-#139)- The A.B.C.
