  "description": "I couldn’t help myself. I married the babysitter. And it turns out she’s a virgin. I thought Erin would be the perfect nanny for my daughter. Now I’m getting a virgin bride in the bargain. I’m the first man to get this deep, but I’m not turning back.  When work gets crazy, I need to hire a nanny to help take care of my baby daughter. Erin is smart and gorgeous, and as soon as I see her perfect curves and innocent lips, I know I’m going to hire her.  Maybe it’s a little selfish. But she’s gorgeous, and I can’t resist tasting those lips every time I walk through the door.  I know it turns her on. She loves teasing me. It’s the perfect situation, and I can’t get enough of Erin’s toe-curling moans.  Except she has two big secrets. The first one drives me crazy: she’s a virgin, just waiting to be touched.  And the second secret ends with us getting married.  Now she’s my little virgin wife, and I can do whatever I want with her.  And there won’t be a single inch of her that I won’t completely expose.  Virgin Bride is a dirty single dad romance with steamy scenes and bad language. It’s only recommended for readers 18+.  Virgin Bride is a STANDALONE, full-length novel. No cliffhanger. Guaranteed HEA. Includes bonus content!",
