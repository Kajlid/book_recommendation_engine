  "description": "Alex Martin was just a Blacksmith’s apprentice in a small farm town, who accidently enchants a cooking pot; I mean who doesn’t do that every now and then? But suddenly he finds himself on his way to Xarparion, the premier teaching academy for wizards on the planet! Just one small problem… He’s an Enchanter! Unlike other mages that can cast fireballs and summon elementals, and other cool stuff, Enchanters are only able to craft magic items. Once he gets there he finds he is in a class all of his own, literally! He’s the first Enchanter born in 700 years! And the dark forces of power wish it had been a lot longer, like never! Meanwhile, completely unknown to Alex, mysterious forces of light are also in play and are grooming him for a run at a Necromancer whose undead hordes control half the world! To help him he acquires, a half crazed mentor, an unwanted pixie and a hot sword slinger girlfriend that fights the zombie apocalypse every night in her sleep! And if those three weren’t enough to drive anyone crazy, the rest of his friends might! Mischievous fashion conscious druid girls, a dwarf, dragons, a talking sword, and the occasional marmot fill out the cast of characters for this adventure!",
