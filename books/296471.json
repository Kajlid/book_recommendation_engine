Before she knows it, Turquoise finds herself in strange and perilous worlds populated by the likes of human oddities, shape-shifters, serial killers in flying saucers, flesh-eating hippies, man-eating house cats, and sleazy televangelists who produce snuff films for Christ.Will Turquoise's life ever return to normal? Or will it remain a never-ending roller coaster ride into the bizarre? Find out in these three delightfully deranged tales from the author of The Amnesia Girl!",
