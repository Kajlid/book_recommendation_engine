  "title": "Call a Body Home",
  "description": "In the tradition of Southern writers such as Breece D’J Pancake, the stories of Call a Body Home explore the borderlessness between nature, violence, and memory against the rural Appalachian backdrop of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. Its characters are working class parents, children and siblings struggling to maintain the familial ties and traditions that bind them together, even as time and trauma threaten to uproot them. By turns savage and soulful, Call a Body Home offers a melodic portrait of the modern South and how we fight through hardship and grief to find a way home.",
