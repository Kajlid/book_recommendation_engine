  "description": "Can you ever really go home again? What if you bring a friend and he is welcomed like a favorite son? In this comedy by the masterful George Bernard Shaw, Larry Doyle is a successful engineer in London who returns to his birthplace in Ireland for a business deal. His partner, Tom Broadbent, has romantic notions of the Emerald Isle and is eager to come along. Broadbent cuts a swathe through the small town, charming nearly everyone he meets including Doyle s sweetheart. John Bull's Other Island was first produced in 1904, and is the sole play by Shaw to be set in his homeland of Ireland. Shaw s incisive humor shines throughout, making this a most satisfying read.",
