Predator.\nI've been called many things, most of which are true.But when you're an outlaw, you wear those words like badges of honor on your cut.I grew up in the Devil's Skull MC. It's all I know. It's all I've ever wanted to be.Until I met her.She's feisty, smart, and way too good for the likes of a dirtbag like me.But I can't stay away from her.For two years I've watched her from a distance, wishing our circumstances allowed for me to be the kind of man she deserves.When the chance to get close to her finally arrives, it's only to drag her home so she can answer for her crimes.Finding her was the easy part.Bringing her in sealed her fate.Claiming her was the final nail in her coffin.*** Death In The Flames was partially released as an 18k word novella in the Possessed by Passion Collection. It has been added to and expanded into a full-length novel. ***",
