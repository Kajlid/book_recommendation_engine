  "description": "Mia lives with her family in a small South American village beneath the snowy mountains. Their house is put together from the dumped rubbish of the city - it is not much of a place. One day, Mia's father brings her a puppy, which she calls Poco because he's so small. When Poco runs away, Mia travels far up into the mountains to search for him. There, she finds some white mountain flowers, growing under the stars, as well as something much more powerful - hope.",
