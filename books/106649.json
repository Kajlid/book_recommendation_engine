  "description": "New! From Bloomsbury Spark, a sunny heartwarming story of discovery and sisterhood.  A road trip. A singing competition. And super-hot cowboys.  What could be better? For Charlie, a post-high school road trip isn't just a vacation, it's life changing. While her parents think she's helping a friend move, a chance at fame is the real reason to grab her best friends and drive to L.A. But when her super annoying, uber-responsible, younger sister, Lucy, has to tag along, it isn't quite the summer of fun she imagined. Add in a detour to her grandparents' ranch in Texas, and between mucking the stalls, down-home cookinâ€™, and drool worthy ranch hands, this could just turn into the best, and most complicated, summer of their lives.",
