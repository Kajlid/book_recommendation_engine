  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ASIN B01ETUPOQGFor previous cover edition see hereIt's common enough for a book of dragons to center on a young wizard harnessing his power, or a knightly lad (usually a farmhand) learning to vanquish evil. The Merlins and Arthurs, if you will. Too rarely do we get to glimpse the other side of the coin. The Madam Mims and Morgan le Fays certainly had their own humble beginnings, but those stories are seldom told. Those climbs to power are somehow neglected. Within the pages of The Tatterwing Chronicles you'll find such a story. A story of a girl well on her way to becoming the notorious witch known as Tatterwing. A story of her rise to power, her flirtation with the darkness, and her tendency to ride the line between hero and villain as the odds stack against her. Book 2 - part 1: Medo Tatterwing still believes she is safe in the ruins of Tornhold. She believes the troubles of two years ago have long since been buried. But things haven't stayed buried like they should. The shadow of an old enemy has come back to haunt Medo. A pale woman lurking among the trees, striking fear into the surrounding countryside. A woman who should be dead.",
