  "description": "'My name is Pierre Jacque Russey. My friends call me Pete. I would like to invite you into my world. If you take up my offer and enter, be forewarned. You just might find yourself identifying with it.' A common man's life is full of unique stories. Pete Russey is an ordinary man born in an ordinary town in a fairly ordinary family. He has lived an ordinary life. But that doesn't mean his life is without its out-of-the-ordinary moments, captured here in a collection of tales that every reader can relate to. Travel with Pete on his boyhood camping trip in the Summerville Woods, where he and his pals have an unexpected stalker. Learn the language of dogs when he meets his girlfriend's Pekinese. Solve the mystery of the murder in his classroom. Join the race with the Little Zebra. Get lost in the trip to Spain. And through it all, enjoy the laughs and experience life through another's eyes. The Adventures of a Common Man are worth noting.",
