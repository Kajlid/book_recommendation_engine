  "description": "Jake never liked urban myths. But this is not an urban myth. And it did not happen to someone else, but to him. He's set it down as best he can remember. Whether you believe it or not, is up to you. The Darkeningstone combines gritty, edgy modern-day action with an adventure across time. Discovered over 5,000 years ago, the Darkeningstone affects everyone who finds it. So remember this: Somewhere, sometime, The Darkeningstone is waiting for you. A fast-paced adventure across time, with short chapters crammed with cliff-hangers. There's vengeance here and the threat of violence. There's a plot you can get your teeth into and characters you can believe in. Jake was too smart to believe the rumours about Scaderstone Pit, but now he's in more danger than he could ever have imagined. In 1939, as World War II looms, the lives of two men will be changed forever. Over 5,000 years ago, a hermit will keep the stone a secret. But someone is watching him - someone with murder in his heart. What will you see when you look into The Darkeningstone? If you dare.",
