  "description": "The product of illegal genome experiments to perfect the human race, my name is Angel, and I live with a slave collar, a tracking system I can’t escape. Torn from my lover’s arms and shipped across the galaxy, I am enslaved to the Gran, a fierce alien Catlike race of warriors. I serve as Captain Cronin’s concubine, and pray Cesar, my pirate lover, finds a way to beg, steal or barter my freedom.Trying to salvage an existence among the Royal Family of the Gran, I find friendship and new allies in my bid for freedom. As translator, I have a chance to broker trade between Cesar and the Gran. Success might free me of the slave collar wrapped around my neck.If not, I will surely go mad kneeling before the Captain, serving him in ways I dare not admit to Cesar. I pray my pirate lover never learns the truth of the wicked things I do to please Captain Cronin.Angel 6.0 The Series:Born of illegal experimentation on the human genome, I've been taken for a ride across the galaxy, enslaved to the warlike race of Cats called the Gran. They think I'm some kind of upgrade, a new slave stock to be bred.Though many would resent me for the decisions I have made, they never experienced my struggle to find love and meaning in a world where I do not belong.A freak of nature, the humans don't want me.Far more valuable than they know, the Cats don't appreciate me.Trapped in the conflict between two galactic empires, the pirates can't save me.Thrust into the center of an interstellar war, the Earth Defense Council never saw me coming.\nI am Angel 6.0 and this is the dark, wicked, violent tale of my life.",
