  "description": "Promoted from the rank of Acting Temporary Captain in a Royal Flying Corps training squadron to that of very temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in the Air Ministry, ace pilot Bartholomew Wolfe Bandy blots his copybook with an ill-considered speech, flies to Ireland by mistake, and is sent back to the chaos of the Western Front as a lieutenant with the 13th Bicycle Battalion (also known as \"Captain Craig and the Forty Thieves\"). Reclaimed by the newly-hatched RAF that had just been born on April Fools' Day, Bandy -- now a major -- survives Irish gun-runners, Bolshevik spies, and his honeymoon with only minor injuries and major embarrassment.",
