  "title": "The Sea Hunters: Indians of the Northwest Coast",
  "description": "This is the third book in the author's important series on North American Indian tribes. ... Unlike the Iroquois and other Eastern tribes, the Northwest Coast Indians were not farmers. Since high mountains come down almost to the ocean in the Northwest, these Indians had no fields in which to grow corn and beans and squash. So their whole existence depended on the creatures of the sea. The men were fierce fighters in their wars with other tribes, but first of all they had to be skillful fishermen and hunters.",
