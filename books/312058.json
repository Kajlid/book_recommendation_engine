  "description": "If you're like me, you wish for freedom. You want to live your life as you see fit and do things on your own terms. You hate being told what to do and how to do it. And you hate doing meaningless tasks or busy work that lacks creativity.If you're like me, you've always wanted to make it on your own, be the captain of your ship, master of your destiny. You have the skills to produce value for others and you know there is more to yourself and to what you could achieve. But you're stuck looking for the right idea, the right time or the right plan.This book is here to unstuck you.Can you think of a small $1 idea? Something you could easily implement and sell?A short guide, a cheatsheet, a template, a book, a magazine, a video tutorial, a graphical asset, a specific tool, a plugin, an app, a song, a videogame...I’m hard pressed to think that anyone looking at this book doesn’t have at least a dozen great one dollar ideas.But nobody cares for them, we’re all too busy looking for the mythical million dollars beasts. So we still ourselves and wait patiently as time crawls by. From time to time we stir with excitement only to uncover it had already been done or that it's out of our reach. So we withdraw, waiting for our next moment to strike. Waiting for that one great idea to start in force.We are foolish to wait. Knowledge and ideas have been inflated for years by gurus wanting to sell us on expensive courses and seminars. There are no secrets to success left to uncover. It’s hard work, timing and luck.Knowing the path doesn’t put you one single step ahead of someone blindly walking it.This book and any others are just pointing fingers. They might help, but only if you let go of them and start actually moving.Execution is where the difference is made. The worst idea you put out there is still infinitely better than the best idea you never do anything about. The more you apply yourself, the more your abilities grow, and the more opportunities you'll find.A simple one dollar idea is a good enough start.Building and selling a $1 product will teach you more about real world money making than any book, course or trainer could ever do.And what if instead of selling it, you would put it behind a membership paywall for $1 monthly subscription? And the clients you’d make would stay with you forever.All you’d need to do is take the money you made the month before and reinvest it in advertising, next month you’d have more clients, the old ones plus the new ones… even more $1 bills to use, burn all of that on growth and keep repeating the cycle until you reach the edges of the internet.Millions of members paying you $1 a month for the rest of their lives. The mythical fairy tale beast born out of a lowly $1 seed.Facebook sells us $1 products, Google sells us $1 products, Spotify sells us $5 products, Netflix and all the streaming platforms sell us $10 products. They are billions a month companies built on cheap digital products and a recurring system.You no longer need to be world famous or top 1% of your field to become financially free. A few thousand people paying you a small monthly fee to access your digital work can get you there.Learn",
