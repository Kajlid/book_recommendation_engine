  "title": "The Sheriff: A Detective's Story",
  "description": "Since Gerry O'Carroll joined Ireland's national police force in the early 1970s, there has been much bloodshed and plenty of controversy; and as one of the force's most distinguished detective inspectors, he has seen his fair share of both. Following his first posting as an officer on the beat in Dublin, Gerry spent three decades investigating some of the country's most high-profile crimes and here he explains the motives behind them and reveals the confessions that led to convictions. He also shares his thoughts on the Kerry Babies case that split the nation, along with his experiences as an officer at the height of The Troubles. The story then follows his retirement from the force, as he has become a popular columnist with the Evening Herald, is in demand on radio and television for his views on crime, and most famously helped Jon Voight to prepare for his performance as an Irish policeman in John Boorman's The General , based on the life of Martin Cahill, a gangster vigorously pursued by Gerry.",
