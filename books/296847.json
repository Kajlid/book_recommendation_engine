  "title": "Everything Tracker: The Ultimate Comprehensive CBT Toolkit",
  "description": "A revolutionary tracking tool for those striving to overcome a chronic illness. The Everything Tracker is literally just that -- a place to track everything, including mood, pain, sleep, exercise, food, meditation and medication. The tracker even includes a place to practice reframing negative thoughts into positive ones. This three-month journal enables people with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety and other chronic conditions to take control of the healing process by leaving nothing to guess work or relying on memory. At the end of each week and month there is a place for note-taking during doctor's visits, so practitioners can share information, both with their patients and with each other. Written by a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, the author of \"Solving Fibromyalgia: A Treatment Guide for Practitioners,\" the Everything Tracker helps identify unhealthy habits and trigger foods, sleep disorders, medication side effects and so much more. The Everything Tracker was designed by an actual user who has struggled with depression, anxiety and chronic pain for a decade, and has searched endlessly for one tracker that has everything.",
