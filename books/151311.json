And when push comes to shove, Alex is ready to defend her to the death. Will the dark forest put an end to both their young lives? Will it be the beginning to a dark reign of terror no one can control? Or will it be the beginning of innocent romance, a new world of light? Alex is running out of time to save his red-haired love. And little does he know – the world is running out of time, too.",
