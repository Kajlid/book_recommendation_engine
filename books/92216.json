  "title": "Beyond the Rift",
  "description": "Combining complex science with skillfully executed prose, these edgy, award-winning tales explore the shifting border between the known and the alien. The beauty and peril of technology and the passion and penalties of conviction merge in narratives that are by turns dark, satiric, and introspective. Among these bold storylines: a seemingly humanized monster from John Carpenterâ€™s The Thing reveals the true villains in an Antarctic showdown; an artificial intelligence shields a biologically enhanced prodigy from her overwhelmed parents; a deep-sea diver discovers her true nature lies not within the confines of her mission but in the depths of her psyche; a court psychologist analyzes a psychotic graduate student who has learned to reprogram reality itself; and a father tries to hold his broken family together in the wake of an ongoing assault by sentient rainstorms. Gorgeously saturnine and exceptionally powerful, these collected fictions are both intensely thought-provoking and impossible to forget.Contents\"The Things\"\"The Island\" \"The Second Coming of Jasmine Fitzgerald\"\"A Word for Heathens\"\"Home\"\"The Eyes of God\" \"Flesh Made Word\"\"Nimbus\"\"Mayfly\" (with Derryl Murphy) \"Ambassador\"\"Hillcrest vs. Velikovsky\"\"Repeating the Past\"\"A Niche\"\"Outtro: En Route to Dystopia with the Angry Optimist\"",
