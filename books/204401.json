  "description": "Tillie Pierce is a thoughtful, fifteen-year-old young woman, living with her family in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It's 1863, and the Civil War is touching every town and home with tragedy. Tillie's is no exception.She has two brothers fighting in the war, but she receives news that it's her sister's sweetheart who has died defending his country against Confederate forces. This shatters Tillie's faith-she finds it impossible to believe that God, in all of his sovereignty, would allow such horrors to take place.What Tillie doesn't know is this is only the beginning, as the Battle of Gettysburg is just around the corner. The Confederate Army arrives three days ahead of the Union soldiers, and they loot, steal, and enslave African American citizens.Tillie's parents, devout Christians and staunch abolitionists, encourage her to pray for her enemies, but she can't speak to a god who won't stop the war. Where is Christ in all of this? Will Tillie and her family survive the bloody conflict, and will she ever find her faith again?No Safe Haven is a deeply personal account of a young woman's struggles through the greatest conflict her country, and her heart, will ever see.",
