  "description": "WHO WILL CLAIM THE TOWER?After the near-destruction of the High Halls, Corporal Kaylin Neya is looking forward to resuming her patrol. But once more an empty Tower stands in Elantra, and Kaylin’s companions won’t let an advantage slip by. They see the Tower as a base to fight Shadow. The Dragon Bellusdeo as a protection for the cohort; Sedarias as a potential hoard. And others are interested as well.Kaylin knows when she’s in over her head. Claiming a Tower is not the future she wants. And the Tower has strict requirements—ones that daunt even the Dragons and the Barrani. But as the various factions strategize, the Shadows are making their own plans. They still want to cross into Elantra, and this might be the perfect chance.",
