  "description": "Title 3 of 12: Tess MonaghanListening Length = 8 hours and 47 minutesAn Agatha and Anthony Award winner! PI Tess Monaghan has just set up shop in Baltimore when a man who was recently released from prison asks her to find the witnesses of his sentencing — supposedly to make reparations. But as she begins investigating, the witnesses start dying… A crackling thriller from a “brilliant” author (Gillian Flynn).Tess Monaghan has finally made the move and hung out her sign as a private investigator for hire, complete with an office in Butchers Hill. Maybe it's not the greatest address in Baltimore, but you've got to start somewhere. Then in walks Luther Beale, the notorious vigilante who five years ago shot a boy for vandalising his car. Just out of prison, he wants to make reparations to the kids who witnessed his crime, so he needs Tess to find them. But once she starts snooping, the witnesses start dying. Is the 'Butcher of Butchers Hill' at it again? Like it or not, Tess is embroiled in a case that encompasses the powers-that-be, a heartless system that has destroyed the lives of children, and a nasty trail of money and lies leading all the way back to Butchers Hill.",
