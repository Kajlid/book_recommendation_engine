  "description": "Goat shifters in love! Brave goats, wicked fae, and a cursed castle Supernatural historian and goat shifter Adiel Nielson moved to Fox Hollow to write about the town's unique history as a haven for shifters and psychics. He never expects to encounter the cute guy he flirted with at a rest stop—or to discover that Joel is a shifter as well—and the photographer assigned to his project. Sparks fly between them, but a misunderstanding threatens their relationship. Then Joel disappears, taken by the fae, and Adiel is the only one who can rescue him. Nothing tests true love like a fight to the death against three faerie monsters! Gruff is a suspenseful MM paranormal romance mystery-adventure full of sexy shifters, adorable fainting goats, hurt/comfort, second chance love, age gap attraction, sincere psychics, scary faeries, protective squirrels, found family, and fated mates. Gruff takes place in the town of Fox Hollow but can be read as a stand-alone from the other Fox Hollow books.",
