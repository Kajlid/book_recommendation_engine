  "title": "Prolonged Echoes: Volume 2: The Reception Of Norse Myths In Medieval Island",
  "description": "Prolonged Echoes is the second volume in the two volume study of Old Norse myths and their meaning both for us and for medieval Scandinavians, -- some of whom we should thank for the myths' written transmission through the Middle Ages and into modern times.The subject of Vol. 2 is the reception and use of Old Norse myths by the Cristian community of medieval Iceland. It requires us to consider a wider range of Old Icelandic texts, including those studied in volume one but extending to works that, while not taking myth as their subject, utilise it and references to it in their larger discourse.A number of excellent general studies that are available to assist readers unfamiliar with recent writing on early medieval Scandinavia are listed as an addendum.",
