  "description": "Dan Stoltz has worked for years under his mentor Murphy to train sparring werewolves for the WWFL. Finally ready to start his own business he takes the money he's saved, buys a license to train, and goes to the slave auction house to buy his first fighter.Ashland's owner has lost him for failure to pay back taxes and he's up on the auction block. His former master abused him, underfed him, didn't put him in fights or keep up with his training, and he's not in the best shape.When Dan sets his sights elsewhere, Murphy insists Ash is the better choice, and so, against his better judgment, Dan purchases Ash. Ash might not look like much at first, but as they work together, Ash looks better than better. Now it seems Dan might get a better return on his investment than he could have expected, because he discovers that he burns with desire for his slave and Ash might just feel the same.",
