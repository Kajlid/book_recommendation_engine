  "description": "Wren Minix knew vamps were real. Totally. But mean fairies? Fairies weren’t supposed to be mean! But they are, and she really thought she was gonna become fairy dust if it hadn’t been for the super hunky vampire that saved her. Had she mentioned hunky? And, hey, giving him a little snack in return was no bigs. He helped, after all. Except she wanted one nibble to turn into two and then…oodles. And she’d tell him so…just as soon as she finished tasting all of those yummy muscles. For three hundred years, Griffin Linch has protected the city of Atlanta as one of its Knight Protectors, a vampire with a cause. Each night he turns other predators into prey and keeps the citizens of the city safe from the bad things that go bump in the night. But it’s one, lush, curvaceous and smart-mouthed human that he’s rescued and can’t get out of his system. She’s it for him. The perfect package…the perfect mate…if only she could keep her mouth shut long enough for him to tell her. Part of the KNIGHT PROTECTORS Nibbled by the Vamp Big Bad Vamp",
