  "description": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be held hostage by an Italian stallion? My name is Clara, and I am part-owner of a brothel called “The Castle.” My empire is my home which I’ve worked hard to build a life from. A future. But one day, the infamous Luca Belatoni stepped into my office and demanded that I pay him protection money. Of course, I refused. Of course, he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Now he is in my castle—holding me hostage. Trying to control my mind in business and my body in bed. Neither of which I will allow. No matter how much his caramel eyes and Italian words of love puncture my hardened heart. So, being the hostage of an Italian stallion pretty much sucks. Because this man is a force to be reckoned with. And while I am not frightened for my life, I am definitely frightened for my heart.\nIf you don’t like dominating, overbearing arseholes, please do not read.
