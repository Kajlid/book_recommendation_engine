After one wild night in Vegas (and too much tequila), Everleigh finds herself in bed with a man she can’t stand and a ring on her finger. It doesn’t help that the man in question knows all the ways to push her buttons, even with his lickable abs and chiseled chest. The life she’s built, with her secrets locked up tight, is threatened when he decides he wants more than her in his bed - he wants her heart.Brooks had wanted the hot pharmacist from the first moment he saw her. Except she shoots him down at every advance, so he hands it over to fate. But fate doesn’t anticipate someone from Everleigh’s past intent on keeping her for himself.",
