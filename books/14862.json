  "description": "The Magic Word is one that everyone needs to learn. \"Elisabeth Keys never said thank you, excuse me or please. She made fun of people, she'd argue and tease. She took what she wanted whenever she could, Elisabeth's manners were not very good.\" So begins the rhymed story of Elisabeth, who discovers her lack of friends when no one wants to come to her birthday party. Her mother suggests that she learn to be considerate of others and to say \"please\" as well as \"thank you.\" She should treat others \"the way that you know you would like,\" and should \"think more about others and less about you.\" When Elisabeth goes to school the next day, she remembers her mother's advice and uses the magic word \"please.\" She also tries to become more thoughtful of others. Imagine her pleasure when she returns home to find out that her new friends are all coming to her birthday party. Wouldn't it be wonderful if children could learn at an early age to be polite and thoughtful of others! This wonderful rhyming book will have your kids saying \"please\" before you know it! A former teacher, Sherrill S.
