  "title": "My Heart Lies South: The Story of My Mexican Marriage",
  "description": "What happens when a thoroughly twentieth-century American lady journalist becomes a Mexican señora in nineteen-thirties provincial Monterrey? She finds herself sometimes hilariously coping with servants, daily food allowances, bargaining, and dramatic Latin emotions. It is like stepping back a hundred years. In this vivid autobiography, Newberry Award-winning author Elizabeth Borton de Treviño brings to life her experiences with the culture and the faith of a civilization so close to the United States, but rarely appreciated or understood. This special young people s edition presents the humor and the insights of a remarkable woman and her contact with an era which is now past, but not to be forgotten. Ages 14 and up.",
