  "title": "Dogged Flight: A fable told by Canaan dog Keren",
  "description": "“I have always wanted to fly.” Keren is a nine-year-old female Canaan dog who loves to tell stories; some of them are true. Here, she tells about how she made her puppyhood dream of flying with the birds become real. Keren loves to chase and play with anything that moves, but can’t catch the birds. She is dogged—she won’t give up in her efforts to learn how to fly. To overcome the challenges, she recalls the teachings of her parents and the traditions of her desert-living Canaan ancestors. She turns to the experts in flight, the birds, seeking to learn the secret of flight. She studies, through observation, instruction, and practice, how to fly. Although she tries very hard, she still can’t fly, until one day, when she isn’t even trying to fly, she finds herself airborne. A story of determination and discovery, a fable of growth and change, and love of the natural world. Eighty-four luminous color photographs show Keren's adventures. Reader ages: As a picture book, any age from 5-105. Class use and independent reading from 2nd grade. Can be read as a chapter book over several sessions.",
