  "description": "Twenty years ago, the Black Flu decimated the population of the world. The UK’s response was to create Safe Zones, providing sanctuary for those that survived. Sammie was born in Safe Zone E, and grew up there, learning how to survive and how to fight, and trading with other Safe Zones. When Sammie made a discovery that could bring hope to all the survivors, one man’s twisted greed turned that dream into a nightmare. He destroyed Safe Zone E and caused the death of thousands. After the destruction of her Zone, Sammie was voted in as leader of the former residents. She made them three promises: she would find them a new home, she would find her nemesis, Brian Crowe, and make him pay, and she would build a better future for her people. Sammie intends to keep these promises at any cost.  In the conclusion to the Safe Zone Trilogy, can the people of the UK find their Serenity?",
