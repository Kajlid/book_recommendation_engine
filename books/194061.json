  "description": "Life is a bitch. Keeps screwing me over, and I take blow after blow, sucking it up, giving her the finger. Don’t get me wrong: I love women. Especially one woman – Madeline. She’s gorgeous, she’s sexy, she’s goddamn perfect. Plus – minor detail – she has a boyfriend already. Not that she’d want anything to do with the likes of me. Apprentice tattoo artist, former homeless person, covered in ink, without a penny to my name. And sort of cursed. I mean, I’d be lucky to run into a girl, any girl, on my way in and out of hospitals with the way life has been knocking me about lately. But I’m not lucky. Never was. Doesn’t look like that’s gonna change any day soon, either. Until the day the girl of my dreams literally runs into me. With her car. Life hates me, and if this isn’t a clue, then I don’t know what is. Standalone novel. No cliffhanger. *Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young readers.* SETH is book 3 in the series Damage Control - a series set in the same world as Inked Brotherhood. The boys of Damage Control were taken in by Zane Madden and Rafe Vestri and offered apprenticeship and work in the tattoo shop Damage Control. Next in the Damage Control series: SHANE(Damage Control 4).",
