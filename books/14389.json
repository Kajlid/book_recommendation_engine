  "description": "[Siren Erotic Contemporary Paranormal Romance, vampires] After a messy divorce and the death of her mother, author Charlotte Allen is looking for a quiet place to hang her laptop. She finds it on a hundred acres of pristine, Northern Canadian wilderness. Things start to look up when a hunky contractor signs on to build her dream home. David Hadfield is a big fan of Charlotte's work, so it's no trouble at all when the lovely Ms. Allen asks him to put his big hammer to use. David's also a 250-year-old vampire who's been looking for a woman to call his own. Forever. He loves the vampire stories she writes. It makes sense she'd find it easy to love a real bloodsucker . . . doesn't it? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
