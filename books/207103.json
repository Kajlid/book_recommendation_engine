The next, she's a reporter, and he's a detective who appears to see Caitlin only as a friend.Her mother’s advice to throw sexy detective Raven O’Brien to the floor and have her way with him is not Caitlin’s idea of romance, no matter how much she desires his love.

He desperately searches for evidence to find the killer, while Caitlin uses her unique abilities to find answers. Will Caitlin become the killer’s next victim? Can Caitlin and Raven survive to build a life together?",
