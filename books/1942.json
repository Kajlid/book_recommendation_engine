  "description": "Rear cover \"Here at last is the complete and perfect book for everyone who wants to know 'all about cowboys' - a fascinating roundup of hundreds of facts of all kinds about cowboy life and lore from the days of the open range to the modern dude ranch. It tells about the cowboy's clothes, his work, his horse, his rope, his six-shooter, his 'lingo'; about roundups, cattle drives, famous 'bad men' and gunfighters, Indians and buffaloes, and life on the range. It explains the 'how' and why' of the cowboy's way of doing things, from braiding a quirt to 'busting' a bronc. The vigorous spirit of the old, untrammeled West breathes through the pages of this book. With more than 600 entries and over 200 illustrations, it brings vividly to life the days when 'cattle was king,' and when the hard-riding, free-spirited cowboy, with his horse, his rope, and his gun, was 'winning the West' for the white man. There is endless fascination here for everyone, young or old, who loves American traditions, and who thrills to the spell of the West.\"",
