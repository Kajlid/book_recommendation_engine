  "description": "Five average, middle-aged suburban guys jokingly call themselves the Thursday Night Mafia, and their weekly blackjack game appears to be an innocent pastime. But looks can be deceiving, as casual talk over cards leads to an ill-fated plot to scam Lake Tahoe casinos. Their lives are thrown into a downward spiral faster than you can shuffle the cards. Caught red-handed by mob-goons, and facing certain death if they don't repay a fortune they don't have, they turn to Rick. He secretly schemes to use their inside knowledge of Air Force operations to his own end. They commandeer a plane with nuclear weapons for ransom.But the BLACKSTAR BOMBER holds secrets bigger than Rick's, and a crack security team of Air Force security policemen and National Security Agents race against the clock to hunt down Rick. His vengeful plan includes the destruction of Lake Tahoe and the death of thousands of people, and that's just to starters. The race is on to capture Rick and recover the ultra-secret BlackStar system before it can be exposed.",
