Congdon brings her personal passion as a lifelong swimmer to this beautiful and thoughtful celebration of getting in the water. Hand-lettered inspirational quotes, watercolor portraits paired with real people's personal stories, illustrated collections of vintage objects—colorful swim caps, bathing suits through the ages, traditional pool signs—and much more evoke the beauty and inspiration of the subject. An emphasis on swimming as a way of life—taking the leap, going with the flow—makes this delightful volume one that will speak to serious swimmers, vacation paddlers, and anyone pondering their next high dive.",
