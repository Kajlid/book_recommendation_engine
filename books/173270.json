  "description": "He was supposed to be the reboundâ€¦After a pathetic reenactment of The Runaway Bride, the last thing Nelena Price needed was a man to swoop in and steal her heart. Good liquor, laughter, and great no-strings sex were the only options she wanted on her menu. Kade Wright had every intention of savoring Nelena, never anticipating he would fall addicted to her taste. But can the events of fourteen days in Vegas really be left in Vegas?",
