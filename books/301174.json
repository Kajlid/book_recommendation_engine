  "description": "There were shadows I was running from. Ones that haunted and taunted. Ones that made it so I had no choice but to disappear.  I’d spent years hiding from the world. My little island haven, the only assurance of safety.  It all changed the moment he showed up at my door. The hint of pain in his eyes told me that something haunted him, too. And I couldn’t help but be drawn closer.  But finding the person I needed most came with risks I never expected. And when our ghosts find us again, neither of us may make it out this time.",
