  "description": "A killer stalks the wedding party!On the eve of their marriage, Lt. Plate and Daphne must uncover a ruthless murderer or forfeit their chance for happiness for all time. Their fledgling romance began as sparks during a flood, simmered within a scandal, and caught fire amidst a storm of anarchy. Now it would only be justice if Lt. Plate and Daphne could enjoy a long and stress free engagement, then sail away into the sunset after a quiet weddingâ€¦ Not meant to be. A chance at a dream Hollywood style ceremony pushes up their nuptial calendar, which would be fine if Plate also did not have to tend to security for a runaway princess bride, a Japanese VIP also claiming royal ties, a prominent movie producer staging a murder in Sand Waves, and then the surprise acquittal of an East Texas serial killer who murders on land and sea. With half his fellow officers taking off for sailing trips on Galveston Bay, and the chief busy trying to learn the new computer technology of the 1980s, Plate is left with only Grant Skaar, the youngest member of the force, as backup. Still Plate is coping, and Daphne is selling all parties involved as much insurance as she can, when suddenly everything has to take a backseat to an unimaginable tragedy within the police department. Fourth in a series of featuring the descendant of a famous Texas lawman and the woman he loves.",
