  "description": "Brandt is sent off to scout out new land at Corey, his alpha's, command. But when he gets caught in a flash flood and his car overturns, he wakes up in the bed of one sexy man. Brandt is attracted right away to Tyr, a healer, and from the look of the tented pants, the feeling is mutual. There's one problem--Tyr is a forest cat shifter. Dogs and cats mating? Yeah, probably not. But neither man is willing to give up the chance to have the other, even if it lasts the few days that Brandt waits for the roads to clear. When a few nights in bed with Tyr aren't enough, Brandt invites him to come home with him. Gentle Tyr has been used to giving in to the stronger men around him, if only to keep the peace, but he's never met a man that makes him feel like Brandt does. One of his former lovers doesn't want to let him go, but Brandt is more than a match. Broken promises, misunderstandings, and heartache await the two of them at the fenrir homestead. Especially when Tyr using his healing abilities reveals what kind of shifter he is to the other wolves. Brandt must save Tyr's life and decide whether dogs and cats can be bonded mates, and make it all work out in the end.",
