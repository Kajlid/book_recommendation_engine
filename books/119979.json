  "description": "The Earth was doomed. That is what the aliens had warned Mitch Chambers a year ago. It wasn't like it was anything new, mankind had always been teetering on the edge of extinction. But when aliens visit, you listened. They gave him and nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine other people a year to prepare before they are transplanted to another world. Mitch didn't even consider going to the media or the government, they would have laughed him right into an asylum. No, Mitch knew he would have to do it the hard way, pull mankind up by the bootstraps. Bootstrap colony.",
