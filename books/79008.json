  "description": "I'd once heard that your senior year in high school is supposed to be the time of your life. I guess they forgot to mention the crazy girl that thinks you're after her boyfriend or the wolf that attacks you in the woods during the senior camping trip. Between strange dreams that border on nightmares and Kodi Barrett, a fellow senior that I've been inexplicably drawn to for years at the center of it all, I was positive that life at Mountain Falls High School was about to get much more complicated. I didn't need my senior year to be perfect; I just needed to survive it!",
