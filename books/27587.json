  "title": "Selection Event",
  "description": "In an isolation experiment, Martin Lake had been below-ground for fourteen months and two weeks. He came up on May 30, Wednesday, 11:35 AM. He discovered that civilization had folded its arms across its breast, closed its eyes, and ceased. When natural selection wipes the slate, there are always a few survivors. Unfortunately, nature does not select for beauty or intelligence. Selection Event follows in the tradition of Earth Abides and The Road. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, this is what happens next. People open the zoos, sabotage dams, and in a final nihilistic fling, several countries have a small nuclear exchange of greetings. It is into this that Martin Lake must go and take his future into his hands.103,000 words",
