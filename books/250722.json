  "description": "Eli Donoghue is not like other children of his age. He is also the new kid in Hazel, a small, rural town in Northern Ireland. It might as well say boring on the township sign, in Eli's opinion. The only thing close to entertainment he experiences is avoiding the school bullies intent on terrorizing him. That is until he meets Mr. Jones.Jones is an enigma. He is an adult, but one with a childish sense of humour and wonder. He also has a guitar and offers to teach Eli how to play. As he begins to learn, Eli discovers thereâ€™s a lot more to Jones and to Hazel than he first thought. What follows is a story of growing up and the people that influence that delicate stage between youth and adulthood. Mr. Jones is a story of friendship, books, music and laughter.",
