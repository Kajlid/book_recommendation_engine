  "description": "Burned, scarred, and left for dead, Jimmy Tasker is running from everyone. The blaze changed him—changed the way his brain fires—and left someone else in his head with him. Someone who wants to kill for fun. He changes his name, buries his past, starts a new life…and disappears. Years later, four friends from the city are hard up. Steve needs work, Gil’s jumpy, Peter is struggling, and Cal’s an addict. So they plan a robbery. Steve backs out, but the other three go through with it and botch the job, resulting in the death of Lauren Westerbrook. Ronan Westerbrook has a hidden past, a love of photography…and a fondness for flame. Ronan’s revenge for his wife’s death culminates in a bloodbath—and unleashes Jimmy, who was there all along, tormented by nightmares of atrocities he has no idea if he truly committed. Steve is trying to build a respectable life, but now Jimmy has one last piece of unfinished business…the only witness who can identify him.",
