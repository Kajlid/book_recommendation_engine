  "title": "Love and Rockets, Vol. 24: The Education of Hopey Glass",
  "description": "A graphic novel collecting Love and Rockets stories from the \"Locas\" universe. It starts with a barely-glimpsed slaying (\"Life Through Whispers\") and ends with a funeral (\"Male Torso Found in L.A. River\"). Even though (or perhaps because) he's still carrying the torch for Maggie, Ray diligently pursues the dangerous and annoying \"Frogmouth,\" aspiring actress and full-time train wreck, from seedy bars and back alleys through comic book conventions... all the way to the ultimate, and unexpected, consummation. Meanwhile, Hopey spends an eventful week during which she undergoes a couple of major life changes, both personal and professional... and for that matter cosmetic. New characters include Hopey's long-suffering on-the-side squeeze Grace; Maggie's new roommate, the sweet-natured jockette \"Angel of Tarzana;\" and the live-wire would-be gangsta Elmer - while such classic Love and Rockets characters as the hard-living Doyle, the aging but still-rocking Terry, and the mysterious super-heroine Alarma pop up in the margins... As does Maggie, well off stage but visible as Ray's resentful ex, Angel's roommate, and (forever and still) Hopey's best friend.",
