  "title": "Turning Pain into Love",
  "description": "Turning Pain into Love is a book about the power of God working through someone to transform their suffering into a lifelong blessing. So often the trials and tribulations of our life can make us feel hopeless and confused about who we are in this world. I believe, with the belief in something greater than ourselves, a positive attitude and the intention to make a difference in the world a person can turn anything into a gift. Anytime someone has been through an experience they now have the ability to help someone else that is going through the experience for the first time. Years ago when I was living in Santa Monica, California I came across a Reader's Digest. As I was flipping through the magazine I saw a quote, \"I am not sure what Enlightenment is but I think it has something to do with turning pain into love.\" That phrase resonated with me and it has stuck with me ever since.",
