  "description": "Societies are threatened by the growing number of terrorists, virus outbreaks, global cataclysmic weather phenomena and mankind's overuse of the planet's dwindling resources.  When terrorists attack the touristic city of Florence and threaten the lives of many innocent people, Andrea Cello becomes an unwitting hero by diving in and stopping them. He has potentially saved hundreds from a horrific fate. But his good deeds and his subsequent message of peace goes viral and attracts the attention of powerful world figures. Insidious people who have an agenda, threatened by Andrea's words.  The leader of the terrorist group responsible wants to meet Andrea and his partner, but that danger is overshadowed by devastating, deadly threats with even more frightening consequences.  The Peace Ambassador holds the future in his hands, the status quo and maybe the whole of humanity.",
