Marvin struggles to impress the girl he likes, while trying to avoid the class bully. Along the way, he creates a special friendship with his teacher, and encounters many of life's humorous hurdles through the eyes of a fourth grader. Parents, teachers and students will see many parallels to their own lives, as the elements in these stories are taken from real-life experiences chronicled by the author during almost two decades as an elementary school teacher.",
