  "title": "Like a Lampshade In a Whorehouse: My Life In Comedy",
  "description": "From housewife to humorist, Phyllis Diller has been making millions laugh for five decades with her groundbreaking comedy. Boasting unique material, a raucous laugh, wild hair, the trademark cigarette holder, and garish clothes, she blazed a trail for comediennes during the fifties and sixties. She achieved this by poking fun at her own looks and frustrating life as a bored, ignored, and inept housewife - a routine that also served as a form of self-therapy in a life steeped in tragedy and turmoil.",
