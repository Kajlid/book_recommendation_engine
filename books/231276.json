Akio is of the same mind, but he sees the whole world as a place that needs the protection that Terry and his people can provide.\nOn behalf of The Queen Bitch, Akio recruits the FDG to take the fight overseas to stop an army.\n\n “The saga of TH, Char, and the Force de Guerre continues full steam… The characters are real in their interaction with each other.
