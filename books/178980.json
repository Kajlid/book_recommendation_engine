Since girls aren't supposed to be inventors, she’s secretly building her own airship up on the roof of their house. When her father is attacked and his valuable invention is stolen, she sets out in her untested airship to get her father’s contraption back. She'd better hurry. Her father's contract with his buyer expires in three days and without it they’re ruined.The airship lifts off but things get complicated when Theo finds an unintended passenger aboard. Henry Caracticus Thorne—the thief she'd spotted that very morning making off with things in the market—is an altogether unsuitable companion. But he's unlike anyone she's ever met before, he's willing to help, and he's drop-dead gorgeous. As they soar through the sky in the close quarters of Theo's airship, it’s not just the steam engine heating up.Theo has a hunch who took her father's invention. Will she manage to catch the culprit before it’s too late? What did that strange lightning storm do to Theo and Henry? And will Theo give in to her heart and act on her growing feelings for Henry?The Adventures of Theodocia Hews is a humorous YA steampunk adventure/romance series set in 1879 Cincinnati in an alternate universe where the evil institution of slavery was abolished shortly after the United States was founded, the Civil War never happened, crazy inventions are commonplace, and steam power rules!",
