  "description": "My name is Crystal Dolce, and I’m anything but sweet…  It’ll be easy, my father said. When we move to a small town in the south, we’ll own it, my brothers said. After all, my family is rich as sin and used to getting whatever they want. How hard could it be?  Except when we arrive in Faulkner, someone already owns this town.  The Darling family.  They’re every bit as wealthy as we are, and they’re not happy with our new money moving in. The three Darling cousins, each one more cruel and gorgeous than the last, rule the halls of Willow Heights the way my brothers ruled our prep school in Manhattan. None is worse than Devlin Darling, who makes it his personal mission to ruin his new rivals.  The Darlings see my brothers as a threat. They want them gone.  It doesn’t take them long to find my brothers’ one weakness.  Me.   *Bully Me is a high school dark romance suitable for readers 18+*",
