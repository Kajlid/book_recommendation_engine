  "description": "This edition is no longer available.Kyrus is a wanted man. He's an Astral Mage, better known as a \"Soul Giver\", a race of people who can reattach life force energy back to its source. In other words, he brings the dead back to life. For years the Confederated Authority, the governing body for planets, has been methodically hunting them down and Kyrus is as pure as they've seen. So it becomes a huge risk when Tilbarr, the captain of the Wolf, brings Kyrus on board his ship. Not that Tilbarr is afraid of the ConFed. Far from it. But the threat to Kyrus doesn’t just come from outside the Wolf and it isn’t long before Tilbarr realizes he may have to give up everything in order to save Kyrus; his ship, his crew and even his life. All in all, not a bad trade off.",
