  "description": "There’s been a mistake…\nOlympic athlete Sebastian Clarke has six weeks to repair the damage to his reputation or lose the funding he needs to finally win that gold. Working as a sports ambassador in England for the summer is the perfect way to prove to his sponsors that he’s still their wholesome hero, and to seal the deal, he’s hired a sweet university librarian to pose as his girlfriend. Cassie is nothing like the Las Vegas showgirls the media stirred the truth with last month, but when she turns up late for their first meeting, Seb doesn’t expect to find her with a large plate of food in her hands and a startled look in her eyes.\nAre you freaking kidding me?\nComputer-geek Helen Hobbs only borrowed Cassie’s access badge to snaffle a free meal—just her damn luck to be caught red-handed by a hunk of a man who immediately spouts on about contracts, rules and schedules. Helen tells him he’s made a mistake, but it’s too late. A journalist hungry for trash on the disgraced sporting star is already hot on their tail, so maybe now isn’t a good time to tell him she’s under police surveillance for accidentally working with one of the UK’s most wanted cyber criminals…Forced to hire Helen as his fake-girlfriend, can Sebastian keep this trouble magnet in line before she ruins his career? \nThey have a contract…\nBut who will be the first to break the rules?",
