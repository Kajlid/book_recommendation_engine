  "description": "The pathfinder, Shea, has chosen to make a place for herself among her former captors, leaving behind her people and the life she once knew. However, not all welcome this outsider in their midst. Shea will find that surviving alone in the wilderness is childâ€™s play next to navigating the politics that come with her new position. Especially when it becomes evident that there are those out for her blood. As a new danger looms on the horizon, Shea and her warlord will need all the allies they can find. Because something is stirring in the barren lands from which all beasts are born. Something old and not seen since the last cataclysm. Can Shea protect her people from this new threat or will it be the dangers from within her own inner circle that destroy her?",
