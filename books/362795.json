  "description": "Child bride Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart. Charmingly innocent, she dismissed the ancient feud that divided their families, and was totally unaware of his past exploits as the notorious pirate, Pagan. And Nathan was beguiled by Sara's sweet, defiant ways. But her love would soon be tested as a vile conspiracy tries to tear them apart.",
