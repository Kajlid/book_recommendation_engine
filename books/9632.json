  "description": "Welcome to New York City, and the world of publishing, interior design, fashion and food. As Elie Sands turns 50, she seems to have a charmed life. Executive editor of a top design magazine, she’s married to a furniture tycoon and the mother of two accomplished young women. She’s an avid cook, lives on Central Park West and owns a house in the Hamptons. Syd Sorenstein is Elie’s mentor and upstairs neighbor. A chic, opinionated financial advisor, widowhood has not extinguished her lust for living. A workout fanatic and world traveler, Syd does exactly as she sees fit, with little interest in what others think.Michael Delmonico, partner of Daniel, is entertaining and flamboyant. He is also self-centered and hopelessly disorganized, but has an eager list of clients waiting for his interior design services. Michael is Elie’s dearest friend, and Syd’s worst nightmare. Life is good. Or is it? Elie makes a distressing discovery, Syd’s reputation is threatened and Michael gets shocking news from his past. Instead of easing comfortably into middle-age, each is forced to deal with unforeseen challenges, unresolved issues and reassessing what lies ahead.",
