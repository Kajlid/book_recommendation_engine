So when Jackson offers an escape – a 2000-mile journey across the roughest country in the world – Aiden knows it's their only choice.They say there are a hundred ways to die on the Oregon Trail, and the long wagon journey is broken only by catastrophe: wolf attacks, rattlesnakes, deadly river crossings, Indians, and the looming threat of smallpox, \"the devil's paint.\" Through it all, Aiden and Maddy and a hundred fellow travelers move forward with a growing hope, and the promise of a new life in the Washington Territory.

Shackleton's Stowaway (\"Truly thrilling\" according to The Washington Post) was Victoria McKernan's first novel for young adults. She lives in Washington, D.C..",
