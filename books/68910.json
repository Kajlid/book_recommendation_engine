Wayne Robinson is the local hairdresser in the small college town he grew up in. Campy, demonstrative, an amateur artist and a romantic at heart, he quickly discovers an inferiority complex where Professor Adrian Taylor is concerned. Taylor is deeply closeted with a mania for privacy, a dry sense of humor and an endearing helplessness in matters of the heart. When he invites Wayne to move in as his 'tenant', their mutual misunderstanding of the arrangement causes conflict. The haunted house in the old part of town becomes a battleground as Wayne tries to retain his relationship with his new lover, his old friends, and his family.This story has been previously published.",
