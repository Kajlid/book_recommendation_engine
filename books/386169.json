Honor-bound to serve the First Lord in return for his life, Trell continues on his appointed path, yet each day unveils new and stranger secrets that eventually call into question everything he knows...Cephrael's Hand is a pattern of light - of one man who foresaw the end of the world and sacrificed everything to prevent its coming, of a royal family sundered by tragedy and betrayal, of a young Healer's search for a place and a people to call her own. And a pattern of shadow - of a dying race and the desperate gambits of those sworn to preserve it, of political treachery within a vast global plot, and of the single boy with colorless eyes who holds the key to it all.",
