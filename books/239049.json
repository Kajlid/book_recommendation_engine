  "description": "We’ve all heard the saying, “When life hands you lemons, make lemonade,” but what if the lemonade leaves a sour expression on your face? That’s what Dani wonders until the day she receives two perfect presents. Instead of letting life’s glitches set her back, Dani prevails. Ryker had only one aspiration when he left his hometown eight years ago, to be prosperous, but that blew up in his face when the love of his life left town. He takes his glitches and turns them into meaningless encounters with nameless women to feel adequate. Ryker and Dani bring new meaning to ‘keep your friends close and your enemies closer.’ What happens when Ryker is faced with the reality he left behind? What happens when Dani is faced with her past and the people who turned their backs on her?",
