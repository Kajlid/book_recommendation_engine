  "description": "\" This compelling, character-driven story will captivate even those with limited knowledge of Jewish history, the Nazis, or Eichmann and teach valuable lessons along the way. An engrossing mystery wrapped in a coming-of-age story and the heart-rending legacy of the Holocaust .\" - Kirkus Review (Starred Review)Susan Reich is a 17-year-old American who goes to Israel seeking to solve a family mystery. Susanâ€™s quest takes her to unexpected places where she confronts layers of history that she never knew. While trying to find her missing uncle, with the Adolf Eichmann trial in the background, she explores awakening emotions in herself and gets involved in the political struggles of the moment. The seven months that Roslyn Bernstein spent in Jerusalem in 1961, when she listened to the stories of immigrants and survivors and daydreamed about their meanings, was a source of inspiration for The Girl Who Counted Numbers . She has been attentive to historical accuracies of time and place but the story of Susan Reich, her family, and friends is fictional.",
