The guy he's had a crush on for months might make a wonderful dominant, but a straight dominant never did a gay submissive any good. It's time he stopped wasting his history lectures wondering what his life would be like if he belonged to James Ford.Ford's had enough. A man can only stay in the closet for so long. It's time he came out and made his peace with who he really is. And if he can get a date with the cute guy from his history lecture, so much the better.",
