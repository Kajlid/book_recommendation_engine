  "description": "BLACKWELL is a story about loyalty, friendship, conviction, and a danger that threatens to destroy it all. When visitors from another world show up at their Wyoming ranch, Rick and Jane Blackwell are amazed; first, by the proof that extraterrestrial intelligent life really exists, and second by the friendship that so easily forms. As the shock subsides and the language barrier is crossed, they settle into a new way of life. But when a stranger shows up, everything Rick thinks he knows falls under the shadow of doubt as he becomes an unwitting pawn in an ancient battle from another world. Has he been tricked into believing a lie? Will the truth be his demise or his salvation? Can he act in time to save his wife and new daughter? And what if the world found out what really happened at the Blackwell Ranch?BLACKWELL is your invitation to take another look up, and in, and imagine the possibilities.“A down-to-earth novel about aliens! BLACKWELL brings to mind Close Encounters and ET, in that the setting and characters are almost mundane in their familiarity, then along come these out-of-this-world beings. Michael Gunter has written a smart, fun and entertaining novel that’s full of heart.” – Marjorie Preston (Author, editor, and columnist for Beach Reads) “An almost perfect blend of the familiar and the exotic…A story that is impossible to put down…Appealing to an audience from eighteen to eighty, the science is believable and the events move quickly to create a story that will force you to choose between reading and sleep. I highly recommend this book for those who desire a tale to engross their imagination and challenge the way they understand people.” – James L. Grieme, (Pastor)BLACKWELL is also available in all e-book formats.",
