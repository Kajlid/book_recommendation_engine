In a quest to find out the worms’ special talent, Darwin played the bassoon to the worms to see if they could hear, laid out a picnic treasure hunt for them to see how well they could smell, among many other bizarre but entirely true experiments .But so far Darwin didn’t find anything extra special about worms. Until, one day he realized that worms do have a superpower. They POOP!
