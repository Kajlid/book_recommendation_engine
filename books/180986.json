  "description": "Darien’s best friends are the other guys in the rock band Heaven Sent. The three—now four—of them are closer than brothers to him and he’s happy that they’ve all found their life mates. He is. He doesn’t at all mind that each of those life mates are men. He doesn’t. In fact, that’s just it. Maybe there’s something to this gay stuff. He’s never been particularly interested before, but after a short, failed marriage, he’s willing to open himself up to new possibilities. Especially if one of those possibilities is the gorgeous lawyer who handled his divorce, Christopher Faith. Trouble is, Chris doesn’t seem to want to believe that Darien’s serious. Well, sure, Darien’s never slept with a guy before, but he’s allowed to change his mind. Isn’t he?[Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.]",
