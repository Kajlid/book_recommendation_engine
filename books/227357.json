He knows it’ll force my hand to break ties with the only family I have left in this world.But once The Tempest, the man with the iron heart, falls in love … he'll crush anyone who dares to take me away from him.I have no choice but to go down with his big ship.Hook, line, and goddamned sinker.The Tempest is a contemporary romance story of love, comedy and treachery.No cheating.
