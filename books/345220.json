  "title": "Stuart: A Life Backwards",
  "description": "In this extraordinary book, Alexander Masters has created a moving portrait of a troubled man, an unlikely friendship, and a desperate world few ever see. A gripping who-done-it journey back in time, it begins with Masters meeting a drunken Stuart lying on a sidewalk in Cambridge, England, and leads through layers of hell…back through crimes and misdemeanors, prison and homelessness, suicide attempts, violence, drugs, juvenile halls and special schools–to expose the smiling, gregarious thirteen-year-old boy who was Stuart before his long, sprawling, dangerous fall. Shocking, inspiring, and hilarious by turns,  A Life Backwards is a writer’s quest to give voice to a man who, beneath his forbidding exterior, has a message for us that every life–even the most chaotic and disreputable–is a story worthy of being told.",
