  "description": "Poetry. Gay & Lesbian Studies. \"Put whippets in your heart and let the rabbits breed. They will.\" Like still-wet lagomorphs crawling over each other in innate proximity, Peggy Munson's poems confine the reader \"inside a lantern, buzzing at the headlights.\" Munson addresses illness, family, and the blood running through both with malleable tenacity. Noelle Kocot describes Munson's work as \"free from a lot of the burden of contemporary poetry conventions, existing] like a small island in the fiery sun, alone, yet willing to be utterly beautiful, utterly strange and utterly itself.\" PATHOGENESIS was a finalist or semifinalist for numerous prizes, including the Dorset Prize, the Carnegie-Mellon Poetry Series, the Beatrice Hawley Award, the Verse Prize, and the University of Wisconsin Pollack Prize. Munson is the author of the novel, ORIGAMI STRIPTEASE, a finalist for the Lambda Literary Awards.",
