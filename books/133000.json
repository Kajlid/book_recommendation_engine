  "description": "I'm an omega used as scent bait for feral alphas fighting in underground deathmatches. I was told I’m an omega without a heat—a lie.The truth? My heats were medically suppressed, and now I’ve been sold as a secret weapon in a brutal underground where feral alphas are pitted against each other in fights to the death. When the Omega Crimes Bureau raids the ring, my dream of having love with a real pack seems within reach, but freedom is never that simple.I won’t leave my feral alphas behind, and what sane pack would accept living with two violent killers? This is an non-shifting omegaverse standalone featuring an abused FMC finding love with a pack of alpha men where she doesn't have to choose and neither do they. Includes an established MM relationship. Content includes dub con, abuse/harassment, superheats, emergency heat intervention, miss-matched pack, found family, violence, betrayal, dom/sub relationship, thought of self harm.",
