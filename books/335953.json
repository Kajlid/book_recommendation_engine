Wrought with teenaged angst, attraction, and the visceral confusion of not knowing who she is or what she wants, Kash learns what it is to share intimacy with the people in her life and discovers how that vulnerability affects her relationships with them. bedfellows explores the more metaphysical, philosophical side of love and intimacy as well as the relatable inner chaos of growing up.bedfellows will resonate with new adult and coming-of-age readers who are interested in both the complexities of growing up and the fleeting intimacies we share with those around us.",
