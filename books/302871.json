  "description": "They say that life can throw you a curve ball, but my life decided to go bigger. Life threw me a damn wrecking ball.Everything was going to plan; life was good, better than good. Until life decided to take my happiness, my dreams, my love, and destroy them.Life can be a real b*tch, and that’s putting it lightly.My whole world was turned completely upside down in just a few minutes; a few words changed it all.It forced me to change our dreams, forced me to do it alone.A new life, a new town, a whole new country.Is the quiet town of Baddeck Nova Scotia really ready for Esme Tucker?Suddenly a clumsy, foul mouthed Brit crashes into their town.A delicate English rose she is not. She isn’t afraid to speak her mind, even when it comes to a 6ft 4 brooding lumberjack.Not at all phased by his good looks, his deep chocolate eyes, or that delectable dusting of stubble along his jaw, Esme Tucker isn’t interested.All she sees is a rude and grumpy guy who annoys her far too much.A new home, job, life, and then a new love.Tiers Of Joy will pull on your heart strings while making you laugh out loud.It’s a romcom with heart breaking emotion mixed together with an abundance of inappropriate humour and bad language!",
