  "description": "They can save millions of lives, if she doesn’t kill them firstTourist Raymond Molina finds the body of a young biologist in a Costa Rican bay—apparent victim of a shark attack—but no one knows how she got there. As Ray searches for what really happened to her, he stumbles onto the best kept secret in the natural world.This is a secret hidden for centuries by residents of the coastal town of Sonara, protected by intelligent but violent animals unknown anywhere else on earth, and coveted by a massive biotech company that will do anything to discover the truth—no matter the cost.And behind it all is a creature with the power to cure disease, all disease…or kill everyone on earth.*\"The surf sequences are drawn by the hand of a virtuoso, and the wasp sequence had me laughing and crying out loud... This is easily five stars—I’d give it more if I could.\" - Dr. Heather Carter, author of The Black Unicorn",
