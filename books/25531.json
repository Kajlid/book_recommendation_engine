The truth perhaps lies somewhere in between, and depends entirely upon whom you ask…Dwarf slayer Gotrek Gurnisson and his sworn human companion Felix Jaeger are beset by a new and terrible foe in their unceasing war against Chaos. When a powerful evil forms in darkest Sylvania, it threatens to reach out and tear the very heart out of the Empire – and out of Felix's relationship with Ulrika. But when this foe is a powerful, centuries old vampire, the deadly battle can only result in death and tragedy.",
