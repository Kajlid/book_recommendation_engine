  "description": "A son in danger \nThe Demon Horde MC are no strangers to breaking the rules, but making a man pay to get his son back crosses one too many lines for Skeeter. He'll do anything, including play by the book, if it means bringing his son home. Hiring straitlaced attorney Miriam Englestein is meant to solve his problems, not create new ones. One look at her and his good-guy facade goes out the window. He wants to throw his buttoned-up lawyer onto the back of his bike and make her his.  \nA woman at risk \nMiri wants nothing to do with the club. Her father may be in their pocket, but she's on the right side of the law and she intends to stay there. But there's something about Skeeter's plea—something about him—she can't walk away from. While she's tempted to let him do unspeakably wicked and delicious things to her, she can't risk her law practice, or her heart. \nA dangerous deception  \nWhen Miriam agrees to pose as Skeeter's woman to get details they need for the case, things heat up fast—and it's not long before the lines between business and personal blur, and they're both in over their heads. In the MC world, lies have a way of coming back to you, and they put everyone at risk.  This book is approximately 60,000 words  \nOne-click with confidence. This title is part of the \n\nCarina Press Romance Promise\n\n: all the romance you're looking for with an HEA/HFN. It's a promise!",
