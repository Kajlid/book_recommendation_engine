  "description": "Liz is having a crappy day. First she loses her job. Then she spots a flyer for a punk show that is covered in fae glamour. And the entire reason she moved to the humdrum ‘burbs was to avoid all the supernatural crap she’s been seeing since she was a kid.It stands to reason she should avoid the show, but curiosity wins out. And her senses didn’t fail her. A punk band consisting of a succubus, a satyr and a siren can only spell one thing—trouble.When Liz lets it slip that she’s no average human, the siren takes a keen interest in her. Even without his otherworldly abilities, those skillful bass-playing fingers and the interest in those gorgeous blue eyes are enough to reel Liz in. Combine that with the promise in his wicked smile and Liz just may be on the way to turn her rotten day around.",
