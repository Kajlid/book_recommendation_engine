  "title": "The Wretched of the Earth: The Handbook for the Black Revolution That is Changing the Shape of the World",
  "description": "Frantz Fanon was one of the twentieth centuryâ€™s most important theorists of revolution, colonialism, and racial difference, and this, his masterwork, is a classic alongside Orientalism and The Autobiography of Malcolm XThe Wretched of the Earth is a brilliant analysis of the psychology of the colonized and their path to liberation. Bearing singular insight into the rage of colonized peoples and the role of violence in historical change, the book also incisively attacks postindependence disenfranchisement of the masses by the elite on one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other. A veritable handbook of social reorganization for leaders of emerging nations, The Wretched of the Earth has had a major impact on civil rights, anticolonialism, and black-consciousness movements around the world. This new translation updates its language for a new generation of readers and its lessons are more vital now than ever.From the back cover:Written in anger, this book by a distinguished Negro psychiatrist and leading spokesman of the revolution which won independence for Algeria is no mere diatribe against the white man or the West. It is a brilliant examination of the role of violence in effecting historical change which has served leaders of emerging nations as a veritable handbook of revolutionary practice and social reorganization.An Evergreen Black Cat Book B-342-K",
