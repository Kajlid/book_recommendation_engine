  "description": "Our dogs love, worship, and adore us (or so we hope) but what's really going on in those canine minds when they're giving us \"the look\" or staring off into the distance? Doggitude takes a light-hearted look at the irreverent inner dialogs of 36 endearing dogs, expressed in sassy haiku. Each dog is featured on a two-page spread which includes a beautiful full-page watercolor portrait and loving, often poignant anecdotes about the dog shared by the owner.Doggitude is sure to appeal to anyone who loves dogs, dog art, and dog humor.From Julie Hill, host of DogCast Radio: \"The stunning portraits capture the beauty and character of a wide variety of breeds and mixes. Tenderness, boldness, and playfulness are all depicted in breathtaking detail. Sure to tug at the heartstrings of all dog lovers and raise smiles. Author and artist Carole Pivarnik catches the spirit and soul of her subjects; the expressions in the eyes are exquisite. I defy anyone to choose a favourite!\"",
