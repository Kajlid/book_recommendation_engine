  "description": "Time is running out. But what will destroy them first? Secrets? Lies? Or magic?  I’m in trouble. Big trouble. A split-second reflex that saved Kol’s life, and all hell busted out. Rather, my secret busted out for all to see. Now the only thing keeping a lid on my wild, unpredictable magic is Cassius’s magical handcuffs. Kinky? Yeah, no.  I need to show Gideon, Marcus, Jacob, and Kol that my nephilim blood is the only thing I lied about, even if it means letting my memories be mined for the truth. Except when that soul-scraping spell comes up hard against an unbreakable magical wall, it reveals a secret that’s news even to me.  But finding the answers will have to wait. A new danger threatens the city. Three glyph witches so powerful every body-shredding battle leaves my guys barely alive.  We don’t know what the witches’ end game is, but if we don’t figure out how to play — and how to harness my magic — we’ll lose. And so will every innocent civilian we’ve sworn to protect.  Destined Storm is the fourth book in the Nephilim’s Destiny series, an action-packed full-length paranormal romance with four irresistible guys and a kick-ass heroine who doesn’t have to choose.",
