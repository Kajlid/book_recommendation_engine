  "description": "Dear Author,I walked into the shower room at the gymnasium to cool down after exercise the other day. Suddenly the door to the steam room opened and a cloud of steam rolled out enveloping one of the most handsome nearly naked men I have ever seen. A strategically draped towel added interest. Was he real or was the steam slowly dissolving wings?This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
