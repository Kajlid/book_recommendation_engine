  "description": "Daemon uth Friesard is the unwilling king of Phalindros. Because both his older brothers have died, he finds himself in a role he doesn't want and isn't suited for. With a domineering mother, an ice cold wife, a tempting minstrel, and a failing friendship, it's all he can do to keep from falling into the same kind of darkness that took his father.  Clayden Kiel is the youngest High Priest in the history of Phalindros. He is also a Chosen of the gods, gifted with direct communion to the god of light, Basale. A war is coming, a war that he would like to avoid. But the gods are of little help, seeking only to influence so far as to not affect free will, and there are secrets to be kept. Secrets belonging not only to himself and his time, but going all the way back to the founding of the kingdom. As Clayden struggles with his own inner demons as well as those of his long time friend, the king, he must find a way to put aside his humanity in order to better serve the gods and to save the kingdom from a devastating war. Easier said than done.",
