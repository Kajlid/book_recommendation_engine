  "title": "Tink",
  "description": "Temporary blurb:Tink is Book 3 in the highly anticipated Neverland Novels; an adult contemporary romance retelling of the Peter Pan stories featuring the entire cast of Neverland characters as orphans who end up as mechanics--the Tink and the Lost Boys doing legitimate work at Peter's shop, LB Automotive, while Hook and his crew work for the sadistic Neverland crime boss, Croc. This story is about the only girl raised with eleven other orphans at the School for Lost Boys of Neverland. Now that her lifetime of unrequited love with Peter is over, she turns her focus to her favorite hobby--rebuilding and customizing old cars that can't cause her any heartache or reject her like her mother did when she was little. She's perfectly content spending all her time with the junkers, but Michael Darling has other ideas, and as much as she tries to ignore him and his ornery teenage foster daughter, the two start worming their way into her damaged heart and soon the girl who thought she never truly fit finds that maybe she has a place where she belongs after all.",
