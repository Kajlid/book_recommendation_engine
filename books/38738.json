  "title": "Pauline Johnson: Selected Poetry and Prose",
  "description": "Pauline Johnson was an unusual and unique presence on the literary scene during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A female voice among an almost entirely male writing community, she drew on her gender and her unique origins  half-aboriginal, half-English  developing a unique perspective in her lyrical poems and her recounting of Native myths and legends. She captivated her audiences on both sides of the Atlantic by infusing drama into her readings. Her writings assembled here represent poems from her collection Flint and Feather, coupled with her stories and legends of British Columbia that appeared in Legends of Vancouver. Although her life was cut short by illness, Pauline Johnson, or Tekahionwake, as she was known to her people, has been the subject of several biographies and remains a writer of compelling interest to the present day.",
