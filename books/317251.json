  "description": "Welcome to Rosedale High. New halls, new classes, same old bullies.Meet Emily, a closeted trans teen ostracized both at school and in his own home. Now meet new-to-Rosedale Cole, a Hispanic freshman excited by the prospect of living in a more diverse area. In such a populated school, there is no reason for their paths to cross, until they find a common enemy in the ruthless and unrelenting school bully, Robert. With the help of an ally, it seems there may be light at the end of the tunnel for Emily and Cole, but how far will Robert go to ensure they remain in their place as outcasts?In this first volume of Theory of Reality , Mendoza builds multi-dimensional characters in a world that explores the intersection of identity, mental illness, and environment. For those who have ever felt alone and underrepresented, Emily and Cole are waiting for you in a heart-wrenching story meant to remind all readers that “although our diverse identities mean we experience things differently, trauma doesn’t discriminate.”",
