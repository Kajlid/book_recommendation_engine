It seems impossible for his big dream to come true. But then Egon meets the little ballet girl Lisa and his dream may come true yet… With dance instructions and music suggestions for parents and their children. You, too, can dance like Lisa and Egon! Also recommended for teachers and dancing instructors. “Lisa and Egon – A Hippo Learns To Dance” is a book about friendship. And about never giving up. Live your dream! Hippos, too, can dance, if they really want to.",
