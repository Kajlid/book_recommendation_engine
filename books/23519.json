  "title": "Under A Fairy Moon",
  "description": "Addy Marten sets out to explore her new neighbour's beautiful garden, and especially the rows of mysterious stone statues that she has glimpsed through her bedroom window. Instead of the enticing hideaway she has imagined, however, she finds herself trapped in the Median Realms, and an unwilling pawn in a game of Fairy Chess. She must use all her courage and wits to win the game and free herself from malicious fairy creatures and their twisted fairy-tale world. -- “A misbehaving pixie named Enitua steals the limelight as the novel's most precocious character and later becomes a key ally in guarding the human's safety.” -- Publishers Weekly Reviewer (Amazon Breakthrough Novel Awards, 2010)",
