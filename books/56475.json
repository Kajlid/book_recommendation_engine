  "description": "Trust is not high on straight-talking rancher Dan Jarrett's list. He doesn't believe there are many people worthy of it. Case-in-point: his new stepfather. His widowed mother says it was love at first sight, but Dan is convinced the man is a con artist spending his mother's nest egg. And the only reason Dan's going on the family holiday cruise is to gain time to prove his suspicions. After losing both of her parents to cancer, E.R. nurse Sunny Elders cherishes any time she can spend with the loved ones she has left-her sister's family. Relaxing together on a cruise filled with love and laughter sounds like the perfect prescription for healing. And Sunny's unsinkable spirit and her maddening penchant for zany disasters provide an ample dose of both.Collision Course. Troubled Waters Ahead!",
