Once he freed himself from that life, Deacon was hesitant to allow anyone in, fearful of the DNA running through his veins.

When a beautiful woman enters the police department, the same day he turns in his letter of resignation, he knows he'll do everything to protect her, including delaying his own plans to keep her safe, and have the chance to show her they belong together.\nShe's always preferred reading fairy tales to living her reality…\nAside from her parents, Leah Taylor has felt as if she's on the outside looking in her entire life.
