  "description": "Sparkling with wit, wisdom and wonderful songs including, \"I Could Have Danced All Night\", \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\" and \"Get Me To The Church On Time\", the musical play based on Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" has been delighting audiences since it was first performed in the 1950s. When overbearing Professor Higgins stumbles on flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, in Covent Garden he recognizes that her hideous vowels and forgotten consonants are all that separate her from the upper classes. Higgins wagers that he can pass her off as a Duchess in a matter of weeks. But what will become of Eliza when the bet is over? This edition of \"My Fair Lady\" includes the complete script and a selection of black and white stills from the Oscar-winning film starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison.",
