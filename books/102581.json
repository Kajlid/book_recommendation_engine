  "title": "From Border to Border:  Crossing the Continent by Land Rover",
  "description": "Starting an expedition requires planning, faith, and ignorance. When I set off on a trans-continental expedition in a vintage Land Rover I was strong on the second two.For Land Rover’s 50th anniversary in 1998 I joined a group of fifty people from all over North America to travel off-road from Canada to Mexico. Acting as my co-drivers were my brother, father, and girlfriend, in order of declining mechanical ability and increasing attractiveness. Our caravan was populated by mismatched lovers, computer geeks, crusty mountain men, and white-haired academics, yet all shared a passion for rugged trucks and some of the country’s most spectacular landscapes.From the wind-blasted bleakery of central Canada to the rocky playground of Moab, brake failure on a New Mexico hill to a harrowing drive up a flooding river, my journey hit incredible highs and lows before my luck finally ran out on the return home.",
