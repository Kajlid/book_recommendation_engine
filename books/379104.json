  "title": "In the Company of Soldiers: A Chronicle of Combat in Iraq",
  "description": "During the recent war in Iraq, renowned historian Rick Atkinson was embedded with the 101st Airbourne Division of the US forces. He had access to the headquarters command post and the top-secret plans tent and spent most days at the elbow of Major General David H. Petraeus as he directed attacks on the cities of Najaf, Karbala, Hilla and, ultimately, southern Baghdad. This short book, written with a strong first-person narrative, will not only provide a unique insight into the course of events; using the microcosm of the 101st, Atkinson will also reveal much about the contemporary US military and the soldiers who compose it. In his unique hands this book is set to become a classic of war journalism and the only book to buy for an insider's account of America's war in Iraq.",
