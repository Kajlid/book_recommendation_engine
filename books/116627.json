It was only supposed to be one night, one brief departure from my real life, but nothing ever works out exactly the way you plan.Colton Waters was everything from my past that didn't fit into my present, so why did he have to show up at my college and pledge the one frat I couldn't avoid?Because nothing is ever meant to happen just once. At least not the life changing things that mean the difference between falling apart and falling in love.",
