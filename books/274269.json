  "description": "\"That Mr. Prendergast is unusually well-equipped to discuss both the technology and the aesthetics of film music is revealed once more in this second edition, particularly in the new section on synthesizers. And in this discussion he is disarmingly frank and perceptive. The hands-on experience he has had as one of Hollywood's leading music editors has allowed him to make comments and judgments that serve the history of film music.\" â€•William Kraft, composer, from the Foreword In addition to the new material on the synthesizer mentioned above, the author has completely reviewed the four parts of the book and integrated new material where appropriate: History (an overview from the silent films to the present); Aesthetics (the artistic purposes film music serves and the forms it takes); Technique (how to synchronize music to picture and the special demands of television); and Contemporary Techniques and Tools (comprising video post-production, digital audio, and other innovations). A completely updated bibliography rounds out this informative study.",
