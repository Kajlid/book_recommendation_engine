  "description": "Sandra Brown’s classic love stories have long captivated readers with “larger than life heroines [that] make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life.”* Now, for the first time in hardcover, comes her exquisite novel of two people whose newfound attraction compels them to see other in . . . A WHOLE NEW LIGHT Cyn McCall knew she could always count on her late husband’s friend and business partner, Worth Lansing. He could make her laugh and forget her problems. She could tease him about his many romantic entanglements. The last thing Cyn expected was to find herself longing for a man who could never settle down.When Worth invites Cyn to a getaway weekend in Acapulco, he doesn’t expect to be sharing a room—or to respond to her the way he does to any beautiful woman. While he thinks it’s time Cyn stopped mourning and moved forward with her life, he can’t escape the feeling he’s betraying his friend’s memory. But even guilt can’t stop the desire that overwhelms him—and ultimately overtakes them both.Cyn wants to believe their night of passion was sparked by the exotic locale and intoxicating scent of hibiscus. But Worth knows they share something deeper, something that will outlast the Mexican sunglow. He knows he’s finally ready to stop playing games . . . if only Cyn would open her heart to new possibilities and the promise of love.",
