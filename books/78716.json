  "description": "Last year, my friends and I discovered something... We hate everything but boys! Take Jeff, for instance. Sometimes I think he really likes me, and then he goes nuts over that stuck-up Sue-Ann, who chases him like mad. And I'm not the only one with boy troubleâ€”my friends are in the same boat.That's why I started the WE HATE EVERYTHING BUT BOYS club. I made each of the members swear to do anything to find out who her true love really likes. Of course, I had no idea how much trouble that would cause. Me and my big ideas!",
