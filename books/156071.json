  "description": "Tyler Stone has always been a loyal soldier, a good soldier, for the Xen Empire and—based upon recent events in his life—it seems as though the world in which he’s always lived has finally started to pay him back. A promotion, an engagement to a beautiful (and powerful) woman, and the restoration of his family's honor. But this newfound prestige comes with a price, and Stone is soon ordered to carry out a fool's mission by a commander who is unfit to lead. Amidst the decimation of his battalion, his eyes are opened to the truth via a most unlikely source, a woman, from the same people who are his sworn enemies. As he struggles to understand the nature of the war his home planet has been waging for so many generations, Stone must accept that his fate is his responsibility alone. He is willing to die for his country; is he willing to kill for it too?",
