  "description": "Diz and Clarissa Are Back for the Holidays!  It’s Christmas Eve in Baltimore, and you know what that means . . . snow. Lots of it. Join our dynamic duo as they battle the elements, each other, and a Siberian husky named Sadie—all in an ill-fated attempt to host their first holiday party. “Blended Families,” the latest tale of Diz and Clarissa, is a rollicking, yuletide romp that combines Meet the Parents with The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Join Diz and Clarissa as they welcome Bernard and Elspeth Wiley, Art and Maggie Gillespie, a priest, an ex-nun, a German widow, a felonious Siberian husky, and a well-dressed Whippet named Maris.  Three combines the all-new “Blended Families” with the bonus addition of two previously published Diz and Clarissa stories, “Nevermore!” and A Christmas Tree Grows in Baltimore. The trilogy is a holiday omnibus not to be missed.",
