  "description": "Meet Eddie Kane: ex-cokehead and current, clueless sidekick to the enigmatic Calif Cryste, badass vampire hunter extraordinaire-and unforthcoming warrior of God. In the midst of a two-man crusade to put a kibosh on the vampire populations currently besieging the tribal lands of the Midwest, Eddie can't help but notice that the string of death and destruction in their wake has begun to draw a certain, uncomfortable amount of attention from the local media. Enter obsessed FBI Special Agent Doug Degulchi, suspended from the bureau over his proofless conviction that these two are \"the guys,\" and Eddie finds himself an unwilling player in an over-arching drama as Calif's own misguided sort of apostles begin to fall into place. Meanwhile, the vampire hordes race to multiply their ranks in anticipation of a coming battle even Calif cannot (or will not) predict, and Eddie hasn't even had a chance to face his own demons yet. Whether or not Eddie's prepared to accept the truth, though, the second-born is here to wage war... on his own, if he has to.",
