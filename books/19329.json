  "description": "WHO ORDERED THE HIT ON RUSH LIMBAUGH? It’s 2015. A Republican choke hold on the White House and Congress is in its second decade. Desperate Democrats continue to be pilloried in the polls and each election year, their party's faithful become fewer and fewer. Facing extinction by the GOP, a splinter group of Democrats hatches a frightful solution. With the help of an organized crime lord, they plot to assassinate the mouthpiece of the Republican juggernaut conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. The Assassination of Rush Limbaugh is the fascinating multi-generational tale of two immigrant families set on a collision course one beholden to Democratic ideals and social change, the other quickly absorbed by the underworld. For nearly a century, the two families’ paths crisscross, until fate pits the scion of one family against the descendant of the other. The harrowing race to thwart the assassination of Rush leads to a spellbinding showdown that will have reverberations for generations to come. Set against a backdrop of national politics, social upheaval, and the rise of talk radio, The Assassination of Rush Limbaugh is a breathless, brilliant thriller for our political times.",
