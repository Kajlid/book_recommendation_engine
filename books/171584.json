  "description": "Highlighting Eric Hobsbawm's passionate concern for the lives and struggles of ordinary men and women, Uncommon People brings back into print his classic works on labor history, working people, and social protest, pairing them with more recent, previously unpublished pieces on everything from the villainy of Roy Cohen to the genius of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Billie Holliday. Uncommon People offers both an exciting introduction for the uninitiated as well as a broad-ranging retrospective of the work of \"the best-known living historian in the world\" (The Times, London).",
