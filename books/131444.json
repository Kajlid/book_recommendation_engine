  "description": "At 39, a new divorcee, and a college literature professor, Gillian mostly spends her days on work and books. Her house is a bit of a mess and she should probably get out more often instead of watching infomercials, but apart from that she manages well on her own. She has a sweet classic Mustang, an insatiable makeup addiction, and an attraction to drinking wine. On the surface, her life looks better than average. Though she cannot see it herself, Gillian’s life is a bit rusty. It takes a dark poet, named Blake Garrett, to brighten her vision. Gillian’s story involves a dying houseplant, an accidental encounter with a transvestite support group, a brilliant young student, the annoying Seth character, a bit of kink, and a riveting conversation about Abraham Lincoln's preferred method of cooking an egg. Gillian wasn’t looking for anything. It’s a good thing Blake finds her.Author's Note: This is my first work. I would love for you to rank, review, and share it!",
