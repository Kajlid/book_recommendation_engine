  "description": "It's time to sleep, it's time to sleep,the fishes croon in waters deep.The songbirds sing in trees above,\"It's time to sleep, my love, my love.\"As children prepare for bed, the world around them is also settling down for the night. Animals who live in the jungle, the forest, the sea--all whisper to their babies a soft refrain: It's time to sleep, my love.As comforting as a soft blanket and warm as a goodnight hug, Eric Metaxas's lullaby is lovingly brought to life by bestselling artist Nancy Tillman (On the Night You Were Born), whose illustrations celebrate the wonders of the natural world, and the bonds of family.It's Time to Sleep, My Love is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
