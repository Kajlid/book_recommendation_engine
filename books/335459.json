Javier Falcón has been through therapy and is in the process of breaking free of the psychological damage sustained during his last major investigation. Called to the scene of a suspicious suicide in a wealthy neighborhood on the outskirts of Seville, he begins to investigate a case with no solid evidence when suddenly, in quick succession, two more suicides occur-one of them a fellow police officer in the sex crimes unit.
