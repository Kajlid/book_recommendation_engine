  "title": "Confessions of the Evolutionists",
  "description": "Ever since it was first put forward, certain materialist circles have attempted to portray the theory of evolution as scientific fact. In fact, however, the theory, which claims that life emerged as the result of chance processes, has been utterly disproved by various branches of science. Over the 150 or so years separating Charles Darwin, the founder of the theory, and the present day, such scientific fields as paleontology, biochemistry, genetics and anatomy have demolished the theory’s assumptions. The more the details of nature have been revealed, the more extraordinary characteristics have been discovered that can never be explained in terms of chance.For all these reasons, in the words of the famous molecular biologist Professor Michael Behe, evolution is “A theory in crisis.”From time to time, this crisis leads scientists who support the theory to make a number of confessions. They reject the theory not despite their materialist preconceptions, but because they realize that it flies in the face of scientific findings.In this book you will find statements made by these evolutionist scientists regarding the theory they believe in. Hundreds of evolutionists, from Charles Darwin to eminent present-day supporters of his theory, such as Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Leakey, have admitted that it is groundless, incorrect, and even ridiculous.If you want to see why not even Darwinism’s most determined proponents believe in it, you must read this book.",
