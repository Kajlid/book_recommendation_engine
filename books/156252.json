  "description": "Damien, Alpha of the San Antonio pack had thought it was an awesome idea to take his mate, Scott, back to his ex-home pack to catch up with his parents and ex-Alpha. He had assumed that his power as a wolf, and the fact that he was from such a large pack would guarantee both men a good time. A homophobic Alpha and a disgruntled mother are just two of the problems the men face. In fact if Damien isn't careful his mate might not make it back to Texas alive. Included as a free read - Malacai Finds His Mate Malacai, Second in the San Antonio Pack has waited over eighty years to find his true mate. When he and his Alpha Damien rescue a young shifter from a hole under a kitchen he never believed his search was finally over. Unfortunately life has a habit of intervening and the path to his HEA was going to take a lot more work than he had bargained on. This is Book 3.5 of the Cloverleah Pack series and is based on the characters in Book 3 (When No Doesn't Cut It). While it contains enough back story to be read as a standalone, if you want to know more about the characters then please read Books 1 - 3. Warning: This book is about gay wolf shifters. It contains some violence, male-male sexual acts, anal intercourse, oral sex and rimming. If you object to these things please look elsewhere for your reading pleasure.",
