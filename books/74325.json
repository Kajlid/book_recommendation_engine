  "description": "Update: A new on-line ebook based on the Third Edition is now available. See the \"other editions\" or \"all editions\" links in the book details below.The Third Edition of Nutrition For Children: Practical and To-The-Point adds more foods for the nutrient choline, includes a comparison between Nutrition Facts labels and the newer Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) system, and adds a nutrient \"life list\" chapter to aid in planning menus for your family.One goal for this book is that each edition should be more sufficient for answering common questions about what children need to eat to receive adequate nutrition. For example, Nutrition Facts product labels are generally designed for adults, and the Third Edition provides tables showing how to make this information applicable to children, based on the more age-specific DRIs.In an era of jaw-dropping costs for medical procedures, many traditionally expensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, start to look very affordable considering that they provide the beneficial nutrients, fiber, and anti-oxidants that everyone needs. With some planning, it is possible to build confidence that a child is receiving adequate amounts of every essential nutrient, which is an important milestone in establishing their long-term health.",
