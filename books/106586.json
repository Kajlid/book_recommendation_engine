  "description": "Books have always been Juliet Marlowe's sanctuary; the one place she would never be judged or made to feel like an outcast. But when tragedy strikes, she has to get her nose out of the antique tomes she prefers and become the guardian of her five younger brothers and sisters.Jules struggles to make ends meet. And with the constant threat of losing custody of her siblings if she doesn't maintain the standard of living previously set by her parents, she finds herself forced to make tough decisions and take risks.One thing she knows for certain is she definitely does not have room in her life for a relationship. Especially with a man who's trying to readjust to civilian life and who once held a starring role in her secret fantasies. No, absolutely not, she does not have any room in her life for Roman Price and his smoldering gaze that triggers her irritating blushes with only a thought.But when everything Jules has built threatens to collapse on her, she finds herself not only accepting Roman's offer of help, but starts to question whether or not she misjudged the situation from the beginning.Also included, the first chapters of Kristen's previous releases!",
