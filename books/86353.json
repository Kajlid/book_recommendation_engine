  "description": "My Adventures with la Femme Charmée, the New York City travelog/diary of the New York Flaneur as told to alter ego David St.-Lascaux, is a rollicking, riveting true story, and groundbreaking combination of cultural celebration and explicit erotica.\tCompleting a family of diaries set in several of the Great Western Cities, and modeled after those of Samuel Pepys, John Evelyn and James Boswell (London) and Anais Nin (Paris), My Adventures introduces le Flaneur and his exuberant co-protagonist and titular heroine, the Enchanted Woman. My Adventures notes numerous events (art, dance, music and theater), boldfaces the many talented New Yorkers le Flaneur meets, incorporates wide-ranging references to literature, details la Femme Charmée's gastronomic delights, and notes aesthetic landmarks to provide a flavor of living in New York City today.\tDiary entries in My Adventures alternate with blushing \"pink pages\"; (les pages rouges), documentary erotica in Google French followed by translations into English. These humorous, explicit entries deliciously detail le Flaneur's sex life with la Femme Charmée. \tMy Adventures with la Femme Charmee is unabridged; it is also published as a trilogy: The Fountain, Her Secret and High Five.\tMy Adventures will be of interest to today's readers for its encyclopedic cultural references and uninhibited eroticism, and to future generations for its incisive expression of the Zeitgeist of New York City in the early Twenty-first Century.",
