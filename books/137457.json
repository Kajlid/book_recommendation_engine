  "description": "It’s not easy being an adopted, astraphobic ballet dancer from Canada, trying to make friends in a new country, but when eight year old Callie Clay saved the boy at the gorge on her first day in Horizon, she scored two best friends, a red baseball cap, and a reputation for being a risk-taking weirdo. Eight years later, Hunter and Ryan had been given pamphlets on what to do when they started noticing girls, but nothing could have prepared them for the changes that came over their tomboy friend and so they handled it as hormonal teenage boys do; badly. One moment, they were a band on the precipice of their first big gig and the next, Callie is having a nervous breakdown and running naked into the eye of Cyclone Addison. When Callie returns, she's no longer the girl next door but a goddess with one purpose; To shatter one of the hearts of the men she's forbidden to love, by using the other- for the sake of The Harmony, and to save her own ass.Go back to when the music defined lives, the butterflies of first love consumed every thought and brace yourself for a ride to Oblivion and back! Passion, anguish, sex, drugs and rock 'n roll… Unchained Melody is an epic Paranormal Romance served with a pair of Doc Martens and a trip down Melody lane! *Contains some very adult themes*",
