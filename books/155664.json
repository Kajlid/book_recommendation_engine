  "description": "Jason Fowler has just slept with the devil.\nWaking up beside Blanche might be the best thing he’s ever done in the past ten years. But when an unexpected text message appears on Blanche’s phone, Jason’s world is about to come crashing down. \nBlanche is in more danger than she thought.\nWhen she doesn’t report back in time to the cartel, an undertaker is sent to clean up any mess that might’ve been left behind. With the Jason and the Devils on one side and the merciless cartel on the other, Blanche may find that this is the end of the road. \nJason knows what he has to do.\nThe realization that he’s just bedded the cartel’s most dangerous assassin leaves Jason reeling. He knows what it’ll take to ensure his club’s survival. But knowing what must be done and actually carrying it out is two different things, and he’s not sure—when push comes to shove—that he’ll be able to do what is necessary.",
