  "title": "Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Vampire Stories",
  "description": "Lesbian vampires — the quintessential bad girls — indulge in their perverse pleasures in this red-hot collection.The female vampire is so deliciously wicked that her powerful sexual nature was hidden for centuries. But the vampire story has always been one of submerged eroticism. The vampire emerges from the shadows, seduces her intended victim, and feeds on her, defying all rules in her pursuit of pleasure. In Daughters of Darkness, editor Pam Keesey brings the eroticism of the female vampire front and center with explicit tales from some of the finest contemporary queer writers. Patrick Califia’s “The Vampire” confounds conventional views of the subject as he uncovers Sapphic bloodlust in the S/M netherworld. Katherine V. Forrest imagines the lesbian vampire cruising the galaxies in search of bed-and-blood partners in the witty sci-fi adventure “O Captain, My Captain.” In “Louisiana: 1850,” Lambda Award-winner Jewelle Gomez delights readers with a curious ménage in the antebellum South. Also included is the first major lesbian vampire tale, J. Sheridan Le Fanu’s “Carmilla” (1871).",
