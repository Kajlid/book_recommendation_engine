Wicked -, Book 2 Harrison Jennera Abbot was born with a silver broomstick in her hand. Heiress to a Magian dynasty. Good witch extraordinaire. She-s sick of it. She longs to be human, normal like her friend Callie. Or, uh, as normal as Callie ever gets. She thought running away would be an adventure, but three months playing human has given her a new point of view. Just as she-s ready to return home, though, the real adventure begins. In short order, she's attacked, saved, kidnapped...and seduced. Jacob and Ric are convinced that Harrison is the destined third of their triad-if they can convince her they won't use her as a sexual chew toy, or a social stepping stone. Before they can make her beg for the match, though, she needs to know the truth about who tried to kill her. And why her brother keeps sending her cryptic psychic messages. Hard as it might be on their Magian male pride, they may have to let her go-trusting that in the end, she'll choose them. Contains an accidental orgasm, crimes of passion, sentient ropes,powerful witches and bisexual Magians being magically delicious. Oh, and a charmed shower that only lives to please you.",
