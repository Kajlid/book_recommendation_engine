  "description": "England, 1810. The north is governed by a single rule. Faerie will take as it pleases.\nWilliam Loxley is cursed. A pale and monstrous creature haunts his dreams, luring him from London to the desolate, grey landscape of his forgotten childhood. There, it will use him to open a door to Faerie—a fate that will trap Loxley in that glittering, heathen otherworld forever.His only hope of escaping the creature's grasp lies with John Thorncress, a dark and windswept stranger met on the moors. The longer Loxley stays in Thorncress' company, the harder it becomes to fight his attraction to the man. Such attraction can only end in heartbreak—or the noose.But Thorncress has his own bleak ties to Faerie. They come creeping in with the frost, their howls carrying on the winter wind. If Thorncress' past catches up with him before they can break the curse, then Loxley will not only lose his soul.He'll lose Thorncress, too.\"Beautifully creepy and eerily magical, with a bittersweet romance that I loved.\"  - Stephanie Burgis, author of Snowspelled and Masks and Shadows",
