  "description": "A new kind of picture book that combines pictures and words with actions. Children touch picture buttons and each button is coupled with a response that the reader and child perform together. Kids love interacting with the reader and the fun exchanges promote early literacy by keeping active kids entertained as they learn the meanings of words. To buy, or see a video of the book in action, visit www.pictivities.com or click on the Amazon link below.",
