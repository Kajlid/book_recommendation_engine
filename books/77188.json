  "description": "Ethan is different. He is gorgeous, easy to talk to, and a uniquely gifted pianist. But his musical talent is both a gift and a curse. The doctors label him a schizophrenic, as he claims to have been taught by a long-dead, 19th-century composer. Clare doesn't know what to believe and she's determined to help Ethan find out the truth about himself, even if it means having little time for anything else-including her best friend, Liz. When Liz, feeling completely betrayed, reveals Ethan's secret, she sets in motion a tragic turn of events that ripples throughout the entire community. Beautifully written in provocative prose, her is Anna Myers at her finest. Ethan Between Us is a powerful story, told in the absorbed and guarded voice of a teenage girl, who ultimately discovers the transforming power of truth and friendship.",
