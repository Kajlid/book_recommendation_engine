Try taking one home to meet Mom…The world fell apart after a virus killed billions, and turned most male survivors into violent wolfmen. That left the world in the hands of a lot of lonely women… As the last gay man standing, how much worse could things get?I thought getting captured by said wolfmen -- who don’t tolerate smart mouthed humans -- topped the list. Although that turned out to have a silver lining named Mace. Best sex of my life and he cares enough to fight for me. Life was starting to look up, in a kinda weird way.That’s when Murphy’s Law kicked in. All those lonely women I was escaping? They want me back, even if they have to kill my lover to get me. And then there’s my mother. How the hell do you introduce your alpha wolfman lover to your mother, the man-eating former head of surgery?Toss in a psychotic Major, a wolfman willing to start a war to take Mace’s place and a whole lot of mistrust. Old Murphy is having a damned field day…",
