  "description": "My name is Althea, and I am an Immortal living among Mortals. Momma taught me to blend in; appear human. The more human we tried to be, the less stress we had from the Hunters. We avoided unwanted attention by following a strict set of personal rules. Unfortunately, Momma had been gone for several years now. She just never came home one night; I was thirteen years old when it happened. Soon, I would be breaking the most fundamental rule she had ever taught me; donâ€™t ever do anything that will get you noticed. I know being half Demon is not exactly a ringing endorsement on my behalf, but it does have its benefits, as well as its drawbacks. Being that I was also half Fairy might sound better, but it is not. Fey can be just as evil as any Demon; sometimes much worse. The time for running and hiding from those hunting me has ended, and the time to stand up and fight back has begun. 5.0 out of 5 stars Lady of the Shadows By Deborah Hughes (Maine, USA) This was an engrossing and interesting read. Highly recommend for those who like dark fantasy with some romance, lots of action, plot twists and turns, a heroine to root for and an over-the-top supporting cast to keep it all interesting and engaging!",
