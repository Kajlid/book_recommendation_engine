  "description": "Black Poet is one man's expression of the hurt, anger and joy of looking at the world as a black person. The Author/Actor Cassius Ali has written three poetry books The Last Word, Poetic Expression and A Bully Story (A Bully Story has two short tales of bullying as well as poetry). After interviewing people of all colors, Cassius Ali tells their stories using what he calls a \"Poetic expression.\" Because of growing up through hardships, you'll find many of the poems are filled with emotion and passion. Cassius has worked with and around children for over two decades and learned that for most of us, that is when we decide the direction of our lives. If we do not express the hurt, anger or even the joy we may hold inside of ourselves our choices could be made because of un-channeled emotions. After watching the news Author/Actor Cassius Ali wrote the poem called \"On this Day\".",
