  "description": "Many's the ignorant person who claims that spirits and haunts have forsaken the modern age in this new twentieth century. But what they do not know would fill a book. And this is the book.Blossom Culp, spunky, devious, a bit of a female chauvinist—soon to be the most famous girl in two countries—is the outspoken outcast of Bluff City, Mid-America. But she begins a climb to fame one Halloween night when she deliberately puts the blame on Letty Shambaugh for squelching Alexander Armsworth's conspiracy to overturn Old Man Leverette's outhouse.Always resourceful, Blossom manages to foil Letty's plan for revenge by suddenly developing a spurious gift for second sight—which unexpectedly misfires. It turns out that Blossom indeed has the Gift for Seeing the Unseen.Nothing daunted, Blossom goes on to put herself and her town on the map. She tames the ghost of a suicidal servant and caps her career with a lunatic odyssey to London.In the midst of her adventures, however, Blossom comes to understand the serious side of her flickering Second Sight. In ghostly form she witnesses the terrible last minutes of the sinking of the Titanic and learns the sad truth that whether one glimpses the future or travels into the past, one is powerless to alter history.Low comedy and high tragedy are beautifully blended by a master comfortably at home in the perhaps more innocent era already happily familiar to readers of The Ghost Belonged to Me.",
