  "title": "Manhattan: Seeds of the Big Apple",
  "description": "In 1653, lower Manhattan was a Dutch community of about 120 houses, its people protected by a fort and a log wall which stood as a defense against Indian attacks. Today's Wall Street follows the line of that ancient plank wall. Sheriff Resolved Waldron, his wife, Tennake, and their three children lived at the present day crossing of Wall Street and Broadway. There along with them on Block B, across the street from the Dutch West India Company's enormous garden, resided Augustine Herrman, Peter Schaefbanck, the jailor, Hendrick Hendricksen, and Domine (clergy) Samuel Drisius. These were but a few of Americas first immigrants. This is their story.",
