  "title": "Tesla, Master of Lightning",
  "description": "This is the story of a genius--the enigmatic Nikola Tesla (1856-1943)--and his vast contribution to science. Years in the making, this thoroughly researched volume presents important new materials: archival documents and photographs; excerpts from Tesla's writings, lectures, and diaries; selections from his correspondence (some previously unpublished). By placing Tesla's patents and inventions in historical context, the book documents how aspects of television, X-rays, satellite transmission, and advance defense systems such as the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) were foreshadowed in Tesla's work. The 250 black-and-white and duo tone images create an invaluable record of the man and his times vividly showcasing his inventions and working methods. Tesla: Master of Lightning illuminates the life and grand achievements of this eccentric wizard.",
