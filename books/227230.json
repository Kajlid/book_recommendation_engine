  "description": "On the day he turned thirty, John starred in America’s number-one movie ( Animal House ), starred in the number-one late-night show ( Saturday Night Live ) and had recorded the number-one album ( Briefcase Full of Blues ). All from a guy who was never supposed to make it out from behind the cash register of his family’s Chicago diner. How did this Albanian immigrant’s son capture a nation’s imagination and come to embody all the glory and tragedy of the American dream? It was one high-price, high-speed, short-lived wild ride.BELUSHI is a whirlwind of a book, filled with never-before-seen photos and provocative, intensely personal testimonials by just about every major comedic figure of the last half century. Here is the remarkable and raucous story of a larger-than-life figure who danced out at the precipice of American fame.",
