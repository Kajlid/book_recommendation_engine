  "description": "A day ago. What a difference a day makes! If you had told me, a day ago, that there were monsters amongst us – I would have laughed in your face. Not just any monsters, mind you, but I’m staring down Death himself. Well, he’s probably not Death but he looks the part. And he’s come into my life for what? Some sort of journey? A mission? Why would such a creature need my help? Dragged into a world I know nothing of, I’m ashamed to say my story isn’t epic, heroic or filled with life’s unraveled mysteries. Okay, maybe one secret. I do not save the princess, battle for the fate of the kingdom nor discover earth-shattering true love. But this is a story I think everyone will need to know… Because, well, I will be to blame for whatever happens to us now.",
