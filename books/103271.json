  "description": "A children's story of heavenly proportions inspired by true events and told through colorful illustrations and rhyme. This story focuses on Tyke the elephant's journey to Heaven. It does not highlight her violent death. Please enjoy the spiritual journey it takes children on with her as there could be no other way to describe a 'happy ending' to her story. A percentage of net royalties are pledged by the author to be donated to The Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) sanctuaries in memory of Tyke to care for rescued elephants. The book's dedication is in Memory of Pat Derby and Tyke and is categorized as youth fiction for preschool to kindergarten aged and beginner readers. Inspiration was drawn from Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein, most noted children's book authors. The cover art has a bit of graphic novel feel to it - dared to be different. Thousands of people have been touched by Tyke's true tragic story and parents and educators can find more info about Tyke and the legacy she left behind on wiki. * Not available in Hard Cover at this time.",
