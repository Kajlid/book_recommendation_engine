  "title": "A Treasury of African-American Christmas Stories: Volume II",
  "description": "The perfect Christmas gift â€” including pieces from such literary giants as John Henrik Clarke and Langston Hughes, as well as gems from rediscovered writers. African-American Christmas, historically a very important time for celebration, reflect, and reunion within the African-American community, is again the subject of a collection of poignant and historic stories compiled and edited by Professor Bettye Collier-Thomas. Written by and about African-Americans and containing gems dating from the late nineteenth century through the Depression era, this collection reflects the Christmas experiences of everyday African-Americans and illuminates themes such as racial injustice and a distinct concept of black culture common to writers who were part of the burgeoning Harlem Renaissance. Stories by such esteemed authors as John Henrik Clarke and Langston Hughes are presented alongside pieces from newly rediscovered writers and focus on universal themes such as familial and romantic love, Christian faith, and the existence of Santa Claus, and more serious topics such as racism, violence, poverty, and racial identity. Beautifully packaged and meticulously collected, this second volume of A Treasury of African-American Christmas Stories is sure to find a place next to the first as a prized possession in many households.",
