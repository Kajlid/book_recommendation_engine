  "description": "Back home, there wasn't a woman who could say no to me.  There wasn't a woman in town that could convince me to go back to my place instead of theirs. Once I blew my load, I was gone. I didn't have time for love.  But this isn't back home. This is the middle of a God damn war zone and I haven't scored a woman in months. The pressure built up between my legs is unbearable.  Then she comes around with that smokin' hot body. Taunting me with it every chance she gets. Worse yet, the damn woman won't shut up. Of course she's a reporter. Of course she wants answers. She's nothing but trouble.  If only I realized just how much trouble. This girl turned my world upside down and I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.  HOSTILE is a standalone romance with hot sex, strong language, and an HEA.",
