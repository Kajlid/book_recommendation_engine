  "description": "Do you occasionally wonder, What kind of person works at a porn video store? Do public defenders believe in their clients? What does a reporter feel when he visits war-torn Iraq? What happens after a child star falls into obscurity?Thanks to Web logs, or \"blogs\" as they're affectionately nicknamed by Net-savvy voyeurs, anyone can jump into the shoes of a video salesclerk, a criminal court lawyer, an international journalist, or a TV star, among others.While entertaining and educating, these virtual diaries represent a cross section of the people who dwell online. This book features the Internet's most provocative writing, by unknown writers and underground celebrities.Neil Forrester, former cast member of MTV's The Real World, gives new meaning to the phrase \"Bite your tongue.\" Meanwhile, Star Trek: The Next Generation actor, Wil Wheaton, gives his take on the Hollywood system and fleeting stardom.Elsewhere, web designer Heather Hamilton finds herself unemployed after posting on-the-job stories to her personal blog. And humorist Choire Sicha shares advice about broken hearts and timeshares. Plus: tales of creepy video-store customers, office pranks gone awry, a childhood encounter with Darth Vader, and so much more!",
