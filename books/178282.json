A serial killer is on the loose in Los Angeles attacking whole families, and Vance is the only one who can catch him. But that’s not what the killer seems to think. What becomes a fun game of cat and mouse to the killer, turns Vance’s life into a living hell for him, his family, and his friends. Sweet, demure Melina Higgins is minding her business when – BAM! – she literally crashes into the most gorgeous man she has ever seen. Although hesitant to date a man whose dangerous job consumes his life, she is unable to control her attraction to this sexy, sensitive, family man. When a serial killer sets his sights on her new detective boyfriend, Melina has no choice but to help fight for her man…and her life. *Warning* This book is intended for mature readers over the age of 18. There is a short rape scene integral to the storyline.",
