  "description": "Life is rough when you’re gorgeous, rich, talented and so sexy that the media won’t leave you alone. It’s certainly the truth in Christian Lasher’s case. He returns to the neighborhood of his childhood to escape the spotlight, hungering for a change in his creative endeavors. In the midst of his soul searching he meets Megan and is captured by the tantalizing hint of her hidden fires. Megan knows nothing about his wild, rebellious youth or his career as a rock star—and Christian would prefer to keep it that way. There was much, much more to her than the role of a fragile victim. Megan Shreve is a sculptor with creative depths and passions that tragedy had forced into the shadows. When she looks into Christian’s eyes she sees herself for the first time as an exciting, sexy woman. She longs to discover more of herself in Christian’s arms and in his bed. Two passionate souls destined for one another—unless the stifling roles imposed by tragedy and fame rip them apart.",
