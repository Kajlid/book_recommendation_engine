  "title": "Avoiding Prison and Other Noble Vacation Goals: Adventures in Love and Danger",
  "description": "From salsa dancing in a rum-induced haze and struggling to exercise in Colombia (the guerillas were using the track again today), to crossing international borders unconventionally and dodging bombs in Lebanon (the good news was that they were small bombs), Wendy somehow manages to find herself in the midst of hysterical, adventurous, and often illegal situations. Case in point every time she heads to Costa Rica, she is forced to visit another prison. Although a jail may not be everyone's idea of a place to find a date, Wendy soon falls in love with a man, a country, and its people and risks everything she has to clear his name.",
