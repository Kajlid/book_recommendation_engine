  "description": "Ravi, a young ambitious Indian financial analyst, is sent to South Africa by Pluto Asset Management (PAM), an emerging force in fund management in London. He relocates with his boss; Christopher is a legend not because he can distance his emotions from the market, but because he has no emotions to distance. PAM also sends Margaret, a walking femme-fatale, and Jacob, a black graduate (whose father is connected to the SA government) to spearhead the office.In South Africa Ravi has an investor’s Midas touch; he discovers companies with grossly undervalued properties, dot.com potential ten-baggers, e-wallets that will transform banking and he rides their ascent. Even better, he finds himself blissfully in love.But all is not as it seems. Treachery, corruption and insider trading lurk behind the shiny corporate façade, where fortunes are made not only by stock picking, but on the nod of a crooked politician, or the fantasies of a serial-optimist CEO.Soon Ravi finds himself not only fighting for his job, but for his life.",
