  "description": "This thriller novel of two werewolf clans trying to co-exist in Ireland draws the reader into the mysterious otherworld of the Garou's \"Northern Den\" and the Noctrailis. Their long history is slowly revealed, but the war between them and within them has really only just begun. The story takes place in small town Ireland where the chilling case of grisly murders has shocked the Sapien community, baffled the police force and kept local investigative newspaper journalist Cara-Marie McKenna on her toes. Good character development and sustained suspense as the chilling tale unfolds with multiple twists and turns and a surprising ending.\"Moon Dancing\" definitely is a leader of the pack.",
