  "description": "Not all families are loving. Not all relationships end in chaos. And, sometimes, reality is an illusion.Following release from Havenhurst Hospital in Amherst, Massachusetts in June 2015, 29-year-old Farrah Glickman learns she has been placed under the guardianship of her toxic parents and in the care of court-appointed psychologist Bonnie Lowenstein. Two unproductive months later, after defiantly mocking therapy and growing increasingly unstable, Farrah reluctantly agrees to actively engage in the biweekly sessions, and her story (from earliest traumatic memories to most recent, out-of-control survival) begins to surface from the depths of her tortured psyche. As she and Bonnie process the archives of her 29 years, heavy with the emotional baggage of a dysfunctional childhood and a series of very unhealthy relationships with men and just about everyone else in her life, Farrah cautiously reveals an emotional void she forever endeavors to fill with a protective combination of deflective humor, casual sex, alcohol in abundance, and Jesus hallucinations. All the while, her mental health is drifting further away, and the keeper of her well-being and safely guarded secrets laughs as she rows the boat into dangerous, uncharted territory.Now That You Have Seen Me is the (sometimes dark, sometimes dirty, all times witty) story of Farrah's unforgiving, year-and-a-half long journey to the bottom of her soul and back again, straight from her own HUGE potty mouth.",
