Showing the world he’s in a committed relationship will hopefully convince casting agents he’s reformed, stable and trustworthy.Even if it’s a lie.What Dante doesn’t count on is the public’s reaction to the announcement that Chris and he are a couple…and his own feelings for Chris spiraling out of control.Under the merciless cameras of the paparazzi, Dante is forced to choose--his leading man status or the man he thought was just his best friend. Who ever thought that pretending to be in love would be this hard?",
