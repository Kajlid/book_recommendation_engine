  "title": "Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days",
  "description": "Founders at Work recounts the early struggles for independence and acceptance of many of modern technologyâ€™s giants, through personal interviews that are at times hilarious, at times painful, and always inspiring. As human-interest stories they will interest the same audience that enjoys reading about the Google founders in PEOPLE magazine. These stories are exceptionally interesting, because they're about the early stages, when the founders were younger and inexperienced. Most readers know startup founders only as confident millionaires. As novices trying to find their way by trial and error, they're more human, and easier for the reader to identify with.",
