  "description": "At the Foot of the Snows tells the inspiring story of an American family living among the virtually unknown Kham Magar of Nepal, developing a deep bond of friendship that transcended their cultural divide. Through years of study and hard work, they translated Scripture into the Kham language, igniting a spark of interest in the gospel that would fan to life through years of persecution. Through it all, David and Nancy Watters struggled to demonstrate that gospel to these people who lived, in the words of the Khams, \"at the foot of the snows.\"",
