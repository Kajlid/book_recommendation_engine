  "description": "Mary has rushed to Sedona to be by Sarah's side after a car accident leaves John in a coma and the mess she created in Phoenix has followed her. Sedona has always been her safe refuge, the place she could go to regain the focus over her life and she's determined to find that clarity again, but Alex, Bryce and new complications aren't making it easy. She'll have to make hard choices and learn to let go of her past before she can move forward.  Love will be found and lost, then found again in this nail-biting conclusion to the roller-coaster romance you fell in love with in Unexpectedly Out of Focus.  Praise for Unexpected Rule of Thirds  ...this book…this series…is so well written...the author still managed to keep me questioning and create a twist that I certainly didn’t see coming...Unexpected Rule of Thirds is a wonderfully written conclusion to the Mary, Alex, and Bryce saga (Romantic Reading Escapes)...  ...I couldn't put it down, but by 3 am I had to go to bed (Reader)...  ...OMG the book is so good. Every chance I have I'm reading it (Reader)...  ...Swoooooon! (Reader)...",
