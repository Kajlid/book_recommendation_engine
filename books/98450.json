  "description": "From crooked detectives to boxcar hobos; from desperate bounty hunters to disgraced celebrities; from small-town doldrums to haunted marriages—these ten stories explore the strange and uncertain, the deadly and the lonesome, looking deep into the aching reflections of the choices we’ve made, the cages we’ve created, the secrets we’ve buried, and at the ace cards we’ve tucked away into our sleeves during the long and dangerous card game of life...waiting for that moment when we’ll need them the most.",
