  "description": "She was forbidden.I didn’t care.As my best friend’s little sister, Macey Hale was off-limits, but the girl was tempting as sin and forbidden as fuck. I wish I could say that stopped me. I wish I could tell you I behaved like a gentleman.I didn’t.When she waltzes back into my life with that same spark I fell for, looking every bit the beautiful woman I knew she’d grow into, I have to force myself to remember I’m different from the man she once knew. I’m colder. Harder. And for good reason.With my heart on lockdown and my hands aching to touch her, I set out to prove that I can keep myself in check this time.No strings. No attachments.And definitely no falling for her again.If you love steamy romance, you won't want to miss this older brother's best friend romance. This is book two in the Lessons with the Dom series, following The Gentleman Mentor. Both are complete standalone novels featuring sexy Dominant men you're sure to fall in love with. Enjoy!",
