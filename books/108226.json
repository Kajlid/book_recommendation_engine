  "description": "For Elizabeth and Emrys, an enchanting trip to the Hebrides brings not only magnificent sights, but another prophecy, and as always it comes in the form of a mystifying, rhyming riddle. Although somewhat disturbing, Lizzy is sidetracked by urgent questions regarding her own visions, but later, while visiting the mysterious Callanish Stones, Sibelle’s chilling words come back to her: “One final slash brings forth the flood…Two feet will stand upon the blood.” Elizabeth is filled with an eerie dreadful sense of foreboding; when will this happen, will they know ahead of time, will someone actually die? Back home, life takes on a normal flow, and the prophecy is all but forgotten. As time passes, Elizabeth begins to wonder if Sibelle’s prophecy was incorrect… But she’d forgotten one thing: Sibelle is never wrong… and sometimes evil returns when you least expect it.",
