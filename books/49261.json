  "description": "Blind in one eye, Lieutenant Peter Thorton is back in British service and made acting-captain of His Britannic Majesty's frigate Ajax. Battered by the onslaught of the vengeful Spanish, the Ajax is in a sorry state when she is ordered back to England. If keeping the damaged Ajax afloat was not trouble enough, Thorton must rescue Horner from the bottom of a bottle of brandy and save the Resolute from mutiny. Meanwhile the Ottoman Empire has gone to war against Spain, only to be defeated and driven away from Sebta in ruin. The Sallee vessels are trounced by a Spanish fleet and it is Thorton's sad duty to stitch the shroud of his good friend and former lover, Captain Tangle, to bury him at sea. Arriving at last in England, Thorton and his fellow officers are deprived of their commissions and arrested. Thorton must face his old nemesis, Captain Bishop, in a final showdown on the field of honor. Determined that this time he will not lose, Bishop has brought reinforcements.Book Three brings our intrepid heroes their greatest challenges-challenges that can only be overcome by Iron Men. Writen by a tall ship sailor and internationally acclaimed poet, M. Kei, Pirates of the Narrow Seas combines swashbuckling adventure, gay romance, and gritty realism.",
