  "description": "Vivid and twisted - a stunning retelling of the classic Medusa myth..Life on Perseus's island of Serifos hangs in a precarious state of balance - the legacy of war - but his own routines are relaxed and calm. However, a beautiful stranger arrives and shatters the peace for everyone. Perseus is smitten, but others are suspicious, for Andromeda has a unique and potentially powerful gift. But she also has a harsh destiny to fulfil. She must die to save her people, and a stunning, word-changing discovery will die with her - unless Perseus abandons all his beliefs to confront the horror of the Medusa quest.In a mesmerising novel which combines Ann Halam's own skilful blend of magic realism with the rich otherwordly power of a favourite Greek myth, this is a story of hope and survival, and the sheer determination of two young people against all the odds.",
