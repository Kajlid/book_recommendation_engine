  "description": "In 1859 the opportunities for women were scant unless one wished to take a chance. Calico Benson, a gentle bred woman wanting the security of marriage and family, answered an ad in the “Matrimonial News,” where men were advertising for wives. Along with five other women, Calico set out on the Santa Fe Trail hoping to find love at the end of the trip. What they all found was nothing short of a hellish nightmare journey. Follow Calico and the others while they seek safe haven at the end of the Santa Fe Trail. Join them as they meet the savage and the civil on their passage. Will their dreams be fulfilled or lost along the way?",
