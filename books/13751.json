  "description": "Best Nonfiction Finalist, Stanford University– William Saroyan International Prize.One of 30 Moving memoirs every student should read. –OnlineCollegeSolaces tells the touching story of a boy's search for family life and safety following his parents' divorce in Iran during the 1960s. The first child of a heartless father and a discarded mother is left to fend for himself on the streets of Mashhad, seeking food and shelter wherever he can. His lonely early years are an unbelievable tale of cruelty and betrayal by nearly everyone who might be expected to help, save for one aunt who leaves the door to her home partially open to him. But living a harsh and solitary existence has one advantage for this little boy: other than forcing him to be self-reliant, no one is around to chain the wings of his imagination and limit how much he can dream.",
