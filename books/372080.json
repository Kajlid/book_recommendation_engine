  "description": "Self-made espresso bar owner Maggy Thorsen would rather be whipping up steam with her sexy sheriff boyfriend than organizing a barista competition. But the big Java Ho convention, the coffee industry's seasonal trade show, has come to Milwaukee. And this year it's not only insane, it's murder…when Maggy finds the body of Marvin LaRoche, proprietor of the HotWired coffee chain, under a banquet table.LaRoche was powerful, mean and nasty—or maybe he just drank too much of his own coffee. Either way, somebody bludgeoned him with Maggy's first-place barista trophy. Hoping to clear her name, Maggy watches the man's too-cheerful widow and an angry activist accusing LaRoche of exploiting Third World coffee growers. With a killer to catch and coffee to brew, Maggy is working overtime to save her own beans.",
