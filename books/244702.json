  "title": "Wicked Angels",
  "description": "Wicked Angels is the exquisite English translation of the classic 1955 French literary novel Les mauvais anges, banned for thirty years for what was called its 'subversive' subject matter. It is the story of Pierre and Gerard, two teenagers who share a love that no one else around them can condone. The two young men discover their destiny in each other's arms, their passion coupled with violence - and ultimately pay the price. The novel is a profoundly lyrical ode to adolescent love and sexuality, as well as a bold and elegant rejection of society's values while on the road to self-destruction.",
