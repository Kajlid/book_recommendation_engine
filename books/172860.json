  "description": "Carmelina Dahl is used to taking care of herself. Growing up below the poverty line with an addict for a mother, she hardly had another choice. At twenty-six years old, she still guards her heart like a penalty box, but her journalism career is well on its way and she wants a white-picket-fence life of her own. On a sweltering Friday afternoon, she tags along to a Major League Soccer game with her friend from the sports-desk, but she doesn’t expect to strike the attention of “golden boy” Shane Mitchell, the goalkeeper for Austin United, infamous for his hard-partying ways and love of playing the field (in more ways than one). Carmelina is no fan of soccer, jocks, nor this particular Texan soccer-jock. She refuses to be another notch on his bedpost, despite the fireworks of desire exploding between them both. Nonetheless, the tournament for Carmelina’s heart has hardly begun, and Shane is used to getting what he wants. With eyes for her alone, he's not about to back down. Possessive and domineering, this man lives to save and plays to win. The walls around Carmelina’s heart were fortified long ago, but this cocky and confident soccer goalie is just the man to tear them down. Shane might be hell-bent on proving that some people are worth trusting, but little does he know that Carmelina guards a “red-card” worthy secret of her own. When it comes to the woman he loves, will Carmelina’s truth even the score, or prove too offside for Shane to handle? Standalone novel with HEA - no cliffhanger ending. Recommended for 18+ due to language and sexual situations.",
