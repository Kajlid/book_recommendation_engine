  "description": "Musical comedy revue 3 males and 1 female Interior The wild humor of Tom Lehrer is exhibited in this hilarious, laugh-filled, and yet, poignant adaptation by Cameron Mackintosh and Robin Ray. Twenty-eight of Lehrer's songs are featured in this casual revue, in which the actors go by their own names and remain on stage at a bar while the others perform. This comedy is sure to leave adult audiences with sore sides and laughter-induced tears, but also with thoughts to ponder after watching Lehrer's satire at work. \"Leaves us wishing that Tom Lehrer will yet return to his piano again.\"- The New York Times",
