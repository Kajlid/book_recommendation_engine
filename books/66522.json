  "description": "The fascinating stories in TINKER, written by award-winning author R.L. Herron, shine a light on dim places...war, loneliness and despair...things we often choose not to talk about. However, at the same time these stories touch gently on some of the bright, soft things of life. They'll make you feel the subtle butterfly wings of hope that occasionally tickle our hearts. A remarkable collection.  \"Well done!\"  ~ Reviewed by V. Reader on Amazon  \"Beautifully written...!\"  ~ Reviewed by Darin Godby for Readers Favorite  \"The lead story 'TINKER' ... although melancholy and sad ... is really a beautiful love story.\" ~ Reviewed by Lady Reader on Amazon",
