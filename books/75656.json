  "title": "Multiple Sclerosis: A Guide to Treatment and Management",
  "description": "\"The huge expansion of information available about MS, especially through the Internet, has put the individual with MS in a position to take increasing responsibility for her or his own care. There is thus a need for a comprehensive, readily accessible guide to the present therapeutic options, which will give the inquirer a balanced guide to the relative effectiveness of individual treatments. This book is designed to do just that. This bestselling title is a unique compendium of the most frequently used treatments for multiple sclerosis, an authoritative reference for all physicians, and a factual guide for patients who need information about therapies. This new edition has been extensively revised both in content and format from previous editions. Its organization into sections dealing with the treatment of acute exacerbations, disease-modifying therapies, symptom management, and alternative therapies makes the book much more accessible to the reader. The title has been changed from \"\"Therapeutic Claims in Multiple Sclerosis\"\" to reflect the major restructuring of this edition and to better describe the range and focus of the content.The authors have included the original data underlying the conclusions reached by the Therapeutic Claims Committee of the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, providing for a greater understanding of how those conclusions were reached. The addition of references at the end of each chapter will be especially useful for physicians and other health care professionals, but will also be of interest to those lay readers who want more detail about the therapies discussed.\"",
