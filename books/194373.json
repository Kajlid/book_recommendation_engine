  "description": "This collection from McGough - dating from 1976 - is described as childrens poetry, which is slightly surprising given the quality of many of the poems. The collection contains 34 poems and a prose poem spread over several pages. Many of the poems display the typical wit and humour we expect from McGough, although my favourite poem in the collection is \"A Brown Paper Carrier Bag\"; a darker piece that you can't help but keep thinking about.McGough fans - and poetry lovers everywhere - should enjoy this collection.",
