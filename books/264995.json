  "description": "Kneel. Submit. Obey I have been taken by a man unknown to me. But he is not the one who holds me captive. Not whose voice commands me. Not who watches me with a storm raging in ocean-blue eyes. It is my captor who knows every inch of my body. Who trains me for another man to ruin. But I am not his. I belong to my requestor. Whoever he is . . .",
