  "description": "Who was Wendy Wyoming? After listening to KBOY's husky-voiced sexpot of a new deejay, Jason Wakefield had to know. His pal Melody Hunter knew but wasn't telling... except for the hilarious boast that she was Wendy. Always the kidder.Still, mild-mannered Melody had changed. Lately her dresses clung closer to her curves, her auburn hair gleamed, and during one of their perfunctory slow dances, Mel moved like she meant it. She was far from the redheaded bombshells Jason normally favored, but suddenly, with Melody in his arms, the Wendy Wyomings of the world didn't matter anymore.",
