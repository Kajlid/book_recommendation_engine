  "description": "In the Nevada desert, a game of hunter and prey is about to begin as a band of survivors seeks to capture a creature of nightmare. Failure will not only mean their deaths, but the murder of innocents...  With his superiors wiped out by the plague, MAJOR BEEMAN finds himself in charge of the Facility, the top secret base where the Omega Virus began. He has the command he’s always craved, and he’ll ruthlessly protect it from anyone he perceives as a threat. Beeman has eliminated the Army Rangers sent there as protection, taken hostages and sent the Nimitz survivors on a suicide mission. But now he has left the Facility vulnerable…  THE QUEEN has awakened from her bizarre sleep of transformation. Bigger, stronger and infinitely more deadly than ever, she has gathered the dead to her lair to unleash her greatest power, that of creation. She will not assemble a mere pack this time, but instead give birth to a legion of Hobgoblins. And her ultimate goal is not one of simple annihilation…it’s revenge…  Released from her captivity as a test subject, SKYE DENNISON and her friends have been given an ultimatum; bring back the Alpha Female or your families will die. Accompanied by FATHER XAVIER, ANGIE WEST and others, Skye heads into an apocalyptic Reno, a city infested with the dead and ruled by something far more diabolical. Her mission will put her on a collision course with the Queen, where only one can survive…  As thousands of ravenous Hobgoblins spill into the streets, good and evil will face off in an epic showdown that could well seal the fate of mankind.",
