  "title": "The Street Boy",
  "description": "Written in a simple, plain and beautiful language, The Street Boy narrates the story of Sierra Leone’s eleven-year civil war. Events of the war are beautifully narrated as the protagonist moved from one place to another and as he grew from childhood to adulthood. The book narrates life with the Revolutionary United Front rebels, how it was like living in a refugee camp in a foreign country and it also shows the social matrix of the Sierra Leonean society. This book educates you with all you need to know about Sierra Leone’s most recent history, from the inception of the war to its conclusion; all you need to know about the major players involved in the civil war; and the involvement of Sierra Leone’s neighbours in the war.",
