Sassy Road is tough, beautiful, smart, and looking for retribution against the stepfather who abused her. Logan Marcs, an undercover cop and Heroes and Rogues full patch member, is in position to bring down Damsel Road, a rival club's leader. The last thing Logan needs is interference from a sexy little vixen, but Sassy is about to complicate his life even more. Victory Rising was Damsel Road's old lady, but after Damsel goes to prison, Victory sets her sights on Devon Kardashian, the Heroes and Rogues club president. Breaking a truce between clubs, Devon chooses personal gain over professional obligation. Soon, disgruntled MC members question the man holding the gavel at the head of their table. Is Victory trying to even old scores or is she truly interested in earning Devon's love? Summer Pain, an undercover agent, lands in bed with the very man who has haunted her dreams. Unfortunately, reality is much better and far worse than she ever imagined. Tigger, the Heroes and Rogues Vice-President, is under investigation for illegal activity and he's mighty close to blowing Summer's cover. With the power to expose another undercover agent, Summer realizes the pressure is on but will she carry out her orders or follow her heart?",
