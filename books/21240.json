  "description": "“(Influenced by) A New York Times Bestseller\"From the critically acknowledged and controversial author, Slava Pastukhov, comes an examination of society’s zeitgeist through the lens of the cynical comedian. There is something here to entertain or enrage anyone who has been a part of society in recent years (That’s YOU!)Bros & Hoes in Prose is an ebook. It is free. What other reasons do you need to download it?What’s this book about? Nothing really, but it’s quite funny. This book is a collection of short essays that cover all aspects of life; from hipsters to hand jobs and from rap moguls to Ron Artest. It’s best read on a crowded subway or in the middle of a wedding ceremony so that strangers can reward your loud guffaws with stone-cold stares of appreciation.There are six themes throughout the book which cover The Unfairer Sex, Sour Sports Satire, Limited Lifetricks, Eloquent Excurse, Judgements and Jargon and Branded Bromosexuals so there should be a little bit of something for everyone to hate.“The funniest thing I’ve ever read. Possibly the most influential thing I’ve ever put on my Kindle” – Plato“This book made my penis grow an extra inch overnight” – Zeus D. GodCover Design by Faraz WarsiFollow Slava on Twitter @YarocK",
