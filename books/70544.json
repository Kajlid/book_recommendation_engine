  "title": "A Dodge a Twist and a Tobacconist",
  "description": "A literary dream team of crime fighters including characters from Dickens, Stevenson, Austen, Kipling, Doyle, and even a nod to some writers across the pond. Prowl the foggy alleyways on the track of a ruthless enslaver of souls. Travel the Thames in a Giant Catfish. Soar over London in a stealth glider, and witness the true redemption and restoration no one imagined.\"He's going to ram Twist's ship,\" Kera breathed. \"They'll both crash into the house and Mrs. Rose just might have her bomb going off.\" I ran along the edge of the roof as if I were looking for a shot. But I already knew my pistol was empty, useless, and the guard was trying to get around another gable to get a clear shot while staying behind cover. I had come to a conclusion a moment earlier that I dared not say out loud lest I be grabbed and thrown down on the roof by both women, but I knew what I had to do. Just as the spy craft hove around the corner of the house, only a few feet away from the airship, I launched myself off the roof. The smaller ship disappeared and my heart leaped in panic at the thought of being sliced into quarters by the tail rotor. But my fingertips caught hold of a solid object. I found the fuselage of the spy ship and wrapped my legs around it. The thing slewed and spun and began to fall tail-first toward the green lawn.",
