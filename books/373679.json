  "title": "Heart of the Highriders: In a fantasy world, seekers find the true Source of good",
  "description": "Imagine living in a fantasy world without magic, a world that knows nothing of sorcery nor of a wizard's quick solutions -- a world where one never encounters talking beasts, invincible swords, glowing rings or all-seeing eyes. What would it be like to behold such a world through the mind of those for whom the realm of the spirit is a closed book, and only that which meets the eye can be taken into account? In such a world powers of evil go unrecognized, and thus work their harm, until the spiritual Source of righteousness is revealed. Such is the world of Heart of the Highriders. Co-written by Richard C. Leonard and Charity R. Silkebakken, this Medieval-flavored 412-page epic adventure includes an Afterword, Glossary and Map.",
