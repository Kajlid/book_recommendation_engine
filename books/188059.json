  "title": "When Latin Lost its Relevance",
  "description": "Paul Riddle arrives at the Pontifical College Josephinum in 1961, naive, innocent, and frightfully unprepared for the hostility, draconian discipline and exhausting academic curriculum he finds awaiting him. And he didn't count on one particular enemy in his new Latin. Succeeding at Latin will spark a chain of events that leads to betrayal, revenge, and death. Riddle is forced to confront his doubts about his own innocence and that of his friends-all while dealing with doubts about his sexuality. Is Riddle caught up in these deadly secrets, or is it all merely the accusations of his adversary, the adversary who's been stalking him all year? The question will force Riddle to face the strange person he is growing into who threatens to sabotage not only everything he believes himself to be, but also everything he believes his friends to be.",
