But does it have to include my business partner’s moody younger sister, Layla? Yes, it does, and she happens to be escorting me to New Orleans. As much as we hate each other, it isn’t completely crazy. Technically, she’s an employee and someone decided I should be her boss. But one fight after another leads us to an explosion in the bedroom… more than once.I definitely wasn’t planning on nailing more than a good business deal on this trip. Unfortunately, our plan to leave the antics in the bedroom and out of the office falls apart as soon as we return home. First, because some of our mutual talents can’t be forgotten. Two, because there is a business partner that may kill me as soon as he figures out what happened. And three, because some secrets can only be kept for so long, give or take nine months.The Unexpected Card is the first standalone novel from the Mr. Boss series. This workplace romance is filled with banter, a swoony boss, steamy times, and surprises along the way.",
