  "description": "Master horror storyteller Joe R. Lansdale throws his scathing wit and wild, otherworldly creations into the mix as he brings Robert E. Howard's classic tale of dark revenge to the present . . . and into the unwitting lives of the Blassenville mansion heirs, twin sisters Claire and Janet. When Griswell fled the Blassenville estate those many years ago, he couldn't have imagined the grotesque horrors that would eclipse the ones he saw then - but they're here! With more than twenty books to his credit, Joe R. Lansdale is an acclaimed storyteller. He's been called \"an immense talent\" by Booklist; \"a born storyteller\" by Robert Bloch; and The New York Times Book Review declares he has \"a folklorist's eye for telling detail and a front-porch raconteur's sense of pace.\" He has won a number of awards, including five Bram Stoker horror awards, a British Fantasy Award, the American Mystery Award, the Horror Critics Award, the \"Shot in the Dark\" International Crime Writer's award, the Booklist Editor's Award, the Critic's Choice Award, and a New York Times Notable Book award.",
