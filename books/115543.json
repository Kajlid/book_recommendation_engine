Discover the difference between Ordinary Setting that bogs down your story, and Active Setting that empowers your story -- creating a compelling story world, regardless of what you write.\"Mary Buckham has created a treasure for writers. This is a fabulous craft book for the writer who does not want readers \"skimming\" over chunks of their story because the setting bogs it down. And for the writer who wants to draw readers deep into their world. And for the writer who wants to use setting to show emotion or reveal details about their characters. Need I go on? Kudos to Mary on producing a book that shows how top authors write great setting and easy steps for any writer who wants to improve setting in their stories.\" NYT Bestselling Author, Dianna Love\"I am amazed how much can change in one paragraph of my manuscript with the manipulation of Setting. This book spells out how to do just that in clear, easy to understand, small steps.\"Judy Wirzberger. Women's Fiction Writer",
