While trying to learn his new normal, Layla, his first and only love, breezed back into his life.

The problem was, he was starting to wonder if the new Layla wasn’t really who she was.He tried to resist her but sometimes love is never really over.Never Really Over is a complete standalone. This farm boy romance is sure to make you swoon, laugh, and tear up a few times.",
