  "description": "So...Earth was invaded by Aliens. That happened. I’m not joking. Fortunately for us, Humans developed latent abilities that enabled us to defend and protect our planet. We call ourselves the Praesidio. Six years later the world is not the same. We know we are not alone in the universe. There are dangerous things lingering in the darkness.   Alexa The Laren delegation is coming to her colony. A race of super-advanced Aliens that remind her of sexy elves. Silver skinned, pointy ears, swirling eyes and all. As Chancellor it is her responsibility to ensure everything goes well. Not everyone wants Alien visitors and tensions are high. Of course, things don’t get off to a great start. Somehow, she ends up Mated to an Alien. Yeah...things only get worse from there. Quarantine. Riots and Space Pirates. How did this happen again?    Warning: This book is a science-fiction alien romance. It contains swearing, violence, sensual sex scenes. It's definitely recommended for readers aged 18 and over.",
