  "description": "Private Detective Mike Hardin has two simple tasks: investigate a cheating husband and pick up a gambling addicted embezzler. For an investigator with his vast experience it should be a piece of cake, right? It would be if he knew all of the secrets the principles have been keeping from him. Add in an accident prone ex-stripper secretary plus a childhood pal anxious to get his hands on a gun and you'll see Mike Hardin finds it nearly impossible to attack.",
