  "description": "What if one morning you look in the mirror and no longer recognize the person looking back?  When Leelo can no longer identify herself by the roles that once defined her, it's both terrifying and liberating. Oh, she feels the loss, the grief, and then the anger, but when she inherits property up north, she jumps at the promise of freedom and independence.  Yet not everyone in her new community is what they seem, starting with the surly mountain man down the road.  As owner of the local fishing lodge, Roar is content with his everyday life. And the older he gets, the less he appreciates change. So when a blue-haired, tattooed ‘city girl’ moves into the old motel, shaking up his daily routine, he’s none too pleased.  Still, something about the woman’s easy smile and almost reckless grit has him step up as her keeper.",
