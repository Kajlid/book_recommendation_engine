  "description": "Chapter 1 The Mark Twain MissionThere is a tremendous explosion on a docked steamboat and the levees of New Orleans are destroyed. The city is flooded and a young Mark Twain vanishes in the muddy waters of the Mississippi River. Not only will the future generations never get to read some of his best works but also the city will never become the great port and vacation center it is today. The 1800 club must send a member back and stop the explosion. They need a member who has an understanding of steamboats and their engines and selects Tommy “Whitey” Madden, a New York City detective. Tommy finds out that in order to prevent the explosion from becoming history he must inform Mark Twain about his mission and inadvertently gives him an idea for one of his most popular stories. Chapter 2 The Ronald Reagan MissionWhy would Ronald Reagan simply never exist? It was during his time as President of the United States that the Soviet Union was challenged by him to tear down the Berlin Wall beginning the end of the Cold War. If he wasn’t around to become president, who would take his place? Find out how an Italian/American and a Scottish man-o-war fights a British man-o-war to save the future President of the United States.",
