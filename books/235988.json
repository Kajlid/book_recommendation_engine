  "description": "Lynx Caine is no stranger to trouble. He’s found himself knee deep in it more times than he can count. But never has he found himself in the sort of hot water he’s in now. Lynx has been waiting what feels like a lifetime for Reagan Trevino to dump the loser she’s spent nearly a decade with. Now that she’s single, Lynx is free to make his move. And he fully intends to do so.  However, Reagan is not going to be easy to catch. She has some stipulations for the bad boy of Embers Ridge, and she has every intention of sticking to them. Or that was her plan. Unfortunately, her good intentions are thwarted when a madman draws her right into the line of fire. When Lynx refuses to let her out of his sight, Reagan soon realizes the sexy country boy might be tattooed from neck to knuckles, but he’s got a heart as big as Texas and resisting him is a whole lot harder than she anticipated.",
