  "description": "\"Destiny is a persistent master, but sometimes the path it lays is shrouded in mist.\" Merlin Two Briton warriors are caught in a fierce snow storm and forced to take shelter in a foreboding abandoned castle, where they encounter a spectral figure, a man in a Druid's robe, seemingly as old as time itself. The old man tells the warriors a story that begins with Arthur's journey to the annual tournament in London. But what happens at the journey's end, when Arthur first sees Caliburn, the Sword of Destiny, will become lost in Arthur's legend as it grows over the centuries. This is a time of great turmoil. The powerful Saxons are planning to invade Britain. The barbaric Celtic tribes of the north are growing bolder, and the raids of the Norsemen continue unabated. Arthur faces other challenges as well - an ambitious brother, a spy within the Briton ranks, a meddlesome and jealous woman. But despite Merlin's years of grooming, Arthur is still a distracted and indecisive youth, more interested in play than training, more focused on women than duty. And so the world of Merlin's Britain is about to be turned upside down.",
