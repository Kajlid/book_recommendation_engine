She attends the prestigious South Haven Academy for the Gifted and Talented, but unknown to the other students, she is an Alerium witch.

In the trials arena, friendships will be put to the test, fears will be confronted head-on, and powerful spells will be unleashed. When Alexia is confronted with the ultimate game of chance, and is torn between her Ô¨Årst real love and the allegiance that binds her to her coven, will she buckle under the weight of the pressure ... or will she rise to the challenge?",
