  "description": "Just as you see things out of the corner of your eye with peripheral vision, you also see things out of the corner of you mind the same way, things you sense without words. These poems are the words for things often sensed peripherally. They are things you've often felt but perhaps didn't quite know how to say. Most of these poems were born out of contemplating some simple daily life reality, such as the poem \"Selfies\", which you can read in the sample. It's the first poem and a foretaste of what's inside.",
