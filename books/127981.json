During a brief musical performance that started his game, he quickly grew more aware of the lead singer with electrifying blue eyes, a striking smile and a body fit for more than just dancing to the thump of a distant drumbeat. Instantly he sensed a link with the man behind the music unlike any he had ever felt before.By force of nature and during his song, Alec James was stimulated by palpitations of the heart when the center man of the baseball field looked his way and smiled. He fell in love with the pitcher even before their hearts had a chance to trade places. A song and a game executed a rock solid love affair between these two men who met one another by chance.While building their life of love together, Gabriel and AJ merged with obstacles that cartwheel in and out of their path, and their romance becomes tangled with criminal suspense. While balancing newfound love and their iconic careers, they clashed with distractions that spiraled around them, one speeding up right after the other. In the course of it all, Gabriel and AJ refused to give up on love and unprecedented male bonding.A finale so unexpected breaks open when another spiraling event takes a shocking turn.",
