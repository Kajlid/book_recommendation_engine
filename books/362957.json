  "description": "Banished to the Earth, the guardian angels are trying to live amongst humans. They succeed until Opal Keaton, a seventeen-year-old bent on escaping small-town life, discovers the truth. At first, Opal thinks that Caleb and Emma are just exceptionally beautiful teenagers who happen to be a little strange--from their interest in Opal to their unusual kindness. But soon Opal learns the truth about her new friends, that they belong to a race of fallen angels and that they believe Opal is the one who can help them return to heaven. Skeptic that she is, Opal doesn't want to believe their story. But why else would Caleb and Emma be so involved in her life? Before she comes to terms with the truth that her friends are fallen angels imprisoned on Earth, Opal is swept up into a supernatural battle that has been raging since the beginning of time. In Rachel Allyson Stone's fast-paced novel, The Guardian , Opal finds herself being hunted by the cruelest of beings. Only Caleb and Emma know how to save her. But when Opal's life begins to fall apart, she learns that salvation depends on her own stubborn, pessimistic heart. Can Opal survive a war between angels and demons? Will the guardians be able to return to heaven, or will they be on the run again, always seeking peace and never finding it?",
