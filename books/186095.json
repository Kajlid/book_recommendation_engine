  "description": "Devilishly Handsome... David Culhane is a loner whose sense of honor overrides his own desires. David leaves his life in the rugged West Virginia hills behind as he tries to forget a discouraging heartbreak. In the years he roams the countryside, David realizes it was his loss of pride, not love, he was searching for until he falls prey to the seductive charms of a blue eyed, dimple cheeked, schoolmarm from Wyoming. Angelically Beautiful... Evelyn Ratherby, a substitute teacher on the verge of spinsterhood, throws down the dictates of society to follow her heart. She gambles her way onto a cattle drive where she's dealt high stakes adventures. Refusing to fold when things get tough, Eve antes up her courage all the way from Texas to Colorado, where she seductively wins an all-or-nothing hand of a lifetime.",
