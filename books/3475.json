  "description": "From the award winning series, Cougar Cub Tales, I'm Just Like You is the second book about the ongoing adventures of the cougar cub brother and sister. One day, they encounter a creature very unlike themselves. They have ungrounded apprehension about whether or not the blind bobcat is a REAL cougar cub . By the end of the tale, they realize that they really ARE the same, overlooking their physical differences as they embrace their new friend. It is a timeless story that deals with the everyday issues of non-acceptance and intolerance, especially regarding physical difference and disability. Written in a wonderful nonsensical rhyme with eighteen watercolors, it is an exquisite representation of a charming tale. Check out Cougar Cub Lost and Alone, the first story and soon to be released, Cougar Cub The Sneezy Wheezy Day.",
