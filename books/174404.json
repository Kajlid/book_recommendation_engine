  "description": "Welcome to the Republic of Texas, a country mined from the rubble of a fallen America and forged into steel by civil war and unending corporate conflict. Technology and neglect made this country what it is. It's near as wild as it was after America wrestled it from the native civilizations. Maybe more so. It's a tough place to make a living, but it's home and on a good day it’s a bounty hunter's gold mine.Winston Brand was a bounty hunter, but nothing felt like a gold mine when he woke after a battle he didn’t remember. By the looks of it, it wasn’t a battle he’d won. All he knew was that Goodwin was paying good money. There were other hunters after the girl, too, so Winston hardly had time to ask himself the question: Why does Chester Goodwin want his own daughter back Dead or Alive?",
