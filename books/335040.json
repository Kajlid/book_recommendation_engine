  "title": "The Battle of the Red Hot Pepper Weenies",
  "description": "A girl doesn't have a date for the school dance—until her dad makes one for her in his lab. \"Lily—meet Stitchy.\" A family enjoys a nice Thanksgiving dinner—until they are interrupted by a torrent of turkeys out for revenge. A princess meets a pea-brained suitor. And the battle of two red hot pepper weenies ends in flames.Critically-acclaimed author and master of the macabre David Lubar returns from a journey into the darkest depths of his brain with thirty-five more warped and creepy tales. And in the tradition of the three previous Weenie collections—In the Land of the Lawn Weenies, Invasion of the Road Weenies, and The Curse of the Campfire Weenies—he reveals the inspiration behind each story at the end of the book. Don't be a weenie. Read these stories...if you dare!",
