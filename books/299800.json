  "description": "You've read Alyssa's side of the story in The Tie That Binds. Now it's Daniel's turn.I thought I could stay away from her. I thought wrong.What was I supposed to do when I found out that Charles Moriani's last wish was for me to marry his only daughter?I owed the man everything - he taught me all I know and took on the role my late father was unable to fulfil, never asking for anything in return.Until now.The choice was easy to make. Too easy, perhaps. I tried to make myself believe I married her for honourable reasons, but nothing could be further from the truth.Alyssa was never meant to find out how I feel about her. She was never meant to end up in my bed. And she was definitely never meant to love me back.Author's note: Serendipity is based on my debut novel, The Tie That Binds, and largely follows the same events, but it's written from Daniel's point of view. While it is technically a standalone, I highly recommend reading The Tie That Binds first. It'll be a more enjoyable read that way, as Serendipity was mostly written for my beloved readers that requested Daniel's side of the story.",
