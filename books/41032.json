  "description": "You have read Xandra's version of when she first met Kallen. Now it's his turn. Join him on this incredible adventure his grandmother has sent him on, and read how his feelings for Xandra developed over time.***** Reader Message *****True of Blood: Kallen’s Tale is meant to be read after True of Blood. This is a companion book that gives the reader a look into Kallen’s mind when he meets Xandra. In an effort to avoid as much redundancy as possible, I have condensed some scenes, focusing less on Xandra and more on Kallen. This could cause confusion if this book is read first.I hope you enjoy this look into Kallen’s world.",
