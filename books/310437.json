  "description": "There's a reason buried things should always stay buried. For better or for worse.To have and to hold a demon for eternity. She says demons haunt the night, inflecting everything in their path. But where I come from demons don't just lurk around the shadows. They breed in your head. Feasting on your soul until you cease to exist.And, mine just woke up infested in wicked lies.Till death do us apart, little soul.",
