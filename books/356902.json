  "title": "White Dog",
  "description": "Both a personal memoir and a French novelist's encounter with American reality, White Dog is an unforgettable portrait of racism and hypocrisy. Set in the tumultuous Los Angeles of 1968, Romain Gary's story begins when a German shepherd strays into his life: \"He was watching me, his head cocked to one side, with that unbearable intensity of dogs in the pound waiting for a rescuer.\" A lost police canine, this \"white dog\" is programmed to respond violently to the sight of a black man and Gary's attempts to deprogram it—like his attempts to protect his wife, the actress Jean Seberg; like her endeavors to help black activists; like his need to rescue himself from the \"predicament of being trapped, lock, stock and barrel within a human skin\"—lead from crisis to grief.Using the re-education of this adopted pet as a metaphor for the need to quash American racism, Gary develops a domestic crisis into a full-scale social allegory.",
