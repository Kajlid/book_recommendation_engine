  "title": "Franz Kafka: A Biography",
  "description": "Max Brod, a German writer of historical fiction, has come to us best known as the editor of Kafka's writings. This second, enlarged edition represents the culmination of Brod's work on Kafka, and for many, is one of the authoritative biographies of the great writer's life. Its return into print is long overdue and warmly welcomed. Readable, trenchant, poignant, Brod's look at the tragi-comic nature of Kafka's reality, so aptly reflected in his work, is highly recommended reading Kafkaites.",
