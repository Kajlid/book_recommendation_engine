  "description": "Hank is happy with his life in Shady Ridge, the small town he grew up in and now works as a police officer in. And if he has to go to the Neon Sky, a gay bar a couple hours away in the middle of nowhere once every six months or so to get his jollies, well it's working for him.At least it is until Charlie joins the force. A giant of a man, Charlie has left the big city after a nasty break-up and come to Shady Ridge for a little peace. Hank's immediately attracted, and when he runs into Charlie at the Neon Sky, finding out they're batting for the same team... well it just might turn Hank's ordered world upside down.",
