  "description": "Can a Brentwood brat survive without a phone? Edna will find out.Edna is a precocious trouble-maker wreaking havoc at school. Her therapist advocates medication, but her parents come up with an alternative cure: Edna will spend the summer in the desert with her grandparents. Their remote cabin is cut off from cell phone signals and cable service, so they don’t have Internet. They don’t even have a television. Edna can’t imagine an entire summer without WiFi. She’s determined to rebel, but then she meets an older local boy and falls in love for the first time. How can she get to know him from the edge of nowhere?Praise for Edna in the Desert“I loved this realistic, funny-and-yet-equally-serious, pitch-perfect novel about a young teen with no distractions—other than herself. What Edna learns over her summer in the desert makes for one of my favorite books of the year.”Melissa SenateAuthor of See Jane Date and The Mosts\"I LOVED the book! It was so dramatic and sweet. I just loved it. I will buy several copies for my school library, and I recommend it to students and teachers.\"Karen CasaceliGateway Middle School Librarian, Monroeville, PA\"I really enjoyed it. Edna in the Desert really captured the teenage voice and how they think they know everything. I definitely think more schools should have the opportunity to read it.\"Melissa MehlingHonors English Teacher, Carle Place High School, Carle Place, NY",
