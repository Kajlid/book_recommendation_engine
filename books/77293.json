  "description": "For Princess Mab, protection means power. As the most powerful faerie in existence, Mab is powerless to save her Lumen Court when its time runs out. Challenged from all sides, she is forced to court Freyr—an alluring, reluctant Vanir god sent to her world. When Mab and Freyr unite against increasing betrayal and murder among the headstrong faerie courts, an ancient prophecy plunges them into chaos. Both fight against catastrophic results threatening to tear them apart. Though Freyr struggles against Mab’s bloodlust and revenge, he is determined to save her from an unstoppable force that would lead her deeper into shadows and madness. A pawn in a centuries-old conflict, Mab must test herself beyond anything she’s ever known or condemn her court to destruction. But the very thing that would save her court might be the one thing that costs Mab her life.",
