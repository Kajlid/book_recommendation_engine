  "description": "This summer is different. School is over for Alex Delaney, and he’s waiting for his university acceptance, only seventeen days away. The waiting is killing him. He’s not expecting much from summer. Bodysurfing, TV, but mainly waiting.So he’s not ready for the girl who cuts past him on a wave. Not at all prepared for her perfect balance on the board, the elegant muscles of her shoulders and back. Just a girl. Compelling green eyes, golden skin, something graceful and elusive about her. Summer is about to change.",
