  "description": "A deadly sexy SEAL. His best friend's sister. An assignment gone very wrong. A USA Today Bestseller! Retired Navy SEAL Chris Cassidy knows the bro code—no messing around with teammates’ sisters. But, Chris never was one for following rules. Besides, Rick’s gorgeous sister Darci is worth breaking a few rules for. Darci Mann is tired of being alone. Since Zane, the bad boy SEAL she had a crush on, fell in love with someone else, and her best friend Ali found her own happy ending, Darci’s feeling her single status extra keenly. Though she suspects her brother’s friend Chris would be willing to change that if she decides to let him. When a routine assignment turns deadly and Chris switches from charming joker to trained killer, willing to kill or die to protect her, Darci might have to reevaluate her feelings about the perpetual bachelor and her own life and future with him.",
