  "description": "My father was gunned down in front of his company's headquarters. He survived long enough to extract a promise from Mac Sutton...to protect me by marrying me.  My father had basically handed off his partnership to the man, yet I’m still shocked that his final wish was to hand me off as well. Though I adored my father and want to be a dutiful daughter, marriage to a hard-hearted bastard like Mac Sutton seems too much of a sacrifice.Mac doesn't want this marriage any more than I do, yet he's hell-bent on keeping his promise. As if he owed my father. I’m beyond suspicious of his motives, but he’s using guilt to make me comply, reminding me that it was my father's deathbed request.Of course, getting married will destroy my nice comfortable relationship with the man I've been dating. My boyfriend doesn't stir any passion in me, which is exactly the way I like it. My mother killed herself because of passion. And I am my mother's child. Not only do I look like her, but I have her impulsive nature. I'm determined to live my life differently. \nI'm not about to let passion overrule my common sense.",
