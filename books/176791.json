  "description": "Matt Turner’s psychic ability has granted him a window into the entirety of Earth’s intelligent beings—past and present—but this gift has also been his heaviest burden. A talent like Matt’s can only be kept secret for so long, and ruthless individuals desiring lost and rare items have viewed him only as a prized tool.  Now, there is no more secret. Despite living a reclusive existence—unseen in five years—Matthew Turner is among the most recognized names on the planet, and wealthy collectors are not the only ones out for a piece of the only confirmed, undisputed psychic the world has ever known. Most people simply want his help tracking down a missing loved one.  At only 32, Matt has seen and experienced more of life and death than any person alive, and with this unique talent and perspective, he’s now ready to set right the wrongs of both yesterday and today.",
