  "title": "The Wimsey Family: A Fragmentary History Compiled from Correspondence with Dorothy L. Sayers",
  "description": "Behind every great man, there stands an equally great family and Lord Peter Wimsey’s family is no exception. On the Wimsey family tree there blossomed some of the British Empire’s most extraordinary men and women, stretching as far back as that colorful trip across the Channel known as the Norman Conquest. Gleaned from the witty and imaginative letters of Dorothy L. Sayers and the fertile annals of English history and fancy, The Wimsey Family is a marvelous excursion into the days of yore which uncovers the age-old mystery—whencesoever did Lord Peter spring and how the devil did he get so clever?
