  "description": "Poetry. John Compton's [n√©e Thompson's] first book of poetry is not, in poet Christopher Bursk's words, \"an easy read. It teases us with hard questions, takes us into troubling parts of our soul we'd like to pretend don't exist, draws us to get our footing in lines that seem to shift under us and taxes the limits of poetry and of our own minds. Flick on the light of your miner's helmet. Join this poet and dig deep.\"",
