  "description": "*This is a novelette only available as bonus content at the end of Never Truth*I spent years devoting my life to a woman whose heart belonged to another man. She belongs to him now, and in the process, I was shot and wrongfully arrested. It’s been a shit couple of months. I never dreamed it would all turn around the second I met my court-ordered shrink. She was breathtaking. Irresistible. Keenly perceptive and impossibly stubborn—an alluring challenge I couldn’t ignore.She thinks her oath of ethics will keep our relationship strictly professional. I look forward to proving her otherwise…Guilty Stars is a complete Five Families novelette with an HEA and no cliffhangers meant to be read between books 2 and 3 of The Five Families Series.",
