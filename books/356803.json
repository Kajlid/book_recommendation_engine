  "description": "Return to the tranquil shores of Willow Lake with The Winter Lodge. On the longest night of the year, Jenny Majesky loses everything in a devastating house fire. But as she finds comfort in the predictability of running the family bakery, she’s surprised by the ongoing support of the Avalon community, especially local police chief Rourke McKnight. When she finds an unusual treasure among her grandfather’s belongings, she embarks on a search for the truth, and on a path she never imagined. The Winter Lodge, a remote cabin owned by her half-sister on the shores of Willow Lake, becomes a refuge for Jenny as she seeks the truth. In the peaceful quiet, she can focus on rebuilding her life — and pursue her dream of becoming a writer. But when a blizzard traps her there with Rourke, Jenny suddenly doesn’t feel so secure. Unlocking the secrets of the past might just mean walking away from her one chance at love.",
