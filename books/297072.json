  "description": "Florida isn’t all beaches and sunshine. There are strange and hidden places in the center of the state, places where Wild Magick runs free and dark things lurk beneath the cypress.For Eugene Law, one of Tampa’s few active Magicians, the smart plan had always been to avoid those places altogether, and as plans go, it had been a good one. That was until he closed a deal with the enigmatic 69 Mallory Lane to save his family. A single dirty deed in a backwater bar for the House tips the scales and sets Gene on a collision course with Demon Hunters, Darklings, and the best in Animated Demin. In short order, Tampa’s ex-Magician finds himself deep in the heart of the Green Swamp where bad decisions reign supreme.For a broken Magician, sometimes the only way forward is to go back and take the beaten path.",
