  "description": "\"Is It Just Me? or Is Everyone a Little Nuts!\" offers a laugh out loud look at parenting, marriage, aging and small town living from an suburban point of view. Written in short chapters, Coltman retells everyday life events, conversations and stories infused with her skewed sense of humor. These small snippets of life are moments in which anyone can identify and laugh at themselves as well. Middle age can be boring, but Coltman allows the naughty into her life from time to time, like her adult Scout Troop, \"Cougar Scouts\" Troop 69, or conversations between her middle aged self and her seventeen year old self that will leave you rolling ( and remembering!) A great quick read!!",
