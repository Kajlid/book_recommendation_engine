He swears none of them will harm me, but I can’t be so sure. Zachary is convinced he knew me before he was imprisoned—three hundred years ago. He tries to get me to remember our shared past…while I find myself more concerned with our future.My blood could end them…When the woman I was mistaken for appears, she brings startling revelations for both of us.
