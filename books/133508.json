  "description": "Southerlynn Row crept into my bed one night and I don't know how it happened, but one minute I was telling her to leave and the next...well, the next I was her first and then she disappeared from my life like a specter in the night and I never saw her again.For ten years I wondered where she was and for ten years I've been haunted by her memory. I am locked into a union I do not want to be in, with a woman that I do not love, because even after ten years this redhead still haunts my dreams and my fantasies. Just when I think that I've buried that part of my life, the past comes back with a vengeance.A night out with the boys at a strip club was what I needed after a long and grueling case that I ended up winning. I wasn't prepared for who I'd see headlining the stage that night, though. And once I saw her, my heart - and other...um, organs - started pulsating again.*******Ten years ago, I seduced the man I loved and walked out of his life. Ten years later, and I plan on doing it again. If only I can stop embarrassing myself in front of him: like face-planting on the floor during a sexy dance as I try to lure him back into my life...and my lacy boy shorts.I've had a messed up past, but Collin Danes made it all worth it to experience day by day. I spent ten years of my life without him. I refuse to do it again.I'm a grown woman now. And if I'm going to get what I want, I'm going to need a plan. When something is meant to be, nothing or no one - no matter how rich and pretty they are - can stand in the way.",
