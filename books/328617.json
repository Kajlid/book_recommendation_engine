  "description": "We are driving on Street Runs Road now. This is the road--the place where it happened, the birthplace of my journey, the crossroads, the crux of time where the line between life and death merged. It is the place where I was forever changed. In July of 1983, JC Pezzini and his parents were involved in a deadly hit-and-run car accident. A mysterious Good Samaritan referred to as \"She\" was the only reason JC survived--and finding She has become his all-consuming passion in life. More than twenty years later, JC is a filmmaker, a voyeur, and a man haunted by his past. With the help of his psychiatrist, his friends, and old acquaintances of the unknown woman, JC will attempt to get closer to She than he could ever hope to--even in his most lucid daydreams. Whether through regression hypnotherapy, time travel by means of an anti-reality chamber, or sheer determination, JC won't stop until he recovers the answers he has been searching for all these years. After coming across a stunning She look-alike named Angela, JC is convinced he's almost completed his life quest. Only then are the real answers--and the shocking secrets that have hidden the truth--revealed.",
