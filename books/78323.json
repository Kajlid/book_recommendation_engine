  "description": "A Christmas book with a unique \"snow globe\" novelty on the cover- kids can flip the book upside-down and right-side-up to make the glitter and shapes float, fly, and decorate the Christmas tree!When Mr. and Mrs. Bear find that their extra-big Christmas tree won't fit in their house, they cut off the top half and share it with Mr. Fox and his son saying, \"We took our tree and made it two. One half for us, one half for you.\"The Foxes love their new tree, but then they remember Old Rabbit, who lives alone. So the Foxes give half of their tree to Old Rabbit. And in turn, Old Rabbit gives part of his tree to a mouse family.The cover of the book features a fabulous, tree-shaped gel pouch filled with sparkly, festive glitter and foil bells, stars, and more!",
