  "description": "Anorexia nervosa is a controversial subject that attracts constant media attention. As an illness it mystifys as much as terrifies. In this book Claire Beeken tells the story of her battle with anorexia. She was first hospitalized at the age of 10 with an eating disorder and spent the next 13 years in a cycle of starvation, binge-eating and laxative abuse. She describes her early years through her teenage years to how she finally gained the upperhand and put herself on the road to recovery.",
