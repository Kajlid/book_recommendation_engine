  "description": "Florence is confused. Her family says her older sister Lizzie died of fever and should be buried immediately. No doctor is called, no clergyman is present and no neighbours are asked to come. The burial happens at night. In 1860s Australia, on a remote sheep station, the staff do not ask questions. Life has been good for young Florence. She has her pony and her birds, her older sisters spoil her and even her very strict father often gives way to her. But after Lizzie’s burial, the atmosphere in her home changes. People are grieving, but there is much gossip. Family and staff members whisper in corners and no one will answer Florence’s questions. No one visits Lizzie’s grave. The arrival of her new governess, Susannah, a friend of Lizzie’s, adds to the tension. Susannah does not believe that Lizzie died of fever. With Susannah, Florence sets out to discover the true story of what has happened to her sister.",
