With her growing business being praised from the mouths of celebrities, Lexi’s happy to oblige. What she isn’t expecting is to gain the attention of the guy who’s everything she’s shied away from. Cruz is a self-assured witch, a realist, and not afraid to play the field with his charismatic demeanor. Lexi’s optimistic, sweet, and looking for the one who will make her heart whole.Sometimes love is hiding in places you’d least expect. Just ask Lexi and Cruz.",
