  "description": "Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper burns. Fahrenheit 451 is a novel set in the (perhaps near) future when \"firemen\" burn books forbidden by a totaltarian \"brave new world\" regime. The hero, according to Mr. Bradbury, is \"a book burner who suddenly discovers that books are flesh-and-blood ideas and cry out silently when put to the torch.\"Today, when libraries and schools in this country and all over the world are still \"burning\" certain books, Fahrenheit 451 remains a brilliantly readable and suspenseful work of even greater impact and timeliness.",
