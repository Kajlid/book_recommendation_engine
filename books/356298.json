  "title": "No Perfect People Allowed: Creating a Come-as-You-Are Culture in the Church",
  "description": "How do we live out the message of Jesus in today's ever-changing culture? The church is facing its greatest challenge—and its greatest opportunity—in our postmodern, post-Christian world. God is drawing thousands of spiritually curious \"imperfect people\" to become his church—but how are we doing at welcoming them? No Perfect People Allowed shows you how to deconstruct the five main barriers standing between emerging generations and your church by creating the right culture. From inspiring stories of real people once far from God, to practical ideas that can be applied by any local church, this book offers a refreshing vision of the potential and power of the Body of Christ to transform lives today.",
