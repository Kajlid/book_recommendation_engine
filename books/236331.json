  "description": "The Circle War Rages…  The war of the gods has spread beyond Earth, and the expansion brings all new challenges for August and Bear.  With Meryn in hiding, Paralos takes charge of her champions. Bear is forced into recruiting the other gods to join the fight against Amara, while August is sent into combat alongside Paralos’s chosen, the legendary Aeris, leader of the doomed Vontani race. August must help Aeris win her people’s safety before Paralos will let them go back to Earth to face Amara’s champions. For Bear, a man who found himself thrust into a war he didn’t want any part of, the recruitment of the gods becomes perilous, as he finds he’s not the only champion looking for allies. If he’s going to succeed, he’ll have to fight, and he’ll have to do it without August or Shadow.  On Earth, Amara pits the world against August and Bear in their absence, blaming them for Gemini’s destruction during the events of GODSEND. When August and Aeris arrive, August finds out he’s a wanted man, and the people he’s sworn to save are the very people hunting him.  Bear and August’s paths converge in a battle for Earth that shows the true destructive power of the gods’ champions, and the ramifications of a war that threatens to encompass the universe.",
