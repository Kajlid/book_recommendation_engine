  "title": "Cloud's Rider",
  "description": "On a distant planet, all the native creatures communicate telepathically, projecting images which drive humans to madness. As a result, the people live in walled cities and owe their lives to the nighthorses, equines who can bond with certain riders and provide a telepathic \"buffer\". But one savage winter, young Danny Fisher and his nighthorse Cloud lead the survivors of a deadly telepathic attack to shelter high in the snowbound mountains--only to discover their \"sanctuary\" threatened by a vicious predator never before known to humans. Sequel to \"Rider at the Gate\".",
