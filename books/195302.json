Reaver and Killian are going to quickly realize that the plaguelands hold to them a threat that the greywastes and Skyfall have never seen; a dangerous creature that has discovered just how valuable immortals are.And back in Skyfall, the Dekker family is about to be tested in ways they’ve never been before.
