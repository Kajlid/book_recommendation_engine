  "description": "Scottish metal vocalist Spark MacDubh wakes covered in snow on a street of his home town. His most recent memories are of dying and being jolted back to life by a force from the skies. Feeling fresher than ever, Spark sets out to restart his band, which had split years earlier in a hail of blood rituals, violence, depravity and jail time. Finding his ex-bandmates isn’t easy, but convincing them to abandon their new lives in order to chase old dreams is a monumental task. Guided by voices he believes to be celestial, MacDubh leads the band out on tour... and mayhem follows. As the voices in Spark’s head urge him down ever-darker paths, his psyche is stretched to breaking point. The band's trail of destruction, fornication and occult events attracts the attention of the Devil himself, who claims to be the outfit's only hope of success. Unwilling to sign away his soul, however, MacDubh decides instead to put the Devil out of business. A fantastic idea in theory, but not exactly a practical plan. For starters, it requires a trip to Hell. Catch-22? More like Catch-666. Even with help from a Wiccan priestess, a criminal manager, the world’s most eccentric music journalist and an assortment of dead rock stars, the odds are stacked against MacDubh and his gang. Metallic Dreams takes the reader into a realm where deities and demons are muses, where the profound is hidden within the profane, and where five uncompromising Scots must put their existence on the line in defence of each other. An immersive journey loaded with hope, humour and the heaviest metal.“The Devil has all the best tunes? My arse! Metalville just got a new sheriff.” – Spark MacDubh",
