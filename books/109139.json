  "description": "As wolf shifters, friends, and lovers, Tristen and Fin’s loyalty knows no bounds. Yet these close shifters cannot speak from the heart. Which only worsens since Tristen suffers from extreme postwar PTSD and refuses Fin’s suggestions for help. Unfortunately, silence is a highly destructive force. As Fin becomes a shifter of fewer and fewer words, he starts to believe this might be the beginning of their end.Santo, another retired soldier and vampire, is invited to stay on after the temp job in Vegas. Given his torturous battlefield experiences, he's looking for work and a place to belong after swearing off blood hunting. Running security for the head of the Justice Council in Denver is a place to deal with his past.When these three connect for a night of drinking and pool, they find a way out of their painful war experiences and how to heal. But can one wild night be the means to discover deeper desires and trust? Or will Fin want more...Afterward, he and Tristen must decide if they will stay together or if a hook-up with a footloose vampire is the doorway to going their separate ways. Note: Red flag alert. Sensitive subject matter deals with veterans' PTSD, wartime nightmares, adult scenes, and language.",
