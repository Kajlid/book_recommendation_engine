  "description": "Relentless, life-threatening peril is only one reason Magda would prefer to be back on the beach in the human world reading trashy novels. But that life seems further and further behind her as she travels deep into the magical wilds of the Pixie Lands, pursuing a destiny she’s not sure she wants, but can’t seem to escape. Fending off her attraction to a reluctant Prince isn’t making her journey any easier either. And more danger awaits when she’s forced to trespass into the Elf King's Realms. There, two Princes meet face to face for the first time. One discovers his true identity. And one has a dragon. Part Three of the fantasy romance serial Claiming the Prince.",
