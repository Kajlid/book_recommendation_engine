  "description": "They’ll be put to the ultimate test to save their club, and a love like they’ve never known.  Things are not going well for the Iron Raiders. Now that the Black Brothers have declared an open turf war, every man in the club has been put to work, fighting to reclaim their territory and remove the threat of a takeover. But for Austin Parker, things have never been better. True, the business with the club is nasty, but he’s finally convinced Ellie to give him a shot, and he’s determined not to screw it up.  Ellie Carmichael has no idea what she was thinking by letting Austin into her life. But she sees a different side to him than she ever has before, and she hopes that he will prove her instinct right. In the meantime, she’s trying to support the club in any way they’ll let her, even as it gets her into trouble from time to time.  As the Black Brothers get closer, things get more dangerous. As people get hurt, the stakes are raised, and Austin will be forced to risk it all to save the woman he can’t live without and the club that has started to feel like the only family he’s ever known. When everything is on the line, he’ll stop at nothing to protect the only people who’ve ever had his back, and the only woman he’s ever wanted a future with.  It will take the fight of a lifetime to make that possible future a reality.",
