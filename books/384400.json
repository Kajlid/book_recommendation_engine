  "description": "Lilly has been thrown into another dimension at the whim of an unnamed, undefined entity. To return to her life with Gabriele, she must find a new door, prevent a paradox and seek the truth from the past. The youngest vampire in existence, she will travel the world and centuries of vampire history to become the oldest of her kind with talents that humanize and terrorize those that would manipulate her for their ends. In the end, she must return to where she began and make choices between her first love, the tales of someone she’s had no reason to doubt, and an Über-vampire who reeks of evil and illness yet holds her heart. What is truth? What is instinct? Which acts will she commit that can preserve or will end those of her line?",
