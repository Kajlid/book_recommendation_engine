  "description": "He had some questions…and she gave all the wrong answers.Luke’s learned the hard way that a pretty face gets him nothing but trouble. His solution? A series of questions to use as a dating screener. The woman with the right answers would be perfect, except for one tiny problem. Madison Anderson, the woman he really wants, the one who makes him laugh and can rock a bikini better than most on Boca Raton’s beaches, just failed the test. Miserably.Madison is hardly oblivious to her new neighbor, Luke Bennet. A sexy construction worker with sun-kissed hair and an easy smile that makes her melt? Yes please. But it’s not like she’s going gaga over him like the other women in her condo building. And since she’s engaged, anything between them will have to be strictly as friends... even if every one of her senses is sending her messages that they want so much more.The rules for love are about to be rewritten in the sixth book in the Almost Perfect series!",
