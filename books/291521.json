  "description": "Winner of the 2019 OutWrite Chapbook Competition in Poetry. Selected by Wo Chan. A 5”x5” chapbook. 48 pages.“A voyage and a promise, boy if steers the conditional waters of gender, memory, and family through a constellation of lyric and song. Espudo’s debut is genuine and intelligent, tipping the tradition of poetic portraiture into queer time. boy if does not reflect—it renders. It resumes and it restores. One feels a heartbeat reading these poems.” — Wo Chan",
