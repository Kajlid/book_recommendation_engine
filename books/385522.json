  "description": "Tehmper is a fire demon, devoted to hunting down Shayatin. One such mission leads him to Gabe, his mate. He bites Gabe and claims him. But convincing Gabe to return to Jinnistan is harder than Tehmper thought. When more rogue demons attack, trying to take Gabe, it's all Tehmper can do to convince Gabe to leave with him, especially when the man is so angry over the destruction of his home. When Tehmper and Gabe are met at the portal gate by the ruling Amir and his personal guards, Tehmper has no choice but to turn his mate over or risk Gabe's life. He vows to do everything in his power to free Gabe, even if it means returning him to the surface world. But can he save Gabe before the Amir turns him into royal consort, or will Gabe lose his head to the executioner's axe? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
