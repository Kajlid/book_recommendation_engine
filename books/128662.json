  "description": "Two young seeksmen are dead, and Sydney blames herself. The only way to get her sister back from the county's clutches, while also preventing more death, was to offer her own life in exchange for Evvie's freedom.She expected a dreadful end, but nothing like the prison in which she wakes. Agonizing county life is redefined in Neo-Necropolis, new city of the dead, which lies beneath the earth. Worse than being allegedly deceased, is the false identity Sydney is forced to assume where Evvie, Sheridan's captain, and Crewe never existed. Sydney alone knows the magnitude of the county's evildoings inside, outside, and now below. At only eighteen, the responsibility to defend freedom falls solely on her tried and tested shouldersâ€”a burden that requires desperate action when a catastrophic revelation upends the world as she knew it. The people Sydney cares for are more vulnerable than ever. Though she's buried underground and monitored by county agents, she must escape this new captivity. Maybe it's time to fight fire with fire. Sydney has proven her courage in facing their weapons, but can she trigger her own?",
