  "description": "We were supposed to be living our Happily Ever After.  It’s been three months since we graduated. X started college, Riot's got his Motocross sponsorship, and Baz is working 20 hour days to try to clean up Peter's mess. Me? I don’t have a clue what I want to do with my life yet.  But that might not matter. Peter isn't accepting defeat, even from a prison cell, and revenge is the name of the game. I don't know if my boys and I are strong enough to get through it again. Especially when my past finally catches up with me.  I'm Ever Darlington and this time? I might not have a way out.  NEVER AFTER is the follow up book to the Lost Boys of Neverly Prep series. A dark and dirty contemporary RH romance based loosely on the characters from Peter Pan. All the players are over 18.",
