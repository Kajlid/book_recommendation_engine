  "description": "Born into an affluent family, Locky never faced a problem his family money couldn't fix. Everything changed the night he stumbled upon a young gay man beaten to death and left in the parking lot beside his car. Unable to get the image of the boy out of his head, Locky quit his father's law practice and took a job at BK House. Adapting to a new way of life is difficult, and it's made even more so by a raven-haired hottie who pushes every one of Locky's buttons.College courses have been a breeze for junior, Becket Chandler. He's sailed through his classes with ease, despite their advanced subject matter. His love life, on the other hand, has been an ongoing struggle with no easy answers. While his former housemates enjoyed gaming, sports and drinking, Becket chose sex as his favourite extracurricular activity.When Becket arrives at the BK House, he's ready to tackle another year and a few more willing seniors. Younger men are fun to play with from time to time, but nothing satisfies him like an older, bigger man staring down at him, preferably with Becket's legs spread and draped over his broad shoulders. From the moment he shakes hands with Locky, all he can think about is getting the drop-dead sexy Director of Student Life into his favourite position. Despite Becket's continued interest, Locky continues to play hard to get. Luckily, Becket doesn't give up easily.",
