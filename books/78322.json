  "description": "Set in contemporary New York and reminiscent of the comedies of P.G. Wodehouse and Preston Sturges, Blue Heaven is the uproarious tale of a most unlikely couple and their brilliant plan to earn a fortune on the way to the altar.Gilbert Selwyn, a young man possessed of boundless charm and an allergy to employment, has devised a plan to wring a nice pile of loot from his mother's newest (and obscenely wealthy) husband. The scheme, simply put, is to get married for the gifts. But Gilbert, who's gay, needs a fianc√©e... Enter Moira Finch, a demonically conniving young woman whose own mother, having recently married the Duke of Dorsetshire, will contribute richly to the couple's receipts. Enter, too, Philip Cavanaugh, Gilbert's longtime friend, former lover, and highly strung Best Man. And enter, finally, the Cellinis, Gilbert's huge internecine step-family, whose fortune has not been amassed as innocently as Gilbert first believed.As Gilbert, Moira, and Philip struggle to keep their plot under wraps, the scams get bigger and more perilous, deceit multiplies, and a wonderfully calamitous trail leads us toward what could be the wedding of the season.",
