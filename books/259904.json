  "description": "The highly acclaimed author of The Jew in the Lotus turns his attention to his own rich and diverse tradition to understand what it means to live spiritually as a Jew. The Jew in the Lotus found Rodger Kamenetz in Dharamsala, India, witnessing an historic dialogue between rabbis and the Dalai Lama. That highly charged visit blasted open Kamenetz's view of what it means to be a practicing Jew and launched him on a six-year journey to find and learn from the teachers who are revitalizing the ancient spiritual practices of Judaism. In Stalking Elijah, Kamenetz takes us along for the ride. Whether exploring the old tradition for its meditative silences or hearing the new Kabbalah being created by today's women, whether welcoming the Sabbath bride with Jewish drug addicts and convicts in the slums of West L.A. or practicing the Hasidic method of \"calling out\" to God while driving the San Bernadino freeway, Kamenetz will provoke and inspire readers to dig down for the richness of their own spiritual traditions and introduce them to the amazing new landscape of Jewish practice. A fun and profoundly moving account of one man's search for a deeper Jewish practice, Stalking Elijah will be coveted by all those who loved The Jew in the Lotus and conscientiously studied by everyone curious about the Jewish path to the inner life.",
