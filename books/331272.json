  "description": "Knox Maguire is the king of our college campus.Star offensive tight end on the football team.He is the complete opposite of me in every way.I'm quiet. He's loud.I'm shy. He's definitely not.Everyone loves him. No one knows me.Fresh out of a breakup, I don't really trust him, and why should I? Knox is the ultimate player. When I become his English tutor, I tell myself we need to keep things between us strictly business. Watching my mother deal with my ex-athlete father long, long ago taught me to stay far away from that type of man.Yet Knox is impossible to resist. Next thing I know, we're getting hot and heavy in the libraryâ€”and that was never part of the plan. When Knox admits he can't stop thinking about me, I have a realization.I can't stop thinking about him either.Instead of keeping my distance, I pull him in closer. Until somehow, we're spending all of our time together and I find myself falling for Knox. Hard.Will this actually work between us? Or am I getting played?",
