  "description": "The love affair that psychoanalysis has had with its own founder has obscured just how different the field is today from what it was a century ago, when Freud was writing. Now Stephen A. Mitchell, a central figure in the modernization of psychoanlalysis, shows how the field is moving beyond the confines of Freudian drive theory to encompass the concerns of contemporary life.",
