  "description": "Review Author lays it all out! Superb book! As a reader who lost the love of my life to what doctors claimed was a \"bipolar\" disorder, I have remained very in the dark as to the the validity of merit regarding this \"mental illness.\" After having the chance to read the author's short but hard hitting book I have decided that this was the one read that provided \"real clarity\" straight from the horses mouth. Absolutely the best book on the bipolar condition that I have ever read....and required reading for those who suffer and those who love the ones who do. Description Learning to live with bipolar disorder can be the toughest part of having it. In \"Living Bipolar\" you'll start at the beginning with what to expect from your first appointments with your medical team, to self help, support and more. Once you've read \"Living Bipolar\" you will have the skills and capabilities to live life with your illness and a better understanding of it, from an author who lives bipolar everyday.",
