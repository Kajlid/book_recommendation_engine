  "title": "Gypsy Wolves: Tornan's Curse",
  "description": "In the dark, foreboding Black Forest of Transylvania, the beautiful gypsy, Galena travels to her arranged marriage with the master wolf hunter of Dragomir. But en route, a mysterious man that commands wolves abducts her and under the spell of a gypsy hex, she is seduced into submitting her innocence to her enigmatic captor’s lust.   Surrendering to the carnal decadence, Galena embarks on a torrid affair. Torn between trusting a man that makes her tremble with desire and fearing the wolves he masters, she soon makes a choice to escape, never knowing of the dire consequences.   Count Tornan Wolvraine has lived his life as a man cursed by a gypsy. With his ability to shape shift into a wolf, he survives on instinct instead of emotions. When he hears of the impending marriage of the master wolf hunter to a gypsy, he knows he has to stop the union by any means, including killing the bride.   But once Galena’s in his clutches, Tornan feels the draw of a long ago prophesy. Ensnared by the enchantment, he acts upon animalistic impulse with both the lust of a man and a beast in a ritual mating that requires his pack of wolf-shifter’s to bare witness to.  In the end, Tornan and Galena must face something more dangerous than a gypsy curse—they must survive the master wolf hunter’s vengeance?",
