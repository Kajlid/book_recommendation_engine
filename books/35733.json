She pays a visit to the stranger in the hospital, but the only thing he remembers of his past is seeing a name written on a headstone: that of Jim Heron — a fallen angel charged with rescuing souls from the seven deadly sins. His amnesia is just the kind of mystery she likes to solve, but she soon discovers they're over their heads with his past. Over their heads with passion, too… As shadows walk the line between reality and another realm, and her lover's memory begins to come back, the two of them learn that nothing is truly dead and buried.For as Mels struggles to help this mysterious stranger rediscover himself, Heron himself returns to prepare for a battle between good and evil. And Mels and her love find themselves trapped in a no-holds-barred war between angels and demons. With a soul on the line, and Mels's heart at risk, what in heaven — or in hell — will it take to save them both?",
