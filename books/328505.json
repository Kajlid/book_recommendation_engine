  "description": "On a planet with three women for every man, eugenicists believe Teakh Noahee to be innately monogamous and altruistic—a load of shine according to him. He passes himself off as a fisherman while blackmailing poachers. Regardless, his DNA may hold the key to male survival on the harsh ocean planet of Fenria. But before he’s aware of his value as sperm donor, he loses a spoonful of his seed to a mysterious trio of women. They are succubi, professionals who sell on the black market. True to his genetics, coded for monogamy, Teakh falls in love with the most beautiful among them, an artist who—in his opinion—is “full sail gorgeous.”Determined to assist in raising his children, he rebels against the matriarchy and sets his own course, founding a new clan that treats men and women as equals, all for the love of the woman who cheated him.",
