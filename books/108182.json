  "description": "In my four hundred years, I’ve learned three very important things...First, my kind, vampires, aren’t the worst things you humans share this world with.Second, true love has the ability to lift you up so high you can almost see the gates of Heaven…or destroy you so utterly that there’s nothing left of your heart but ashes.And last but not least, never, ever, trust a blood witch. I should have known Shea O'Hare was up to something the second the word ‘favor’ came out of her mouth. I was an easy target, I’ll admit. She had something I wanted, something only she could give me, and she used my heart’s desire to maneuver me into place like a pawn on a chess board.You might be asking what a witch could possibly have that a vampire might want so badly that he would willingly let her play him for a fool. In my case, that answer was ridiculously simple—information. It was only a name and a location, but that name and that location meant everything to me.It was bribery, plain and simple.",
