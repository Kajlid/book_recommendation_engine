Detective Mike Sheridan tried to wrap his mind around the concept as he sped through town. The late night call from dispatch had been anything but helpful. A patrol sergeant was missing after making a routine car stop and he was being assigned the case. And so began an investigation unlike any he’d experienced. Sergeant Dave Bertram, had been involved in a computer espionage case that had put him in conflict with the KGB two decades earlier – but could that incident have come back to haunt him, all these years later? With the help of the senior FBI inspector who had worked on the original case, Sheridan tracks the suspects across the country , but who wanted Bertram dead, and why? As Sheridan struggles with grief over losing his colleague and tries to find time for his new girlfriend, he doesn’t realize someone else is also working the Bertram case—a mysterious figure who knows more about the past than he does.",
