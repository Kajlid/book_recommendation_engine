  "description": "Africa and Back, With Dave and Dorothy is a travel journal with color photographs of the couple's mission trip to a charming primary school in a remote part of Zimbabwe, Africa, following which they spend a full week at the resort of Victoria Falls. While they saw the unfortunate side effects of brutality and suffering at its worst, they also experienced African culture at its best, through the art, sculpture, dance and music. The African children, whom they had come to serve, captured their hearts with their poise, gifts, and astonishing thirst for learning amid sometimes primitive conditions.On the lighter side, Dave and Dorothy enjoyed the sights and sound of the mighty Victoria Falls, and spent time with the animals of Africa. Dorothy brings her entertaining story telling skills to bear and will intrigue you with tales of their adventures, spiced throughout with the 225 best of the hundreds of photographs they took on the trip of a lifetime.",
