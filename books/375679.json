  "description": "The Voltarian invaders are getting down and dirty...in the deadliest of games. The Planet Earth. Voltarian Royal Officer Jettero Heller has heart, nerve and a quick mind on his side. His archenemy Soltan Gris has cunning, ruthlessness and a devious plan on his. But what neither of them has is money-and without that they may as well pack up and go back to Voltar. Because as every earthling knows-no pay, no play. Heller's solution is a weekend in Atlantic City, where he puts a new spin on gambling. He's got a foolproof system, guaranteeing that he'll win every bet he makes. Gris, on the other hand, has found an unexpected source of income. His body. Turns out there are certain women, with a very perverse sense of humor, willing to pay to play with him. Into this world of dirty money, dirty tricks and dirty games, the wildest of wild cards is about to change everything. Countess Krak is back-and this voluptuous Voltarian, condemned murderess and love of Heller's life could prove to be the key player in coming to grips with a FORTUNE OF FEAR.",
