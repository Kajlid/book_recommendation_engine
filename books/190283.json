  "description": "The Umae teeter on the brink of extinction. Their blood rivals, the Hek, have mysteriously made huge leaps forward in technology and are now poised to exterminate them. Their godlike protectors, the Journeyers, have not been heard from for centuries. Just as their society is poised to collapse, the Journeycraft Starshine returns to them from deep space. Prohibited from using advanced technology by an ancient set of laws known as The Protocols, the Starshine's terminally ill Command Agent must lead a ragtag group of exiles on an overwater quest to investigate a clue to the Umaes' ultimate salvation. But the Hek stalk them at every turn, and a would be dictator plots his own ascension to power. Can the Journeyers restore the faith the Umae once had in them? Can the key to the Umaes' survival be found in time? And what is the Starshine's Command Agent willing to sacrifice in order to have the only thing he ever truly wanted?",
