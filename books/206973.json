  "description": "Wedding bells and death knells… They say you can’t go home again…and they may be right. Cupcake shop owner, Melissa Gladstone-Beckett, travels from her new home in Florida back to small-town Louisiana to plan a wedding for a beloved friend, taking her amateur sleuthing bestie, Echo Willis, with her. Missy is excited, and feeling more than a little nostalgic, being back in her old hometown, and she loves the changes that have been made to her former cupcake shop. All is not sweetness and cupcakes in the town of LaChance, Louisiana, however, and a murdered mother/daughter duo is found just a few miles from Missy’s old neighborhood. Never ones to shy away from an impromptu investigation, Missy and Echo jump into the case and, in short order, find themselves swept up in a chilling search for the truth. Will the wedding plans be ruined by terrible events? Will Missy and Echo make it back to Florida? Find out in this fast-paced yarn! This fun Cozy Mystery can be read as a standalone, but if you’re interested in finding out more about Missy, her husband, Detective Chas Beckett, and the rest of the gang, you’ll want to read the Frosted Love Cozy Mysteries, which precede this series, along with all the other INNcredibly Sweet books which follow this one. The saga continues with the Cupcakes in Paradise series. Enjoy them all!",
