  "title": "Max the Troll",
  "description": "Max the Troll is a fairly young and quite small troll who longs to leave the fjord, and he thinks he will be the first troll from his troll cave to do so. But he has forgotten about Mist, the young girl troll who, a thousand years before, ended up on a Viking boat by accident and sailed away, no one knows where. Now the time has come to find Mist and bring her home, and Max the Troll has been chosen for the quest. From his home on the fjord in the North he will have to travel to the South, to a peninsula in the middle of the Middle Sea.",
