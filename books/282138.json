  "description": "Werewolf ParanormalBen Davis is a vegetarian, Buddhist, and … werewolf. Sorta. For the last three years, Ben has controlled his lycanthropy by avoiding team sports and doing power yoga. Because of his iron physical and mental control, he doesn't change into his less attractive form.Danielle Linden is a reporter, Ben’s writing partner, and … survivor. Five years ago, she divorced her abusive husband and never looked back. She learned her lesson about love and attraction, though, and guards herself against both. The only guy able to crack her emotional walls is Ben, and he’s just a good-looking teddy bear who wouldn’t hurt a fly.When a frantic father bursts into the newsroom and claims that his daughter, a local college student, was kidnapped by a werewolf, Dani begins an investigation that soon plunges both her and Ben into the dangerous world of the local wolf pack—a world filled with Pagan rituals and animalistic lusts.Ben fears both for Dani’s life and his own secret, but things get more complicated when the Hunger Moon rises, an event that only happens once every eighteen years. With his attraction to Dani already straining his self-control … the strong and enigmatic pull of the Hunger Moon brings him to the edge of change.Then Dani gains the perilous attention of the alpha wolf and Ben realizes he must give in to the dark side of his soul … and in doing so, risk losing the woman he loves—forever.",
