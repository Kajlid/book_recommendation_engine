  "description": "Kiley Tasker lives a simple and predictable life, especially for a woman in her late twenties. So, when she is hired to work for the well known womanizer, Triston Benson, she isn’t thrilled.  Triston Benson has been working to take over his family's business since he was fifteen, no matter the cost. So, when Triston’s father forces him to hire someone to help clean up his playboy reputation, he has no choice but to accept.  When the two are forced to play nice and live under the same roof for thirty days, tensions build. Kiley finds herself drawn to the man she had planned to hate, while Triston battles to deny his intense need to claim her for himself.  Unable to ignore their needs, they start breaking the rules for the sake of pleasure.  Will Triston dominate Kiley in the way she craves, or will he deny his own dark needs for a submissive?
