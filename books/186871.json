  "description": "After the first book delivered nothing like an autobiography should... The highly demanded second one, being more like something a live “Stand Up” comedian would do on stage... Jimmy was asked to write a third, giving his opinions on men, women, the bedroom and relationships. Are men really from Mars? Are women really from Venus? Does size really matter? All can be found out inside this one, as Jimmy lets loose on his words once again !!",
