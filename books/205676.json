  "description": "The Traversers' Memoirs: Wondrous Realms is the first book of a High Fantasy/Mythopoeia series set in the fictional world of Epidrae. Szai li Quer Swei: Coincidence is an accepted myth. Epidrae is a world of 9 oceans and 5 continents, ravaged by a war engulfing 500 kingdoms over a span of 14,000 years. Strife and deceit riddle the peoples of Epidrae, sundered by the 200 distinct races that have come to be, races of shape-shifters, men who can transform into beasts of all kinds - from dragons to lions, from fish to reptiles - each a custodian of a distinct culture, born from a legendary curse that afflicted their world. Malice - an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent entity - manipulates emotions of kingdoms aplenty with elaborate lies and long-drawn politics. To each religion, and to each empire there exists a legendary solution, a way to end all conflict. But what is true and what is not is something that permeates their mortal thoughts. Wondrous Realms is the commencement of one such chain of events that will determine the fate of Epidrae in a conscripted domino effect. The book includes over a hundred poems and songs, and is penned in hyperbolic Middle English prose that often rhymes. The book also includes dialogues in languages native to several races of Epidrae and detailed descriptions of elements unique to this world of legends.",
