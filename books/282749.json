  "title": "Leaping Poetry: An Idea with Poems and Translations",
  "description": "Leaping Poetry is Robert Bly's testament to the importance of the artistic leap that bridges the gap between conscious and unconscious thought in any great work of art. Part anthology and part commentary, Bly seeks to rejuvenate modern Western poetry through his revelations of \";leaping\"; as found in the works of poets from around the world, while also outlining the basic principles that shape his own poetry.",
