  "title": "Ultras: Effect of the Sky Canopy",
  "description": "In the near future, nightmarish creatures called Ferals have overrun the planet, pushing humanity to the brink of annihilation. But in the post-apocalyptic turmoil, something unexpected has happened. A small number of humans have transcended, giving them a rare trait to access the full capacity of the brain. Scientists believe that these Ultra humans may serve the resistance. A scientist named Dr. Mirren is tasked with seeking out these extraordinary people called Ultras, but time is against him. The threat of the Ferals looms ahead and a quicker solution must be devised. Here in one of the last surviving cities on Earth, an effort to protect what is left has begun. A large electromagnetic shield called Sky Canopy has risen around the mega city of Cleveland to defend the people. The Sky Canopy may accomplish keeping the Ferals out, but at what cost? Does the technology itself pose a threat? At the center of the conflict are the Ultras. A high-tech special-forces team, a mysterious ninja assassin, and a mixed martial arts warrior come together in a time of despair to face the deadly Ferals. This sci-fi action adventure leads us into a spectacular city of the future and back into the volatile lands of the Ferals. Between the terror and the tragedy, the triumph and defeat, the Ultras will discover the effect of the Sky Canopy.",
