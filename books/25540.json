  "description": "Beth knows the value of secrecy.It’s what’s kept her and her brother safe roaming from town to town in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. It’s also one of her core rules - trust no one, take no shit, and conceal the constant battle to keep her inner beast at bay. Her animal has always been ornery and restless - she’s used to it. So when a gorgeous stranger walks into her shop, bringing with him both a peculiar sense of calm and an electric attraction, it’s not something she or her animal can ignore.Jax knows two things the moment he sets eyes on Beth. The first is that she’s his mate - a fact that he’s all too eager to prove to her. The second is that secrets surrounding Beth could have colossal implications for his people. When Beth’s existence threatens to tear a divide in his community, Jax is willing to risk everything to protect his mate. But a much more significant threat is coming from outside their fences… and it’s coming fast.",
