  "description": "\"Taylor is a master of the short story form....[His] is an extraordinary gift, too often absent in contemporary fiction.\"THE BOSTON GLOBEIn eleven lyrical, moving, and eerie tales, and three one-act plays Pulitzer Prize-winning author Peter Taylor lays claim to a level of literary observation and feeling that is unmatched. Whether he is exploring the limitations of family and the ambivalence of identity in \"Cousin Aubry,\" the cruel payments exacted by love forsaken in \"The Witch of Owl Mountain Springs,\" or the strange, possibly supernatural power that love calls into play in the title novella, Peter Taylor proves once again that he is a writer of rare talent who should not be missed.",
