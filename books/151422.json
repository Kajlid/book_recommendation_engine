  "description": "A young, independent, and beautiful free-thinker, Brooke Banister always knew what she wanted and how to get it. But when it came to men, she was more interested in ranching than dating. However, she was losing her passion for ranch life and yearned for a change. It would come in the form of a devastatingly handsome man named Devon. A fresh start and a new career were within her reach, but did she have the courage to take the leap? Little did Brooke know, danger awaited her decision. Devon Taylor wasn't looking forward to being dragged away from his comfortable city life, but his father insisted they spend time away from their law firm in San Francisco. He was, however, looking forward to being just another tourist in Montana where no one knew his worth. A place to get away from the constant reminders that his office brought forth. His charming good looks and playboy demeanor had finally caught up to him when an a recent encounter with an obsessive past employee put him on edge. Love had always been a game for Devon until he met the vibrant, head strong Brooke, who caused his fascination to become desire and something more. The problem was, he quickly found that his heart was on the line. Devon's previous secretary Shellie wasn't going to give up without a fight. She longed to be the woman in his life as well as his bed. After her gut wrenching rejection and immediate termination, she vowed revenge on the next woman that occupied Devon's attention. Brooke had no idea she had become a target.",
