  "description": "Fallen Prince, Book One in the Fallen Kingdom Duet, an enemies-to-lovers forbidden romance of epic proportions by Mia Asher.Two brothers. One girl. A tragic love story.Twelve years ago I met them—the Van Buren Princes. One was dazzlingly handsome.Radiant like the sun. The perfect knight in shining armor. It was so easy to be blinded by him. Blinded by his warm touch and kisses that tasted like summer. It should’ve been so easy to fall in love with him … The other was mercilessly vicious. The most beautiful fallen angel. Born with a bulletproof heart. It was so easy to hate him. Hate the captivating smiles hiding a broken soul and his cruelly stolen kisses. He broke my heart in two. But I should’ve known my place. Girls like me don’t get to love the Van Burens without paying a price—‘an eye for an eye, a heart for a heart,’ he said. Now I know better. I’ve come back to where it all started that summer. Back to that gilded hell. The only difference is … This time I am just like them.",
