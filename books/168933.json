  "description": "Callie, a cop on disability leave, plans a new career at the inn where her father was murdered years ago. Nick, a Christian, curious to learn who is opening up the old inn, stops in to find out and someone takes aim. His uncle, who is with him, is shot but survives. Callie demands justice, but thinks the shooting appears to be a planned hit. Thinking she can solve the crime, she instead finds herself protecting Nick from danger. Worse than that, she finds herself fighting to protect her heart from Nick. While attracted to Callie, Nick has promised himself that he will never be more than a friend to someone who is not a believer.",
