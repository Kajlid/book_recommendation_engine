  "description": "When the farmer and her husband find a giant peach at their door, they can’t imagine how it got there. But they are even more surprised when the skin bursts open and out leaps… a girl.Feisty Momoko declares that she is here to make the world a better place, and what better way to start than by investigating the rumours about a fearsome local ogre? Everyone says the ogre is taller than a tree, has teeth like knives, shoots flames from his eyes, and eats small children. The villagers won’t go near him. But Momoko wants to find out for herself, and her new friends Monkey, Dog, and Pheasant might just be able to help her—as long as she’s willing to share those tasty peach dumplings.Inspired by Japan’s Peach Boy story, Raymond Nakamura‘s quirky adventure reminds readers that rumour is no substitute for seeing with your own eyes, and an open hand shows far more courage than a closed fist. Award-winning illustrator Rebecca Bender’s spirited acrylics bring to life a brave heroine, a trio of expressive animals, and a vivid Japanese landscape.",
