  "description": "Matt Scudder put the brilliant and elusive James Leo Motley behind bars - for good, or so he hoped. Because Motley went down swearing revenge on Scudder and anyone who knew him. Twelve years later, Motley is out and giving his psychopathic tendencies free rein. No one is safe, friends, lovers and even strangers unfortunate enough to share the Scudder name. Each step in the resulting grisly dance takes the Big Apple PI one step further away from Al-Anon and one step nearer to death.",
