  "title": "Bloomsday: The Bostoniad",
  "description": "This tragicomic epic brings to life in America the enduring masterpiece of Homer's \"Odyssey\" and the Irish saga of Joyce's \"Ulysses\" in a Father's Day in Boston after the Vietnam War in 1974. This new \"Bostoniad\" portrays the American immigrant descendants of Leopold and Molly Bloom, and Stephen Dedalus of Dublin. After Tim Finnegan's Irish wake Rudy and Penelope Bloom of Beacon Hill meet Harvard Professor, Dr. Thomas Dedalus. \"Bloomsday\" narrates in a pixilist style a chorus of New England voices blending to render new verses of the greatest epic of antiquity and the 20th century's most celebrated literary novel on the legendary wandering home of Odysseus after the fall of Troy.",
