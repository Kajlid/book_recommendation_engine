  "description": "This 240-page novel continues the thrilling saga of the Realmgate Wars with two tales of the Stormcast Eternals as they seek new allies and an ancient artefact to aid in their battle against the Ruinous Powers. The cover depicts a heroic Knight-Azyros brandishing his Warding Lantern, above a scene of battle from the Realm of Life depicting the Hallowed Knights locked in combat with the plague hordes of Nurgle.Sigmar's hammer has been part of Warhammer since the very start (it's right there in the name) so the battle to get it back is a big deal – and it's a massive story, full of heroism and treachery and lots and lots of kick-ass action. Plus over in the Realm of Life, find out who the Sylvaneth are and – crucially – whose side they're on.",
