  "description": "My name's Annie Graceland.Things you should know about me: I’m a Midwesterner living in L.A. I run my own baking business. I talk to dead people.  I’m finally dating again but my BFFs say I dress like I’ve been dumpster diving. They drag me to Snotsky’s Department Store sale where I’m ‘helped’ by Edith Flowers – the meanest sales lady in the world.  When someone meaner than Edith kills her off she haunts me, following me from the Ladies Lingerie department to 'Cocktail Attire' nagging me to bring her murderer to justice. I came to Snotsky’s for the half off sale -- not the half out of my mind sale. Can I find the killer and still score a festive frock for pennies on the dollar?",
