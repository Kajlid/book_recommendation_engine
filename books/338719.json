  "description": "Two men from the Cowboy State and the women they love! Denim and Diamonds Rancher Chase Brown has always loved Letty Ellison, but nine years ago she left their small Wyoming town, searching for a different kind of life. Now she's come home to Red Springs with her dreams in tatters and a five-year-old child in tow. She's ready to trade the false glitter of Hollywood for the true happiness of being a rancher's wife. Chase's wife. But is it too late? The Wyoming Kid Rancher Lonny Ellison is an ex-rodeo cowboy who's used to the adulation of women. But that's something he doesn't get from Joy Fuller. In fact, they argue constantly. His sister, Letty, says it's because he's interested in Joy and Lonny figures she's right. Can he convince Joy that marriage to the Wyoming Kid will be as exciting as an eight-second bull ride and as sweet as the cookies she likes to bake? \"",
