  "title": "Never Cry Wolf: The Amazing True Story of Life Among Arctic Wolves",
  "description": "More than a half-century ago the naturalist Farley Mowat was sent to investigate why wolves were killing arctic caribou. Mowat's account of the summer he lived in the frozen tundra alone—studying the wolf population and developing a deep affection for the wolves (who were of no threat to caribou or man)—is today celebrated as a classic of nature writing, at once a tale of remarkable adventures and indelible record of myths and magic of wolves. This book is worth reading, but it's a whopper--wolves don't live on small rodents alone.",
