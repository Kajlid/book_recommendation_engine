  "title": "Children of the Resolution",
  "description": "It was a time of change and new ideologies, a vision of a more inclusive, fairer future... a time that was destined to shape the lives of many, and fail more than a mere handful. Viewed retrospectively through the eyes of the now adult Carl Grantham, Children of the Resolution is a story of a child poised between two worlds. Thrown into the revolutionary world of integrated education in 1970s England, the physically disabled Carl finds himself torn between what he expects of himself and what his changing environment will allow. At heart, a coming-of-age story -- Children of the Resolution explores the intricacies of friendship and loss, the subtle fears of childhood and the far less subtle fears of adulthoods possibly never realised. -- \"Children of the Resolution is more than a novel, it is a commentary on the work of educationalists, practitioners and politicians who see education through their own eyes and experiences and not those of the real participants, our young people.\" Phil Willis MP.",
