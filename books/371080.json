Leave it to Lucky to attract a man who looks better in a dress than she does.Lucky must manage the Babylon's onslaught of outrageous festivities, solve a murder, and struggle to keep her life and libido from spinning out of control… not to mention keep her balance in six inch heels.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
