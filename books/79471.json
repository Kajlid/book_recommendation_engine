  "description": "Life has been harsh, but after a horrible childhood, Park was finally content with her life. Her beautiful home sat on the edge of the Pacific Ocean in Los Angeles, she had her dream job, and good friends she trusted. Then she's abducted, car-jacked by a stunningly sexy man who she realizes is dangerously crazy...he thinks he's a vampire. Park plays along until she can escape, until she discovers that there are things out there people like her never knew existed. Life changed instantly in one night...vampires do exist and she herself is something more than she ever knew. He'd been alive over three hundred years with little complications. But when Bas went to do a simple compel to get a ride on a busy street in L.A. late one night, he found the impossible...a human he couldn't compel. Only, after a taste, he knew...she was something more than human...something different. A complication and a mystery on a night all he wanted was transportation home and away from an enemy he wasn't prepared to fight...yet. He wasn't looking for her, anything like her, and yet he couldn't think about letting her go. Yes, he wanted to know what she was, and he needed to protect her from his enemy, but even more than that...somewhere deep inside an old battle-weary vampire, his human heart told him that the time may have come to feel love again.Park had always thought she was broken...was never good enough...she'd been taught that often enough as a little girl who lived in the dark. But sometimes things have to fall apart so they can fall together the way they were always meant to be.",
