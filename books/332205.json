  "description": "I’m drawn in like a magnet toward the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life. She is female perfection personified, nothing more beautiful in this world could ever exist. But as my eyes rake over her porcelain skin, the high I’m feeling at finding her turns on a dime, I’ve never been angrier in my life. Someone has tried to hurt her. It’s apparent from the mark on the side of her face. Who? I have no clue, but I do know one thing. Whoever it is is a dead man walking. I will see to it. I make a promise to myself at that moment, and a silent promise to her at the same time. She is the light to my dark, but my darkness is only beginning. I will find whoever did this, and I will end them. Permanently. Because from the moment I laid eyes on her she became mine and no touches or even looks at what is mine without consequences.",
