  "description": "\"Lucky Girl\" continues the story of Majesty Morgan, lottery winner and Colorado rancher, and the family and friends who love her in spite of her faults. Just when Majesty thinks her new life in Colorado is finally settling down, a whole new set of drama unfolds. From a wild animal refuge to bullets flying to love in the air, nothing can break the bond of the friends who love, laugh, eat, and play at Lone Wolf Ranch. When an eagle and a law enforcement officer are intentionally shot and wounded, is the perpetrator a stranger with a bad aim, or someone who is closer to Majesty than she expected? As Majesty deals with the nosy media, her boyfriend's meddling ex-wife, the everyday challenges of ranch life, and the acknowledgement that she is now old enough to be a member of AARP, she still loves, laughs, and protects those dearest to her heart.",
