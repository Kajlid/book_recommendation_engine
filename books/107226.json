  "description": "He’s a wolf without a pack...\nGraphic novelist, Aidan Harte, writes about the kind of heroes he knows he’ll never be. He’s returned to the forgotten gold mining town of Chatanika, Alaska to scatter his father’s ashes and close out the bastard’s life. He plans to get in and get out without seeing a soul. That is until he falls into a trap. \nShe’s a raven who’s clipped her wings...\nRaven Maiski’s thrilled that old man Harte is dead. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. But she’s not happy about the return of his son, Aidan, her enemy, her lover and soul mate who promised twelve years ago never to step foot back in Chatanika. She’ll never be able to keep her secrets unless she runs him out of town.  But word of the miser’s death spreads like a gold rush, and danger erupts in a quest for treasure that will either lead to redemption...or blood.",
