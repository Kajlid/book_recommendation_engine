Well, Jane can - with the help of the Irish mob.Holly lives in Room 4-B, the shabby room next to Sam Russo's. She's a man. He's a woman. Sam doesn't care. He likes Holly. His dog Jane likes Holly. Life is fine until a Lagonda rolls through Stapleton, a small town on the northern end of Staten Island. Getting into that car, Holly's just turned the worst trick of her life. When Holly disappears, Russo, Private Eye, and Jane, more than a partner, find themselves lost in a sordid world of hidden mansions, a twisted social club, and high society secret cabals.",
