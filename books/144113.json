  "description": "A New York Times Book Review Notable Book of the YearA Los Angeles Times Book Review Favorite Book of the YearSince her girlhood, Prudence Winship has gazed across the tidal straits from her home in Brooklyn to the city of Manhattan and yearned to bridge the distance. Now, firmly established as the owner of an enormously successful gin distillery she inherited from her father, she can begin to realize her dream.Set in eighteenth-century Brooklyn, this is the beautifully written story of a woman with a a gargantuan construction of timber and masonry to span the East River. With the help of her sisters--high-spirited Tem and silent, uncanny Pearl--Prue fires the imaginations of the people of Brooklyn and New York by promising them easy passage between their two worlds.Brookland confirms Emily Barton's reputation as one of the finest writers of her generation, whose work is \"blessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt\" (Thomas Pynchon).",
