  "description": "There is a curse on her world. A game. Full of sin. Full of chaos. Full of terror. Gluttony. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Sloth. Greed. Lust.For five hundred years, the game of the Sins has leashed a rope around the city of Calesal, tugging for more candidates to bloodswear themselves for the price of redemption. Yet, after all that time, not a single person has ever ventured through all seven worlds—seven sins—and come out alive. Worlds most definitely filled with deserts, cities, aliens, drugs, war, blood, death, and mystery. Violet Sutton's brother was sentenced to the game two years ago. The second anniversary of his lethal exile looms over her head, and by searing fate, Violet is bloodsworn into the game on a quest to find him and bring him home. One problem: the candidates are murderers, thieves, and a notorious gang leader with his sights set on her. The second: The Sins are not at all what they seem to be. Blood will awaken at its call. Behold, the Sins.",
