  "description": "Revisit the enchanting Donovan clan from #1 New York Times bestselling author NORA ROBERTS These fascinating cousins share a secret that's been handed down through generations-a secret that sets them apart... Captivated His interest in her was purely professional...or so he told himself. Nash Kirkland had sought out Morgana Donovan, self-proclaimed witch, to help him research his latest screenplay. The hardheaded skeptic didn't believe for a minute that Morgana was what she professed to be, yet Nash found himself falling under her spell. But how could he be sure the passion he felt was real and not just some conjurer's trick? Entranced Obviously Sebastian Donovan was a fraud, but fiercely protective Mary Ellen Sutherland was desperate to find a missing baby and had run out of leads. Reluctantly the private investigator agreed to enlist Sebastian's help. She soon had to admit, though grudgingly, that this man had some pretty remarkable gifts- the most disturbing of which was his ability to penetrate her tough facade and get to her heart.",
