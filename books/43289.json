  "description": "[Siren Menage Erotic Western Menage a Quatre Romance, M/F/M/M, HEA] Desperate to escape her scandalous past, Victoria Edison heads west to a respectable future. When a storm traps her for three nights on the J Bar C Ranch, she's faced with a choice of marriage or shame. Jed Adams says he detests the shrew but she can cook and, since his partners want her, agrees to wed the voluptuous woman in a civil ceremony. But their new life is destroyed when the wedding is annulled by a vengeful business rival. Unless they remarry with a preacher, Victoria will lose the respectability she craves, Clint and Riley will lose the woman they've come to love, and Jed will lose the new light in his life. But Jed's the son of a vicious Bible-thumping hypocrite and will have nothing to do with a preacher. Can Victoria face the rival's wrath, and Jed his nightmarish past, to bring love into their lives? There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among the men.",
