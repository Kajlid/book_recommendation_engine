  "description": "I’m Emily Ruth Fleischer and this book written by me is the only one of its kind. I can never let anyone know the horrible things that my father did or the secrets that my family had kept hidden for years. If anyone ever found out then that would mean they would also know what I did. I’m not even sure if I have fully come to terms with all of that yet myself. But I had to get it all out of my head and write it somewhere. So here it is: the worst of what happened in my life (hopefully) and the terrible secrets that I found out in the year 1976.",
