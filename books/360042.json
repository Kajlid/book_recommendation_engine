  "description": "Does the idea of a talking mummy make your teeth chatter and send shivers running down your spine? It shouldn't!For years mummies have been given a bad wrap. The subject of countless ghost stories and horror movies, mummies are generally thought of as gross and scary. But mummies aren't scary at all. Preserved for thousands of years, mummies are time capsules that allow us to peer back into the past and see what life was like in another age. From a five-thousand-year-old \"Iceman\" discovered in Europe to a tongue-tied Egyptian mummy named Natsef-Amun, mummies have provided us with fascinating clues about ancient civilizations. In this funny, fact-filled book, author James Deem takes you on a mummy-discovery tour that spans centuries and continents. You'll learn exactly what mummies are, how they are created, where they have been found, how scientists investigate them, and what they tell us about the people who lived long ago. So sit back, relax, and find out how you too can make a mummy \"talk.\"",
