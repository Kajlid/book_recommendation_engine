  "title": "Beauty Queens",
  "description": "From bestselling Printz award-winning author Libba Bray, the story of a plane of beauty contestants that crashes on a desert island. Teen beauty queens. A \"Lost\"-like island. Mysteries and dangers. No access to e-mail. And the spirit of fierce, feral competition that lives underground in girls, a savage brutality that can only be revealed by a journey into the heart of non-exfoliated darkness. Oh, the horror, the horror! Only funnier. With evening gowns. And a body count.",
