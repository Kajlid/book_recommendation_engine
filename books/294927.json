The British/American maverick has written his own rules for success and Blow It Up contains many frank anecdotes that perfectly encapsulate the entrepreneurial spirit. Highlights include: - Getting a deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers for a celebrity ping pong tournament with Jimmy Kimmel as host.  - Hustling to get his brand featured on national TV within a few months of launching. - Managing to create a video for a Kickstarter campaign without having the product ready. - Competing against the ping pong club owned by one of Hollywood's biggest actresses and winning. - Saving the company after an overseas factory was flooded.  Blow It Up is a rollercoaster ride that will teach you everything you need to be a successful entrepreneur.  As soon as you have read the book, you will feel compelled to start your own business.",
