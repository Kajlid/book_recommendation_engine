  "description": "My name is Brandon Edwards. Men like me don’t come along often. I'm a gentleman, a lover, a protector, and a Dominant. I've never been the type who can – or even wants to – commit to a woman…until I met Penny a couple of years ago. Since then, we've been in a committed relationship. I adore and cherish her.Penny has a darkness inside her, a yearning for extreme pain. But I don’t want that for her, nor can I give her what she’s so desperate for. Her craving has led her down risky paths, and it’s my job to keep her off those now.There’s a dangerous desire lurking within all of us. But when does wanting more become too much?",
