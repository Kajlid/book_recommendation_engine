  "description": "Rehearsals, leotards, and textbooks—that was my life. Dancing is all I’ve known until Liam admits his true feelings, and I’m thrown into a world I know nothing about. Secrets and betrayal have proven that Liam isn’t the man I thought he was. Though I’m struggling with the truth, deep down I’d still do anything for him. Saving our relationship is his top priority, but keeping him safe is mine. Corruption and power are their game and Liam is nothing more than a pawn. Playing by the rules won’t end well, but I can’t let him fight them alone.  Our happily ever after is right around the corner, but then it crashes and burns, threatening to destroy us. Giving up on the love of my life isn’t an option, but I might not be able to save him.ALWAYS YOURS is book 2 in the Liam & Maddie duet and must be read in order.",
