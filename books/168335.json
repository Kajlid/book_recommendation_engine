  "title": "His Old Kentucky Home",
  "description": "Who says you can never go home? Sully Przkop, that’s who!  Ten years ago, Sully vowed never to return to Blue Grove, Kentucky, and the family who’d betrayed him. Now, he’s built a new life; a life that includes the lover he calls Sir—Cord Sabatello.  Submitting to Cord in the bedroom sends fire zinging through Sully, but lately, life outside that bedroom is anything but perfection. The emotional distance between them has Sully wondering if Cord plans to say goodbye forever—especially now that 1400 miles separate them.   But Cord has other plans, and leaving his man to fend for himself in Kentucky isn’t one of them. They need to find their way back home together, but will “home” lead them in different directions, or will it lead them back into each other’s arms forever?",
