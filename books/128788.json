  "title": "Her Master's Courtesan",
  "description": "I am a Master. You must know this fact to understand my story. I capture women. I break them down. And I rebuild them. If they are lucky, they are sold into the professional hands of another Master. If they are less fortunate, they are buried beneath the ground, never to be thought of again. I lust for the control, I demand absolute submission and my body yearns to warp the minds of those I train. Power is the only thing Iâ€™ll ever need and I am addicted to the feeling of ultimate control. I am wealthy, good-looking, educated and charming. And I am - in no way - a good man. I do not want love. I do not want kindness. She thought she could change me by giving me the two things I knew I never wanted. She was wrong.  This book is intended for mature audiences only. Some scenes contain graphic depictions of violence. Please read the warning included before the prologue. This book is a stand alone with NO cliffhanger. Each book in the series can be read independently from the others.",
