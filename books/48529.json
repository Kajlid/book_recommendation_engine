  "description": "How deep does love run? Deeper than the ocean? Deeper than memory? Deeper than magic? Following their plan to save Atlas, Madly and Jackson return the spirit of Wolfhardt to his prison beneath the sea. But even the best laid plans couldn’t account for the surprises they find. This time, Lore aren’t their only challenges. Madly is special in ways no one could have guessed and dark forces seek to control her. They want her power, but first they must weaken her. They need her beaten. Vulnerable. Near death. And alone. But that task isn’t an easy one with Jackson at her side. The strongest of their kind, the only way to separate Jackson from Madly is to destroy his love for her, to erase it from his mind. And his heart. Is it possible to steal Jackson’s love from Madly? Or is their love the only truly unbreakable thing? ** Mature Content** Book 1- Madly (novelette) Book 2- Madly & Wolfhardt Book 3- Madly & the Jackal Book 4- Coming Soon About I love coffee and chocolate, even more so when they are combined. I'm convinced that one day they could be the basis for world peace. I also love the color red and am seriously considering dying my hair.",
