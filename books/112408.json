He has lived it, escaped it, and is determined to never experience it again. Only now, for the good of his pack, he is forced to work alongside a threat to his freedom – a pale-eyed woman who smells of moonlight.…will not submit to her.Known as the Master of Monsters, Rule is able to bend even sentient creatures to her will. Revered and reviled in equal measure for her extraordinary powers, Rule is used to suspicious glances and outright hostility. Not that it matters, not even when it comes from an alpha werewolf whose beast calls to her unlike any other.Together, Wulver and Rule must uncover why werewolves are disappearing. As they follow a twisted path through the underbelly of the New Realms, Wulver has two battles to face – the battle to keep his beast from submitting to the Master of Monsters, and the battle to keep himself from claiming Rule.",
