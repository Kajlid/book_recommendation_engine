  "description": "Neuromancer for a non-binary age: an action-packed techno-thriller with a side of magical realism.Everything’s for hire – even magic. If you need something done, they’re the best: a tough, resourceful mage, a lab-created genderless hacker and a cyborg with a big gun. But when they’re hired by a virtual construct to destroy the other copies of himself, and the down payment is a new magical skill, Cloke knows this job is going to be a league harder than anything they’ve ever done.",
