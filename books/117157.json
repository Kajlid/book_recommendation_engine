  "description": "Samantha isn’t feeling very festive as she heads back to her childhood hometown for Christmas—but being alone, homeless, and verging on jobless can do that to a woman. She has no interest in participating in the town Christmas celebrations and would rather just crawl into bed until the holidays are over. Determined to get back into the Christmas spirit, Sam plans on seducing her childhood best friend—and fantasy guy—Jack. A holiday fling will be just the thing to kick her Scrooge-like attitude.Jack’s been in love with Samantha for years, but he didn’t make his move before someone else did. Now she’s finally single again, and Jack’s not going to waste any time. He has a little over a week to convince Samantha they belong together, and that moving back to their childhood town to be with him is the right thing to do. As he woos her with carriage rides and homemade desserts, he learns Sam has been offered a new job half-way across the country, and he fears he’s about to lose her all over again.",
