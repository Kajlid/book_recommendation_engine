  "description": "Ready or not, baby makes three for Brice and Peyton Northam. For someone who’s never even been able to keep a Chia Pet alive, parenthood is a daunting endeavor for Peyton. And when life seems to be undergoing more frequent changes than her newborn baby’s diapers, she has a hard time keeping up.Everything is new. Everything, that is, except for her habit of withholding information. Even that’s slightly different nowadays, though, as she’s keeping more secrets about her feelings on wifedom and motherhood than she ever did about other people’s dramas. But clergymen husbands don’t look kindly on secret-keeping, unless it falls under the category of “pastoral privilege,” and Peyton quickly finds herself in need of a mindset makeover. Necessity turns to desperation when an irresistible opportunity beckons Brice hundreds of miles from everything and everyone Peyton’s ever known. Who knew that something said offhandedly on a cold Wisconsin dock at the very birth of their new relationship would be the source of so much turmoil and so many sleepless nights?",
