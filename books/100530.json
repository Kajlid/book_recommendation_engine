  "description": "GURNARD’S BOOK OF DELIGHTS is a collection of stories written by children aged between four and eleven years of age for a Primary School literary competition. They had to write a story involving an element of time travel... and they certainly did that. It features three bonus stories by authors, Vanessa Wester and S.P. Moss, who judged the entries. S.P. Moss commented: “I’ve had so much fun reading your wild and wonderful stories. There were stories that made me giggle, stories that made me gasp and stories that amazed me with the places they took me to. I travelled in time back to the war, the Victorian times and even further - to the Aztecs, the ancient Greeks and ancient Egyptians with your stories. The time travel mechanisms were most ingenious - from boffin-like time-travel machines to everyday objects like a TV and a toy train. Not to mention a hat and some rather fabby pink boots - and even magic guinea pigs! Thanks to all of you who took part and keep on writing...” Any funds raised from sales of this book will go to Gurnard Primary School.",
