  "description": "The swamps of Louisiana and Le Marais in particular hold many secrets; or is it Mama Ruth who owns the secrets and the swamp just holds them for her? Its alive though, with the past and the present and the future all colliding in one place; almost in one person. Mya Devereux. She's in the eye of the storm, the centre of this cosmic dart board...and she has no clue. She's just worried about passing Chemistry. Leo's not worried about anything. He has it all figured out. Phil and Lillian can only watch and comment. Too bad they're ghosts so popcorn is out.",
