  "title": "The Three Legions",
  "description": "The Tribune Claudius Cinna had won glory and the title of \"the one savage who pleased Rome,\" yet he found his triumphant life empty. Arminius, Prince of the German tribe, the Cherusci, \"looked more Roman than German,\" yet he hated Rome and longed to free his people. The girl, Thessia, did not fear the Roman enemy. \"Let them come soon,\" she said, hating only the filth and cold and barrenness of her people's life. The youth, the fisher from Marsilia, knew nothing of war or love except his dreams. The governing passions of these four strangely assorted people - their passions for love, for freedom, for comfort and for fulfillment - played dominant and conflicting parts in the events that led to one of the decisive battles of history. This novel of the time of Augustus Caesar combines a stirringly dramatic story with mature and subtle characterization.",
