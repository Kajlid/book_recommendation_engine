  "description": "Jonathon Steel is everything Serena wants in a man. He is sexy, successful, and mysterious. Sure, the dollars and fancy cars and holidays to exotic places are attractive, but his dark side, that which showed itself in the best-selling horror novels he wrote and which was forged by a lifetime of anger and pain, is the one thing that intrigues and attracts her more than anything else. Never in her wildest dreams did she think his dark side would prove to be so dark.",
