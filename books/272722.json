  "description": "The grim reality of life in a lead mining area of nineteenth century England forms the backdrop to this thirty-minute read.The author describes the blossoming of love between two young mine workers. They struggle to understand the nature of their relationship at a time when asexual and asexuality were unfamiliar terms, and when the church strictly adhered to biblical teaching.The inclusion of dialect and mining terminology, used sparingly and unobtrusively, grounds the tale in Victorian, Northern England.",
