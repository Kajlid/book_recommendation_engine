  "description": "What happens when you’re forced to seduce the one person you vowed never to love?You get screwed … in more than one way. I walked out of Tucker Middleton’s bedroom seven years ago, leaving him hurt and angry. Now I need his help; the only way I can get it, is to make him think I want him back. The only problem is we have silently vowed to hate one another for the rest of our lives. In order to get Tucker to help me—I have to seduce him. Easy right? Hell yes! I’m the CEO of CMI Consulting. If I set my mind to something, I make it happen. Charleston Monroe is playing me for a fool. If she believes for one second I’m going to let her walk into my life to help her save the very job that ripped her away from me, she’s got another thing coming. She thinks she can seduce me, and I let her believe she can. After all, I’m getting what I’ve always wanted. Her. Caution: This story contains crazy hot sex, and one shaved pussy.",
