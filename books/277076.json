  "description": "Vampire democracy sucks. Literally. When it's one vamp, one vote, the worst monsters can swing elections by turning random people off the streets into new vampires. Dylan is one of those random people. The power players in the city want his vote, but he just wants to be left the hell alone. Most of all, he wants to stop murdering people. That's easier than it sounds when some people are seriously asking for it.  Dylan's life as a vampire is gross, terrifying, disgusting, frustrating, sexy, painful, and that's all just in the first night out. Content Warning: This novel contains graphic depictions of assault, murder, sex, bodily fluids, and sexual assault.",
