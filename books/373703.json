  "description": "Lost! Space adventurer Carson Napier made a grievous miscalculation and became stranded on dangerous, mist-shrouded Venus. But Napier refused to quit. He won the love of the beautiful Duare, princess of Vepaja, became a pirate, fought villains, then lost his beloved to the evil Thorist kidnappers.  Napier's adventures on Venus continue in this pulse-pounding sequel to Pirates of Venus. Here the intrepid and wry explorer takes on a savage world in order to rescue the princess from her sworn enemies. Napier’s epic quest for Duare takes him through the streets of the City of the Dead, into the terrifying Room of the Seven Doors, and face to face with fantastic and perilous creatures. Featuring what may be Burroughs’s most realistic hero, Lost on Venus brims with the action, suspense, and wit unique to the Master of Adventure. This edition features an introduction by celebrated writer Kevin J. Anderson and the original illustrations by J. Allen St. John.",
