  "description": "The village of Glenree is home to the Munroe women, including from the glamorous new in-law, Emma; the homely Miriam; and airs-and-graces Sheila, who is forced to watch her own daughter Ellen become the talk of the county. The saying \"love is blind\" could have been invented for the wayward Ellen, whose life changes for ever when she leaves the ebony darkness and winding country roads of Glenree for the bright lights of the city. It is there she falls in love with Chris Wallace, a skunk of the highest order. A tale of love and heartbreak, laughter and tears, this is a moving novel will strike a chord with anyone who has loved a scoundrel.",
