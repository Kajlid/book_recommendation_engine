  "description": "At twelve-years of age, Maddy Richards has everything she needs in life – good friends, a loving mother, and a home she loves. When her mother announces that she's getting married, Maddy's seemingly perfect world is rocked to the core, but when she discovers that not only that her mother is getting married and she'll have a new dad, but there's another, even more world rocking change planned, Maddy, thinking there's no way out of her predicament, forges a plan that she's sure will put a stop to at least one of these sudden changes in her life. With her best friend Hannah in tow, Maddy embarks on a journey, hoping that will prompt her mother and new husband-to-be to change their minds, but a horrific storm is about to complicate matters further. What looked like a solution suddenly becomes more of a problem. Maddy will have to gather her resolve and determine if she's ready to trust God, regardless of what is happening, and let life unfold as it should, even if that means her life will never be the same again.
