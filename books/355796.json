  "title": "Will Heaven Be Good Enough, Nellie?",
  "description": "In the South of not-so-long-ago, every small town had a someone old enough and bold enough to tell people just what they needed to hear—whether they wanted to or not. Our Nellie, wherever she lived, put her foot down and made a big impression—but a little bit of Nellie went a long, long way. You didn’t want to have too many encounters with her, so it was best to learn whatever she was teaching the first time around! Little children adored her. Teenagers abhorred her! Women couldn’t stand her and real men believed she was heaven sent. Nellie was tart, smart and strong-headed from the cradle to the grave. And since y’all so nosey, I told this gal to go ahead and let y’all get off into some of my biz’ness. So with all due respect and Nellie’s permission, you are invited to have a little bit more of Nellie.",
