  "description": "What if the world doesn't end? The year is 8007 AM and humanity is still struggling. Earth is ruled by an iron-fisted religion. All traces of drugs and alcohol are long obliterated, while history is considered a taboo subject referred to only as The Void. Meet Hubresh (a.k.a. the Humanoid) and Vladesh (a.k.a.Vlad the Inhaler), two sub-social irregulars lodged at the Heatley Block Boarding House in the bowels of metropolitan al Vancouverael. When these misfits discover an ancient vault full of long forgotten chemicals, they uncover secrets from other worlds and stumble onto a journey of mythic proportions. Follow them as they trip through the Omniverse, unwittingly stranded for periods of time in nether-worlds that range from fantastically strange to terribly real. Join them and a motley cast of characters who populate these dimensions of infinite possibility. But watch out, for these worlds are rife with predators and villains, such as feral Blue Mundee, wicked Monkey King, and the Inquisitor, ruthless minister of the Sharmudic code. Told in a futuristic jargon called Jislamish, a mishmash of English, Arabic and Hebrew, HUMANOID looks back through thousands of years at a world gone horribly wrong. Novelist Miguel Burr has crafted a believably absurd future while painting a timeless portrait of desperate people caught between authority and vice. The result is an open invitation for readers to experience shock-inducing social satire of the blackest comedic order. Download HUMANOID to your protonic tablet and viz the future before it becomes reality!",
