  "description": "It's something all pirates are taught when they're very young, but too many forget: never get on the wrong side of a librarian. Especially if the librarian is a lemming! Sylvester Lemmington used to read about cannibals, impenetrable jungles, lethal carnivores, mysterious fortune-teller, voodoo magic, cutthroat pirates, shipwrecks, mutinies, spaceships and much else in his books, but he never thought he'd encounter them for real. Can Sylvester save his sweetheart, Viola, her tough-as-nails mom and the other friends he's acquired along the way? Can he find long-lost father, rescue his hometown of Foxglove from the murderous rule of its ruthless mayor and discover true happiness? Oh, did we mention that Sylvester has mistakenly received the most sought after treasure map ever? This means he also has to escape from the cruelest and craziest pirate captain who ever sailed the seas of Sagaria - the horrifying Cap'n Terrigan Rustbane who will stop at nothing to get his map back. A map that leads to a treasure beyond the wildest dreams of avarice. It's kind of a tall order, but then, Sylvester is a librarian..and a lemming.",
