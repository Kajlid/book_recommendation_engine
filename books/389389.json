  "description": "\"The next ice age could begin any day! Next week, next month, next year, it's not a question of if, only when. One day you'll wake up--or won't wake up, rather -- buried beneath nine stories of snow as the climate of Greenland descends on Canada, Britain, Norway and most of the north..practically overnight. It's all part of a dependable, predictable, natural cycle that returns like clockwork every 11,500 years.?",
