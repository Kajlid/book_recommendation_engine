  "description": "Shipwrecked has so many twists and turns -- it might make you seasick! Hold on to your life vest, it's going to be a bumpy ride! Jillie's day starts when the ship she's traveling on sinks in shark-infested waters. With her parents missing, she's left solely responsible for her spoiled little sister, Ruby. When a strange boy named Omar pulls them from the water, Jillie is at once grateful and suspicious. Omar seems to be hiding something, and Jillie wants to get to the bottom of it. Strange people cross their path to give them wisdom, or is it misdirection? Join the adventure as Jillie and Ruby navigate a mysterious island where they must battle wild animals, crazy weather, and creepy people while searching for the girls' parents. When no one is who they say, and nothing is as it seems, family is all you can trust. Authorâ€™s This book was created in a unique way. Students in Idaho read the first chapters and were given three paths to choose from for the author to follow, then the author wrote the next three chapters. Each time, the students picked the way the author least wanted to go, which made the book much more spontaneous and fun than it might have been. Young children will love this zany adventure story! Follow the twists and turns, enjoy the journey!",
