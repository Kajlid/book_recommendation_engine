Twenty years after plundering with Tom, Joe Harper is a failed pirate turned vagabond, wandering in search of the perfect cave in which to die. What he finds instead is a philosophizing Chinese railroad worker and an Amish woman fleeing a forced marriage a surrogate family that bonds over their hobo adventures. When the three are arrested and forced to work on a chain gang, their narrow escape earns them a powerful enemy, until they are rescued by Tom Sawyer who just might be the greatest threat they ve faced yet. Inspired by Twain s storytelling, Phong Nguyen expertly evokes the beloved world of Tom Sawyer and extends Twain s savvy commentary to the struggles of Chinese Americans, women, and outcasts in Reconstruction America.\"",
