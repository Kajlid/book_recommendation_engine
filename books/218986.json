  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for 9780692311448 In Into the Heart of the Feminine, Jungian analysts and authors Massimilla and Bud Harris dynamically weave their own personal and professional experiences in the form of rich and compelling stories, providing a down-to-earth book available to a wide audience.A Book for Women...for Men...and for our Culture... Imagine within each of us, there is a deep, powerful source for living lives of love, creativity, and fulfillment.To imagine this foundation for life and the energy it produces is to imagine ourselves and our world filled with the influence of the archetypal feminine - her passionate creativity, love, and ageless knowing. Personally and culturally, this force - which lives at the heart of our lives - has been diminished and wounded until it seems to have retreated beyond the horizon, in a world filled with rationalism and an anxious search for the material \"good life.\"This is a powerfully moving book that goes beyond gender roles into the soul of the archetypal feminine, exploring how it has been damaged and traumatized, and finding out how this condition affects all of us. Through the myth of Medusa, the authors create an inspirational guide for healing, revitalizing, loving, and nurturing the archetypal feminine as we awaken our own voices and transform our fate.",
