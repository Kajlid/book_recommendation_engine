  "title": "God's Breaking Heart",
  "description": "When God is generous to show us, we catch glimpses of the anguish He feels at seeing His children hurt themselves and each other. Follow a handful of disconnected people in this short story, through a single day in their lives, as they see the chain reactions caused by their choices. What actions appear unrelated are often weaved in a delicate web, unseen and orchestrated to produce glorious ends.",
