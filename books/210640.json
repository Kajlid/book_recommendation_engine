  "description": "Rhod Evans, last descendant of Arthur Pendragon, thought he had killed Mordred a year ago. Now Mordred has returned with a vengeance, and Merlin is across the ocean, out of touch. The Pendragon must find the strength and wisdom to fight his archenemy without his confidante, lover, and best friend. He must fight a villain who is sometimes real and sometimes illusion. All his strengths—and weaknesses—will be put to the test, and perhaps he will also find the answer to this important Is there a back door to hell?",
