  "description": "Daddy William has been so busy with work that his little Haley has been acting out for attention.  He plans two weeks away from everything, and it’s absolutely perfect. A sandy beach, Haley in tiny bikinis, and lots of DD/lg time.  What they don't expect is little Haley feeling she may be missing out on other things in life.  Can Daddy William let his little one find her way on her own? Will Haley have second thoughts about her lifestyle?  Book two in the Innocence series is just what you’ve been begging for.  Warning: Serious DD/lg play, which includes but is not limited to: spanking, unicorn stuffed-animal play, anal, cake pops, oral, and lots of dirty talks.  NOTE: Innocent Getaway isn't role play... Haley embraces her inner child and loves to be a brat. While William adores it, not everyone does. This is a full-time DD/lg and relationship.",
