  "description": "No. Nope. Knot going to happen.I may be an omega, but I’ve got dreams and goals of my own, and none of them include shacking up with a pack of raging alphas just because biology says I have to. Sure, that time will come and I’ll welcome it with open arms, but for now, I’m doing me.I’ve managed to make a name for myself on the PackChat App, unintentionally starting a movement that has earned me millions of followers, along with plenty of enemies. Namely, a rival group known as RideAnAlpha. They drive me crazy with their constant lewd and rude comments, and, admittedly, their thirst traps showing off their hot bodies and abs for days. What? I’m in self-isolation, not dead, after all. They’re the bane of my existence, but I’m a pro at being oblivious.As my birthday looms, my bestie convinces me to attend a major influencer conference where my rivals and I are keynote speakers. I’m determined to prove the real Bexley Carter is not the evil omega they portray me as. I’ll get in, get out, and stay just long enough to figuratively give them the finger...or maybe literally, time will tell. No thoughts of claiming or bonds or heats since, you know, they hate me and all. I should be safe, right?Because…I think knot!I Think Knot is book one in the Knot Yours Omegaverse, a series of fast-burn reverse harem romance standalones. Each book will end in an HEA and lead into the next book with a new reluctant omega and her own possessive, purring alphas.",
