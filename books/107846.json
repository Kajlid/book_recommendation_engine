  "description": "Seven years after the Strangers decimated the planet, Joad is one of the Remaining, the few left unharmed when most of humanity was obliterated. He was halfway around the world when disaster struck and has been trying ever since to get home to Nemo, where he prays his wife waits for him.Days from his destination, Joad’s thrown off-course by four merciless brothers who glide across The Flats in a pirate ship. In his escape, Joad reluctantly gains new companions. Together, they journey through a landscape equally beautiful and haunting, mysterious and magical — including The Fields, the deadly territory between them and Nemo. Filled with hope, horror, and wonder; The Seventh Day presents a world we haven’t yet encountered but could just be around the corner.",
