  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B077Z8BJ6T.)  A single night changes everything.   I go from town to town, never staying in one place for long. I’m always chasing the next deal, the next adrenaline rush and thriving in the great outdoors.  Until one fateful trip, one chance encounter. When I meet her... my beautiful Rose.  It was only supposed to be one night. No strings attached. Our chemistry was off the charts and we didn’t fight it.  But ever since then, she's all I think about. Replaying the perfect night over and over and thinking about what could've been.  Now I'm back in her town, and it could be my one chance to claim what should have been mine forever and not for just one night.  I've got it all figured out. But as soon as I see her, I come to a screeching halt. What's with the anger in her eyes? And whose baby is she carrying?  Am I too late to make her mine?  Baby Daddy is a full length romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
