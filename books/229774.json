But when her boyfriend, Tate, wants to take her to Disney World (forbidden by her grandmother) she can't help but break the rules. But maybe her grandmother was right to warn her against the place, because the park is a gateway to another dimension: Fable, where fairy tales are real and things go bump in the night. And now her grandmother has been taken captive by an evil magician named Alric.Red turns out to be the central character in a very scary story, a tale she will have no choice but to act out in order to save her grandmother. Worse, Alric is determined to rule Fable by making all the famous fairy tales fallâ€”and Red is his first target. Red, along with Tate, must venture into almost certain death and learn to break the chains of her fear. But on her journey, Red will learn that even the most famous fairy tales are not always what they seem...",
