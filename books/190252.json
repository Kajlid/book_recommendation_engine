  "title": "Babes In Arms: Women in the Comics During World War Two",
  "description": "During the Golden Age of comics, publishers offered titles supporting the war effort -- presenting fighting men and their feminine counterparts -- babes in arms! Comic books during this period featured US service-women fighting all of the axis bad guys and gave several of the most noteworthy women artists of the era opportunities to create action-packed, adventure-filled, four-color stories. Now for the first time renowned pop-culture historian Trina Robbins assembles comic book stories by artists Barbara Hall, Jill Elgin, Lilly Renee, and Fran Hopper together with insightful commentary and loads of documentary extras to create the definitive book chronicling the work of these important Golden Age artists. This magnificent art book offers page-after-page of good girl action!",
