  "description": "I have one job: Get close and take him out. The only problem is, I want him more.I was barely five when I lost my brother; seven when my father was murdered.Overnight, I was taken by my mysterious uncle, grafted into a world of crime I didn’t understand and couldn’t escape.The first ten years, I did my best to blend in.The next four, I reinvented myself, growing stronger, searching for answers. Now I have one assignment—take down the man who knows our secrets. Professor Dirk Winston is my target, and I’m expected to be a good soldier, disguised as a good student.Only he’s not the passive bookworm I expect. He’s ripped muscles, bedroom eyes, dirty mouth, and ready for a fight.But I’ve got plans of my own, and this hot teacher is going to do more than give me grades and take my panties. He’s going to help me get revenge.(FORBIDDEN is a five-alarm-spicy age-gap, student-professor romance with secrets, lies, and answers to all your questions. No cheating. No cliffhanger.)",
