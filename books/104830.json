  "description": "There is a $2,500 reward for the head of the killer wolf, Gray Cloud.When Dave Reagan, considered little better than a half-wit by all who know him, finds the wolf held in his traps, something in the fearless animal's eyes keeps Dave from killing him. Instead, he releases Gray Cloud and carries him on his back to save the wolf from a prairie fire that is threatening them both. Dave brings Gray Cloud home and chains him in a shed that he uses as a blacksmith shop. Dave expects now that, as a result of this feat, his cousins who have always called him a dummy will for the first time come to respect him. But his cousins don't feel anything of the kind. As far as they are concerned, this is the time to put a bullet in Gray Cloud and claim the $2,500 reward. Dave escapes with Gray Cloud to live in the wilderness, away from humans . . .",
