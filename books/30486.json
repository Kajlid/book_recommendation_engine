Our Muse of Good Fortune, despite her exceptional charm and unearthly beauty, has been slacking off, getting by on her looks, wiles, and considerable sex appeal -- not to mention her privileged position as the daughter of Mighty Zeus Himself! Performance Objectives The best place on Earth for the Muse of Good Fortune to make a difference is . . . Las Vegas. Therefore Kyra is to spend one year at the famous Acropolis Casino, where she will inspire good fortune. During her sentence, she is forbidden from getting romantically involved with a mortal, and most especially not with Jake Lennox. This professional gambler-turned-investigator is too seductive and attractive for his own good. Besides, Jake has an agenda that may prove too dangerous for Kyra's soft heart. So, if she falls in love, all bets are off.",
