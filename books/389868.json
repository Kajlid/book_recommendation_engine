  "description": "He was chasing a criminal.She was fleeing the law.One accident made their worlds collide.An accident on a frozen highway brings two strangers together. Nate Morrison has no recollection of what placed him on that icy stretch so far from home. In his line of business, memory loss was unacceptable and accountability was crucial. Upon her parents’ death, Emily Brennan became the sole guardian of her brilliant, yet eccentric brother. Her devotion to protect him from a world that shunned the abnormal made her do the unthinkable. She stole designs from National Marine Dynamics…and now she was on the run. Only an hour from the promise of safety, Emily witnesses the car behind her spin out of control on an icy stretch of highway. Fear dictated that she should flee, but the body slumped on the shoulder of the road appealed to her humanity. Emily and Nate are two strangers thrown together by an errant patch of ice. Would the truths of their identities tear them apart or would they unite in battle against an egomaniac that threatened the safety of innocent civilians.Previously released as BORROWED TIME. Revised and re-released by the author.",
