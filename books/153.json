  "description": "Sam has always wanted a dog, but Jenny is a dog like no other. She has come from another world?a parallel world of mythology, where the whims of the gods decide the course of Destiny. Jenny fled in terror after her attempt to save the life of her first beloved boy interrupted the gods? plans for a battle for control of the world. But now her escape threatens Sam?s world as well. So Jenny has to convince her motley pack of dog friends?tiny Pico, giant Gentleman Jim, slow-moving Boris, excitable Checkers, and nervous Flo?that it?s their destiny to restore the worlds to order before it?s too late. Norse mythology, a huge respect for the hearts and minds of dogs, and many dashes of humor combine to tell the tale of a grand, epic quest to save the world for humans, gods, and dogs.",
