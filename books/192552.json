  "description": "Lieutenant Sam Gatlin is back in Vietnam because he has something to prove--to himself. This time, Vietnam takes him deeper into the mysterious yin-yang of the society. From the opening events, there are betrayals, spies, hidden secrets and the beginning of questions--of the meaning of war, of loyalty, of death and love--that Sam might finally understand by the surprising end of the novel. War as the Conradian heart of darkness and life in Vietnam as seen through a Greene-like quiet American. Full of rich characters, multi-cultural soldiers and civilians---and with a protagonist bent, against all odds, on \"doing the right thing.\"",
