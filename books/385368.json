  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Olivia Hughes has always considered herself a lucky girl. She knows what she wants to do with her life—be an actress. And she’s already on her way. She just landed a national ad campaign that should get her noticed. But then her luck runs out. A little pimple turns into a full-blown case of acne, with serious side effects for her career, her relationships, and her self-esteem. Now all she wants to do is hide, but she can’t. She goes from being the girl at school who everyone wants to be to Zitface, a girl who is teased, dumped, and even fired. What do you do when you’ve lost control of everything in your life? Olivia has to find out the hard way. And maybe what she finds isn’t so bad after all. The book includes an author’s note about the psychological and medical issues involved for teens dealing with significant acne. The author is a licensed mental health counselor who has worked in California and Texas schools.",
