  "description": "\"Tell your Padishah that the stars fortell that this deed you do will be returned one hundred fold. That the Eye of Kali will be your reward. It will be waiting for you in Kabool.\" Thus Arash, leader of the bloodthirsty Sayeh, began his journey along the Golden Path to fullfill his destiny and obtain the legendary sword known as the Eye of Kali. And surely what would get in the way of a poweful vampire as he seeks to uphold the words of prophesy? Plenty, it would seem. Particularly when the Golden Path runs straight through the dark lair of the mighty dragon Fucanglong.",
