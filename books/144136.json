  "title": "The Unorthodox Arrival of Pumpkin Allan",
  "description": "An uplifting and moving story of Lois and Tom’s relocation from London to a surprisingly quirky, rural hamlet. Tom falls off his mountain bike just days before they take ownership of Honeysuckle Cottage; leaving a pregnant Lois and her close friend to collect the keys to their new home. Finding her dream house fraught with unexpected problems, Lois becomes sick with worry that she should never have persuaded Tom to leave the city. But, as they settle, glitches with the cottage are resolved, and a wonderfully eclectic mix of friends, enemies, crooks, and eccentrics is revealed within this extraordinary community. Lois and Tom’s rapid series of major life events culminates in great excitement, with their wedding and the birth of the baby in very quick succession and a melodramatic twist, as uninvited guests arrive at the home delivery.",
