  "title": "The Love of a Mate",
  "description": "Alfred’s always been the pack’s trouble maker. He’s given up hope of ever being anything else. But, could that change when he suddenly receives the love of a mate? Caden’s never had any trouble convincing other wolves to do what he wants. He might not have his brother’s status, size or grumpy personality, but that doesn’t matter. He’s always found smiles and flirtations to be far more effective than any of those things anyway. When Caden sets his sights on Alfred, he knows he’ll need every trick he’s ever acquired if he’s to have any chance of reforming the pack trouble maker into a good wolf and a first-rate potential mate. However, that might not be the only obstacle they face—the rest of the pack might yet prove to be their biggest challenge of all.Please note this book is best read in sequence as part of the Pack Discipline Series.",
