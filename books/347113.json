  "description": "The higher she climbs, the harder he falls...Carter Malone is usually the first one to make tracks before a woman starts getting any ideas. Permanent relationships don't fit into his personal blueprint. Now, for the first time in his life, he's burning up the sheets with a woman who makes him think about something more permanent...like spending the night. But she's holding something back, something he can't quite pin down.As a woman in a man's world, Ryan Cooper is used to wearing a target on her back-and hiding her vulnerabilities. She hasn't let anything, not even the ever-present threat of an epileptic seizure, stop her from working her butt off to get the foreman's job with her stepfather's construction company. Then she discovers the guy she's been dating-okay, having the hottest sex of her life with-is the architect who designed the building she'll be overseeing. The last thing she needs is anyone thinking she slept with Carter to get the job.Or worse, feeling sorry for her.Before the dust clears, things get a lot more complicated. The previous foreman's injury was no accident, and whoever caused it is taking aim-at the target on Ryan's back.This book contains almost fully clothed sex with a little bit o' spanking on an OCD-clean desk inside a construction trailer, a rogue set of pencils that just won't take stay for an answer, and sweet loving in a tub.",
