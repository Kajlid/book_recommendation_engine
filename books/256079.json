  "description": "Lilith just can’t seem to get the hang of living. As an ungainly immortal she has died and come back to life more times than she cares to admit, or remember. When she dies she forgets, except if she has it written down in her journal bound in dragon skin that preserves her memories. During an attempt to escape a nasty pack of acid drooling dog-lizard rejects she makes a new friend, John. Who helps save her hide, but in return will she be able to save his? Lilith is up against all sorts of supernatural nasties, an obsessed ex-lover she can’t remember. A love interest who has a fatal interest in John, and worst of all herself.Praise for Eden's Outcast \"Kuta Marler weaves a fascinating & nuanced tale of angelic and demonic beings that combines humor, horror and romance. She is an amazing writer.”Melinda M. Snodgrass -Edge of Reason",
