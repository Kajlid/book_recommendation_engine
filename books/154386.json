He has come home - to a land of loss. Parents, dead. Grandparents, dead. Twin brother, dead two hours after birth. Great-aunts, great-uncles, Aunt Jennyâ€™s husband Lawton, all dead. All decaying in their graves.But something lives. Something dark. Something evil.And it wants to drag Jeffrey Conley to Hell.",
