  "description": "Defector in Paradise is the second novel in the Owen Roberts' trilogy. The year is 2024, and a Russian agent is just a step away from making it to the White House. Tragic circumstances force Owen to team with a cagey Soviet defector to expose one of the Cold War's last and biggest the identity of a high-level mole operating within the US government. This is not the same Owen we read about in The Clandestine Education of Owen Roberts. It is twenty years later, and he is no longer the young, idealistic intelligence officer he once was. He wants to be, but life in the world of espionage is beginning to wear on him. His career is going nowhere, and once again he finds himself fighting against invisible forces he cannot control while he questions his own moral code. As Owen walks down a violent path of death and destruction, he realizes that he has become the last man standing between the mole and the White House. What follows is a high stakes game of cat and mouse fought at the highest levels of the intelligence community, but the question who's the cat and who is the mouse? At its heart, Defector in Paradise is a novel about the unimaginable manipulation of American politics, and the actions of those who refuse to believe truths they cannot accept. Owen Roberts teaches us once again that the truth can set you free, but sometimes it's better just not to know. The truth, after all, is the most dangerous weapon of all.",
