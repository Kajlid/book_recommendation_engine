  "description": "It's a dangerous thing, creating glass slippers for a prince ...Seventeen-year-old Chiara Dragoni is a master glassmaker of Venice, a position that is both a privilege — and a trap. For the glassmakers of Murano are forbidden to ever leave the islands of the Venetian lagoon. When Chiara's uncle is caught on the mainland and thrown into the dungeon of the Doge's Palace, she must use all her talents, including magic, to help free him. But the gift she creates for a prince of Venice has unintended consequences.And now Chiara must decide whether to give up everything and everyone she knows in order to save her dream — and be with the man she truly loves ... Set in an alternate historical Venice with alchemists, witches and magic, Island of Glass uses familiar motifs from the beloved fairy tale \"Cinderella\" to tell a very different tale. It is the first book in The Glassmakers Trilogy.",
