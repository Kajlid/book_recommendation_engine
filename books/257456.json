  "title": "Rebecca's book of Fairies, Pixies, Elves & other Amazing Things",
  "description": "This illustrated novel is a light-hearted look at Rebecca’s world and the way she sees the wonders of our beautiful planet. Although she is now 25-years-old, she often reflects upon her younger days as a child. She was around six when she first spotted a fairy, and has managed to take this vision into her adult years.You may question if this book is merely a chronicle of Rebecca’s imagination, or if she has really seen these wonders. Take her guidance, follow her suggestions, and go look for yourself. You’ll be amazed what is out there.I hope this book is one that parents love as much as their children do. After all, imagination has no age limit.",
