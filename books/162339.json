  "title": "The Sicilian Defence",
  "description": "These short stories provide a window on contemporary Sicilian life seen through the lens of the island’s literary history. They reflect Sicily’s power to encompass perfectly the ideas of Good and Bad, Heaven and Hell, to enmesh them so tightly that, at times, it remains impossible to distinguish the two concepts. This is the English translation of The ‘Alfonso Cossio Short Story Prize’ winning Spanish title ‘La Defensa Siciliana’.",
