The group must leave their comfort zone, find new shelter, and do it all whilst battling their own internal demons. Kurt and Haylea aren't sure if their relationship can survive these new struggles. Jack's past is not only revealed, but old demons return to haunt him. Emily and Elyse are torn apart as their entire world is flipped upside down. The only way to last in this new world is for the survivors of WTIX to stick together...which is harder than any of them ever imagined.",
