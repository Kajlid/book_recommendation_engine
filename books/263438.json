Is it too late?All dragon shifter Cynthia “Brown” wants is a safe place to raise her child and heal from bitter betrayal. When Cal — her first love, her only love, and her destined mate — unexpectedly appears on Maui, he stirs up all kinds of other desires too. But trouble — as usual — is hot on his heels.Cal Zydler has spent a decade secretively protecting the only woman he’s ever loved. Cynthia may be hopelessly out of his league, but he’ll never, ever give up on her, no matter how forbidden their love is. In his dreams, he rides off into the sunset with his destined mate on the back of his vintage motorcycle. In real life… Well, not every wolf shifter gets a happy ending, especially not a guy from the wrong side of the tracks. And not when danger lurks everywhere — even on a sunny island paradise.Evil shifter forces are gathering to attack the Hawaiian hideaway where Cynthia and her young son have taken refuge. It’s her darkest hour, and Cal is ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. The future of all shifters stands on the brink, and even the Special Forces heroes of Koakea — dragons, lions, wolves, and bear shifters — will need help to beat the odds. Does Cal pose the ultimate danger, or is he Cynthia’s only hope?",
