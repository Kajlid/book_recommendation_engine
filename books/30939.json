  "description": "New Englanders have an old saying about their \"If you don't like it, wait a minute!\" While the weather doesn't always change quite that fast, each of the four seasons puts its own distinctive stamp on New England's climate, lifestyle, and availability of many foods. This cookbook gives an exciting glimpse into seasonal meal preparation adapted to the ever-changing weather patterns of the regional northeast. Creativity runs the gamut from the typical pack-and-go face of the summer months to the fortifying soups and stews savored by a winter's fire.",
