  "title": "Man Hunt",
  "description": "In the North Pacific Ocean there is an island that has been forgotten by mankind. Living there are men who have committed all manner of moral crimes. Deceived by an elaborate ruse, they wake deep within fortress walls where they are tortured, brainwashed, and then trained to physical perfection. When they are finally released to the island's hills and abandoned streets, they are told one simple rule: Survive long enough and you will be sent home. The island's only other inhabitants are women. In \"Man Hunt\", survival of the fittest means being literally hunted. It is \"Lord of the Flies\" meets hard-core feminism, because it tells both sides of the story.",
