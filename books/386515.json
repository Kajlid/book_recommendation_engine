  "description": "Can love bloom between a bookish human and a giant alien?Gilmat was bred for a very specific set of skills - skills which never developed. Even after finding a new home with his brothers-in-arms, the knowledge of his failure haunts him. He certainly doesn’t deserve the gift of a tiny, fragile female - but he will fight to his last breath to keep her.When Julie wakes up surrounded by flowers in the. middle of a blizzard she’s convinced she’s dreaming - but the huge green male holding her so carefully is very real. For the first time in her life more than her intellectual curiosity is aroused, even though her gentle giant is as much plant as man.When outside forces threaten their newfound paradise, will Gilmat’s skills finally blossom in time to save Julie - and the rest of his family?Each book in the Seven Brides series features a different couple and may be read as a standalone, but the books do link together. This sweet and steamy series is intended for mature readers.",
