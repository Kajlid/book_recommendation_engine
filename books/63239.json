  "title": "Liaisons",
  "description": "Liaisons is a collection of poems rooted in the exotic cultures of the Middle East, especially Turkey. It chronicles life, loss and landscape, always coming back to a place of sensuality and love. Praise for Liaisons: Charged with eroticism, sultry poems of desire and ecstasy, like deep earth wine: Liaisons offers the grateful reader, washed ashore in foreign lands, an eternity of nights, entrancing and passionate. Helene Cardona, actress, poet (The Astonished Universe) Kristen D. Scott has written deftly and beautifully about love, death and fear in various circumstances of a modern life in which love conquers all. Fascinated by ancestral voices in the Middle East of her travels, she presents its culture, a subject of her studies, with understanding which turns superbly on its women and her own impressions. She aptly shows locale of a few countries and moods, including American, in spare and hypnotic poetry. Helene Pilbosian (At Quarter Past Reality, Writer's Digest award winner)",
