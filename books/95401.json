  "title": "Blood Oath",
  "description": "Eve has claimed leadership of the Rapid City wolves, but her insistence on maintaining a platonic relationship with her beta werewolf, Max, has caused friction within the pack. Centuries-old tradition mandates that Eve and Max must be mates as well as co-leaders, but Eve's heart and soul belong only to Jericho, the vampire that Max has sworn a blood oath to kill.To make matters worse, Jericho has all but disappeared, and the only indication of any vampire's presence in Rapid City is a sudden rash of brutal murders. Eve knows that claiming Max as her beta wounded Jericho deeply, but surely her decision wouldn't drive her soulmate to start killing again...would it?",
