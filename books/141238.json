Natalie wants to start over and forget all about the past year she spent as the girlfriend of an enforcer for the Philly Mob. Unfortunately, it isn’t as simple as running away. While there are thousands of miles between Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the ripple-effect of her actions is far reaching. With a price on her head, Natalie’s brother, Grant, and her mobster ex-boyfriend, Dominic, are forcing change within the Philly Mob to eliminate the threat. Alliances are formed and negotiations are made to ensure Natalie’s safety in California, but an announcement from home and an unexpected betrayal may cause Natalie to once again leave everything behind. *For mature audiences.",
