  "description": "In this character-driven story, Trinidad, a streetwise mutt, struggles to communicate with humans and her pedigreed neighbor — the biggest chunk of gristle in her life.What Trinidad lacks in pedigree she more than makes up for in pluck, nosing out the most from each day. She could help us get more from our own lives — show us what it’s like to truly love being alive —if we could hear outside our limited range of sound waves. We can’t help our inadequate sense of smell either, but let’s face it, we’re justtoo busy and inhibited to use the full potential of our amazing minds and bodies.Trinidad’s neighbor, Stanley, is private, knowledgeable and always right — except when he skews what he learns from his scientist owner.The story employs canine fact and fiction, and presents a view of their possible world. It, fills us in on how the Old One created the world and describes dogs’ purpose in the grand scheme.The characters reveal almost exclusively from a dog’s point of view what it might be like to have canine values and priorities as members of a species sometimes misunderstood or even abused — and yet maintain a joyful spirit.",
