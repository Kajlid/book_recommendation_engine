  "description": "Everyone knows that the Tower of Alexis is impregnable...  ...But Emily intends to prove them wrong.  The Kingdom of Zangaria has finally started its descent into civil war. King Randor has declared martial law, imprisoned the pregnant Crown Princess Alassa in the Tower of Alexis and started preparations for a first strike against his enemies. The time has come for everyone to choose a side.  Emily has arrived in Alexis with the intention of freeing Alassa before her father can have her executed. But as Emily and her friends are drawn into a maelstrom of rebellious factions and crown loyalists, of commoners trying to escape the chaos and noblemen trying to make it worse, they find themselves faced with an insolvable problem.  If they manage to liberate Alassa - and put her on the throne - will there be anything left of Zangaria for her to rule?",
