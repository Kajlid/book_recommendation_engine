  "title": "Bijou, Bonbon and Beau: The Kittens Who Danced for Degas",
  "description": "On a cold dark night, a mama cat seeks shelter for her newborn kittens in a Parisian theater known for its ballet and for the famous artist who comes there to sketch. While the ballerinas practice, Bijou, Bonbon and Beau make themselves right at home to the delight of the dancers as well as the artist who quietly sketches them. Oh, the mischief they get into! They chase the ballerinas, sleep in their toeshoes, and frolick amongst their tutus. Until finally, the irritable stage manager threatens to throw the mischevious little trio back onto the street. But, on opening night, it is Bijou, Bonbon and Beau who steal the show. Beautiful pastel illustrations capture the spirit of Degas, and a surprise gatefold reproduction introduces readers to an actual Degas painting. A short bio on the artist is also included making this both a captivating story and an enchanting introduction to impressionist art that will appeal to cat-lovers, art afficionados, and ballerinas of all ages!",
