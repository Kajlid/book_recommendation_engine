You did.’ ‘That’s not the point!’   Dominique Boucher skipped her hometown for the bright lights of London with dreams, ambitions and a chip on her shoulder bigger than her eighties perm. Twenty years later, clutching her marriage certificate and wearing heels higher than her hopes, she returns home to prove her maturity to her prudent sister in order to take over management of her inheritance.  She’d only planned to be in town a few days, but Little Midwood and it’s inhabitants had other ideas. Within hours Dominique finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation.  Will she ever get back to normality, or has her hometown called her back for good.  Grab your beverage of choice and prepare to meet the most fashionable sleuth on the block. Buy Death by Shampoo, the debut Cozy Mystery by Diane Keen, now with one click or read for free on Kindle Unlimited.",
