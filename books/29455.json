  "description": "Michael’s life was forever changed by the brutal murder of his wife. As the reality of her death registers, Michael feels a strange force at work inside of him. Seeing nine ominous doors in his mind, six of them burst open, he hears unfamiliar words whispered. Repeating those words, Michael finds himself, unwittingly avenging his wife by incinerating the killer.  Little did Michael know that the opening of those doors would also be the opening to a new world for him, one of magic and legend. Michael must journey to this other world to help defend the magic that is his birthright. The magi of Kantwell, along with the human and dwarven races, a handful of elven guard, and the elite Avari warriors, now stand against the combined might of the trolls, ogres, and weres, under the ruthless leadership of the powerful wizard Mortow and the magi who follow him.  Will Michael’s unique magic be enough to save Kantwell and keep the races from falling into slavery or will Mortow be able to manipulate him to assure victory over all of Thelona?",
