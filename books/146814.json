It’s something that’s always bothered her, but even more so after her mother dies.

And when a secret is revealed about her mother, Lola decides it’s time to leave the dangerous life she’s grown up in and get some answers. But before Lola can get too far, she’s kidnapped by Frankie Catherlson, one of her father’s enemies, and given a choice—commit murder or let her father die. Worse, Layton Everett is the guy chosen to make sure she goes through with the hit. Lola has known Layton since they were kids, but their friendship was ruined when he went to work for Frankie without so much as an explanation. Lola thinks Layton is just keeping an eye on her to make sure she goes through with the murder, but when it all comes down to it, Layton just might be on her side.",
