  "description": "IvanI'm not a good man. I've killed, tortured others in the name of my family, for my uncle, for my father. I've been sent to a new place, one that I've never been before. It's where I meet her. Adelina is light in a dark world, she looks at everything in a different way, and brings happiness to others. She's everything I want, but shouldn't have. And our families are about to go to war over territory. What does that mean for us?AdelinaI love to see people happy. My grandmother says something is coming and I believe her. And then I see him. Ivan. I run into him, though he doesn't see me at first. I watched him be violent and then turn around and treat a little child with care, and a dog with love. He thinks he's not redeemable, but I think differently. We keep our trysts a secret since our families are about to go to war. I don't believe that Ivan's people mean us any harm, we can live in harmony. But my father disagrees. What does this mean for us?",
