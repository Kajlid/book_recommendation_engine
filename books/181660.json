  "description": "\"You know you're a little crazy, right Lil?\" \"I know. I get it from my mama.\" Unfinished business. Old family secrets. Guilt. Attorney Lilly Atkins has survived the long, hot summer in Oklahoma after running home from a cheating fianc√© and discovering a former flame had become a career criminal. That infamous ne'er-do-well, Cash Stetson, is on the tail end of a stint in rehab; and with a near-death experience skirted, life-altering epiphany under her belt, and cowgirl boots in place, Lilly is ready to kick butt. Except something's got ahold of her; turning her every way but loose. And as much as she tries to hide her crazy, it keeps flashing everyone on Main Street. Former federal agent Spencer Locke is rescuing her. Again. Her latest case includes dead varmints. On YouTube. She's finding dead bodies. In her office. She's getting assaulted. Weekly. And it won't stop raining. So there's reason enough to come unwound.",
