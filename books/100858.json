She lives a bored, lonely existence pining for something more. little does she realise that she is a pawn in Heaven's power struggles, but her discovery of its secrets will reignite an ancient war. The Gods' power has been broken, they are either dead or imprisoned. But when Sariel frees two goddesses they remind the Angels and the world what they should not have forgotten. But beneath the power struggles of Heaven and Earth lies Hell and all its dark, forgotten secrets. It is within its tormented embrace that Sariel is drawn to her destiny. But can she survive Hell long enough to reach Lucifer and if she does the Beast will be waiting.",
