  "description": "Zeke Daniels isn't just a douchebag; he's an a**hole. A total and complete jerk, Zeke keeps people at a distance. He has no interest in relationships—most a**holes don’t. Dating?  Being part of a couple? Nope. Not for him.He's never given any thought to what he wants in a girlfriend, because he's never had any intention of having one. Shit, he barely has a relationship with his family, and they're related; his own friends don’t even like him. So why does he keep thinking about Violet DeLuca? Sweet, quiet Violet—his opposite in every sense of the word.The light to his dark, even her damn name sounds like rays of sunshine and happiness and shit.And that pisses him off, too.",
