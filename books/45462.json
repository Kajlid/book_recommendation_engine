  "title": "A Death in Italy: The Definitive Account of the Amanda Knox Case",
  "description": "London Times journalist John Follain presents the most comprehensive account of the most publicized and controversial trial in a decade. Shortly after 12:30 pm on November 2, 2007, Italian police were called to the Perugia home of twenty-one-year-old British student Meredith Kercher. They found her body on the floor under a beige quilt. Her throat had been cut. Four days later, the prosecutor jailed Meredith's roommate, American student Amanda Knox, and Raffaele Sollecito, her Italian boyfriend. He also jailed Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast drifter. Four years later Knox and Sollecito were acquitted amid chaotic scenes in front of the world's media. Uniquely based on four years of reporting and access to the complete case files, and hundreds of first hand interviews, A Death in Italy takes readers on a riveting journey behind the scenes of the investigation, as John Follain shares the drama of the trials and appeal hearings.",
