  "description": "Roxy AbruzzoÂ stays one step ahead of trouble----especially now that her cash flow is less than stellar, and she's \"doing favors\" for her slippery uncle Carmine, one of the last old-time Mob bosses in Pittsburgh.With her sidekick, Nooch, and her thieving pitbull, Rooney, Roxy hustles the mean streets collecting debts for Uncle Carmine and keeping his customers in line.Â With her daughter's college tuition to pay, Roxy can almost convince herself that the shady jobs are legal. But when Carmine's consigliere offers Roxy a contract to kidnap someone, that's a line she wonâ��t cross.Trouble is the kidnapping happens anyway, and when the victim turns up murdered, Roxyâ��s number one on the police hit parade. To protect herself, she investigates and soon learns the victim had a big secret---or two. Add a rock singer with a penchant for dinosaur bones and throw in aÂ pesky paleontologist, plus an ex-nun with a mustache problem---not to mention a sexy chef with a taste for whatever Roxy dishes up---and you've got a caper full of quirky characters and laugh-out-loud mayhem.Peppered as usual with Nancy Martinâ��s sharp one-liners, Sticky Fingers---the second Roxy Abruzzo mystery---is evenÂ tastier than the first.",
