  "description": "The acclaimed series from Don Lomax continues in this third trade paperback collecting the entire Vietnam Journal series. The four issues contained in this volume were originally published by Apple Comics (#9-#12) and have never been reprinted before so this volume is a chance for long time fans to finally get the whole saga of \"From the Delta to Dak To\" in its entirety. The events of this issue cover the \"Brown Water Warriors\" to the \"Path of Reeds\" plus Journal is exposed to Dak To and Hill 875. Scott 'Journal' Neithammer is a journalist who finds that when you enter a war, there is no way to stay as a non-combatant. The original series was picked by Entertainment Weekly as \"a graphic novel you should own\" and recommended by the Military History Book Club. Vietnam Journal is written and drawn by Don Lomax, a Vietnam War veteran. \"Vietnam Journal by Don Lomax is the best comic book portrayal of Vietnam I have ever read. It's probably one of the best works ever put down in any art form about the war.\" - Daniel Robert Epstein",
