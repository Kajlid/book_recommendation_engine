  "description": "Questioning the ability of political organizations to assist in fully eradicating the oppression of First Nations and their citizens, the author critically reflects on the meaning of \"self-government\"â€•and the obstacles as well as solutions to some of its challenges. Concluding that self-government as a goal is too narrow and overly inundated by colonial meanings to be a full solution, Monture-Angus rejects the idea of \"self-government\" in favor of a much larger idea, independence.",
