  "description": "My magic burns inside me...Not all soulmates are created equal. Some of them are relieved to find each other. Some build a relationship nice and slow. And for some of them it’s that all consuming, love-at-first-sight kind of magic, like my twin sister Tegan and her other half, Tennessee.Then there are some where the girl is so up in her head and freaked the hell out that she actually, sorta, kinda, resents the guy who’s supposed to bring her happiness simply for his mere existence.AKA. ME.It’s time for me to be the soulmate Deacon deserves, even if it means trading in my cowgirl boots for designer stilettos. But Manhattan is a huge, terrifying city full of a society of witches determined to tear us apart.",
