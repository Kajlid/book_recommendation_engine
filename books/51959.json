  "description": "Tobe is a ruthless killer from medieval Japan who's been suffering in Hell for 300 years. After what seems like an eternity, he's finally given a chance for redemption--armed with the magical wooden sword Togari, he's sent to modern-day Tokyo to destroy 108 malevolent demons in 108 days. However, these demons must be vanquished without causing harm to their possessed human hosts. Will the baffling ways of the modern world and his own criminal tendencies make Tobe's quest against evil an unwinnable war? Fast-paced action seasoned with a touch of moral philosophizing make this series a must read for all!",
