  "title": "Neti-Neti Meditation",
  "description": "Neti-Neti is one of the oldest meditation techniques in the world. Through this process of intense introspection, we discover that we are not limited to our bodies, emotions, or minds, for our true nature is actually boundless and numinous. Historically, these two simple words, Neti-Neti, have pointed the way for generations of seekers and contemplatives to free themselves from the constriction of the ego and suffering. Fortunately, you no longer have to be an expert meditator to practice or even benefit from the wisdom of Neti-Neti. It is now available for anyone seeking freedom in the knowledge of their true nature. Drawing upon his experiences as a Buddhist monk, Zen teacher, and meditation instructor, Andre Doshim Halaw has developed Neti-Neti into a full meditation practice specifically designed to address the human condition in the 21st century. Neti-Neti Meditation is a form of self-inquiry that eliminates who we think we are as a limited, separate person, and reveals our true nature as the formless, unconditioned Absolute itself, free of all imperfections and suffering. This book walks you step-by-step through the Neti-Neti process.",
