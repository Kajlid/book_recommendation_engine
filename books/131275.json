  "description": "Kagen Silivasi is a powerful ancient vampire with a unique gift for healing – he is also a son, a brother, and a loner who has survived unspeakable tragedy and loss: Beneath his handsome, well-mannered exterior lies an alter ego consumed by rage and an undefinable impulse to “kill them all...”Arielle Nightsong is a brave human, a rebel spirit, and an accomplished healer in her own right. Born into a harsh world of violence, cruelty, and danger, she was enslaved at the age of ten and given as a gift to the most depraved being in Mhier – the infamous king of the Lycan. If not for her enduring friendship with a captive vampire, she might not have survived to escape the slave encampment…or to discover her ominous role in an ancient Blood Curse. When Kagen and his brothers journey into Mhier in search of their long lost father, it will take more than stealth and cunning to get out alive: Secrets will be revealed; loyalties will be tested; and long-standing defenses will fracture beneath the weight of an impossible choice...Blood Father ~ where destiny and duty collide.",
