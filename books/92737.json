  "description": "Five children have gone missing in New York. Jimmy, the latest victim, sits cowering in a corner of the dark cell where he is being held captive. With a loud clank, the door opens, and a dark figure emerges. The last thing Jimmy sees is the man's tongue slide over gold teeth. The mutilated bodies of the children begin appearing around town, and Detective Tim Marrow knows it's only a matter of time before the next victim is claimed. A hardened detective who has lost two partners, Tim Marrow is determined to solve the mystery and save the children from the clutches of a madman, and nothing will stop him - not even the fact that he is a little person.",
