  "title": "Rogue Royale: The Lost Bond Film by the 'Shakespeare of Hollywood'",
  "description": "In the mid-Sixties, the James Bond films became a global phenomenon as the world thrilled to their spectacular action sequences and cool gadgets. But the films nearly went in a very different direction, with a much darker treatment of Ian Fleming’s first novel by Hollywood’s most acclaimed screenwriter. In this short ebook, journalist and spy novelist Jeremy Duns unearths Ben Hecht’s drafts of Casino Royale. Rogue Royale is around 11,000 words long, and builds on his ground-breaking 3,400-word article published in The Sunday Telegraph in 2011.  Praise for Jeremy Duns:  'A wholly engrossing and sophisticated spy novel set against a forgotten corner of 20th century history. Fascinating and compelling' – William Boyd on Free Agent 'A taut and tortured exploration of betrayal on the national, ideological and personal levels simultaneously… A cleverly twisted tale of intrigue and deception, this is a masterly excursion back to the bad old days of the Cold War' – The Times on Song of Treason 'The immediacy of Duns’ writing grabs and suspends the reader in a beautifully realized heartbeat of recent history' – Kirkus Reviews on The Dark Chronicles 'This excellent book contains lessons that are still valid in the 21st century' – Oleg Gordievsky on Dead Drop 'Fantastic research and digging... a great read' – Gordon Corera on Dead Drop 'The career of Oleg Penkovsky reads like a story by John le Carré… Duns’ denouement is both startling and convincing – a fitting climax to this irresistible real-life thriller' – Francis Wheen, Mail on Sunday",
