  "description": "When Heaven screws up... All hell breaks loose.  God; omniscient creator, terrible golfer, and disgruntled CEO of Heaven, asks for little in life. He wants nothing more than for his private elevator to be repaired, ten minutes of peace and quiet to eat Girl Scout cookies, and an eighteen-hole round with the recently deceased British Prime Minister. So when a broken database causes his records department to send The Grim Reaper a list of souls not ready for reaping, his once peaceful life quickly begins to unravel.  Furious with Heaven's ineptitude and the problems the disruption is causing his daily routine, The Grim Reaper retaliates with an unprecedented response. He skips the next reaping on his list and as a result, causes an army of bloodthirsty zombie-demons to be unleashed on the peaceful town of Oceanview, Arizona.  After a few days of the apocalypse running unchecked and a rapidly increasing body count, Heaven learns the location of the events occurring below and determines divine intervention is required. When the Oceanview survivors mistakenly kill the angels sent down to help, Heaven has no to choice but to call in the big guns, and God himself is forced to visit Earth for the first time, making an already dire situation much, much worse.",
