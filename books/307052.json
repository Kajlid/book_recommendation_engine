  "description": "Island of Haiti, circa 63. A boy with a big belly button is growing up in Papadopolis (formerly known as Port-au-Prince) with Ma Fifine, his godmother. Climate of panic. The deadly virus of terror is spreading among the islanders. It comes from the lab of Papa Doc, “dicktator” supreme, father figure of the men in blue. Among the underground historians, they are known as Homo Papadocus. Sonson, the unfiltered storyteller of the village of Martissant becomes fluent in the foreign language of silence. In the atmosphere of social distancing, ex-isle seems to him the sole escape. The dying Patriarch intends to last forever. He will do anything to transfer the throne to his teenage son Claude-19 who will do the same with the unborn Nicolas-0. The search is on for the antidote to the plague of Papa Doc. At the end of the day, the only way to capture the frightening ghosts of the past is by the tale, with s-words and subversive language.",
