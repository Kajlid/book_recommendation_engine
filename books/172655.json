Wild waves rose up like a great hand and wrenched loose the Pagoda's long staircase, sending planks tumbling through the air. With horror I watched the end of one twin building sway and dip into the surf.I yelled at Josiah, but my words disappeared on the wind. I grabbed his arm, pointed, and we stood together, shoulder to shoulder, mouths gaping, watching the impossible.Like a wounded Goliath, the great bathhouse shuddered, folded in on its long legs, and collapsed into the sea.Galveston, Texas, may be the booming city of the twentieth century, but to Seth it is the end of a dream. He wants to be a carpenter like his father, but the family has moved so Seth can become a doctor. Just as things begin to look up for Seth, a storm warning is raised one sweltering afternoon. A north wind always brings change, but no one could have imagined anything like this. The acclaimed author of The Truth About Sparrows has crafted an unforgettable story set during the Galveston Storm of 1900. Dark Water Rising is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
