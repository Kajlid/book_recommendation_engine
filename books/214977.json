  "description": "The elves have a plan to save humanity…by enslaving them.And the angels are too busy to intervene.There’s a war in heaven and a petition to have me removed from the Ruling Council of angels. Sounds good to me, but if the rebels win then those I love will face exile and lose everything they’ve spent billions of years to build. I’ll need to rein in these psychotic elves and help restore the balance up above, because the fate of both heaven and earth are at stake, and apparently I’m the only one who can save them both.",
