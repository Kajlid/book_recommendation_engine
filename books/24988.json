But Chavez Delgado is cute as hell. He also has complications written all over him. A volatile tennis prodigy once tipped to win majors, after his epic collapse on the tennis tour eight months ago, he has everything to prove. Even if it means clawing his way back up the rankings on the second-tier Challenger circuit.I’ve met my share of hot messes. Call it collateral damage of being Flynn Dryden— motivational guru to struggling millennials. But I have never met anyone like Chavez. Young and yummy, he pushes all my right buttons. The trouble is, he’s not the only one with unresolved issues. It’s safer to stay away from him, but the temptation is too hard to resist. So when Chavez asks me to join him on tour as his mental fitness coach, I say yes for all the wrong reasons. And now playing a game called love leaves us both in danger of being burned.THIS IS A FULL-LENGTH REVERSE AGE GAP SPORTS ROMANCE BRIMMING WITH SULTRY SEDUCTION AND DELICIOUS SUSPENSE AND FEATURING 2023'S MOST SMOKING HOT INTERRACIAL COUPLE. IN THIS HAPPILY EVER AFTER, THE ONLY WILD CARD IS A THING CALLED LOVE!",
