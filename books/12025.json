  "description": "This book is an accounting of the ten steps author David Showers took to grow a stronger relationship with God. Being the analytical type, when faced with his own doubt of God’s existence, he decided to make a list of what he felt was the fundamental basics of Christianity and explore them in detail. He hoped that by understanding what God expects from him, and what he needs from God, his relationship with God would grow. Ten Steps to a Closer Walk with God is David’s personal journey. He freely admits that he doesn’t have all the answers, but shares what he has learned to hopefully assist others who may be asking the same questions about their relationship with God.",
