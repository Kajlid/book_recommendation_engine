  "description": "\"For a few moments they sat there in silence fraught with the unexpressed. Their bodies were taut and alert, listening for the slightest message from the other, the minutest shift in energy from the other.Deprived of the will to move they sat next to each other in unquiet silence.The unspoken swirled around them in dizzy circles.\"Set in Paris, Budapest and Hyderabad, this is a story about Sadhavi, a married woman, who finds herself intensely attracted to Kanav, a scholar and teacher, whom she meets in Paris. An intelligent woman with a traditional upbringing, a modern liberal education, married into an orthodox Brahmin family, Sadhavi had not actively thought about or pursued that which would fulfill her as an individual— till she comes to Paris and, away from her familiar surroundings, finds herself somewhat alone, emotionally vulnerable and intangibly connected to Kanav.Sadhavi’s yearning for an elusive fulfillment—and her struggle to let go of it—forms the core of the narrative, shaping the finely nuanced, contemplative contours of this quietly told but deeply felt novel.",
