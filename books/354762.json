  "description": "“[A] funny and a wickedly accurate picture of the life of a particular breed of Manhattanites—and it’s also thought-provoking and deeply moving.”—Gretchen Rubin, New York Times bestselling author of The Happiness ProjectA young woman deals with the aftermath of her father’s death while she struggles to commit to a future with her fiancé in Life After Yes, the poignant, wry, and very accomplished debut novel from Aidan Donnelley Rowley. A story of hope and light in the darkness in the bestselling vein of Juliette Fay, Cecilia Ahearn, and Jacqueline Sheehan, newcomer Rowley has captured all the angst and pain of truly becoming an adult, and has done so with unusual heart and grace, inspiring Julie Buxbaum to rave, “Her flawed and complex characters will stick with you long after Life After Yes’s final pages.”",
