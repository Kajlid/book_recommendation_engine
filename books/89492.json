  "title": "Shades of Sin: Behind the Mask",
  "description": "The stories encompass a gamut of writing styles and settings as the authors are from diverse backgrounds; unified only by their common love; that of the written word. Though the characters and stories straddle a wide spectrum, a deliberate effort has been made to keep the feel of the book constant. If you find any of the emotions familiar, or a tale finds an echo in the recesses of your heart, the authors will consider it an affirmation of their belief that this book is a job well done.The book is divided into three sections, a) Light grey b) Dark grey and c) Black. The book starts with stories which are a tad lighter, sometimes even amusing, but then gradually transcends to darker settings and characters. The book ends in a crescendo with the Black section, which has some really dark stories that touch upon the nadir of urban angst and degeneration.",
