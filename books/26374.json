  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Futuristic Sci-Fi Romance, M/M, shape-shifters] Kidnapping your mate is wrong. Even Crank knows that. But when his mate's life is threatened, all Crank can think about is getting the little neon-green-haired man to safety. It's just too bad that Anok refuses to be mated. Crank goes into mating heat the moment he scents his mate. With Anok refusing to be mated, Crank's only choice is to be sedated until his commander can decide what to do with him and Anok can be dropped off on the closest planet. Giving him up at that point is impossible, unless he wants to go feral and have to be put down for the safety of everyone, especially Anok. Anok is confused about the emotions Crank creates in him. He's seen what mates do to each other firsthand, and he wants no part of it, but he can't deny the draw to the handsome cougar shifter. When Crank gets sedated and everyone starts blaming him, Anok decides he needs to know what being mated means. He can think of only one person that can show him, and he's unconscious. But is he brave enough to have Crank awakened? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
