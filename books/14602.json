  "description": "Joanna P. Del Buono, in the 'Standing O' section of the paper Brooklyn NewsIt was a dark and scary night....Scared ya, didn't it? Ed Pessalano, the Edgar Allan Poe of Brooklyn, can scratch one off his bucket list now that he's published his \"Night Shivers\" anthology. Thirteen deliciously devilish short stories scary enough to, well, scare your pants off. Ed's been scaring the bejezzus out of family members with his tales of horror, and now he's sharing his scaring of haunted honeymoons, ghoulish relatives and ghastly ghosts with the rest of us. Standing O is still sleeping with the lights on.If you are looking for great horrifying tales to get you in the mood for Halloween or just love the horror genre, then you will love Night Shivers. Pessalano creates such hair raising stories that it will make you go under the covers. There are thirteen stories in here varying from the wedding day that turns upside down to a camping trip with an unexpected visitor, and an oldie but a goodie when it comes to horror- the old abandoned house with revenge that goes into the paranormal. Thereâ€™s more to choose from such as a story about a passenger on a train being perused by a deranged serial killer and an amusement park story that will have you thinking twice about ever going to a park again. Pessalano has a great gift, to entertain and scare the human mind with these horror stories. Those who love the genre and love a good scare will enjoy the book as much as I did. A fun, scary treat!Denise Alicea-The Pen-Muse Book Blog Reviews",
