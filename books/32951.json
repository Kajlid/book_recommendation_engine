  "description": "Ed Walsh returned to Ireland in 1970, a young man in a hurry to set up an institute of education. He found a decaying mansion on a riverside site, gathered talented young people, and secured funding from the World Bank and European Investment Bank to build what became the University of Limerick. Along the way, Ed made powerful enemies as he challenged official cant, traditional academics, and clerical humbug. This is an inspiring, frank, and often funny memoir by a passionate educational leader.",
