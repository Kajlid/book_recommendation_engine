She had not realized there were worse things to be running from until she was kidnapped by the General’s men. After several months of being held in captivity, a rescue attempt was made by RARE at the facility where she and several other women were being held. During the chaos, Serenity and one of the RARE team members were taken by the General. Once Phoenix finds out Serenity is his mate, nothing will stop him from finding her and freeing her. When Serenity’s demons from her past come back to haunt her, Phoenix must keep her safe not only from the General, but also from her past if they want a future together.",
