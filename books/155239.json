  "description": "The third installment in the Filthy serial novel. Faye thought she could run from the past. Again.She thought she could go back to the seedy life. The one where men pay for her body and she snorts cheap coke off the back of her dirty hand. But the past has found her. Again.The past with green eyes full of hate and lust.And this time he plans to keep her.***Filthy is a dark erotic serial novel that will release in six monthly segments of around 50 pages each. This book is not for those who like a traditional heroine. Faye and Rhett's story is dark, complicated, and twisted with themes that are not acceptable to all readers. Read at your own risk.***",
