  "title": "The Bermuda Triangle",
  "description": "Since 1943 hundreds of plane and ships, and thousands of people, have disappeared in the ocean between Bermuda and the Florida coast, the Bermuda Triangle. A squadron of five aeroplanes have gone missing, a ship was found abandoned with no sign of the crew or passengers. Charles Berlitz set out to investigate and has spoken to numerous people who have escaped the terrifying forces of the Bermuda Triangle. The explanations he finds seem to be impossible but no-one has found more plausible Are UFO's responsible? Is it due to space-time warps created by long-vanished civilisations? What is the connection to the lost continent of Atlantis?",
