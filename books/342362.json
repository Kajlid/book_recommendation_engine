  "description": "RECIPE FOR LOVE?Najika faces a new challenge, and it may be her toughest one yet. Before their tragic accident, her parents, both famous pastry chefs, made a promise to the grandmother of a classmate of Najika’s: to duplicate a white cake the elderly woman once tasted abroad as a teenager. Now Najika hopes to re-create the cake herself.With so few clues (it’s fluffy and heavenly) and so many possibilities, the trial and error might just go on forever. But Najika refuses to give up–-for one reason: She knows that all great masterpieces contain a distinct magic: a secret ingredient called love. Najika will need lots of it to make the wishes of Anju’s grandmother–-and certain other classmates–-come true. And who knows? With so much amour in the air, Najika might just find a little left over for herself!",
