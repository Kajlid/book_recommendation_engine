As a single parent, she must be sure the town she loves is safe for her daughter. Debbie won’t be deterred by anyone—not even the ruggedly handsome agent on the case who doesn’t appreciate her amateur sleuthing.After his partner’s body is uncovered, DEA agent Jack Davis vows revenge. But three words shouted over the phone before his partner died—azul, delfin, Almagro—are Jack’s only clues. Even worse, a sexy blonde spa owner refuses to stay out of his investigation, and the chemistry between them is difficult to ignore. As danger strikes ever closer, Jack and Debbie must figure out what blue dolphins and a small California desert town have to do with a dangerous drug cartel…all while protecting their hearts from an attraction neither can resist.",
