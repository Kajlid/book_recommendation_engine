Accompanied by hundreds of rare and unpublished photographs spanning the decades, we chart the Guides' development and contribution to Irish life. Some of the thousands of Irish women who have been members of the Irish Girl Guides share their experiences of being part of the Guiding family.This superbly-illustrated book will make a wonderful gift for everyone who has ever been a Guide, and is a permanent record of an organization entering its second century. The Irish Girl Guides have over 10,000 members throughout Ireland ranging in age from the Ladybirds of 5 - 7 years to Senior Branch members from 14 - 26 years; the Irish Girl Guides offers an age-specific program that's educational and fun, with a strong emphasis on the outdoors, community responsibility and teamwork. The Irish Girl Guides gives women an opportunity to develop leadership skills and to be challenged to their fullest potential.",
