  "description": "NOT PUBLICATEDBrandon Sanderson writes a \"State of the Sanderson\" each December to \"take a look back at [his] year and talk about the projects [he's] been working on.\"\"No updates from last year, I’m afraid. There was no intention to make progress on these this year. Once Alcatraz is wrapped up, I’ll turn my attention back to The Rithmatist as the last looming series that needs a wrapup that hasn’t gotten one … I know a lot of you keep waiting on Rithmatist news, and I feel bad having to give you the same news every year. (Yes, that paragraph above is the same one I put in the State of the Sanderson last year.) But the truth is, I really can’t work on this until at the very least Alcatraz is finished.A glimmer of light for you Rithmatist fans is this: my son just read the book, and he’s joined the crowd calling for me to do a sequel. So you have an in-house representative.STATUS: Keep Waiting. (Sorry again, again.)\"— Brandon Sanderson's website (The page is linked as the \"official url\" as non-GoodReads links aren't allowed in the description.)",
