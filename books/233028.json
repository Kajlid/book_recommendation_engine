  "description": "I just met the boy of my dreams— literally. But there’s a catch. He’s turning into a werewolf. And I think I might be a witch. In the small town where I grew up, I was a little odd, but who wasn’t? I never told anyone about my dreams, where I went in them, or who I met; no one told me about their weird problems either. But when I left for college, the dreams followed me… and now they’re real. The startlingly handsome boy I’ve been dreaming about for years? He’s in my freshman lit class. I try to avoid him but he doesn’t take the hint. And then things start getting really weird. The boy from my dreams? The one I see all over campus? Turns out he’s dreamed about me, too. I just want to be a normal college student, with a normal life and a normal boyfriend. But I’m not. Lights blow out when I’m angry. I know certain things before they happen. Butterflies follow me when I’m in a good mood. If I’m going to save myself and the boy of my literal dreams, I need to figure out what is happening to us and why. And I need to do it fast.",
