Her best customer is William Dancer, the owner of the office building; he's come to her kiosk nearly every day to request her services in purchasing yet another gift for yet another woman. How many girlfriends does this guy have? And why does he have to be so handsome?William just wants a date with the pretty girl in the lobby of his office building. But why would a bubbly, bouncy girl like Maddie Vaughn go out with a guy like him -- a guy whose last girlfriend called him boring? William figures if he can just talk to her, he'll get up the nerve to ask her out.Now Maddie thinks William is a playboy and William is stuck with an office full of gifts for a woman who doesn't know he's falling hard and fast for her. Will the spirit of Christmas -- in the form of Maddie's brother -- help these two sort through this muddle?",
