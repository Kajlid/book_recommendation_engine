  "description": "Simons Everson Manigault ('You say it 'Simmons.' I'm a rare one-m Simons\") lives with his mother, an eccentric professor (known as the Duchess), on an isolated and undeveloped strip of South Carolina coast. Convinced that her son can be a writer of genius, the Duchess has immersed Simons in the literary classics since birth (\"Like some kids swat mobiles, I was to thumb pages\") and has given him free rein to gather material in such spots as the Baby Grand, a local black nightclub. (\"It was an assignment. I'm supposed to write. I'm supposed get good at it.\")Although posessed of a vocabulary and sophistication beyond his years, Simons feels the normal adolescent bewilderment about the behavior of his parents. His conventionl father, the Progenitor, has recently left the family in a dispute over Simon's upbringing and has moved to nearby Hilton Head, where he would like to see his son raised among the orthodox surroundings of condominiums, country clubs, and private schools. At the book's center is Taurus, and enigmatic father-surrogate who tutors the boy in the art of watching the world without presumption.",
