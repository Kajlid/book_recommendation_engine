  "description": "Ursula may have escaped the Shadow Realm, but things are worse in New York. Kester is missing, and the city is under siege by a legion of dragons. There’s a bounty on Ursula’s head – alive or dead, and the dragons prefer the latter.  Ursula flees back to England, searching for hidden island of Avalon, barely staying ahead of the bloodthirsty monsters. To make things worse, she learns a dark truth about herself more terrible than she could possibly imagine.  But with the powerful shadow demon Bael by her side, Ursula must focus on finding the one weapon that can fight the dragons—the sword Excalibur. If she fails, the dragons will destroy civilization completely.",
