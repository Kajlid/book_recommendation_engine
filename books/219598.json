  "title": "Baby's Own Aesop - Being the Fables Condensed in Rhyme with Portable Morals - Illustrated by Walter Crane",
  "description": "Walter Crane (1845-1915) was one of the earliest contributors to children's literature and one of the most influential illustrators in the development of children's colour picture books. Crane began working for Edmund Evans in 1864 producing bright, colourful children's books which revolutionised the type of children's books available. This wonderfully decorated book 'The Baby's Own Aesop', is collection of rhyming Aesop's Fables about animals originally published in 1887. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Pook Press are working to republish these classic works in affordable, high quality, colour editions, using the original text and artwork so these works can delight another generation of children.",
