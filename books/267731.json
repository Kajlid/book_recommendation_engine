  "description": "The boy who once made my life a living hell is now the only way to save my family from living on the streets.  I wish he’d just stayed wherever he’s been for the past four years. That is, blissfully out of my life and nowhere near our little country town.  But in my weakest moment, he arrived like some knight in shining armour. One I never wanted or asked for. I should have run him down with my wheelchair. But I didn’t. I got in his car. And now I have to see his beautiful damn face every damn day. And that’s my worst nightmare. Because the things he once said can’t be unheard. The hell he put me through can’t be forgotten. The man he is now can’t be forgiven for the boy he once was.  And yet, I want him.   Set in a country town in rural Australia, Only the Negatives is a second chance, enemies to lovers romance, featuring a strong, disabled heroine and the man willing to do anything for another chance.",
