  "description": "The tables have turned; the animals of the United States are tired of being hunted, trapped, caged, and poisoned by humans, and decide to fight back, setting up their own government with the elimination of Homo sapiens as its primary goal.  \"We the Animals of the United States\" ™️️ is a work of imaginative fiction set in the first half of the 1800’s, during the time of America’s expansion westward. Every two years, as dictated by their new Constitution, a different biological Family of animals is selected to run the country, each bringing its own perspectives on how to deal with the human problem. When the protagonist, an egomaniacal hyena originally brought from Africa to be part of a carnival show, is rescued by the animals, he becomes a leading force in not only removing humans, but also in corrupting the government the animals have established.  By exploring the harsh treatment of animals in this country in a somewhat light-hearted, role-reversal, \"We the Animals of the United States\" is intended to make the reader think about co-existence rather than annihilation of other species",
