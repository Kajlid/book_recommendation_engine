  "description": "Been reading up on the latest best sellers eh? The usual suspects, huh? That’s cool man, I like familiar things too- I mean if I was drinking only grape juice for the last twenty years of my life, I guess I’d be pretty used to it by then. But if you’re looking for something out of the ordinary, something new, something not grape- then give Of Hearts And Stars a read. It’s not about wizards and vampires, I promise. Set in the fantastically futuristic (and frustratingly vague) year 20xx, you’ll embark on the first steps of an amazing journey with Leoric Swift. The entire galaxy is at war as two brothers fight for the throne, and one day the carnage and bloodshed finally spills over onto Earth. Swift’s life changes forever the day The Rebel Faction bombs his home city, and through a series of events we find him attending Arbalest Solar Academy; home to some of the brightest young minds in the galaxy. With the past showing up to haunt him, and the future looking ever more dangerous, get ready to put your hands up and throw a few punches with Swift as he sets out to end the galactic civil war and save the galaxy- one ridiculous (and reckless) mission at a time.",
