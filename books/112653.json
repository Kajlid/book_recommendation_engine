  "description": "Ki'shto'ba and its Companions are summoned back to Marcher lands where the High Commander Zhu'zi'a'ro'a and its Warriors have been engaged in a war with the Southern Nasutes over possession of the land to the south of Pol'ki'shtot (the Valley of Thorns). Having little luck keeping the treacherous Sta'ein'zei at bay, Zhu'zi'a'ro'a has decided to take A'zhu'lo's advice and attempt to negotiate peace, with Ki'shto'ba's help.
