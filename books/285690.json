  "description": "The ER doctors of Hopedale Hospital give patients a second chance at life. Finally, they're getting second chances at the love they all wish for. Noah's an ER doctor with a heart problem: he's lonely. Since his wife died four years ago, he's been raising his young son with the help of his single sister Rachel. When he meets a young, gorgeous, radiology tech, he's instantly smitten, and pursues her. Kalinda's the oldest of five siblings, more like their mother than their real mom. She's got a monster crush on tall, dark, and handsome Dr. Bonner, and she's thrilled when he asks her out. A smoking-hot night together gets interrupted by Kalinda's family issues. Can Noah and Kalinda turn their insta-love passion into a life together?",
