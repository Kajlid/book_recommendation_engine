  "description": "My name is Ella Daniels, I always thought I was normal, but when my parents go missing, things begin to become clear yet complicated in the most amazing ways. Finding my parents should be my first priority, but when I meet a new guy at school, things become so confusing that I’m left juggling the chaos of not only my life, but also those of the new guy and his friends. I’ve come to realise, I’m not normal, I never was. My past, present, and future collide in the strangest of ways, and I’m left wondering; Can I have it all or will it all come crashing down like the Hell my new friends are from? This is an RH slow burn, with fantasy and magical elements, with a little bit of mythology thrown in. Some scenes may be distressing to readers and some may leave you asking, “When will I get to read more?” Recommended reading age is 17+",
