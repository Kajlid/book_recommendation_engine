  "description": "Love on the Links  American attorney Julie Leonard has come to Scotland on a working vacation, determined to improve her golf game and earn a leg up in the judgeship sweepstakes. Former competitive golfer Niall Cromarty pulled the short straw for the job of being Julie's golf coach, though he has no patience for people plagued by blind ambition. As if that weren't trouble enough, Niall's neighbor-turned-nemesis, Declan MacPherson, has finally found an old Last Will and Testament that could wreck Niall's plans to expand his golf course.  Julie thought she wanted to wear that black judicial robe, but when Niall and Declan ask her to resolve their land dispute, she realizes she'd really rather wear Niall's ring. Will she steal Niall's dream, or will he fulfill hers?  My Heartthrob's in the Highlands  Florist Megan Leonard travels to Scotland to design the flowers for her sister's wedding, through its crunch time for Megan's business back home, and the loan that will allow her to expand her business has finally been approved. Best man Declan MacPherson is a Scottish farmer who strikes Megan as married to the land his family has been worked for generations, though he can be tempted to frolic with Megan in the greenhouse.  As Megan and Declan fall for each other, they realized one of them will have to give up everything they've worked for if they're to be together. Can true love put down roots in Scotland, or will it wither in the face of practical realities?",
