  "description": "Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny are back in this adventure that also features two particularly \"disagreeable\" villains...Fortunately, those two villains—Tommy Brock the badger and Mr. Tod the fox—dislike each other so much that, when Tommy Brock kidnaps Benjamin's young family, Mr. Tod unwittingly becomes the rabbits' ally.The world that Peter Rabbit first introduced to us in 1902 is still today one of Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved worlds. What started as an endearing story about a bunny rabbit would soon become the first ember for the illustrious series that is 'The World of Beatrix Potter', and a story which has endured retelling after retelling at bedtimes all over the world. \nBeatrix Potter\n (1866–1943) loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit', first published in 1902, was her first book. She later went on to publish more than twenty tales, and collections of rhymes.Age Rating: 3–12+ / Preschool - 2+ / Lexile Measure 890L",
