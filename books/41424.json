  "description": "Learning becomes fun for kids with this counting book about the forest habitat. Amazing artwork will inspire children in classrooms and at home to appreciate the world around us! Follow the tracks of ten woodland animals but . . . uh-oh . . . watch out for the skunk! Children learn the ways of forest animals to the rhythm of \"Over in the Meadow\" as they leap like a squirrel, dunk like a raccoon, and pounce like a fox. They will also count the babies and search for ten hidden forest animals. Cut paper illustrations add to the fun in this delightful introduction to a woodland habitat. Once again, Marianne Berkes makes learning fun. Kids will hide, graze, and pounce as they imitate and count the animals. Like Over in Australia , the cut-paper illustrations will inspire many an art project. Plus Marianne provides tons of ideas for activities and curriculum extensions about forest animals, literature, and writing. Teachers and parents, as well as kids, are the winners with these books. Backmatter Further information about the forest and the animals in the book! Music and song lyrics to \"Over in the Forest\" sung to the tune \"Over in the Meadow\".",
