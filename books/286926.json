He made the life I've always known vanish as if it never existed, and now I'm his helpless captive, forced to play my part in his sadistic fantasy.It could have been a fairytale... A wealthy, handsome Duke sweeps a poor orphan girl from America off her feet and brings her to a beautiful estate hidden away in the English countryside.But this isn't the Victorian era, and I'm not Richard Payne's bride or his guest. I'm his prisoner.I know it is all a sick, twisted game. But what I know doesn't matter. My delusions will be cured by pain and punishment and nothing will stop him from using me as shamefully as he pleases.I'm his ward now. Perhaps one day soon he'll have made me forget I was ever anything else...Publisher's Note: Ward includes spankings, rough sexual scenes, intense and humiliating punishments, and strong D/s themes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.",
