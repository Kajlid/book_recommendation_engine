  "description": "Life’s tough as an Elf girl stranded in Earth’s realm.When a jaguar shifter drops in out of nowhere and asks me for help in tracking down an ancient blood-magic statuette, I say no thank you. I learned a long time ago the key to survival is keeping a low profile. But it's hard to ignore an artifact of the gods powerful enough to blow holes in reality.Enter stalker werewolves in a black Mercedes and magicians trying to capture me. They all think I know where the damned statue is. Then I’m attacked by demons.It wouldn't be so bad, but some of them are really rude. Being rude is a capital crime where I come from.Time for a lesson in manners.",
