  "description": "Kiera has a great life built for herself until someone from her past threatens to destroy the walls she has struggled to build. She doesn't want the pain that comes with remembering. How can she let him be part of her life if all he does is bring those memories back to haunt her? That one case changed the path of Ethanâ€™s life forever. Meeting Kiera again brings all the questions back to the surface. He just wants to know what happened to her on the night he found her bloody and beaten. Neither of them counts on the past changing the course of their future. Will there be anything left of Kiera if she is forced to face a past she has tried so desperately to bury? Will Ethan still want her around after he learns the truth?",
