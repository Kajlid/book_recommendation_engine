  "description": "A Deathbed Promise Raised in an orphanage during the Civil War, Lauralee Johnston learned to stand up for herself and to be wary of men. Hoping for word of her missing parent, she worked as a nurse at the Veteran€™s hospital, until the day her mortally wounded father was brought in. It was his dying wish that led her to Cherokee brave Dancing Cloud. So although she was unfamiliar with Cherokee customs and unsure of what to expect, Lauralee decided to place her trust in the ebony-haired warrior. A Sacred Vow As the man who would one day lead his people, Dancing Cloud knew that he must honor his former commander€™s last request. But there was much more than obligation in his devotion to the beautiful and shy Lauralee. From the moment he set eyes on her, Dancing Cloud sensed she was his destiny. Not even the red-haired Yankee who€™d shot her father and sworn revenge on the Cherokee could come between these two souls yearning to be one.",
