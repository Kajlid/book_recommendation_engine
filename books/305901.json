Houston, Texas.Evie Barnes is a bad girl. So are all her friends. Theyâ€™re the sort who wear bold makeup, laugh too loud, and run around with boys. Most of all, they protect their own against the world. So when Evie is saved from a sinister encounter by a good girl from the \"right\" side of the tracks, every rule she's always lived by is called into question. Now she must redefine what it means to be a bad girl and rethink everything she knew about loyalty.In this riveting story of murder, secrets, and tragedy, Jennifer Mathieu puts a female twist on S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders . Bad Girls Never Say Die has all the drama and heartache of that teen classic, but with a feminist take just right for our times.",
