The past few months have been filled with love and laughter, but storm clouds are gathering on the horizon. The three choose to take every opportunity to cement their growing bond, like an afternoon picnic that turns into a taste test of a different sort when Bay and Marsh show Oliver the delights of Horsfall Ranch.",
