But the residents of St. Bernard Parish refused to be defeated. One Katrina volunteer tells the story of a community that came back to life against all \"\"As volunteers we were privileged to witness their strength through the toughest of times. In St. Bernard Parish dignity and compassion, humor and hospitality were still going strong. And if these residents could maintain their goodness under these circumstances, maybe we could too if disaster ever visited us.\"\"",
