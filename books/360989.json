  "description": "Sleeping with the Fishes made a splash as a zany, amusing fantasy (Best Reviews). Now, Fred the Mermaid returns to discover there are plenty of fish in the sea-and they're getting on her nerves. As Fred the Mermaid tries to fit in with her own kind, she finds herself hooked on both Artur, the High Prince of the undersea realm, and Thomas, a hunky marine biologist. She's also caught between two factions of merfolk: those happy with swimming under the radar-and those who want to bring their existence to the surface.",
