  "description": "Jordan Havers's sixteenth birthday turns out to be anything but sweet when she's kidnapped by a demon who swears that she's the reason her party turned into a tragedy. When Heaven itself unleashes an ancient force to hunt her down, healthy skepticism takes a backseat to survival. Could an honor student from Twin Pines really be the nephilim, a human-angel hybrid cursed with power of apocalyptic proportions? Could a demon really be anything other than a monster? Soon Jordan is forced to choose between accepting Hell's protection and throwing herself at the mercy of Heaven's greatest weapon.",
