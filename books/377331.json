  "description": "Messy, creative Bess is perfectly happy creating her paintings in her out-of- the-way studio, never worrying about what the other fairies think. But after she unveils a new portrait of Tinker Bell, she finds herself in a whirlwind of attention. Every sparrow man and fairy in Pixie Hollow wants her to paint his or her picture! With hundreds of fairies to please, suddenly Bess's talent seems more like a chore than a joy!",
