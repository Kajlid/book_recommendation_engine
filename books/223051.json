  "description": "What matters more to Archer: saving the woman he loves but can never have, protecting humanity, or avoiding a prison sentence that would stretch for eternity? Archer is a half breed, caught between two opposing heritages - the Jacks, a bloodthirsty race who kills for sport, and the Readers, a docile race trying to save humankind. Two years ago, he betrayed the Readers, though, in a last-minute change of heart, saved them from ultimate destruction. But now he’s all alone, wallowing in unrequited love. Sadie is an Immortal Seer with a dangerous calling: she must hunt down and destroy the last of the vengeful Jacks. But her quirky humor and gentle spirit make her an unlikely fit for the job. Archer is drawn to Sadie’s pure, kindhearted nature, rekindling hope he might not have to live a solitary life, but he has no idea the danger he’s in. When fate forces the mortal enemies to work together, Sadie must determine which side Archer is on, how much of his charm is real, and if she should follow through with her directive: should she kill him or save him?",
