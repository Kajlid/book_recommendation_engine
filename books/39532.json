She’s also a foul-mouthed, cranky ex-Catholic, attempting to raise a fourteen-year-old daughter on her own.When she’s hired to investigate the background of a squeaky-clean and charismatic senator who might just be the next president, the last thing she expects to uncover is a murder. Evan’s life is further complicated when she meets the senator’s reclusive wife—who happens to be hiding some dust of her own.",
