You’re doing all the things a Christian should do.But is Christ living in you? Has He swept and cleared out every cobweb in your life? Or are you tightly gripping the broom yourself? Does His spirit motivate your every thought and action? Or is your Christian walk just a performance, an act that masks the emptiness inside?He’s called us to more than a game of charades. He’s invited us to taste the joy of the Christ-filled life.You’re already in Christ; now let Him be in you. It’s time for The Master’s Indwelling .",
