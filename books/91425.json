The author highlights beesâ€™ ties to our own lives, the food we eat, and the habitat we provide, and suggests ways to support bees in our own backyards.In addition to helping readers understand and distinguish among major groups of bees, this guide reveals how bees are an essential part of healthy ecosystem and how many plants, including important crop plants, depend on the pollination they provide.
