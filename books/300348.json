  "description": "Love is DeathLife as I know it is irrevocably changed. I’m now the leader of the Shadow Guild, a ragtag bunch of supernaturals who don’t quite fit in anywhere but together. It should be perfect, but of course the magical world is never so easy.For one, the man that I’m falling for—the Devil of Darkvale—is doomed by a curse that will drag him to hell. There’s only one solution—use magic to break the ancient, fated bond that binds us, and then don’t fall for each other.That becomes difficult when a series of kidnappings forces us to work together. Love might equal death for the Devil and I, but with so many lives at stake, we must work together to save them…all without succumbing to the pull of fate.",
