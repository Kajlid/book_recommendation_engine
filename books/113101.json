  "description": "Jake is not a bad person - he used to be the class joker, the comedian. He used to have 'potential'. But now he's been expelled from five schools and only Cattle Rise, a tough inner-city school, will take him. All he has to do is survive these first few weeks because otherwise he's heading to the Detention Centre. But survival means keeping his head down, and that's not something Jake's very good at. What nobody knows is that Jake is drowning in grief - a grief that makes him angry and violent and unafraid. Then one night he hears screams in the night from the girl next door. Could it be that Robin's trapped in a fate worse than his? Perhaps, in helping her, he can help himself. But, as he's drawn into Robin's world, Jake realizes that he's about to discover what real danger is.",
