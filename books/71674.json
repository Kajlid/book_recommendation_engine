  "description": "\"Playful and smart, Emily Toder's SCIENCE is written in a limpid vernacular of sudden lacunae, jumps, and about-faces. For all the poems' contemporaneity, they are haunted by an unsaid and probably indeterminate mystical experience.\" —Eugene Ostashevsky\"Emily Toder's poems are empathetic, generous and open with an emotional intelligence that run laps around the world we are becoming in. She doesn’t demand or consume, she considers.\" — HTMLGIANT",
