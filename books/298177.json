  "description": "He’s a criminal—an abomination. We’re wrong in every way.\nIf only I could’ve convinced my heart.\nHis lips whispered promises of all the stars in the sky.I dreamt of a love that would last forever.We were gorgeously young and desperate for one another.But we're star-crossed.Fate had decided our course.Leaving us to cling to each other as we crumbled to ash.His need became possession.My innocence turned jaded.Our families declared war.All that remained was hate.But Calder was raised by wolves. The rules didn’t apply.I was his until he said otherwise—for better or for worse.Our love story is bathed in crimson and drenched in bullets.Because sometimes, Romeo comes with tattoos, guns, and a taste for blood.This duet is a dark Romeo and Juliet re-imagining with an HEA, sitting right in the pocket of Leo and Claire, not Shakespeare. Trigger warnings can be found on my website.",
