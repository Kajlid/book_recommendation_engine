  "description": "Dancers are capable of anything to succeed in the cutthroat world of ballet, grueling workouts, restrictive diets, artificial enhancements...even murder. A talking Doberman, an aging ballerina, and an investigative reporter find themselves embroiled in a world where youth rules and no one is safe. This gripping novella by the Hugo and Nebula-Award winning author of Beggars in Spain is a powerful, yet humorous exploration of the moral ambiguities of genetic engineering and the all-too-tenuous bonds of family.",
