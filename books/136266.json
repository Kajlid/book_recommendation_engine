When Inez entered the cave Aledyan first thought that he was imagining her. He has been a warlock's prisoner for over two hundred years, but she could end his torments and set him free, if he played his cards right. Would he be able to go through with it? Would he be able to hurt her, knowing also that she was his one true love?  Please note that this book is not suitable for readers under 16.",
