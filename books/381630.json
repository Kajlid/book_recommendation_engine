  "title": "William Albert Allard: Five Decades",
  "description": "This gorgeous gift book reveals nearly 50 years of photography by seasoned National Geographic photographer Bill Allard. Allard was a pioneer of color photography with a style that called for entering people's homes and hearts; by winning their confidence he was able to capture \"off guard\" moments, and reveal the depth of human nature as never before seen in the pages of National Geographic. Always in search of \"what is happening at the edges,\" his work reveals beauty, mystery, and a sense of adventure. Part photography retrospective and part personal memoir, this book paints a full picture —through images and narrative —of the life of a globe-trekking photographer over the past half century.",
