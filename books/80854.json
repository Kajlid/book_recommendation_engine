  "title": "The Healing Game",
  "description": "For The Healing Game, we interviewed three young adult opiate addicts in long term recovery from pharmaceutical and heroin addiction. Each person in the book's chapters has a minimum of two years sobriety.Their stories of recovery take the reader on recovery journeys that includes Indiana, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. From \"Sea to Shining Sea\" each of the individuals in these three short stories have achieved recovery through the Twelve Step programs offered in musty church basements across this country. The Healing Game recalls the history of their disease and hard fought recovery, and provides the real-life experiences of these young adult addicts. The names have been changed to protect both the recovery of the interviewees and the recovery of their families. These stories provide timelines of how and when their compulsion started, where their addiction brought them, and how they were able to pull themselves out of the clutches of addiction, and find their way back to the road of recovery. The intention of this book is to confirm that recovery does exist from this insidious disease. The Healing Game was written to offer families a gift of hope.",
