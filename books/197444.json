  "description": "Step on up and get fed!  Meet Juan Montoya …  Juan is an over-the-road truck driver who has fallen into complete despair. An incredibly evil and random act of violence has taken his family from him, and now, he is trying to pick up the pieces and move on with his life. As he struggles with this tragic loss, Juan feels that life really has no meaning anymore. Although he believes in God, deep down, he feels that the Lord has somehow abandoned him. On a daily basis, Juan feels searing pain—a pain that must end.  Enter Reggie Harper. Reggie is a fellow truck driver who reaches out to his friend Juan and shows him how to overcome his loss by leading him towards understanding the virtues of biblical hope. Reggie has already learned that without real hope, life can seem utterly meaningless. But what exactly is hope? How can someone’s life be enhanced by something that sounds so good, but can also seem so vague?  Join Juan as he happens upon a strange and unexpected restaurant during a most interesting night, the Hotcake Haus on Grace Highway. There, Juan encounters the oddest thing: a menu that features dishes that are inspired by the various types of hope found in the Bible. During his life-changing visit to this quaint southern diner, Juan’s soul is finally fed what it truly needs—real hope, that can only be found in Jesus Christ.  In this stand-alone installment in the Parables series, your soul will be fed as the reader walks through what is perhaps the most intertwined blessing throughout the entire Bible—real hope.",
