  "description": "Poetry. Memoir. LGBT Studies. Do you have a poet whose every poem you want to read? Trish Salah might be that poet. Written between lyric and language poetries, and exploring the transgender fantasies encoded in feminist, autobiographical, anthropological and psychoanalytic archives, LYRIC SEXOLOGY VOL. 1 could be your book. Drawing upon Freud's interpretation of the memoirs of the jurist Daniel Paul Schreber, alongside gender theories, polemics and case studies dating from the end of the 20th century to beginning of the 21st, Trish Salah samples and remixes the clinic and the club, dystopia and draughty apartments, re-presenting an emergent transgender subject in all (or at least some) of her/hir/his/their messy contrariness and queerly multiple biomythographies. One might even call this composite a syncretic strategy for building a conceptual, poetic world in a single volume. But, inevitably, more is left out than in. Salah revels in the conflicts of undermining specialization: i need to take a shower. i'm troubled by / increasingly distorted fanfictions, psychotic or melancholy, / with the loss of canon. Nevertheless her text shimmies its way through the regulatory regimes of race, class and genre by always bringing us back to glib reality: we all need haircuts though. Roof Books is proud to publish this revelatory manuscript.",
