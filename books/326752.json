  "description": "For over two decades, Spencer Johnson has been inspiring readers with his simple yet profound stories of the challenges we face in these times of unprecedented change. The Present is an engaging story of a young man’s journey to adulthood, and his tireless search for The Present, a mysterious and elusive gift he first hears about from a wise old man.  This Present, according to the old man, is the most valuable gift a person can receive.  Why? Because it is the one thing that doesn’t change in changing times.  As the young boy becomes a man, he grows disillusioned with his work and his life.  So he returns to ask the old man to help him find The Present. The old man responds, “Only you have the power to find The Present for yourself.” Heeding the old man’s advice, the young man embarks on a worldwide search for this magical gift that remains unchanging in a changing world, and holds the secret to personal happiness and lifelong success. It is only after the young man has searched high and low and all but given up his relentless pursuit that he discovers The Present—and all of the promises it offers. Like the young man, you may find that it is the best gift you can ever give to yourself — and to those you care about.",
