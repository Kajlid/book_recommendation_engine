He has three weeks to become a refined, elegant duke for the Queen…or doom the entire family to ruin and scandal.Promising psychologist Jules Southby knows a lot about disguises. She’s secretly been living as a boy since birth, enjoying the freedoms of men and knowing little about how to behave like a woman.

But loving the lost duke would mean losing every sacrifice she’s made to earn her freedom…",
