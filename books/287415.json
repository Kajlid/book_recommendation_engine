  "description": "If you like bossy British guys with big hearts...one click this one today!  Sexy billionaire Liam Bennett is cocky, dangerously handsome, and more importantly, my new boss. If only my ovaries didn't flutter when he was near—yeah, that'd be super helpful.  When our long hours lead to a dare—and an X-rated encounter—I never expected it to be the hottest night of my life.  It'd also be super helpful if Liam didn't know it and taunt me about it every chance he got. Unable to deny our attraction any longer, our work relationship brings a whole new meaning to the term inbox.  But being with him comes with some baggage—like an ex-wife and three kids kind of baggage. And a lawyer who wants half of his company.  Unsure that I'm cut out for this new level of complicated, my traitorous ovaries beg me to try.  Heaven help us all.",
