  "description": "King Everard and Queen Isabelle have no heir. Two children have no family. But what happens when Isa and Ever find out that these children might be the greatest threat the kingdom has seen in 500 years?  In this retelling of Hansel and Gretel, Henri and his little sister, Genny, find themselves abandoned in the forest when something dark beckons to them. Something sweet. And though Henri strives to use his special abilities to protect his sister, the call soon becomes too strong for even him to ignore.  Back at the Fortress, King Everard and Queen Isabelle are enjoying a reign of peace, but what should be a time of joy is marred by the pain of being childless. So when Isa and Ever find themselves in charge of two forsaken children with unusual abilities, and they are called to face an enemy with unexpected connections to Ever's past, they must trust the Fortress once again if they wish to hold onto their kingdom, the hope of parenthood, and ultimately, one another.  Beauty Beheld is the third book in The Becoming Beauty Trilogy and also the third book in the Classical Kingdom Collection, a series of clean fairy tales retold to help readers find the long lost world of magic and destiny.
