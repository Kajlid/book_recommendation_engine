  "description": "r.h. Sin, bestselling author of the  Whiskey, Words & a Shovel  series, returns with a collection of poetry and prose meant to remind the wounded that they are, in fact, beautiful in a way society may never comprehend.A Beautiful Composition of Broken  is inspired by some of the events expressed artistically by Samantha King in the bestseller  Born to Love, Cursed to Feel.  It serves as a poetic documentary of the lives of people who have been mistreated, misunderstood, and wrongfully labeled in a way that limits them in this world. The author’s most personal volume yet,  A Beautiful Composition of Broken  builds a conceptual bridge between r.h. Sin’s earliest work and his series,  Planting Gardens in Graves.",
