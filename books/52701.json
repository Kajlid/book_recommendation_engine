  "title": "The Social Contract and Discourses",
  "description": "Inspired by ancient Greek city states, Rousseau searched for a way which states of his day could be equally representative\nHolding men in wretched subservience, feudalism–alongside religion–was a powerful force in the eighteenth century. Self-serving monarchic social systems, which collectively reduced common people to servitude, were now attacked by Enlightenment philosophers, of whom Rouseau was a leading light.His masterpiece, The Social Contract, profoundly influenced the subsequent development of society and remains provocative in a modern age of continuing widespread vested interest. \nThis is the most comprehensive paperback edition available, with introduction, notes, index and chronology of Rousseau's life and times.",
