  "description": "An emotionally charged romance, COUNTING STARS tells the tale of love and loss, and learning to live after everything you’ve lived for has died.Twenty-two-year-old Reese James has been called bride, wife, and now—widow. At a time when she’d been dreaming of becoming a mother, she became what she never imagined. Her friends and family spent the last year looking at her with pity and discomfort, but now they look at her with impatience. When will she move on? When will she move forward? But how can she move forward when she is standing still, trapped by her past? She had it all with Derek, but now the rings on her finger make her feel like a fraud. Torn between the life she led and a future she can’t imagine, Reese finds herself looking for change. Faced with an opportunity to escape into the wild Alberta Rockies, she takes it. Reese soon finds herself trekking into the wild with Logan, a broody, arrogant, city-scorned man with a chip on his shoulder. But Logan doesn’t know she’s broken. He doesn’t look at her with pity or discomfort or impatience. When he looks at her, she feels strong. She feels alive. As they find a rhythm, learning to live together in the wild, Reese learns the hard lesson that maybe her soul wasn’t intended exclusively for Derek. Maybe, just maybe she was one of those rare souls who had always been intended to love with all of her heart twice in her life. Maybe Logan was always fated to be her future.",
