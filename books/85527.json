Bigger, too.” The thing glanced up at its captive briefly, then dropped it and turned toward Marcia. The little one fell with a startled shout and danced back out of the way.The demon looked like something constructed of gigantic orange pipe cleaners. Its limbs were long and spidery, and it stood in a crouch. Its hands and feet were clawed, its grin filled with long, sharp teeth.“Don’t you want to run?” it asked in a wheedling voice.Marcia realized she should be afraid.

All she felt was anger and contempt.“Last chance,\" it said…And so continue the adventures in Ambermere in the exciting second book of the Ambermere Trilogy",
