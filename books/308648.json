  "description": "Are the ghosts of Christmas really picking this year to mess with Jake’s head? He likes his self-imposed isolation. Maybe like is a little strong, but it’s comfortable and safe, two words no one would ever use to describe New York's culinary rising star, Dani. Can he have a change of heart like Scrooge before she leaves, and would Dani even want him to?Christmas is hard for a lot of people, but for Jake Rogers-Hammond it’s a constant reminder of when his world fell apart. Twice. His sister’s best friend, Dani, is a rising star in the New York culinary scene, coming back for Christmas for the first time in years, and likely her last. Hopefully, she can get over her schoolgirl crush on Jake before she goes back home.Jake doesn’t know why he volunteers to share the bunkhouse with Dani for two weeks. He also can’t understand why he wants to be the one to take care of her during a blizzard or why every time he’s near her he wants to keep her all to himself, knowing he can’t stand in her way of a big promotion. Dani needs to get over her school-girl crush on Jake since before he was her first kiss. He doesn’t remember it, and Dani is hoping being in close quarters will prove that he belongs on the ranch, and in her past, so she can go home and stop comparing every man to Jake.Will Jake admit he’s falling for Dani when his friends, family, and his sister’s obnoxious bull take turns channeling the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future? Can Dani forget Jake amid the hustle and bustle of one of the top kitchens in the City? Will the message from the Ghost of Christmas Future reach them in time or will they forever be haunted by what could have been?",
