  "description": "When Ryannon shows up on Gabriel’s doorstep claiming that he is an archangel with the power to trigger the Apocalypse and that he’s in danger from an End of Days cult, he thinks she’s crazy -- crazy hot -- but still crazy. Despite being a trumpet player named Gabriel, the life he’s led has been anything but angelic. But with the cult already in hot pursuit, he has no choice but to accept it for now. He and Ryannon must go on the run to save themselves and dozens of others from the cult leader’s diabolical schemes.Even the desperate circumstances are not enough to dampen the fiery lust that pulls them together. Gabriel knows that Ryannon is the one for him, but he’s a player and always has been, and Ryannon has no intention of being just another woman in his bed. Will they survive long enough to develop trust, find love, and somehow avoid inadvertently setting off the Apocalypse?",
