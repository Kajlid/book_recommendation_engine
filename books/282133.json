  "description": "Ariana Seven lives in a world without men. After a plague wipes out everyone with a Y chromosome, the women of Earth create the perfect utopian society. Secretly, Ari feels like a freak. Dating is a nightmare--and having sex? Forget about it! Jackson Taylor has had the worst kind of day. He's screwed out of a promotion, his girlfriend dumps him, and just as he’s about to get flattened by a city bus he’s sucked into a time portal into the future. In this perfect world, they have only one use for men--as sperm donors. One look at Ari's silver-blond hair and velvety black eyes and he loses his heart. This title contains explicit sexual content.",
