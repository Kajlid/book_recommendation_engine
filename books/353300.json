  "description": "The final volume in the series drawn by Tove Jansson Moomin Book Five: The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip features the final strips drawn by Tove Jansson and written by her brother Lars for the London Evening News, before Lars took over both the art and the writing. The first “Moomin Winter” returns with more unwanted guests than in Book One, especially the curious and secret-spilling Nibling, sending the Moomin household into a tizzy of secrecy and closed doors. In “Moomin Under Sail,” theMoomins find themselves without a new adventure until Too-Ticky’s compass gives them the idea to build a boat and head to sea. Finally, we meet the Fuddler in “Fuddler’s Courtship.”Mymble captures poor Fuddler’s heart, and his bumbling drives her straight into the arms of Dr.Hatter, the local psychiatrist. Delightfully quirky, the Moomin family does not fare well under the gaze of someone trained in correcting odd behavior.",
