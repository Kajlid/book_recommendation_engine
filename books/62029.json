  "description": "Penny Picklepants, as she is prone to remind everyone and anyone who will listen, is about to start the 6th grade, and that means that she is practically an adult... at least, according to Penny it does. If there are three things that define Penny Picklepants, they are: Shopping, Fashion, Pickles, and, well... more Pickles. After all, Penny is on a quest, a quest to become the youngest professional pickle taster in the history of the family pickle plant. But in order to become the worldâ€™s youngest ever professional pickle taster ever, Penny will first need to find a way to save the family pickle plant. Unfortunately, Penny's plans often have a way of going horribly awry. And you can be sure that this plan will be no exception.",
