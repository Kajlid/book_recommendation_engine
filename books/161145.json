He was helping her move past a broken heart and she was guiding him towards a reclaimed relationship with the brother he'd lost years ago.

She heard things that altered her reality completely. There's no one for her to rely on but herself and she has to decide whether a familiar voice from the past holds more weight than the promise of a future she can't quite grasp yet.Trusting her heart has never been easy for Kayla. Trusting others has never been easy for Ben. Together they have to determine whether the sins of the past are too much to bear or whether a connection that is undeniable is worth the risk.",
