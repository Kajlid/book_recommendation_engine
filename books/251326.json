  "description": "Time-travelling Librarian spy Irene and detective Vale head to 1890s Paris to find the murderer of a dragon at a peace conference in the fifth adventure in the bibliophilic fantasy series from the author of The Lost Plot.When Irene returns to London after a relatively straightforward book theft in Vienna, Bradamant informs her that there is a top secret dragon-Fae peace conference in progress that the Library is mediating, but that the second-in-command dragon has been stabbed to death. Tasked with solving the case, Vale and Irene immediately go to 1890s Paris.Once they arrive, it seems that the murder victim had uncovered evidence suggesting that he may have found proof of treachery by one or more Librarians. But to ensure the peace of the conference, some Librarians are already hostages in the dragon and Fae courts. To save the captives, including her parents, Irene must get to the bottom of this murder - but was it dragon, Fae, or even a Librarian who committed the crime?",
