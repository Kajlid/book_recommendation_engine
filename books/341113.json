  "title": "The Time of Aspen Falls",
  "description": "Aspen Falls was happy. Her life was good. Blessed with a wonderful family and a loyal best friend-Aspen did know a measure of contentment. Still, to Aspen it seemed something was missing-something hovering just beyond her reach-something entirely satisfying that would ensure her happiness. Yet, she couldn't consciously determine what the \"something\" was. And so, Aspen sailed through life-not quite perfectly content perhaps-but grateful for her measure of contentment. Grateful that is, until he appeared-the man in the park-the stranger who jogged passed the bench where Aspen sat during her lunch break each day. As handsome as a dream, and twice as alluring, the man epitomized the absolute stereotypical \"real man\"-and Aspen's measure of contentment vanished! Would Aspen Falls reclaim the comfortable contentment she once knew? Or would the handsome real-man-stranger linger in her mind like a sweet, tricky venom-poisoning all hope of Aspen's ever finding true happiness with any other man?",
