  "description": "\"What Douglas Adams would have envisioned if he were a Millennial…\" -- JJ Falco, author of Buddy Eddington's Golden Pen  In a universe of opportunities, Captain Frankie and the crew of the Atalanta Empress are coming up empty.   They’ve lost their jobs, crash-landed, and possibly unleashed an invasive rodent species onto the land.  Now what was once a courier ship delivering tea towels must fight perpetually pregnant animals, escape transdimensional quagmires, and attempt daring heists. Will the crew make their ship’s lease payment and save the world?  Probably not without endangering many lives and many other worlds in the process.  Follow the tired captain whose true colors literally show, an Earth widow augmented to carry heavy things, an unruly, maned second-in-command, and two triplets with freaky mind powers in the first three wacky space opera novellas bundled into one convenient electronic parcel.  Atalan Adventure Pack #1 contains the first three novellas in the Atalan Adventures.  Rats and Bolts The crew takes up bounty hunting to finance their escape from a rodent-infested planet. Unfortunately, the Kieron fugitive they’re after is a cunning saboteur, innovative thief, and simply, way out of the crew’s league.  Return to Sender Trapped in subspace, the Atalanta Empress floats outside regular space-time -- and into the middle of a multidimensional smuggling operation.  Planetary Pursuit After ganking a job to finance their mission, the Atalan’s crew finds their destination on the auction block, and possibly on the brink of annihilation.  Grab the set today!",
