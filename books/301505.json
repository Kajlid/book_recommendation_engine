  "description": "When 17 year old Kaia was just about ready to enjoy her life in the wilds of the enchanted, yet dark city of Nocteraia, tragedy struckâ€”her mother disappears without a trace. A day turns into a week, and before long, an entire month passes before the authorities admit the disappearance has them stumped. On the verge of mental break, a grieving Kaia is visited by a woman who claims to know where her mother is and how to reclaim her.Desperate to find her beloved mother, Kaia joins \"The Fraternity\", an academy she quickly realizes is a coven of witches preparing for war against their perennial enemies:Vampires and Lycans. But as Kaia is given a mission to spy on a Lycan stronghold all by herself, an ancient Vampire is also there, and her circumstances take a turn for the worse.",
