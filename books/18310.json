  "description": "What is the \"gay Christian\" movement, and why is it now being accepted as an alternative lifestyle within many churches? Author and counselor Joe Dallas, in a loving and biblical manner, spells out what pro-gay theology is and how to confront it, then examines the believer's personal response and the need for bold love and commitment. He also gives detailed responses to the main scriptural arguments posed by the pro-gay movement, and evaluates the movement's impact on culture and the church.",
