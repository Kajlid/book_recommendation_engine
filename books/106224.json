  "title": "The Children of Gavrilek",
  "description": "Sailing aboard a storm-thrashed vessel from America to Cuba, a young woman (Audrianna) and her mysterious son (Devon) are shipwrecked and left for dead. They survive thanks to the mystical efforts of a small community located on the coast of 1920s Georgia. While in the care of this unique group and its beautiful and loving leader, Kendis, Audrianna comes to discover the secrets of her son’s cognitive powers, his (and Kendis’s) otherworldly origins, and an enthralling, Earth-changing “game” that threatens the existences of both the alien descendants of Gavrilek and the unsuspecting inhabitants of Earth. The key to the universe’s survival lies in the unraveling of Audrianna’s conflicted past and desires, as well as in the seemingly motley collection of castoffs that Kendis has nurtured and trained. Invigorated by mesmerizing prose and fervid imagination, The Children of Gavrilek weaves together world history, science fiction, and romance to unleash a powerful story of wrenching emotion and unexpected relevancy for today’s age. Its author is at the height of her narrative powers and her creation will keep you captivated from the opening pages until the last sentence.",
