The greatest storyteller couldn't have written me a better ending. The future looked so bright, at least it did until I found out Graham is missing.As I struggle to come back from an injury that should have killed me, my focus is now on just how worried I need to be that I'm stuck with an Archangel while my wife is off aiding in the search for the very person that could take her away from me forever. I might have been redeemed by the light but I still live in the darkness. Is it possible for me to change my true path or am I destined to always be the way I have been?",
