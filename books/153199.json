  "title": "Mocking Bird-Poetic Reflections on Life and Nature",
  "description": "If you have ever had occasion to live near a Mockingbird, you know that he starts singing in early spring. He begins by mimicking the notes of other birds he has heard, but as the spring goes on, he picks up other sounds including sirens, beepers, whistles, and other tones he regularly hears. Everyday he adds these new songs to his repertoire until he finds a mate. In August of 1999, the words ran from my pen as if I were a Mockingbird. This book is due to that spring of creativity, although it began in the summer. The poems herein are focused mainly on nature and partly on simple reflections on life in general. Finally, the rush slowed and the muse grew quiet. I had found a book. Mockingbird is a collection of simple rhymes meant for a minute of relaxation. You'll find little symbolism here and few, if any profound ideas. My hope is that these poems will leave you with a smile or a thought that will help carry you through the rest of your day.",
