  "description": "Heed the Call and Step into Your Power After years of intense training and international competitions, four-time All-American fencer Siobhan Claire was devastated to lose at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and her world came crashing down. Who am I now? she thought. Raised by immigrant parents, Siobhan felt intense pressure to excel, be a straight-A student, and achieve corporate success. Her Olympic failure was the start of something new, a journey away from people-pleasing and perfection seeking. She was now on the path to becoming a W.I.T.C.H., a woman in total conscious healing. W.I.T.C.H. is an encouraging and compassionate guide to self-exploration and spiritual awakening aimed at helping you build confidence and define what living a successful life truly means to you. Siobhan shares tipping-point personal life experiences, recounting how she stopped abandoning herself, connected with her intuition and psychic abilities, and discovered her sovereign and sensual self. With thought-provoking exercises and journal prompts throughout, W.I.T.C.H. will empower you to trust your inner wisdom, develop your own spiritual practice, and ultimately step into your divine feminine power.",
