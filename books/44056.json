  "description": "This edition is no longer available for purchase.Fiona Gavelle is living a dismal existence. She works in a dusty law office where she does more secretarial than lawyer work and her husband thinks she should work and keep house simultaneously. One snowy night, Fiona learns she has been unceremoniously booted from her crummy job, has the final argument with her spouse, leaving her no choice but to move in with her favorite aunt. With little else to do, she drives a friend to the funeral of a judge she saw at a reception. To her surprise she is hired to represent the estate, but before long, Fiona begins to discover things that donâ€™t fit. She blithely moves along trying to focus on building her own law practice until she is visited by the gravelly voiced Detective with big brown eyes.",
