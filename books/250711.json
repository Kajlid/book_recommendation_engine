But that kiss… That kiss was no joking matter. It was hot and wet. A hands-everywhere, breathless kind of insanity that left us both teetering on the brink.She’s got rules about dating guys like me… Rules I respect the hell out of when they apply to any other pro athlete. But as they apply to me? Well, those rules are about to be broken.",
