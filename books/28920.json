Temptation, seduction, story-telling and magic are used to lure the Sultan towards a climax which is designed to be simultaneously ecstatic and fatal.Featuring as it does sex with men, women, fairies and alligators, this strange little book will delight necrophiliacs, masochists, transvestites, eunuchs, ironists and lovers of beauty and ugliness everywhere.",
