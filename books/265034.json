  "description": "M/M Sci-Fi Romance. 28 year old Brendan Allnows knows what it’s like to lose everything – his family, his friends, his possessions…his world. And when he’s catapulted 4,000 years into the future by a freak accident, he must start to rebuild his very existence.  Ostracized by Lieutenant Joshua Mohl - the one person he wants to be with – he struggles to fit in with the rest of the men. But, when a dark enemy of the Reginians begins to take control from within, they must put their differences aside.  \nShatter\n is a steamy m/m Sci-Fi romance with a cliffhanger ending. There is military violence that may not be suitable for everyone, and also intimate scenes not suitable for readers under 18.",
