  "title": "Don’t Drink Your Own Kool-Aid: Using a Spiritual Guru to Win Your Ascension",
  "description": "A must for sincere spiritual seekers.No other book goes into such depth concerning the  psychological aspects of walking the spiritual path, using (not abusing) a guru and winning your ascension.This profound and personal teaching is a gift from the Ascended Master Guru Ma, who in her last embodiment was a public figure. Her name was Elizabeth Clare Prophet and she was the head of a world-wide spiritual movement and the author of many books.My sister Tatiana and I have each chosen to embrace this book and the teachings of the ascended masters coming through Kim  Michaels after experiencing deep personal connection with the  material. We can feel this way in loving respect and gratitude for the teachings of the ascended masters as brought through our parents in their lifetimes. – Moira Prophet SiskindThis book resonates with me not only because I recognize my  mother’s voice in it, but because it addresses many concepts I have often contemplated . . . This book left me with a wonderful, buoyant sense of comfort—a buoyancy I once felt as a child . . . It has the makings of a best-seller in the spiritual self-help category and will likely become a classic among serious spiritual seekers.– Tatiana ProphetWithin the first chapter I knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this book was indeed dictated by my very own Beloved Elizabeth! The tears flowed unrestrictedly down my face as I wept with  gratitude. – Dr. Richard Bartlett",
