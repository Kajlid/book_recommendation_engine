  "description": "His Love Life Was A Nightmare...Country singer Bradley Nelson always had big dreams. He's sure they're coming true until his debut album tanks, his record contract is cancelled, and his rock star girlfriend kicks him off her tour bus in Reno. Single and stranded, Bradley tracks down his IRS auditor-turned-casino-worker mom. But while he's looking for a shoulder to cry on, Mom's got problems of her own, namely a gang of thug casino owners who are trying to kill her for exposing their criminal deeds. Suddenly, Bradley and his mom are on the run-and they've taken a gorilla along for the ride...Until He Met The Woman Of His Dreams...Delphine Armstrong's dreams never included wearing a gorilla suit to work every day, but strange things happen when you're in Reno. Like the gunshot that whizzes past her just as she strikes up a conversation with a cute country singer. Delphine doesn't have time to ask questions-she and Bradley are too busy running for their lives! But while dodging bullets and side-stepping crooks, Bradley and Delphine discover that you can find passion when you least expect it-and that sometimes, real life can be even better than dreams.",
