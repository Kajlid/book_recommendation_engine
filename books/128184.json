  "description": "A straight man walks into a gay bar searching for meaning…It sounds like the start of a lousy joke. And honestly, that’s what my life is beginning to feel like. I look back at all the hateful things I’ve said and done—so many things I can’t take back—and I’m not proud. I let my ignorance steal my relationship with my youngest brother, Magnus. He and his husband, Sem, are now happily married with kids, and all I want is to be a part of their lives. But I need help to get there. Help in the form of a sweet man so open-hearted and optimistic that he’s willing to take on and teach a lost cause like me. Because I don’t know if people are truly capable of change. But the way Beau looks at me with his pretty eyes and cheeky smile, the way he openly shows me friendship, love, and affection…he sure makes me wonder, if a person can change, can they also earn forgiveness?",
