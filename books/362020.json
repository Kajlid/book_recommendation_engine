  "description": "Residential Construction Management will provide construction managers a concise and practical guide to managing residential construction projects.  One of the fundamental reasons residential contractors fail to prosper is that they are poor managers.  By presenting project management tools in their appropriate context of the project lifecycle—initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing—readers will more clearly understand the iterative nature of construction management, which is a key to successfully managing a construction project.  You can't afford to be without this indispensable working tool and its step-by-step instructions, project management templates, and real-world case studies.",
