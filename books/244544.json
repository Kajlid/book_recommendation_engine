  "title": "Death of an Ordinary Life",
  "description": "This story is a fictional tale that closely mirrors true events that have happened in my life; all of my teachers have expressed to me the importance of sharing the skills that I've learned from them. These skills and teachings primarily come from a Native American philosophy and they're not mine to posses or hold secret. My teachers learned it from their teachers, and the teachers before them and so on. Each generation passes down these skills with respect and reverence to those they feel guided to teach. I have been guided to share these skills in this way. My way is not new, as elders have passed down lessons to children in their tribes using true and fictional stories, thus empowering the lessons - this is the old tribal way of teaching. It is with great gratitude and honor to be able to share these skills and experiences with you. All I ask is that you treat the things you learn from this book with the utmost respect and reverence. The teachers that ensured these skills' survival went through a lifetime of dedication, impeccability, and selflessness. Welcome to the adventure.
