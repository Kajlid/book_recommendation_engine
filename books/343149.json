  "description": "Poking a sleeping bear with a sharp stick is foolish. Marty Edwards is about to be very foolish. Investigative reporter Marty Edwards has found her niche: cold cases. She loves pouring over old notes, hunting down long-forgotten witnesses, and digging down through the layers of an unsolved murder case. But this time, Marty is digging where someone obviously doesn't want her. And that someone might also include the Brownsville Police Department. Why else would they assign Detective Kristen Bailey to baby-sit her? Barely surviving two attempts on her life, Marty abandons Brownsville and the case. Danger follows her as the case turns red hot. With Detective Bailey along for protection, they race along the Gulf Coast, neither knowing who, if anyone, they can trust. The hardest part is learning to trust each other before it's too late for their hearts--and their lives. You'll hit the ground running with this exciting race of life-and-death from Golden Crown Literary Award winner Gerri Hill.",
