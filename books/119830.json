  "description": "Shattered and desperately in need of healing, Kera Van Brocklin has left one war zone only to find another awaits her at home. Her father’s funeral is only the beginning of a breach in her Michigan hometown’s peace as LGBT activists push for civil rights only to be stymied by a mysteriously funded “citizens” group. She doesn’t want to take sides, but has little choice: she is an out lesbian and her old friend Mandy is leading the charge for rights. Her feelings for Mandy, after all these years, only complicate her emotional stability. Her decision puts Kera further at odds with her twin, Deidre, whose marriage to a right-wing religious leader strains their once close relationship. With tension running high, the last thing anyone expects is a brutal murder—and that Kera is the prime suspect.",
