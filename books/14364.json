  "description": "On a dare, Kylie Matthews lands smack in the middle of Solomon's Gate'Castle Creek's new Christian dating agency'and she finds herself revealing exactly what she's waiting for in a \"The kiss that steals my breath away.\" What she doesn't reveal is her lack of self-esteem or her irrational reaction to facial disfigurement. Neither is applicable to her quest to find the perfect match. But that seemingly superficial malady becomes all-important when her first agency-arranged date is Rick Dale'a man who is everything Kylie is searching for. He's handsome, smart, fun. Rick has it all . . . including an angelic six-year-old daughter with severe scarring on one side of her face. Hard at work founding a therapy camp for young female victims of deformity or disfigurement, Rick wants Kylie to be a part of those plans. She'd love to say yes . . . but how can she, when every contact with the facility's guests'and Rick's own daughter'will make her violently ill? Kylie is ready to admit their relationship doesn't stand a chance, but she's forgotten that God makes a way where there seems no way.",
