  "description": "Victoria thinks she has it all-beauty, intelligence, and loving parents who equipped her with the tools necessary to make it in life-until a series of painful events turn her life upside down, making her an easy target for a covert government agency that has been searching for someone with her special skills. The Air Force Academy graduate separates from the military and returns home to Chicago, only to be blackmailed into accepting a job with life-altering consequences-on the her father's freedom and reputation in exchange for her services as a contract killer. Only her proficiency with weapons and uncanny survival instincts will be enough to overcome the perilous missions that lie ahead. It is with her spotter, Marcello Ferrari-former Navy SEAL, Italian heartthrob, and the man whom she entrusts with her life-that she must assassinate a series of high profile and increasingly dangerous marks, before her cover as a professional dancer is blown and the safety of her family and friends are threatened. As if her perilous new career and the associated psychological strain weren't enough, Victoria will have to fight for love, and ultimately discover she herself has become the target of a relentless psychopath.",
