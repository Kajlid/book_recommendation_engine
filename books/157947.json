  "description": "I’m a cold-blooded killer.Raised that way by a man named Ryuu after I was found unconscious on his doorstep when I was ten years old.I have no recollection of my former past, only that Ryuu took me in, raised me like a daughter, and trained me to become what I am today: a silent and deadly predator.Behind each seductive smile is a calculated plan on how I’m going to kill my next victim.Deadly with a gun and even deadlier with a blade, I spared no one.Except one man…A man who made me question everything I’d ever been told. Whose past was as mysterious as mine, and made me feel things I shouldn’t. Grady Tanner.",
