  "description": "“If you died tomorrow... what would be your legacy?” Death does not begin with the loss of the ability to breath, or the last beat of your heart. Cissy learns this as she takes us on an inspiring and eye-opening journey filled with love, friendship, laughter... and hope. This book is about the value of every moment of your life and fighting a good fight.Cissy is your typical hard working, single mother, who leads a very simple life. Until one day, when a cancer diagnosis has her spinning in circles. Not one to sit around and do nothing, and with years of experience in the medical field, she decides to research new medications and clinical studies on the Internet. Then all of a sudden, she hit a block wall. Why are the pharmaceuticals holding back ‘orphan’ drugs that have the potential to save thousands of lives? Why aren’t they conducting clinical studies on these medications? Why are the greedy insurance companies refusing to pay for these medications to keep people alive? Why is our government closing its ‘blind eyes?’ Cissy goes on a quest to find these answers. What she discovers is shocking. With an anger that leaves her cynical, and with time running out, she sets out to ‘right a wrong.’ She does the unimaginable... In this new age of technology... Hackers become a reality and a new Robin Hood becomes our hero!",
