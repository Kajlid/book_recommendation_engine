  "description": "\"If this works, it will let you live again.\" Those words convince eighteen year old Jamie Pepper to undergo a risky, experimental operation to treat the debilitating symptoms of early-onset Parkinson's disease. Within months his world is changed for the better. By the fall his college plans are seemingly back on track. Yet as Jamie enters the college world of classes, drinking, girls, and sex, visions from his past, and flashes from an unfamiliar present suggest that all is not as it would appear. Has Jamie been prowling in the night when he thinks he's been sleeping? And if so, is there now blood on his hands? On/Off follows a young man as he explores modern college life, the realms of the body and the mind, and the ways the past seems to sneak up and scramble even the most carefully plotted plans for the future.",
