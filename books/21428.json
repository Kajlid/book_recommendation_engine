She never let herself fall for a bad boy--now she wants to be a bad girl, and see what letting loose and having fun is all about. And sexy gambler Liam O'Rourke is just the kind of man who puts the \"sin\" in Sin City. . .And Definitely No ClothesLiam may look like a gambler, but that's only his cover story. A firefighter by trade, he's in town to investigate a string of fires in his friend's hotel, not to indulge his own desires. But he can't deny that the spark between him and Jane is a blaze from the moment they meet.
