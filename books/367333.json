  "description": "The sequel to A Strong and Sudden Thaw at last! The world after the Ice remains a dangerous place. Callan and David have survived the dragons but rebuilding lives is no easy task. When the army comes to their town to enforce an evacuation, Callan is suspicious about their claims of tainted groundwater and radiation. David feels he must join his family in defending town, even if rebellion means deadly force is needed. Tragedy strikes when the Brethren, a crazed religious order, seeks to control the new world through not only preaching intolerance but forced conversion and torture as well. Can the love between these young men withstand not only distance but betrayal?",
