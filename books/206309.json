  "description": "Everything you know is a lie...Terrified of the contamination and the creatures it has created, humanity hides behind The Wall. No one knows what lies beyond the wasteland. Maya has never thought much about what might still be out there, lurking in the forgotten places. But when she's thrust into the unknown, she is forced to question everything she has ever been told. Not everyone outside died, some of them became something...else. As her heart is torn in two, every choice she makes is harder than the last. What she discovers will change her forever. She knows she will probably die, but Maya has seen enough of death and she won't let it have her without a fight.",
