Take another journey with a vampire, through eight centuries of dark human history which have, all along, been leading him to the light.Volume I: Descent\"You continue to see the lie before you, no matter how often it speaks the truth!\" Valéry warned Angelina in On the Soul of a Vampire, when she refused once again to see in him the monster he saw in himself.
