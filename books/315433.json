Definition of a thirst trap: A sexy photograph, video or message posted on social media for the intent of causing others to profess their attraction.Thirst traps are meant to entice. To make women wish for something they can’t have.You’re not supposed to fall in love with one.In my defense, I didn’t mean to. It was just supposed to be one night of fun. One night where I could forget my responsibilities and family name. Where I could just be a girl in a bar.I didn’t expect the sexy small town cop to come sliding into my life on his knees. Literally. Or his dance moves to sear themselves into my memory. Or that kiss...To his millions of followers he’s Officer Sexy. To me he’s just Jake. The only man who has ever made me want more. The only one who has ever seen me for me.The man I wasn’t supposed to fall in love with.",
