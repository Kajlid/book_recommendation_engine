Having been shunned by his people because of a mark left upon him by his murderous father, Mani has never known the feeling of love or friendship. If he returns with the crystal, he may finally clear his name and gain acceptance among his people.The action never stops in this epic tale as Mani, with the help of his newfound sorcery and a handful of companions, battles a host of vile creatures he encounters along the way.
