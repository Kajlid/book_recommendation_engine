  "description": "Eric Holden is the hottest football player at Las Juntas Collegeâ€”and the straightest, but Abel Epstein never got the memo. He's always one step behind his white knight, with camera in hand, and no one's ever gotten in his way until Eric's best friend, Pacer Daringer, cast a shadow over Abel's happily ever after. Now Pacer has the little stalker in his sights, and he's determined to teach Abel a lesson. What he didn't count on was that Abel might like it.",
