  "description": "Points West by B.M. Bower is about the death of Cole Lawson's father and his attempt to ride east to conduct business with some notorious horse rustlers. Excerpt: \"The sheriff's right leg swung a leisurely arc over the wild-rose pattern stamped on the cantle of his saddle and dropped to the iron stirrup that dangled stiffly below the level of his horse's belly. The sheriff was a tall man, with wide shoulders and narrow hips, and blue eyes that sparkled rather startlingly in his leather-brown face.\"",
