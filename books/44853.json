  "description": "Venna Greer is a witch suffering from a case of magic-induced amnesia, making her think she's a normal girl. She lives in the sleepy town of Capeside, Virginia, with her foster parents and girl-crazy younger brother. Venna is secretly in love with her best friend, Henry Langley, and has a decision to tell him her feelings or not? But what she doesn't know is that Henry has a secret of his own. Henry Langley is a warlock, and his parents are members of the Council that rule the magical world. He's having a difficult time deciding which to confess to Venna his love, the fact that he knows who she is, or that they are on the brink of a war with the potential to expose them to humans. Time is running out. Venna is thrust into a new world. A world she once belonged to, and war that has more to do with her than anyone ever imagined.",
