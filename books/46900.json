  "description": "Lou's school year is off to a rocky start. Her BFF, Mina, won’t speak to her, but a new friend, Mary Emily, never shuts up. Lou's mom and her new boyfriend are madly in love, but all their smooching is starting to get on Lou's nerves. Meanwhile, a wrecking ball is smashing down the apartment that used to belong to her beloved Tristan. Lou still has a friend in Paul, if she can just work up the courage to write him a letter. Life was a lot easier when dressing up in her pink princess gown and going to the park for ice cream would solve any problem. Is it any wonder that Lou is down in the dumps?",
