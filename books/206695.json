  "title": "Critical Thinking: DontBeStupid.club Reveals 11 Principles for Problem Solving and Good Decision Making",
  "description": "Do you want to make some really great decisions? Do you want to make more of them, quickly and reliably? A normal life today is overloaded with information. There are way too many decisions to make. Good thinking skills are a requirement for making a great life.  We’re overloaded with information and we're overloaded with entertaining distractions too. We can follow the latest political outrage or celebrity getting out of bed this morning. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet available whenever you want it. But the overload of pet videos and celebrity butts makes it easy to become lazy thinkers. Funny sometimes, but it's mind-numbing. We simply consume. And everyone just moves along like a grazing herd, moving in the same direction, and not thinking about why or where it's going.  That may be OK for entertainment, but wouldn’t it be better to make important decisions for yourself? Who's really making the decisions that determine the quality of your life? Are they good decisions? Are they the best decisions for you?  Step away from the herd and Think for Yourself. Critical thinking is a powerful weapon in a stupid world. Good decisions make your life great.  Critical thinking makes your life better, whether you’re watching pet videos or discussing Proust. Some of those videos aren't even funny when you think for yourself.  \"...and in all countries fools outnumber the rest.\"  Better to be one of the smart ones.  Why not spend a couple of hours with us and make better decisions forever? HGJ",
