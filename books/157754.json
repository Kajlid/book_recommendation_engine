  "description": "You can’t have love without trust, so Lefty never looked twice at a woman. Betrayed at a young age, the only people he trusts are his brothers in the Dueling Devils motorcycle club. The boys took him in and showed him the meaning of family and loyalty. Then he broke his own rule and slept with the same woman more than once. She became a habit, and he got ensnared by the island beauty who ruled her strip club with an iron fist. The problem is, Gia’s not interested in anything serious. The minute Gia Hughes began to trust Lefty, she knew she was in too deep. The smart thing would’ve been to walk away, but the chemistry between them was too powerful. Then he started asking for more, and she was forced to run from the only thing she ever really wanted—a place to belong. The skeletons buried in her closet need to stay buried to keep her safe, but all too soon that decision is taken out of her hands.",
