  "title": "Bad Publicity",
  "description": "Glitz, glamour, and the grime this is Jackson Hardy's beat as he shills for the tabloid magazine Our Spinning World. Toss a ghost named Madame Blue into the mix, squeeze the special sauce out of a few forlorn celebrities, shake until buzzing, and watch that bad publicity bubble over. It's all part of the gig. Struggling to put on the air of an alcoholic and enjoying the scowls from his jealous officemates, Hardy wickedly cultivates the stereotype. It's an image he's grown fond of fanning the flames to create. But when that almost-forgotten tingle of journalistic integrity starts nibbling away at his comfortable routine, the muckraking master is soon wandering through underground tunnels, looking over his shoulder for hired goons, dodging buckets of ink, and questioning his place atop the tabloid throne. Can the man behind the magazine climb his way out of the pit he's happily been digging most of his professional career?",
