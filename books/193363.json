  "title": "The Spiced Pumpkin Village",
  "description": "Autumn is just an average girl who loves fall and pumpkin spice lattes. She, and her best friend Summer, get lost in the woods the night before Halloween. Autumn never imagined that magic could exist until she gets separated from Summer and finds herself transported to a village inhabited by pumpkin spirits. There, Autumn meets a pumpkin spirit girl named Curpepa and they fall for each other almost instantly. The pumpkin spirits mistake Autumn for one of their own and insist she hide in their village until All Hallows' Eve is over, as the veil between the spirit world and the human world is weakest during this time of year. The pumpkin spirits seem terrified of humans, so Autumn decides to let them believe she is a spirit. Eventually, Autumn is faced with the decision to reveal that she is a human to save Summer and risk losing Curpepa, or to continue her charade. Along the way in her adventure, Autumn learns to accept herself for who she is and what true friendship really means.",
