Having lost both her mother and aunt at a young age, she is raised under a heavy thumb by her grandmother, Cecilia, who doesn’t want to lose Lia to the same fate that cost Lia’s mother her life.However, like the witches that came before her, Lia has a curiosity about magick that is insatiable and which, in her opinion, her grandmother is taking too long to help her develop. That curiosity leads her to the Babineaux family grimoire, a spell book her abilities are nowhere near advanced enough to handle. Her amateur skills result in the rise of a demon, Seokjin, who bonds to her as her familiar; essentially the other half to her whole.Seokjin and Lia become close as the years pass, facing every threat head-on as a team and then, eventually, as lovers. Along the way, their team grows to include more witches, a gargoyle, a Fae, and even a vampire. With a legacy of power behind her, Lia unravels the path to a mystery that could help her uncover the truth behind her mother and aunt’s deaths, and despite a secret Seokjin is forced to hide from the woman he loves.An AMBW, BWAM interracial fantasy paranormal romance.",
