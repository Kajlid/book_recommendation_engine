  "description": "Having left Spain after the break-up of his marriage, Jacques Deza has allowed a friend to talk him into working for an MI6-like organisation run by the enigmatic Bertram Tupra. Deza's role is a seemingly innocuous one: he is to observe and comment on the behaviour of certain people. But watching and listening are not necessarily innocent occupations.If the first volume of the trilogy saw Deza questining the morality of his new job, the surprising events of the second leave him shaken to the core. In a nightclub scene that is a tour de force, Deza is forced by his spy-master boss Tupra to witness an act of shocking brutality. Is Deza somehow implicated in Tupra's unexpected behaviour? And will he be able to disentangle himself from a situation that is becoming increasingly disturbing?",
