  "description": "'With compassion and insight, Jane Foster examines how a perfectly happy family is pulled apart, not by the challenge of raising a young family far away from home, but by alcoholism. Leaving her husband in Tokyo and escaping back home to New Orleans with her children, thinking there is no other way but out, old friends show Lila that there is still hope if only she can learn to pray. Because when human strength is not enough, turning to God can make all the difference, as we find out in this touching account of one family's journey back to happiness.Below Sea Level won the 2013 Illumination Book Award bronze medal for fiction.",
