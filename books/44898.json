  "description": "Brigitta Skye has known more pain than most people experience in a lifetime. A withdrawn skeptic of life, she’s quickly slipping into silence as haunting memories bubble to the surface. But the scars on her arms and her heart are becoming more visible and when Jake, an overly-responsible guy comes into her life, she’s left with more anxiety than she can handle. She’d give anything to be whole again. Will she make it out alive?",
