  "title": "How Shakespeare Changed Everything",
  "description": "Esquire columnist Stephen Marche gives an expansive and exciting look at William Shakespeare’s pervasive influence on every aspect of modern culture—showing us how we can find Shakespeare even where we least expect him. In the spirit of Alain de Botton’s How Proust Can Change Your Life, Marche reveals how Shakespeare’s influence is everywhere—from politics to psychotherapy, broadway to botany, emo teenagers to outrageous baby names, even zoology (did you know it’s the Bard who is responsible for the starlings terrorizing New York City’s Central Park?). Fans of literary trivia and readers of Stephen Greenblatt’s Will in the World and Bill Bryson’s Shakespeare: The World as Stage will be captivated by Marche’s artful reading of how every day can bring a fresh reading of the Immortal Bard of Avon.",
