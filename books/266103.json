  "title": "Barracuda 945",
  "description": "He was one of the world's most skillful submariners, trained by the best in the business, the Royal Navy. Now, at the peak of his powers and skill, he finally comes into his own. For years, he has been a sleeper for the enemies of the West, now he has been given his orders and will carry them out with brutal efficiency, or die in the attempt. His target? The oil-supply lines that carry America's life blood from the frozen wastes of Alaska to the power hungry refineries of America's West Coast. His weapon? A lethal submarine, Barracuda 945, that he hijacks before setting off in search of the pipelines he will destroy. The Barracuda, like the shark it is named after, is swift, silent and deadly. Who can stop him? - only the Special Forces and the submariners of the West's navies, but only if they can trace him in the first place and eliminate him before he destroys the oil supply routes.",
