  "description": "His lips met mine again, this time in a slow, soft caress, conveying everything he had just said in those beautiful words that had reached my very soul. I could have drowned in that kiss. I could have lived there for eternity. It filled me up with everything I needed to survive. He gave me life through his lips and I treasured it.Recovering from recent losses, Lucinda finds herself in a Dark place. She starts to doubt who she has become. She seeks reassurance, that despite the Prophesy and what that has meant for her life, she is still remaining true to herself.The American Families of Vampires close in on Lucinda and her kindred. There is one who insists Lucinda is his and none other's. He has not forgotten her and will do anything, anything at all to make her his. Loyalties are tested and fall short, and Lucinda must find the strength to fight for something she cannot even remember. But, that is not all Lucinda must battle. The Queen of Darkness appears in amongst the mayhem to exact her plans for Dark's success and the final confrontation of Light and Dark comes to a head. Without the steadfast support and love of her kindred, Lucinda would not be able to face what is to come, but still she holds something of herself back. Will she never give herself completely to Michel? And if she does, will it be enough to save her? And enough to save the Light from the Dark once and for all?",
