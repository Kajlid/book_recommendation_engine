  "description": "Dr. Cheryl Barrett likes to think she got into medicine to help people… to save lives. While that may be true to a certain extent, the real reason has been chasing her since her father’s death. She’s just never been able to face it, and has never really wanted to. Tonight will not only test her as a doctor, but it will test her as a person. The world will change in an instant, and so will she...You see, for the next few hours no one will die and no one will be born anywhere on Earth. Stranger still, this begins at Midnight on Christmas Day, by time zone.Many people that by all accounts should be dead will not be. They will have no vital signs; no heartbeat, no body temperature, and no brainwaves...Technically not alive but obviously not dead they will walk, talk, and move like they always have...For the most part.Cold The End. More Dead than Human, more Human than Dead…",
