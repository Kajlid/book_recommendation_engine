  "description": "Wynter is anything but cold…  It’s Retribution’s last night in town, and band members Jaxon and Elijah don’t know what owner Nick Roman signed them up for this evening. They enter the double doors and meet the elusive Wynter, in the Champagne room at Takers Gentlemen Club.  Reserved for high rollers only.  Beautiful. Russian. Used to getting what she wants.  She’s calling the shots tonight, and tonight...  she wants them.  Warning: Seriously HOT Book. Contents may explode under pressure. Viewer Discretion is most certainly advised.  ***This erotic short story is approximately 4000 words, and is the first in a series of standalone one night stand erotic short stories. Due to sexual content, occasional scenes and references to/of violence, organized crime, language and frequent illegal drug use, we recommend this to mature audiences, ages 18 and over, who are comfortable with this subject matter, and not offended by graphic depiction of sex between consenting adults.***",
