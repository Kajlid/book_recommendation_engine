  "description": "The six-week New York Times bestselling history of the legendary six wives of Henry VIII--from an acclaimed biographer. \"Admirably succeed(s) in bringing to life the six women who married England's ruler. . . .\"--New York Times Book Review. 16 color plates. 32 pages of illustrations.In the popular imagination the unfortunate consorts of Henry VIII survive as feminine stereotypes; the Betrayed Wife, the Temptress, the Good Woman, the Ugly Sister, the Bad Girl, and the Mother Figure. Now one of our leading historians restores these women to human dimensions while unraveling the web of forces that raised them to the throne and sometimes brought them to the headsman's block.Under Antonia Fraser's intent scrutiny, Catherine of Aragon emerges as a scholar-queen who steadfastly refused to grant a divorce to her royal husband; Anne Boleyn is absolved of everything but a sharp tongue and an inability to produce a male heir; and Catherine Parr is revealed as a religious reformer with the good sense to tack with the treacherous winds of the Tudor court. And we gain fresh understanding of Jane Seymour's circumspect wisdom, the touching dignity of Anna of Cleves, and the youthful naivete that led to Katherine Howard's fatal indiscretions. The Wives of Henry VIII interweaves passion and power, personality and politics, into a superb work of history.",
