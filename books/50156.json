  "title": "Shapely Ankle Preferr'd: A History of the Lonely Hearts Ad, 1695-2010",
  "description": "What do women look for in a man? And what do men look for in a woman? And how and why has this changed over the centuries?Every week thousands of people advertise for love either in newspapers, magazines or online. But if you think this is a modern phenomenon, think again - the ads have been running for over three hundred years. From the first ad in 1695 from a young gentleman who 'would willingly Match himself to some Good Young Gentlewoman, that has a Fortune of ï¿½3000 or thereabouts' to the GSOH, WLTM and online dating of more recent years, each ad is a snapshot of its age. The result is a startling history of sex, marriage and society over three centuries - hilarious and heartbreaking by turn.",
