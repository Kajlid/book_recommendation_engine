Fourteen years after their childhood encounter, Lance returns to Keystone and finds that, through a mystical locket, they share an unnatural bond. Determined to uncover the secrets of the growing darkness within him and the mysterious bond he shares with Jade, Lance’s search for the truth reveals that the legacy of the vampire is written in his blood.

Bonded by a love forged from dark nightmares, Jade and Lance are flung into the whirlwind of a dangerous world that threatens both life and sanity and propels them towards a destination they cannot predict.",
