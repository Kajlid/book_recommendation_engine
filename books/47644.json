  "description": "The Bookworld’s leading enforcement officer, Thursday Next, has been forced into semiretirement following an assassination attempt. When Thursday’s former SpecOps division is reinstated, she assumes she’s the obvious choice to lead the Literary Detectives. But our banged-up heroine is no spring chicken, and her old boss has a cushier job in mind for her: chief librarian of the Swindon All-You-Can-Eat at Fatso’s Drink Not Included Library.But where Thursday goes, trouble follows, and pretty soon impressively engineered synthetic Thursdays called Day Players are not only waking up in the stacks, they’re downloading her very consciousness.In the meantime, the Next children face their own career hiccups. A little glitch in human history has forced the shutdown of the time engines, making Friday a might-have-been whose bright future in the Chronoguard has been replaced by a murderous one; Tuesday is unlikely to finish the Anti-Smote Shield in time to thwart an angry deity’s destruction of downtown Swindon; and Thursday’s third child, Jenny, still doesn’t exist, despite the memories that keep surfacing—and not just for Thursday.As our chief librarian stares down 100 percent budget cuts, the ever-evil Jack Schitt’s inexplicable interest in worthless thirteenth-century codices, and a love affair with painkiller patches, one thing is clear: Thursday’s convalescence is going to be anything but restful, in the New York Times bestselling series’ newest tour de force.",
