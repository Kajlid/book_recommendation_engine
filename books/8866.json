  "title": "Jesus + Nothing = Everything",
  "description": "Jesus + Nothing = Everything is the equation that Tullian Tchividjian took away from a year of great trial and turmoil. He describes the bitter divisions that soured the beginning of his pastorate at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church and the personal anchor that he found in the overwhelming power of the gospel. The book of Colossians forms the basis of Tchividjian's call for Christians to rediscover the gospel and continually reorient their lives around Jesus.",
