When a mysterious rebel group breaks her out, she must use her strength, speed, and skill to stay one step ahead of ACID and try to uncover the truth about what really happened on that terrible night two years ago. They’ve taken her life, her freedom, and her memories away from her. How can she reclaim anything when she doesn’t know who to trust?Winner of the North East Teenage Book Award \"Great suspense . . . excellent characters and gripping action.\"--TheGuardian.comFrom the Hardcover edition.",
