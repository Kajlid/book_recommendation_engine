She has grown to trust and even welcome the whisper, as it has encouraged and protected her. But, she wonders, is she crazy? Or is there more to it? Maikaâ€™s journey gets complicated as she realizes there is a man behind the whisper, residing in the shadows. Is she just a pawn in a larger game, involving magic and different worlds, or is she more than an ordinary girl?",
