  "description": "Redtails Hockey goaltender Shane Conrad had been having a great year…until recently. His slump couldn’t happen at the worst time. He needs to get his head in the game, not find a woman to screw with it. Until he meets Bliss Vescovi. She’s the perfect distraction—hot as hell in bed and smart enough out of it to realize their affair will end with the season.Bliss isn’t looking for a commitment, especially not from an intense, driven man used to control. Her ex’s need for control had nearly made her his emotional slave and she’s sworn she’ll never give another man that kind of hold over her again. But a one-night stand with a hot hockey player who won’t be around forever? Totally doable.Until Shane’s off-beat humor and killer smile get around the guard on her heart. And Bliss’s open warmth makes him believe the game might not be everything there is in life.When Shane gets called up to the NHL, Bliss believes she’s found the perfect excuse to break up and avoid heartbreak later. But Shane’s nickname isn’t Brick Wall for nothing. He won’t go down without a fight because he knows, no matter where he is, Bliss belongs at his side.",
