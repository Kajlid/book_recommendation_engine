  "description": "\"I'm so dead... if I don't find my sister soon, this may be the last day of my life.\" Almost sweet sixteen Skye Patterson is in a total panic, searching frantically for her younger sister, Starr, who disappears in the mall of all places. Autism combined with curiosity and mischief can label Starr more than just a handful. To face their uptight parents is another unbearable consequence, causing Skye's teenage declaration of independence to appear more and more dismal. Time may heal old wounds, but patience is not Skye's best quality. She is bound and determined to find a solution to save her family's oncoming disaster for which she feels responsible.",
