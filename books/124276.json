  "title": "An Evil Mind",
  "description": "In rural Wyoming, a man arrested in conjunction with a murder case turns out to have a trail of kidnappings, torture and brutal killings reaching all over the United States linking to him. The Sheriff quickly hands the case over to the FBI, but the man refuses to co-operate. In fact, the only words he will utter are 'I will only speak to Robert Hunter'. Detective Robert Hunter of the Los Angeles Robbery Homicide Division is just about to take his first holiday in over ten years. But before boarding the plane, he is summoned to Captain Barbara Blake's office, where an FBI Director has flown in from Washington DC just to speak to him. The case intrigues Hunter, but he has no idea why the man has asked for him by name, until he sees a photograph of the man in custody - a criminal behavior psychology graduate and his old university roommate - Lucien Folter. Someone Hunter knew well, or at least he thought he did. Could his old friend really have become a deranged serial killer? Surely there has been some mistake. For Hunter, there is only one way to find out. But it will stretch his abilities - and his grip on reality - further than they have ever been stretched before.",
