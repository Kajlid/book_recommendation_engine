  "description": "Slave to the Dream: Everyone’s Dream is a work of non-fiction written in the style of a memoir by author Gaylan D. Wright. Sometimes focusing on some tragic and/or surprising events that more sensitive readers may not wish to experience, this candid and honest account details the history of the author’s eighteen-year career with the Wyoming Highway Patrol. Discussing themes of the American Dream and the true measure of success in life, Wright takes us through the life of a trooper from training to tragedy and back again, with the idea that dreams are not always what they seem, for worse and for better.",
