Traveling back in time, his journey begins with the project rainbow Philadelphia experiment 1943, an experiment with radar invisibility that resulted in the disruption of the time/space continuum. The Nikola Tesla Philadelphia experiment ship, USS Eldridge, physically disappeared from its location in Philadelphia harbor, opening a rip in time that also dragged in an extraterrestrial spaceship.Zakeeraâ€™s mission, to rescue the pilot of that spaceship, leads him to discover a hollow earth entrance to the kingdom of Agatha Shamballa. His adventures in hollow earth Agatha ultimately require him to time travel into the future, where he finally realises the meaning behind the words of his mentor who, when sending him on this mission, told him that whoever discovers and controls the ARK, the Akashi Records Keeper, has the power to control the universe.",
