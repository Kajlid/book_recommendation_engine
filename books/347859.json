  "title": "The Reinvention of Moxie Roosevelt",
  "description": "Moxie Roosevelt Kipper has endured thirteen years of being an ordinary girl with an unordinary name. Now that she's entered boarding school, the time is ripe to reinvent herself. She'll become unusual, outlandish, unexpected, sassy - someone worthy of a name like \"Moxie.\" But who exactly? From Mysterious Earth Goddess to Hale and Hearty Sports Enthusiast; from Detached, Unique, Coolly Knowing Individual to Assertive Revolutionary Activist, Moxie tries them all, while keeping her true talent for piano-playing a secret. But at boarding school, Moxie isn't the only one who isn't what she claims to be.",
