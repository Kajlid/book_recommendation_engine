  "description": "CENTENNIAL EDITION“The Tarzan legend returns us to the Eden where, free of clothes and the inhibitions of an oppressive society, a man is able, as William Faulkner put it…, to prevail as well as endure.”—Gore Vidal, from the Introduction Set amid the vibrant colors and sounds of the African jungle, this classic work, rich in suspense and action, has beckoned generations of readers on a glorious journey to romance and pure adventure. This is the story of the ape-man Tarzan, raised in the wild by the great ape Kala, and how he learns the secrets of the jungle to survive—how to talk with the animals, swing through the trees, and fight the great predators. As Tarzan grows up, he makes many friends, including Tantor the elephant and Numa the lion. When this paradise is invaded by white men, Tarzan’s life changes, for in this group is Jane, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Speaking directly to our childhood fantasies, this exhilarating work takes us to that faraway place in our minds where dreams prevail, and where we too can be masters of our own domain. With an Introduction by Gore Vidal And an Afterword by Michael Meyer",
