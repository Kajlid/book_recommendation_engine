Oh, all right. I'll chase you if you like.\" He started to get up, changed his mind, and slumped back against the pillow. \"Only it's such a bother.\" Catherine Pelliston has just escaped a forced marriage to an obnoxious friend of her unreliable father; and now she's truly in the soup; kidnapped and helpless in a London brothel! And though she's been rescued by the very inebriated Max Demowery, Viscount Rand, she may be in even greater danger of falling in love with the shockingly outrageous, scandalously improper Viscount Vagabond!",
