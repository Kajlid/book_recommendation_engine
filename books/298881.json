  "title": "The Boatswain's Pipe: Boats, Boats, Boats",
  "description": "This is a story about a young man growing up in a small town in Ohio, how his life intertwined with the lake and how some people of that town made his life a living hell, all because he was, at one time, a commercial fisherman. It describes how politics played a hand in that outcome. This story also highlights some of his wartime experiences as a sailor in World War II aboard a Navy destroyer and how his life ended up when he returned home from war. It is a story about a man growing up and loving boats - rowboats, sailboats, powerboats, tugs, and ships, and also aircraft and diving. He's been there, done that! From seaman to captain, he sailed the oceans and the lakes. You will find this story not only interesting but also an epilogue of life for those who love the sea and boating.",
