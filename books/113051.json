  "description": "Bullies, threats, and the loss of friendship are nothing new to people who've come out of the proverbial closet. Most of us can't even begin to understand what that must be like. Reluctantly Exposed takes the reader through a first person account of being different in a society that doesn't appreciate those differences.Andrea \"Andy\" Clearwater is a sixteen year old high school student. She laughs a lot, she loves to dance, and she has a group of friends she thinks will do anything for her. But when they find out that she's been hiding a secret from them, they aren't shy about forgetting she ever existed.Andy's only crime against humanity is being straight in a gay world, but that's enough to bother the masses. Suddenly finding herself an outcast, she must tread the waters of uncertainty as she comes to grips with who she is and how it effects the way she lives her life and the people in it.Content Warning: Mild language and violence in some scenes. Contains mentions of rape and the after effects on one's psyche as a result.",
