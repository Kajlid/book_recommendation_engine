  "description": "Iris Hartman thought she’d finally gotten everything she’d ever wanted. She had her dream job of mayor of Premonition Pointe and was married to a handsome, charismatic man who adored her. But after finding out her husband was involved with a local drug dealer, she suddenly found herself single and forced to step down as mayor. Now she’s starting over. But when a curse hits Premonition Pointe and tourism dries up, turning the beach town into a ghost town, Iris will do anything to save the village she loves, even if it means leaning on a new man in her life. With the help of the local coven and a too-good-too-be-true neighbor, Iris’s new beginning means tapping into magic she didn’t know she had and maybe even learning to trust again.",
