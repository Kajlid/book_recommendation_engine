  "description": "It's been less than a month since monster hunter Morgan's last big case, and trouble is already rearing its ugly head. When Morgan's boyfriend makes a startling discovery about the bodies piling up around New York City, the two of them will have to venture deep into the land of the dead to find answers.  But they aren't alone. Old flames and not-so-old friends have come to play, and not all of them have the purest of intentions. Morgan's magic can blast through the undead, but will it be able to help the witch hold on to the last bit of family she has left?  Shadowlands is the fourth book of The Spire Chronicles urban fantasy series.  Shadowlands features a tough, spunky heroine, a hot hero, mystery, action, and adventure. Fans of Linsey Hall's Dragon's Gift series and Annie Bellet's The Twenty-Sided Sorceress books will likely enjoy this series.  Scroll up and grab your copy today!",
