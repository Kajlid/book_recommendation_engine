  "title": "A Connection to Lennon ?",
  "description": "Have you ever felt a real, deep connection to someone? Anyone? A well-known celebrity? Have you ever had a memorable dream in your lifetime that you've never forgotten? Read this short story and it will give you a chance to ponder these questions. Then decide whether the author had a connection to Lennon. That would be John, of course. This essay was intentionally written from the perspective and voice of the Author's daughter. The story is from her point of view. Originally, she was given an assignment from her high school English teacher to ask one of her parents if they had a 'Paranormal' event occur within their lifetime. And after her father said he did have such a mysterious experience; he wrote this short story. So, fasten your seat belt and take a ride along a journey where the daughter and father talk about the true events of Dad's possible connection to one of the most famous musicians of all-time. And, along the way, various celebrities emerge and add to the association. At the end, ask yourself - Was the Author connected to John Lennon? It’s up to you to decide. (View the cover after you've read the story and this may help you with your decision...) FYI - In December, 2020, the 40th anniversary of John Lennon's passing will occur. Thus, the reading of this essay may help you with either, more knowledge of this iconic member of the Beatles, or just some additional wisdom into the anthology of Beatles history. This story is dedicated to his legacy and all of Lennon’s great contributions to the world.",
