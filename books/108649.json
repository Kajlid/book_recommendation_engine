A note she finds with the body suggests the dearly departed had a secret rendezvous planned with somebody on the island. But when suspicion is cast on a fisherman Natalie believes to be innocent, she begins to wonder if the murder was the result of a lover's quarrel . . . or a lobsterman's disagreement gone horribly wrong. Includes recipes!",
