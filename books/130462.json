  "title": "Children of Africa: A Photographic Journey",
  "description": "The photographs are wonderfully raw and emotional as the authors let the camera, the situation, the subject and the emotion choose the shots. The result is startling! It is a unique marrying of wonderful photographs and tight and emotional dialogue. Raw, real, emotional, powerful and magnetic are all words that best describe the feelings that come through. This is also the result of the African children's tendency to 'emote' the situation and themselves - through their eyes.",
