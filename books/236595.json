  "description": "She needs peace and quiet. He's a distraction.She wants to be left alone. He's inevitable.She has a writer's block. He might be the cure.The only thing Jessica Slade wanted was some peace and quiet, and to finally finish her book. A place called A Drop of Paradise was supposed to do the trick. With its stunning sandy beaches, aquamarine waters, and tropical sunsets, it should have cured more than a writerâ€™s block. But when an unfortunate series of events left her stranded on a remote island with an overbearing, arrogant, but ruggedly handsome stranger, her life started to resemble the romance novels she has been writing.Broad-shouldered Mike Stone was irresistible, sexy, and cooler than a chilled mojito in the middle of summer, not to mention the perfect choice for the cover of her next novel. But not all the imagination in the world could have prepared her for what might happen between two strangers on a spit of sand when sparks started to fly, and anger turned into lust.A Drop of Paradise is the first book in the Bookworms & Alphas series. Each book is a standalone, though it is recommended you read the books in a chronological reading order.",
