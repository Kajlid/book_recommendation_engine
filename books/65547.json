Determined to enjoy summer before her (possibly) imminent demise, Nora plans a ten day backpacking trip with Iris and Wes. Her plans hit a snag when Wes's girlfriend tags along. Amanda is nice, so it's not a huge issueâ€”until she gets taken. Or rather, mistaken...for Nora. All because of a borrowed flannel.Now Raymond has a hostage. Nora has no leverage. Iris has a spear and Wes is building boobytraps. It'll take all of their skills to make it out of the forest alive.There are three problems: Someone is lying. Someone is keeping secrets.And someone has to die.",
