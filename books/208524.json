  "description": "Gavin McManus always knew he'd be a famous singer/songwriter. His disheveled good looks, confidence, and undeniable magnetism were the perfect combination to propel his band Rogue into the spotlight. But it's his wounded-rock-star mystique, born out of childhood trauma, that seals the deal.Sophie Kavanaugh was drawn to Gavin long before he found fame. Her own desire to be what he needed, to somehow be the one to fix him, lasted beyond what should have simply been a memorable school-days romance.Their reunion several years later happens just as Rogue has made a splash in the college music scene, and there's no turning back.Over the course of three more albums and the next decade, Rogue earns their place as the biggest band in the world, while Sophie finds her own career as a model. Gavin and Sophie exude the outward appearance of the perfect rock star/supermodel couple, but that fa√ßade is about to crack. At the same time, Conor, Gavin's best friend and the band's guitarist, struggles to contain his feelings for Sophie. When Gavin's secret is revealed, the ensuing media storm and backlash sends him into a downward spiral that threatens to destroy everything he's worked for, including his marriage, his friendships, and his band.Set against the globetrotting, glamorous worlds of rock music and high fashion, TANGLED UP IN YOU explores Gavin, Sophie, and Conor's tangled struggle to answer the questions that haunt them:What would you do for the love of your life?How much would you endure before protecting your own heart?Order of the Rogue Series:Tangled Up In YouPlaying At LoveHitting That Sweet Spot",
