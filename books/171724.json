Neither did they realize Eulalie would become so formidable, the male population would be too scared to darken their doorstep.But, while Eulalie makes it her mission to protect her sisters from men, she can't stop Brady Callahan, the saloon owner, from turning Susannah's head. Nor can she keep Harold Dawson, recently widowed, from stealing Lucy's heart. And when Richard Morrison comes calling for Eulalie, expecting courtship, marriage, and her love, Eulalie’s world is turned on its axis.As the \"Spinster Sisters\" tumble into romance, the people of Pikes Run might have to seek a new title for them. One of distinction and hope…The Miller Brides.",
