  "description": "Book 5 of 6: The Magic SequenceWith their father missing in action in Vietnam, Holly and her siblings end up in a time warp as they race to free their town from a witch’s curse When Holly, Judy, and Crockett Wade are sent to live with their grandparents after their father is declared MIA in Vietnam, Holly fears she’ll never fit in at school. The small town of Dimsdale, Massachusetts, is nothing like Boston. Even worse, Grandma and Grandpa Wade live in an overgrown house next to the town dump, a place without electricity or running water! None of the dishes match, and Holly’s grandparents are always bringing back other people’s odds and ends. But an old, smelly pillow embroidered with broken circles leads to strange dreams—and a maze in the junkyard! At first, when Holly and her brother and sister walk through an opening in the maze, they don’t realize they’ve entered another time. But they’re back in colonial New England, where they meet a healer named Tamar—and suddenly Holly is caught in the crossfire between dueling witches. Forced to keep their time-traveling a secret, the three siblings race to save Tamar and their town. Lavender-Green Magic is the 5th book in the Magic Sequence, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.",
