While visiting her estranged father, over four hundred miles away from her home in Pineville, Kentucky, Abby learns that the dead is resurrecting and attacking the living. Hell bent to get home to her mother, and boyfriend Conner, Abby is forced to make the journey home alone with her six year old sister Ava in tow.  Zombies are everywhere. Marauders are taking what they want and killing whoever gets in their way. And Abby begins to fear she may never make it home again. Realizing making the trip home alone isn’t going to be as easy as she thought it would be, she decides to join together with another group she comes across to better her chances of survival, and getting her and Ava home safely.  Nothing else matters but getting Ava home safely to their mother, and herself back in Conner’s arms. That is, until she meets Jeremiah.",
