  "description": "Eisner and Harvey Award-winning cartoonist Mike Mignola releases his fourth Hellboy collection, including the 1999 hit series Box Full of Evil, reprinted here with a new epilogue. Stories formerly available only in black-and-white-including Mignola`s contributions to the 1998 and 1999 Dark Horse Presents Annuals, The Right Hand of Doom and Pancakes-are presented here in color for the first time. The VÃ‚rcolac, Mignola`s contribution to Dark Horse Extra, is presented in a redrawn and expanded twelve-page version, and a new story, King Volmer, is printed here for the first time. On top of all this, Mignola shares his sketchbooks for the first time, showing readers the genesis of his personal take on the lords of Hell and other creatures.",
