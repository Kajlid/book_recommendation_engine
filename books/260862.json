And now that the queen is safe and the decrees against elementals have been lifted, all that's left is for him to return to the Guardians' Guild, where he will continue writing songs about events he's played no part in. But when Felix is kidnapped by the devastatingly handsome bandit king, he is thrust into the starring role of a terrifying and romantic adventure.",
