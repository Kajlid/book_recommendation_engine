  "title": "You and Your Aging Parent: A Family Guide to Emotional, Social, Health, and Financial Problems",
  "description": "First published in 1976, You and Your Aging Parent is a classic--the first book to shed light on the challenging relationship between adult children and their aging parents, illuminating the emotional, health, and financial difficulties that elderly parents and their children face during the senior years.Marking the 30th anniversary of this highly popular book, the new and revised edition addresses the changes that have taken place in the last three decades, but it still embraces the authors' fundamental insight--that the difficulties and challenges of the aging process are as much a family affair as in any other phase of life. Both a sensitive exploration of the dynamics of the aging family relationship (between parent and child, and sibling and sibling) and an authoritative how-to guide for seniors and their families navigating the practical problems of growing old in America, You and Your Aging Parent has been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest research findings and changes affecting older adults, including in health care and social services. The book also includes a running commentary by Bob Morris--playwright, author, and humorist--who provides insightful and entertaining observations about his trials and tribulations with his own parents as they aged, serving as acontemporary voice for the middle-aged caregiver of today.As the first of the baby boom generation turns 60 and their increasingly frail parents approach late retirement and final decline, this new and updated edition of You and Your Aging Parent will answer their need for authoritative, practical information about this major phase of life.",
