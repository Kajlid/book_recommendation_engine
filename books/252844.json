  "title": "The Complete Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh",
  "description": "In 1926, Winnie-the-Pooh, a collection of stories about a rather stout, somewhat confused bear, was published in England and America. The enchanting tales of Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Christopher Robin, and the others were an immediate success, and firmly established A. A. Milne, already an acclaimed dramatist, as a major author of children's books. Winnie-the-Pooh was followed in 1928 by the second collection, The House at Pooh Corner, which continued the adventures from the Hundred Acre Wood and introduced bouncy, lovable Tigger.Ernest H. Shepard's brilliant illustrations were based on real toys owned by Milne's son, Christopher Robin. The artist visited Cotchford Farm, the Milne country home in Sussex, where he sketched the child, the stuffed animals, and the surrounding countryside.The world of Winnie-the-Pooh is as popular today as when it was first created. Winnie-the-Pooh has appeared in twenty-one languages, among them Hebrew, Afrikaans, Esperanto, and Latin.This deluxe volume brings all of the Pooh stories together in one full-color, large format book. The texts are complete and unabridged, and all of the illustrations, each gloriously recolored, are included. Here are the beloved stories of Pooh stuck in Rabbit's doorway, of gloomy Eeyore and his nearly forgotten birthday, of playing Poohsticks on the bridge, and so many more.Elegant yet simple, whimsical yet wise, this classic edition is a book to savor and treasure.",
