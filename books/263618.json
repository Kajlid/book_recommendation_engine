  "title": "You Misspelled Christian: How To Bring Heaven To Your Current Circumstances",
  "description": "Watch out! It’s a Christian!                             Does the word “Christian” make you—or everyone around you—cringe? The instant you tell someone you’re a Christian or go to church, a million negative associations often zip through their hypocrite, narrow-minded, bigoted, anti-science, racist, sexist, or worse. What about authentic? Loving? Forgiving? Compassionate? How did the idea of what it means to be a Christian become so distorted in the modern church culture that we’ve lost sight of its original purpose—to live as Jesus Christ did?   Pastor and author Rob Shepherd takes a humorous, but poignant look at how the focus of Christianity has shifted to be more self-focused, rather than Jesus-focused, and takes readers back to the essentials of Christ’s original to love God and love others! With practical life lessons and relevant spiritual insights, Shepherd offers relief for those weary of the “Sunday morning march” and want to experience a true renewal of the heart and soul and restore the original definition of what it means to live as a follower of Christ.",
