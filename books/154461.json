  "title": "For the Love of Mohammad A Memoir: With Mohammad Khordadian",
  "description": "The memoir of two young dancers from vastly different cultures, tells of their ill-fated marriage during Iranâ€™s Islamic Revolution. For several years Mohammad and I had wanted to write about a significantly dramatic part of our personal journey through life. We eventually put pen to paper after meeting up again in England. 'For the Love of Mohammad A Memoir' is a true story of love and all its complexities. It is also the story of a young English girl living in a Middle Eastern country which is torn apart by an Islamic revolution and war, and the story of a young Iranian man struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality after being manipulated into marriage whilst being deeply in love with another man. Mohammad and I feel our story is also more than just a story of our love. As the world continues to struggle with human rights issues, in particular the human rights of the LGBTQ communities in such countries as Iran, Uganda, Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Russia and often in our own backyard; Mohammad and I believe that our story speaks out for those who have their voices silenced; contributes to the awareness of their situation; and carries with it a message of hope and courage by demonstrating how, with the power of love, courage and understanding, life's adversities can be overcome.",
