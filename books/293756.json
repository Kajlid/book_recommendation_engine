  "description": "If people have polar opposites, Luca Rossi is mine.His butt is in the baseball hall of fame. Mine’s comfortably seated in the hall of lame.When he’s not snagging fly balls out in center field, he’s modeling in shampoo commercials. I once jammed my own finger while stirring cookie dough, and sometimes I forget shampoo is a thing.He’s a total cynic when it comes to love.I make a living writing love stories.But after my latest broken engagement (no, I don’t want to talk about how many times that’s happened), it’s clear he’s exactly the man I need.If anyone can teach me to be the opposite of me, it’s him.The first thing I want him to teach me?How to not fall in love.And as luck would have it, he’s in desperate need of a fake girlfriend to get a meddling grandmother off his back.We couldn’t be more perfect together, because the last thing Luca Rossi will ever be is the next man to leave me at the altar.Or will he?Real Fake Love is a line drive straight to the heart featuring a grumpy athlete, a jilted bride, a fake relationship, and the world’s laziest cat. It stands alone and comes complete with sibling rivalry, the world’s most awkward shower scene, and a sweetly satisfying happily ever after.",
