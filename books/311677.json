  "description": "Hellhound shifter. Hardcore gamer.I’ve been in hellhound training with my brothers all my life. Now I’m ready to step outside of my bubble at the academy and actually implement my training for real—even if my boyfriend just broke up with me.Whatever. Time to level up!There are cracks in the world. Condemned souls are slipping out of Hell through those weak points, coming out to play in the realm of the living. As a hellhound shifter assigned the role of Protector, it’s my job to keep the streets safe. No problem. I’m happy to jump into the fray, even if it’ll be a real drain on the gaming time.Also, someone or something is trying to get into Hell. Weird. I mean, who would actually want to go there? Souls always want out, not in.Busy days ahead.Throw into the mix an extremely flirty human bartender I can’t get out of my head, along with a fellow hellhound setting my pulse racing, and the chances of ever getting my elf wizard to level 50 are slipping away.Hellspawn is the first volume in an Urban Fantasy series packed with action, adventure, and a slow-burn MM Ménage Romance. Get ready to meet a buff and geeky hellhound shifter, a delicious human barman, and a tempting hellhound colleague with muscles for days. There's a whole host of nasties causing drama, and not enough gaming going on.This book is not a standalone.",
