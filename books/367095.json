Worse yet, she doesn’t even remember her relationship with the Lord. Despite Jeff’s devotion throughout her recovery, Marnie begs him for an annulment. Then his mother-in-law suggests the unimaginable—that he move out and begin courting his wife as if they had just met.Can Jeff win Marnie’s heart all over again?
