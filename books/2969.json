  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Cowboy Romance, M/M] Billy Thornton is a known troublemaker. He's spent the better part of his life doing whatever his brother Clem wanted him to--from intimidating people to stealing from them. The consequences if he resists are life-threatening. Billy has spent more than one night healing after his brother got pissed at him. The one thing Billy can't do is allow Rourke Blaecleah to be hurt. Billy has loved Rourke for as long as he can remember, even though he knows it is wrong. The only way he can deal with it is to do everything in his power to keep Clem away from Rourke, and that means putting himself in harm's way more than once. When Rourke corners Billy one night and kisses him, things come to a head. Rourke realizes that the man he has been looking for all of his life is right under his nose. Billy finds that he might actually be able to experience what loving Rourke is like in real life and not just his fantasies. And both men realize that what they have found together has put their lives in danger because Clem is coming for them, and he's not happy. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
