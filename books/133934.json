  "title": "Following the Front: The Dispatches of World War II Correspondent Sidney A. Olson",
  "description": "This is a primary source on World War II, which contains the unedited dispatches and personal correspondence of an American reporter embedded with the US Army in Western Europe from 1944 to 1945. His writings capture the human story of the war in Europe in a way that hits on many big themes such as combat, the Holocaust, strategic bombing, the home front, the collapse of the Nazi regime, and the refugee crisis. His firsthand account of the liberation of Dachau is a moving reminder that the world was unaware of the horrors of the holocaust until he and other reporters provided these dispatches.",
