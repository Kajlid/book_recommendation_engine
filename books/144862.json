  "description": "Hi, I’m Damien Wulfman. Single, Gemini, emotionally available. And trying really hard to prevent a bloodbath in the streets of Orlando.Just because I live in the most magical place on Earth doesn’t mean all that magic is kind. It’s a full-time job keeping mundane humans from getting eaten, enchanted, or enslaved by the supernatural world. Luckily for me, most creatures just need one good whack of my charmed bat to keep them in line.That’s until the local vampire clan decided to open a nightclub in the middle of the touristy part of town. And during peak tourist season, no less. The art of secrecy seems to be lost on them as people begin to go missing around their club.As an Enforcer of the Balance, this means I need to step in. The vampires don’t take too kindly to someone like me poking around, asking questions, and accidentally uncovering their evil scheme to create an army of bloodsuckers to overthrow my boss!I either need to come up with a plan or ask for a raise.Fans of “Junkyard Druid” by MD Massey and “Chronicles of Nick” by Sherilyn Kenyon will enjoy “Unbalanced & Unprepared” by Wes Cambron.",
