  "description": "A doctor by day and vampire by night, a Beta of the North American Werewolf Pack, and an arrogant, Nordic Pure Blood have one troublesome thing in common: a black-haired spitfire virgin named Renee. Renee doesn't have time for overbearing men and romantic relationships, not when she's juggling college, butting heads with an overly intrusive family, and waiting tables at Six Feet Under. What Renee needs is a decent night's sleep. Unfortunate for her, peaceful nights aren't coming anytime soon. Dreams from a haunted past drive a terrifying wedge in her future, and the exhaustive years of nightmares have only begun. Can the love and protection of three males change that? It's a given. Primal instincts redefine themselves, because they must, and instead of taming their beasts, the trio will have to tame their mate instead.Erotic romance M/F/M/M menage amour. Vampires/Gothic BDSM Play, mild exhibitionism, spanking, and suspense.",
