  "title": "Egyptian Divinities: The All Who are the One",
  "description": "This brief examination of Egyptian religion, as opposed to mythology, argues that the ancient Egyptians believed in only one god and that each of the many divinities were created to represent or symbolise different aspects of that one supreme deity. Gadalla examines the role and symbolism of each god or goddess in turn, highlighting their place within Egyptian theology. Each divinity is illustrated.",
