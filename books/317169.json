  "description": "WESTLYThe fall from NHL superstar to domestic disaster was swift and painful. When I became the legal guardian of my five younger siblings, I had no idea what I was doing.One year later, I’m still lost.Coaching CU’s hockey team might be the only thing I’m excelling at. But when our star forward is failing math, I have to do what it takes to keep him on the team. Even if it’s going head-to-head with Jasper Eckstein.One minute I’m confronting the notorious hockey-hating professor, and the next I’m agreeing to be his date to his twenty-year high school reunion. I don’t know how that happened.JASPERMy rules are simple. I don’t give extra credit. Ever. No matter how entitled jocks think they are, I refuse to give them special treatment. It's not because I hate them. It's not because a hockey player broke my nose in high school. It's fair. But when Westly Dalton bursts into my office like a hurricane, all my principles fly out the window. Suddenly I'm giving extra credit.And I have a date to my reunion. After one explosive night together, I want more, but his home life is a mess, and I don't want to get in the way. If all we can have is quick thrills, I’m okay with that.It’s not like I could ever fall for a jock.",
