  "title": "Classic Feynman: All the Adventures of a Curious Character",
  "description": "An omnibus edition celebrating a great scientific mind and a legendary American original including a live recording. Richard Feynman (1918-1988) thrived on outrageous adventures. In the phenomenal national bestsellers \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\" and \"What Do You Care What Other People Think?\" the Nobel Prize-winning physicist recounted in an inimitable voice his adventures trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek, painting a naked female toreador, accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums, solving the mystery of the Challenger disaster, and much else of an eyebrow-raising, hugely entertaining, and astounding nature. One of the most influential and creative minds of recent history, Feynman also possessed an unparalleled ability as a storyteller, a delightful coincidence celebrated in this special omnibus edition of his classic stories. Now packaged with an hour-long audio CD of the 1978 \"Los Alamos from Below\" lecture, Classic Feynman offers readers a chance to finally hear a great tale in the orator's own voice.",
