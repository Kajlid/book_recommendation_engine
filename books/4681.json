  "title": "Forever Ours: Real Stories of Immortality and Living from a Forensic Pathologist",
  "description": "Forensic pathologist Janis Amatuzio first began recording the stories told to her by patients, police officers, and other doctors because she felt that no one spoke for the dead. She believed the real experience of death - namely, the spiritual and otherworldly experiences of those near death and their loved ones - was ignored by the medical professionals, who thought of death as simply the cessation of breath. She knew there was more. From the first experience of a patient in her care dying to the miraculous \"appearances\" of loved ones after death, she began recording these experiences, knowing that they would bring comfort to anyone who has suffered the loss of someone they love. Written by a scientist in approachable, nonjudgmental language for anyone who has lost someone they love, this book offers stories that can't be explained in purely physical terms.",
