  "description": "Blake The first thing you learn as a kid is 'stranger danger', but they don't tell you what to do when a tall, tattooed, dangerous man shows up out of nowhere. I know I should make him leave. He's surely capable of fending for himself, but it's the middle of winter, the roads are icy and around these parts that can mean a death sentence. I don't have any other choice but to help this handsome stranger. My heart has been broken one too many times, and I've refused to let anyone back in. Can I keep this man from melting my heart with his charm, or will it be as frigid as it was yesterday? Today is Valentine's after all, and stranger things have happened.",
