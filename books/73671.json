  "title": "A Beautiful Liar",
  "description": "Maggie West has endured the worst luck: abusive relationships, cheating husbands, an emotionally-destructive mother, a daughter’s bout with cancer, and a slew of last-resort jobs. A natural giver, she loses herself in others to the brink of numbness, isolation, and disillusion. However, when she joins a social network to fight her loneliness, Maggie encounters a beautiful man – who is full of lies. As a game, she allows herself to be willfully deceived, and in the process, she gets wrapped into an experience that awakens her mind, body, and sexuality in ways she never imagined possible.",
