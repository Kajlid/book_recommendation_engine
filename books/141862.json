  "description": "Stress accumulates when we don’t feel that we have the time, skill or energy to complete all of the tasks that have been assigned to us. Appropriate Detachment helps us realize which tasks we should tackle first and allows us to focus on them with our whole being. Without the distractions of other tasks roaming around in our mind we can be so much more productive. Just let them go.\tThis book will help you to analyze the aspects of your life that are causing you stress and anxiety. It will give you the tools you need to be more tolerant and calm in the face of mounting workloads and a seemingly impossible schedule of tasks that need your attention. Appropriate Detachment will help create a more efficient you, capable of untold productivity and creativity. But what is it?Analyze your life or an aspect of it and find something that is outside of your \tcontrol.Instead of worrying about that aspect, or planning for it, or making lists to compensate for possible outcomes, just simply let it go. Erase that item from your mind. You can do nothing to effect its outcome, so do nothing. This frees up your mind to tackle tasks that you can actually affect.So once again: Identify something that you cannot control, and just let it go.\tAspects of our life are rarely completely out of our control or fully under our control. It is then up to us to determine where in life we can best apply our finite energy and brainpower, to make the greatest impact.\tThis book was designed to be a small investment of both time and money so that it may be easily read, shared and understood by as many people as possible. This book will give you the tools you need to be able to analyze your life and streamline things that were causing you stress. \tIf we walk around this amazing world of ours assuming that we know everything, our minds won’t have any room to learn anything new. Many questions have a multitude of correct answers and it is only by exploring all of the possible answers that we will ever truly understand the question.\tWe live in a global community now and it behoves us to be more accepting and understanding of foreign concepts. Use the wisdom of the world to inform your daily life. Stand on the shoulders of giants and drink from the pages of world history.\tThis principle snowballs until you find the ideal you. Someone who is physically fit and eats healthy, therefore has a lot of residual energy. Someone who has studied the cultures of the world, yet keeps an open mind so that they can learn from every conversation and from every new person they meet. Someone who isn’t plagued by worry or fraught with stress about things they have no control over. \tYou may not even be able to picture yourself as this person, depending on your starting point, but you can get there. At the very least you can get a lot closer to there, than where you are now, and improvement is the name of the game.\tImagine a world full of calm people who analyze their environment and decide the best course of action rather than making snap reactions based on hatred and greed. Imagine what we can accomplish as a collaborative whole. What could we accomplish if we stopped opposing each other and instead focused that energy on working together?\tWhat indeed?",
