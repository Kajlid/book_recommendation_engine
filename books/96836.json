  "description": "She’s alive but he’s dead…Living Dead Lovers follows the life and times of famed psychic-medium half-Romani gypsy Valentina ‘Cabbage’ Moone, from her mute infancy trawling the roads of Europe to a fiery-tongued, hard-drinking, speed-loving clairvoyant with a complete disregard for human life, including her own of late…Psychic medium Cabbage brings forth more than she can chew with a womanizing dead racing-car driver, Marty ‘Magma’ Molloy, who doesn’t want to give up the chase. Unfortunately, Cabbage has always possessed a sick fascination for deviants and perverts which she blames on her unconventional bohemian quasi-gypsy upbringing.A twisted love-affair never meant to be.

Romantics call it the yin-yang love between being and human being, light and oh so very dark.And her guardian angel Mr. Brick Shithouse makes it even more complicated…",
