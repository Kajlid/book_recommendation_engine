  "description": "I always get what I need. Even if I have to take it.   I have more connections than the internet. I do whatever it takes to get information for the Bad Disciples MC Break an arm. F*ck who I need to. I always keep my emotions in check. Especially after Sage left. But when she comes back into town, feelings come rushing back. I can’t seem to keep my hands off of her. When Sage sees first hand what the Dragon Knights are doing to women, she wants to help the MC. But I refuse to let her get involved. It isn’t safe for a girl that looks like Sage to take on the rival club. But Sage doesn’t like to take no for an answer. How do I keep her safe, when I am the one that keeps pulling her back in?",
