  "title": "The Bipolar Advantage",
  "description": "The Bipolar Advantage is about recognizing all of the aspects of the bipolar condition. Wootton readily admits that \"Advantage\" is not the typical interpretation of bipolar. Based on his Bipolar in Order Seminar that he has developed over the past two years, it focuses on the positive approach to the bipolar condition. It is about coming to an acceptance of yourself while striving to become a better person. Learning to use Introspection to become aware of who you REALLY are and learning to change your habits in order to accentuate the positive aspects of the bipolar condition while minimizing the negative. Turning bipolar into an advantage is accomplished by creating a vision of who you want to be and putting together a plan to follow that will get you there; as is done by every successful business in the world. As a successful professional and someone who was misdiagnosed for years, Wootton has personally experienced the good and the bad of this condition. Leading a DBSA group and teaching the Bipolar in Order seminar has put Wootton in touch with the personal stories of many bipolar people and their families. This positive approach with tools and skills for improving life will be of help to everyone, both those with bipolar and those who love and support them.",
