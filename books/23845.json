The Labyrinths of Echo series --the adventures of Max, who was once a loser but discovers a new world --has been an international literary sensation since its debut.

He travels to the parallel world of Echo, where magic is commonplace and where he fits right in. Plunging back into the astounding and absurd realm first portrayed in The Stranger(Fandomania.com's #1 Book of 2009), this is a sequel of addictive power, blending fantasy, horror, philosophy, and comedy. Readers will welcome this \"utterly original\" (Bookslut) volume of the new adventures and misadventures of Sir Max in this enchanting world.",
