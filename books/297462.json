Two people who are inexplicably drawn to each other even though they have almost nothing in common. TaylorJust when I thought I was destined to die in a foreign country after being kidnapped while doing a geological exploration, a mysterious rescuer shows up just in time to save my life.Unfortunately, my liberator also happens to be the co-CEO of Montgomery Mining, my employer, and a billionaire with an attitude.At first glance, Hudson Montgomery seems like the quintessential gorgeous billionaire with plenty of money to burn, and no concern for anyone but himself.The arrogant billionaire I could handle, but I wasn't quite so sure how to deal with the amazing guy I discovered once I looked past the superficial exterior. The one who stayed by my side as I recovered mentally and physically from the trauma of being a hostage.There was so much more to Hudson than just billions of dollars, a prestigious last name and a very handsome face.When the white-hot chemistry between the two of us finally explodes, do I trust the man I've come to know, or do I accept that Hudson Montgomery is the same guy the rest of the world sees?",
