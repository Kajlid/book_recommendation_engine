Seamus Finn is a bar owner, a single father of four and the center of the Finn family… And he hasn’t been with anyone since his twins were born. An all-expense paid trip to Ireland for a firsthand lesson in brewing beer turns into a different kind of holiday as Seamus rediscovers things about himself—and his sexuality—that don’t fit into the carefully controlled balancing act his life has become.  Giving in to a fling is one thing, but when risk-taking, over-the-top billionaire Bellamy Demir follows him home and meets the family things may get crazy… But crazy might be just what Seamus needs.",
