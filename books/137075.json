  "description": "Four days until the Election. Natasha Biron knows this is her last chance. Losing this Election means losing the war - and her life. Officer Aaren Jemmer diligently works to lockdown Haline and ensure Natasha's failure, another special assignment he'll use to keep his secret safe. Archives employee Joaquin Deva is wrapping-up at the office before a holiday with his girlfriend - until an unexpected discovery drives him to abandon everything in his near-perfect life to find the one person who can help him: Natasha Biron. Over the next four days their paths collide, shattering their realities as they each discover the lies they've been living and the unthinkable truth they share. Haline is a stark look at a post-climate change future, a world licking its wounds after decades of war and famine in which resources are scarce and government tyrannical. It is the answer to the troubling and timely question: What if we do nothing?",
