  "description": "\"NOT GUILTY is a compelling, engrossing, and ultimately uplifting and rewarding read. I couldn't tear myself away!\" —Cheryl Rainfield, author of Scars, Stained, Hunted and Parallel Visions.  A blood-smeared knife. One young man’s word against another. A lifetime dream crushed.  The evidence points to Devon Carlyle. He was there when it happened. Everyone knows he had it in for Renzo Costa. And Costa says Devon was the one. In the judge’s rap of a gavel Devon’s found guilty of assault. The star of the Oceanside High’s basketball team loses his shot at the one thing he’s worked so hard for—the championship game where college scouts could see how good he is.  Now he makes his great shots in Juvenile Hall with kids far different from those that have always been in his life. Angry? Hell, yes.  He’s bent on finding who did the crime. He’s bent on making them pay because he’s Not Guilty.  But can he prove it?",
