  "description": "Ça va mal. Ça va pas bien.What would he do to get her back? ANYTHING.Take a journey into the exotic culture of bayou country in Louisiana's Lafayette and Acadia parishes. Cajun beauty, Angelique Bellefeuille, has had enough of bikers and their bullshit. Being put in danger because of her father's motorcycle club makes that conclusion rock hard solid. When she's sent to an allied club for protection from a rival club, she's reunited with her childhood friend, Just Batiste. Only he's not the cute, fun, adventurous kid she remembers. He's large, in charge, and menacing. The last thing Batiste needs is a distraction from the new joint venture with the SSMC, but Fate has her own sense of timing and her own sense of humor as well. Angel is partly his memory of her as a little girl and partly grown woman walking around in the mind-numbing form of a curvy, blue-eyed mischief maker. Just when he thinks he can't get more frustrated with the little troublemaker, she's kidnapped by the very people he's supposed to be protecting her from. What will he do to get her back? Anything. Distraction or not, he vows she'll be returned unharmed or he'll personally initiate Armageddon.",
