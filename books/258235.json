  "description": "From the author of the #1 bestseller The Man Who Listens to Horses\"Monty Roberts will make you marvel.\"— The New York Times Book ReviewIn The Man Who Listens to Horses , Monty Roberts revealed the depth of communication possible between human and horse. Touching the hearts of more than four million readers worldwide, that memoir—which spent more than a year at the top of The New York Times bestseller list—described his discovery of the \"language\" of horses and the dramatic effectiveness of removing violence from their training. Now, the world's most famous horse gentler demonstrates how his revolutionary Join-Up technique can be used not just for horses, but as a model for how to strengthen human relationships.With vivid, often deeply moving anecdotes, Roberts shows how the lessons learned from the thousands of horses he has known can provide effective guidelines for improving the quality of our communication with one another—from learning to \"read\" each other effectively, to creative fear-free environments, and, most importantly, teaching belief in the power of gentleness and trust.",
