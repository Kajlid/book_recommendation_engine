  "description": "Oregon, 1895Assassin. Outlaw. Thief. Flames, terror and falling into an endless darkness are all Hunter North can remember. When she wakes up, her memory is gone. In her reflection, she finds a stranger. In the tales her father weaves, she finds one of America’s most wanted criminals. Horrified at her identity, and the newfound knowledge that she is the daughter of an even more infamous outlaw than she is, Hunter wonders how she ever got mixed up in the wrong crowd. Wonders how she’ll ever escape and find the truth of her identity. But her father made it abundantly clear the night she tried to run the first time…if she attempts it again, he will find her, and when death finally comes…it will be a sweet relief. But when the choice is taken from Hunter and she is forced to run to keep her life, her world collides with the man who holds the answers her memory has long hidden—the man who has been hunting her down for years—the bane of her existence, but very likely, her only hope—U.S. Marshal Ethan Fellows.",
