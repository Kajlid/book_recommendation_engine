  "description": "The Zookeeper’s Daughter is the journal of Lori Space Day, a third generation zoologist. Growing up at Space Farms Zoo and Museum in New Jersey has given Lori a lifetime of unique stories about individual animals and many animal-related adventures. Her unusual lifestyle has enabled her to work with numerous different species from lions, tigers and bears to otters, opossums and squirrels. The Zookeeper’s Daughter is an ongoing story of a working zookeeper. Stories of daily animal care, medical procedures and infant care are peppered with humor and full of information on many different species. Animals escape or get sick and, yes, tragically, some die. A privately owned, family-operated zoo, the Space Farms Zoo and family have dedicated their lives to the conservation of wildlife. Through this unique animal autobiography, Lori is able to give the reader a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes activities at the zoo.",
