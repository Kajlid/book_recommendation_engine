  "description": "As Cameron and Selena learn more about their ancestry, they discover that by connecting to their pasts, they are already becoming more powerful, even without the aid of Lugh’s Spear or the Dagda’s Cauldron. But Cameron refuses to consider a future on the pantheon of the Tuatha Dé, and Selena cannot imagine a future without it.  Meanwhile, their secret has been revealed to all, and it’s no longer just the New Pantheon they have to evade. The Norse, the oldest rivals of the Tuatha Dé, know the prophecy that ties Selena to the future of their enemies, and the easiest way to defeat them is by killing her. But the Otherworld remains the prized treasure for all of the gods, and one outcast in particular has set his sights on overthrowing the Irish alliance on the eve of Samhain.  In the second book of The Unbreakable Sword series, Selena will be faced with the possibility of the Tuatha Dé losing the Otherworld and their magical island cities, as well as losing her friendship with Cameron as their desires for different futures threaten to tear them apart. And if Cameron refuses to join her on the Irish pantheon, whom can she really trust amongst the gods?  Travel with her to the Cities of the Gods, because she’s about to find out.",
