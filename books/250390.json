The assault changed her into something she has only recently begun to understand, and connects her in unimaginable ways to her attacker.But the dominating vampire who attacked her doesn't want to kill her. He wants to keep her alive.Unfortunately, keeping Trinity alive won't be easy when nearly every vampire in existence wants her dead.

Luckily for Trinity, she doesn't have to fight alone. She has a special sword and six protective people at her back-- The vampire master who attacked her, a mysterious hunter, and four incredible--and hot--supernaturals.And she is as passionately drawn to them as they are to her--emotionally and physically.Her unquenchable thirst for blood is matched by a primal, undeniable lust, and Trinity realizes she is in more danger of losing her heart and soul than she ever was of losing her life.--Urban fantasy/Reverse harem",
