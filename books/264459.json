  "title": "The Songe of If",
  "description": "A lonely hen. A wandering rooster. An old man on a quiet French farm. And a mysterious tree placed center among all. A fairy tale for adults â€“ an exploration of meaning in the burden of time, the possible in dreams, the lessons of silence, the clarity of love, and the miraculous in life. About the lives of two chickens, each with a past that still haunts, a taciturn farmer with no future he sees, and an ancient tree that stands moribund, firm, and wondrous. Told as fantasy and as fact, the story is written in the beloved tradition of the imagined, oral lore from a long-lost age in Southwest France.",
