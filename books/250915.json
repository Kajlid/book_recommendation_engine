  "description": "The Dark is angry… Jameson, the dummy, went off chasing boobs so now I’m chasing a boob too—him. Every road so far ends at a dead end or with someone dead at the end. Mostly the latter. My patience is growing short and so is the time I have to save him. But as Phobe, the father of darkness himself and my best-friend and lover, blithely reminds me with his sharp smile, there’s a reason the Sidhe chose me and that reason leaves me covered in blood. When I finally find the people who took my nerd—I realize the totality of their deception. Betrayed unexpectedly, that ache calls forth the angry darkness waiting inside of me. Bringing it to the very edge of escaping my control. I’m not sure how much longer I can hold it back or if I even want to anymore. Especially not when Phobe smiles that sexy, scary way he does, enticing me to give in to it and let it reign. There’s also another incentive, the people responsible for ALL the pain and heartache in my life are only a few dead bodies away.  ***Please be advised, this book contains content which may be triggering to readers.***",
