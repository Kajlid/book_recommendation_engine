  "description": "Sometimes the best revenge is to thrive…When Ross MacDougall, fearless warrior, frequenter of brothels, and seducer of other men’s wives, receives word that the Lord of Argyll wishes to reward him for their latest campaign, he’s skeptical. His liege’s gifts are often dubious blessings. Oftentimes, more like curses. Turns out he’s right to be leery. The reward is an Irish lass who looks like a grubby boy meant to work in the stables. And she's not intended to be Ross’s slave. She’s meant to be his wife.Men turn away from Elise O’Cleirigh because of the accursed red stain on her right cheek. Her father called it the devil’s mark. Her mother promised it meant nothing. All Elise knows is that it’s brought her nothing but suffering. This arrogant Scot looks to be no different from the others, and that’s fine by her. She escaped her first ruthless husband. She’ll flee this one as well. But this Highlander turns out to be sly. He fights with weapons she’s ill-equipped to counter: kindness, respect, and a gentleness that makes her heart hurt. The man even apologizes when he behaves like a selfish goat. He makes her want to be wanted. And needed. By him. Not a good thing at all because come spring, she’s gone.She’s the victim of a cruel jest. He dared fate one time too many. An unlikely pair, a winter together reveals they’re not so mismatched after all. But the past proves inescapable, returning with a vengeance to destroy them.Note: This series is part of Dragonblade's Flame line, so this is a sexy, steamy, and scorching-hot read with multiple sex scenes.
