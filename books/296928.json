Cici’s twenty-year marriage ends the day her husband beats her so severely she requires hospitalization. Despite years of abuse and the knowledge of his affair with his teenaged secretary, she planned to stay with him. Then he crossed the point of no return: he hit her in front of their children. The adopted biracial child of a loving father and a heartless, bigoted mother, Mavis has eaten her way through a life where she felt she never fit in. Upon her mother’s death, Mavis finds her adoption documents and at her best friends’ insistence, seeks out her birth mother. They accompany her to an emotional meeting with the woman who becomes the mother Mavis always dreamt of, always needed but never had. Thrice divorced Roxy falls for yet another handsome doctor. Tragedy strikes when her new lover dies in a car accident on his way to her house. It’s at his funeral that Roxy finds out he was married with children. Devastated, she swears off men. That is, until she meets Cici’s trust attorney. It is love at first sight, a first for Roxy, and they make plans for the future. For three women as different as night and day and night again, they share a common bond of friendship and love that endures through four decades and five husbands, most of them Roxy’s.",
