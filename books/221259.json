She also has the best friends ever- some real, some fictional- and that's just the way she likes it.But then one dark and stormy night (okay, it was the morning of a sunny day), Charlotte, a new student, comes to town. Ruby knows from her books that a new character probably means trouble...and she's right! Charlotte wants to turn the book club into a drama club, and she's spending a lot of time with Ruby's best friend.Ruby's going to have to use her imagination and love of reading to solve this big problem before she loses her school friends and her book friends for good. Perfect for younger fans of the Dork Diaries and Story Thieves series, Ruby Starr is an older Junie B. Jones with a big imagination and a love of reading!",
