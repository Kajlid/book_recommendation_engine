  "description": "What happens when a couple who had previously never owned a dog decide to foster an ex-racing greyhound (who had never raced) for 'just three to six weeks?'. What happens when the greyhound becomes very much part of the family? What happens when half of the couple leaves for a very long business trip and just one and the greyhound remain, and the weeks of the fostering process continue to pass?. The continuing story of Kimmie and her adaption from the kennels to a home, and her fosterer's adaption from non-dog people to dog owners.",
