  "description": "The threat of missiles from Communist Cuba has been one of America's great fears. Cuba's terror comes from missiles of another kind. Imprisoned for 17 months, Tom White survived to tell the thrilling story of God's suffering church behind the Sugar Cane Curtain. On May 27, 1979, his plane crashed on a Cuban highway. Brutal treatment from the secret police, months of solitary confinement, and the twenty-four year sentence of a kangaroo court form the backdrop of this fascinating story.",
