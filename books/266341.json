Snow White is certain that a dark magic has pushed her once loving stepmother into madness. Shy and bookish as she may be, she will do whatever is necessary to save the Queen, even if it means approaching the infamous Seven Warriors—a group of outspoken fighters who live in the forest—to ask for their help. Unfortunately, six of the men are not convinced the Queen can be redeemed.  But Fritz, the seventh warrior, is different.  Hailed as both a deadly fighter and a humble forester, Fritz senses there is more to the Princess than there appears to be. When magical horrors attack, his mind is made up, and the Seven Warriors pledge their loyalty to Snow White.  With the warriors helping her, Snow White is certain her stepmother can be saved. But just when victory seems near, a poisoned apple changes everything...",
