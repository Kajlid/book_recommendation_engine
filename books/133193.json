  "description": "Originally published in 1905 and long unavailable in anaffordable format, The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis is a psychological reconstruction of the life of a minor character in Malory s Le Morte d'Arthur, showing the dark underside of the Round Table. It is a Job-like tale of the rogue knight Aglovale, son of King Pellinore, and his path toward spiritual redemption. Written in the fine slow prose of contemplation, Sir Aglovale was Clemence Housman s third and final novel. It is also her finest achievement.",
