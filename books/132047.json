  "description": "Twenty-four-year-old Morgan Fox wonders if her life is over when she is forced to return to US soil after losing her leg in Afghanistan. Things take an unexpected turn, however, when she lands a job as a bodyguard for Dakota Summer, an eighteen-year-old television star, and quickly realizes that her Army training did nothing to prepare her for dealing with the spoiled teen’s disregard for rules. Her job description is to keep Dakota away from the party scene and out of the news, but when Dakota refuses to obey her, Morgan can find only one way to make the teen pay attention: a good, hard, bare-bottom spanking. Dakota’s life began spiraling out of control after her older brother died in a car accident, and it is only under Morgan’s firm hand and watchful eye that she truly starts to heal. She also begins to realize what she’s been missing: someone who will care enough to put a stop to her dangerous behavior. Dakota finds herself oddly at peace as she suddenly faces real consequences for her actions, even when those consequences leave her with a red, stinging bottom. The women soon become friends, and although Dakota continues to push her bodyguard away and test her boundaries, Morgan stands firm, refusing to let her behavior go unpunished. When Dakota tells Morgan that she’s falling in love with her, though, the older woman is suddenly at a loss. Dakota has allowed Morgan to bare her bottom and spank her until she’s sobbing, but can Morgan let herself be vulnerable enough to embrace Dakota’s love for her, in spite of the insecurity she feels as a result of her injury?",
