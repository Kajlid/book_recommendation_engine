  "description": "Farah Adlin is never getting married. Not now, not “someday,” and certainly not when she’s black out drunk at her sister’s wedding in Las Vegas. So when she wakes up in an unfamiliar hotel room with a ring on her finger, the only logical explanation is that she won it from a vending machine, right? She doesn’t have much time to dwell on it anyway, as Damien Vance, her boss and heir to the Vance fortune, assigns her to be the glorified baby sitter for his older brother for the week. Eric Vance is as obnoxious as he is handsome, immediately pushing all of Farah’s buttons and all of her boundaries. With one brother trying her patience, and the other acting unusually friendly, Farah’s starting to wonder if she’s going to survive her work life long enough to find who put that ring on her finger. What Happens in Vegas is a lighthearted Romantic Comedy of billionaires, big mistakes, and finding your voice. If you enjoyed the heart of The Hating Game by Sally Thorne and the billionaires of Fifty Shades of Grey by EL James, you'll love What Happens in Vegas.",
