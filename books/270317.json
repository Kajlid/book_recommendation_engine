Her life starts to veer off course when money goes missing and so does her restaurant manager, leaving her in the lurch. Most importantly, raising her young nephew was never anywhere in her plans.Dante Groves could be the answer to Takira’s prayers. She’s an excellent manager and is totally at ease with children. She’s also mature, kind, and unashamedly butch. Takira can’t help being attracted, but Dante’s emotional baggage from her last relationship has left her way too wary of romance.Betrayed by those they trusted, Takira and Dante must rely on each other to create a recipe for success, both in business and in love.Cover Artist: Sheri HalalGenres: Contemporary / Romance Tags: Children / Families, Age Gap, People of Color, Food, Friends & Community",
