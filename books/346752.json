  "description": "Something terrible has happened. Eleven-year-old Aubrey is on her own.' It was fun at first, playing house. Nothing to think about but TV and cheese. A perfect world. 'She's determined to hide away and take care of herself, because facing the truth is too much to bear.' I couldn't let anyone know that I was alone. I was staying right here. 'But with the love of her grandmother and the letters she writes, can Aubrey begin to see that even though she's lost everything - all is not lost?",
