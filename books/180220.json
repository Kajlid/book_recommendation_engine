  "description": "What happens when you fall out of love with the person that has been by your side through the best and the worst of times? Chelby and Tristan are living in their perfect world—perfectly happy, perfectly loving, or so it appears to the outside world.  Dating for the past three years, loving each another is all they’ve known together, yet something has changed. Nothing Chelby and Tristan do anymore seems to coincide; their worlds are slowing moving in opposite directions. Wanting to rekindle the romance in their relationship, they decide to take some time for themselves and embark on a journey they never imagined possible.  After a long day’s drive, they come across a resort and choose to rent a cabin for the night. When they awake the next morning, they realize that things aren’t always as they appear. Determined to find their lost love for one another, they decide to explore the resort enjoying one another’s company. Will Chelby and Tristan be able to find the passion and desire for one another they once felt, or will the distractions of their new found journey pull them apart once and for all?",
