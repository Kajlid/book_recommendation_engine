  "description": "The Burke Siblings are damn good at what they do. And what they do? Well that isn’t any good at all.Performing wet work for the Order of Magic’s Black Operations, the Burkes keep order in a chaotic world. But when their handler doubts their loyalty, snarky firebrand Ed and cerebral illusionist Des discover the difference between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ in the Order of Magic’s hierarchy.Forget getting paid, surviving the Order’s most accomplished killer becomes the Burkes’ all-consuming focus.That and toppling the whole underhanded house of cards that betrayed them.Allies are hard to find when you’re pariahs, so the Burkes turn to a shapeshifter they had hunted not too long ago--an individual who supplies uneasy alliances, personal epiphanies, and stomach butterflies in equal measure.Inspired by the likes of The Dresden Files, Hard Magic, and Supernatural, STRAY DOGS is what happens when a queer author pens a novel with clever magic, frantic action, and hair-trigger wit.",
