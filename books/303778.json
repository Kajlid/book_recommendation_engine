  "description": "The king and queen of romance--Jenna Watson and Lorenzo Graham. The \"dirty duo\" that makes you swoon, gets you hot and then melts your heart with the happily ever after. Two newbie authors, one sketchy Instagram DM, a few phone calls, a drunken live video plotting out our next best seller and then BOOM! Trending and on the radar of every publishing company in the industry, we make it--together. A best seller list, two literary agents and we're cruising by for the next year...until we don't. Writer's block hits and Lorenzo and I are forced to finally meet face to face, retreating to a cabin in the woods all weekend to bang out our next big hit. I don't think our agents wanted us to bang out each other but that's what happens. Over and over again on every damn inch of that cabin. Turns out those sexy scenes that Lorenzo writes have nothing on his real moves. One weekend and then we'll go back to being work partners, except nothing is the same. It'll never be the same.",
