  "title": "The Passenger",
  "description": "While this was released after The Warrior Within (Book 3 of Surviving the Dead), it is not Book 4 in the series. It is related and some of the characters were in the first book in the series, No Easy Hope. It is more of a supplemental reading to the series.During the Outbreak, like billions of others, a man finds himself infected with the Phage. Desperate to spare his family from watching him become a walking nightmare, he flees. Soon after, he is dead. Two years later, he wakes up. Not in the afterlife, but in his own body. Trapped, unable to control the monster that carries him, and forced to witness the horror of its existence. A hundred miles away, Sergeant Ethan Thompson thinks he has seen the worst the apocalypse has to offer. He is wrong. Following the trail of a dying madman, he will embark on a journey of vengeance that will test the limits of his sanity. Along the way, he will learn that there is no justice at the end of the world. There is only the living and the dead, and in between, there is The Passenger.",
