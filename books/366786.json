  "description": "Simon Quinn may be short, but he casts a tall shadow. Standing only three-and-a-half feet tall, he has risen above his lifelong struggles with dwarfism, and has become a legend in his own time. A world renowned sculptor, Simon has created works for celebrities and royalty the world over. He had no intention of becoming a detective, until his world was shattered by the horribly brutal murder of his fiancee. When local police are unable to find the killer, Simon becomes determined to track him down. He uses his unique size and talent for squeezing in tight spaces to his advantage, and the hunt is on. Will he be able to catch the killer, or will he come under suspicion himself, and be charged for a murder he didn't commit?",
