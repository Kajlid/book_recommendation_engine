  "description": "Stuart Watson spent his first career earning a living by talking. His whole identity was wrapped up in being a Peabody-award-winning investigative journalist. Then, he turned 55 and got fired. He began to doubt himself. He flirted with suicide. To escape such dark thoughts, he began a five-year odyssey conducting dozens of interviews for a podcast, book, and a film. Increasingly, these interview subjects were women. But all too often, Stuart interrupted or “mansplained” or flat out argued. It didn’t work. So gradually, he learned how to stop talking over women and really listen to them. The result is this book and a podcast call ManListening, in which Stuart elevates the stories of a diverse group of strong women who bounced back. What She Said & What I Heard is a memoir told through a series of profound moments where a woman said something that Stuart actually heard. He shifted and changed because in a moment, he really listened. This book is for broken people and the people who don’t know hot to hear them. If you’re still reading, you’re one of us.",
