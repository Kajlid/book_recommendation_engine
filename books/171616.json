  "description": "Dwelling on the past can be murder.Emma Sweet looks more like a trophy wife than a killer, but as she watches her cheating husband burn alive in his Mercedes, she knows her trophy life is over. Every man she ever loved hurt her. Now it’s time to hurt them back. As she travels from state to state, crossing a name off her list each time she ends a life, she’s only one step ahead of Agent Douglas. She doesn’t care if she gets caught really, as long as the last name on her list—the first man to break her heart—gets the justice he’s earned before the law catches up with her.With the memory of a fatal house fire looming over her, no one can blame Jace Douglas for being pyrophobic, but agents with the Serial Crimes Unit don’t get to pick and choose assignments. When a series of murders all have the same killing signature, she can’t let the flames of her past interfere with the job. Alongside one pushy—and altogether too attractive—detective, she embarks on a cross-country manhunt to catch a killer before another man dies.",
