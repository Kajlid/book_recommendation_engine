  "description": "A 2015 IndieFab Book of the Year Award Winner, a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award for Best Gay Romance and a finalist for the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival Award for Best Emerging Author, Brothers chronicles the lives of two sets of siblings, the Corks and the Malloys.At twenty-three, Jamus Cork’s plans are simple—graduate college, stay in New York City, and write. But those plans change when his parents are suddenly killed and he finds himself the guardian of his little brother, Nick. Jamus ends up back in the Boston neighborhood where he grew up, with a crying toddler on his knee and the challenge of building a new life for himself and the boy. Jamus somehow finds a way to navigate the ups and downs of single parenting, but over a decade of raising Nick, Jamus never truly overcomes his struggles with loneliness and the guilt he feels as the sole survivor of the crash that killed his parents. That changes when he meets bookishly handsome Sean Malloy. There’s a spark between the two men, but both must face down their own private demons to find love in the Irish enclave of South Boston.For a more in-depth look at \"Brothers,\" check out www.ralphjosiahbardsley.com.",
