Then, as she walks her university campus, she’s stalked by a flock of black birds. Surely an ominous sign. Or, is it?The mysterious, handsome, dark-haired Rovidious steps into her life, bringing with him a newfound passion that Anaïs had only dreamed of. But with her new relationship comes new challenges, and even danger.Rovidious knows summoning him should have been impossible. He had fulfilled his debt to the human race, but now after centuries of isolation the raven was called.

However, his dark past taunts him, and the truth may send Anaïs running in the opposite direction. She must decide if their relationship will stand the against her family’s disapproval, her former crush, and even darker forces on the horizon.",
