  "description": "“The alley was unlit and shadowy figures could be seen mingling around with varying levels of purpose, all silhouetted against the light of the Stradun below. As Ben turned back to the door something in the scene from which he had turned away suddenly registered in his extremely tired subconscious. Surely there couldn’t be two of those awful shirts in one evening in this stylish city? As the light increased and the scene became clearer, Ben began to feel a panicked tingle starting in his fingertips and toes. The hair on his arms rose as the pile of rags revealed itself to be a body lying in a pool of blood. The body of the man he had been talking to at the concert only a few hours earlier.”Cautious by nature, Ben Christie doesn’t usually put himself forward for anything. Whilst on holiday in Dubrovnik, however, an uncharacteristic impulse to volunteer unexpectedly entangles him in a murder investigation. Intrigued by the victim’s mysterious nickname, Ben discovers that beneath the red-tiled roofs and cloudless skies lurk ghosts from the region’s dark past. Threats to his safety mount when the fashionable business of art and music proves every bit as cut-throat as the murky world of local politics. As the relentless police investigation draws to a conclusion, threatening those he has come to care about, Ben must question his deep-seated beliefs regarding responsibility, guilt, and unintended consequences.",
