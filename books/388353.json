  "description": "Are you dating a Dick? (Or a Tom? Or a Harry?) This hilarious mock-man-getting guide will help you decide. Inside Jane's Guide to Dicks (and Toms and Harrys), best-selling humorists Ross and Kathyrn Petras offer tongue-in-cheek lessons to help your average Jane suss out all the Dicks (and Toms and Harrys) they encounter along the way to finding Mr. Right. Once upon a time, Jane didn't know Jack about Dick; however, after careful research, study, and observation, Jane is now an expert on boys, and she's ready to share all her special secrets to help good girls everywhere find their own Dicks (or Toms, or Harrys). Four-color art appears throughout, and each special secret offers suggestively irreverent and sassy quips such as: • Not all boys are created equal. Some of them have BIG machines. Some of them have SMALL machines. A big machine is usually BETTER! (But not TOO big!) • Just because he has balls doesn't mean he wants to shoot a basket in your—or any other girl's—hoop! • Boys who stare at your chest and forget you have a face are the REAL boobs!",
