  "description": "Warning: If you can't handle a Navy SEAL with a filthy mouth, and a huge cock who wants to turn you into his plaything, this isn't the book for you. Carry on. An ass you could bounce a quarter off of.  That’s the sight that greets me of my new roommate as he f*cks a blonde on the kitchen table. That’s right before I get an eyeful of his giant cock. Cue wet panties. Oh, and did I mention he’s a Navy SEAL? One semester. That’s as long as I have to last—and then I’m gone, graduated, off into the real world.  But can I survive that long without becoming … his plaything?",
