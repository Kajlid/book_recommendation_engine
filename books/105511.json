  "description": "My name is Timberly Day. I don’t drink, but I do know things.  I know the heart beats over 100,000 times per day.  I know for every one second, lightning strikes the Earth 100 times.   I also know that Jaxon King—the bloody tosser!—is a muddler.  A manipulator. A liar. A con, a thief...and a closet nerd. He’s as beautiful as innocence, as harmless as a feather.  Except, it’s all an illusion.   I see him and I see lies. I smell him and I taste deceit.  And still—fool that I am—I rush in. His eyes are like ice. His tongue is like fire.  His lies are white, but his touch is red hot.   I had the chance to run. I didn’t.  Now, I am a part of the game. And the only way to win...is to give in.",
