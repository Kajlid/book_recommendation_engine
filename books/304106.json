  "description": "Our band's stunning, untouched new assistant was completely off-limits. But that didn't stop me.A car crash. A fake story at the hospital. She warned me when I dragged her from the nightmare that was her life that she could very well destroy mine. I didn't listen. I didn't care.I brought her into my home. Into my life. Gave her a job. My Pandora. A goddess amongst mortals who opened a jar and obliterated my world with her beautiful evils. But from the moment I saw her, I knew she had to be mine.Consequences be damned.In a life where getting by is barely a thing, I didn’t expect much.Until I crashed into him. Literally. Keith Dawson is a god amongst mortals. A Rockstar I’ve drooled over for longer than I can remember. And now the hero of my darkest tales when a hero was the last thing I was looking for. But a god this powerful always has a fatal flaw. Turns out, she died a long time ago. And there is no living up to the ghosts of his past, right? So where does that leave us? Well, that’s where this story gets interesting.",
