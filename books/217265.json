The prince is a billionaire called Caspian Hart. And we're trying super hard to live happily ever after.He's everything I want, need, and can't a man who looks like a god and bangs like the devil. Except he's still got his rules and he's still got his secrets . . .But if there's one thing Caspian's taught me it's that you should never settle for less than you're worth. And I'm worth his trust. I have to show him that I see him. That I'm not afraid of his passion, or his power, or his past. And that I won't settle for less than everything.",
