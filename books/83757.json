Not only is each letter of the alphabet associated with an animal in a fun and humorous way that is sure to put a smile on your childâ€™s face, but the entire book has a catchy rhyming rhythm that children find irresistible. Everything is brought to life in full color high definition illustrations that seem to pop right off the screen. Kids of all ages will appreciate the humor which will help them remember all of the animal facts that are tossed in the mix. Here is a quick sample, minus the great illustrations and high definition images.I is for Iguana, a Lizard that eats cactus fruit.J is for Jaguar whose cubs are so cute.K is for Kangaroo an animal with a pouch.L is for the Labrador Retriever who loves to sleep on the couch.
