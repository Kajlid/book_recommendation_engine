  "description": "The genius of Raichlen meets the magic of vegetables.Celebrating all the ways to grill green, this mouthwatering, ground breaking cookbook from America’s master griller” ( Esquire ) shows how to bring live fire or wood smoke to every imaginable vegetable. How to fire-blister tomatoes, cedar-plank eggplant, hay-smoke lettuce, spit-roast brussels sprouts on the stalk, grill corn five ways—even cook whole onions caveman-style in the embers. And how to put it all together through 115 inspired recipes. Plus chapters on grilling breads, pizza, eggs, cheese, desserts and more. While vegetables shine in every dish, this is not a strictly vegetarian cookbook—yes, there will be bacon.“Raichlen’s done it again!
