  "description": "In what internal organ does true love reside?

I could see myself pulling out body parts and pinning them to paper with little labels, the heart of a liar, a good man's spleen. Armed only with curiosity, a tape recorder and a list of questions covering love, sex, commitment, marriage and family, I set out in search of real love",
