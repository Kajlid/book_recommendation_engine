  "description": "Out of the friend zone and into the fire...GarrettBeck’s been my best friend since we were toddlers—she’s like a sister to me, or at least that’s what I’ve always thought. Beck is family, and it’s my job to make sure she’s safe and happy.But lately when I look at Beck, family’s not what I see. I see someone who makes my pulse race and my body sit up and take notice. I see a woman.And then we get drunk on a birthday trip, and one thing leads to another …I don’t know what’s waking up in bed with my best friend, or knowing that, no matter what, we can’t do this again. But I have a feeling I’m about to find out.BeckGarrett’s been my best friend for as long as I can remember—the next thing to family. Add to that the fact that his relationships last for a few months at best, and he’s the absolute worst boyfriend candidate around.So why did I just wake up in bed with him?Garrett says it was just a drunken mistake, and we should go on the way we have been—BFFs and nothing more. And he’s right; we can’t do this again. Our friendship is more important than what we just did.Isn’t it?",
