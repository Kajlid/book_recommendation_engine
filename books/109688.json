  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy Romantic Comedy, M/M, shape-shifters, HEA] Have you ever read one of those stories where fire-breathing dragons sweeps down from the sky, torches villages, and eats unsuspecting villagers? This isn't one of them. This is the real thing, and I'm a real dragon. My name's Dineiro, but you can call me Dini. All my friends do. Confused? I can definitely empathize. Imagine this. One day, while out with my friends, I run into the legendary Rainbow Brick Road, which leads me straight to my mate, Prince Kirril of Arthuria. Sadly, he is human, and a dragon slayer. And no, we don't just rush to each other and embrace like I might have imagined once or twice. Instead, he shoots me with a crossbow. We're so different, but against all odds, a true connection forms between us. Of course, the path of fate is fickle. If the two of us want to be together, we have a long road ahead. This is, after all, the first chapter in our tale. This book is written in first-person point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
