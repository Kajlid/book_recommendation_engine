  "description": "Angels and daemons have been locked in warfare for thousands of years, one side striving to protect the humans of the Earthly plane, the other seeking to corrupt them. Until the Great Battle five centuries ago, where the daemon, Dante Vittorio, united the angels and his daemon brethren in an effort to banish the seven Daemon Kings to the underworld.Free from his cruel sire, The King of Lust, Dante worked his fingers to the bone to build his company, Inferno, Inc., from a tiny startup into a worldwide empire. His existence, though boring at times, was exactly how he liked it. Uncomplicated.Until the day his newest assistant walked through the door.Faith Summers knew that at age 22, people would think still being a virgin was strange, but that was just it. Faith was strange.Withdrawn and lonely, her singular goal consisted of going to work every day, keeping her head down, and making sure her eyes and ears never caught wind of the mortifying—and in her opinion, perverted—services offered by her employer, Inferno Inc.And her ‘don’t see, don’t tell’ attitude worked, until the day she found herself thrust two left feet first, into the position of Executive Assistant to the drop-dead gorgeous CEO, Dante Vittorio.When Faith arrived on the top floor of the Tower of Inferno, tongue-tied and trembling, with her sad little box of personal items balanced in her arms, Dante’s reaction was the very last thing either of them expected.",
