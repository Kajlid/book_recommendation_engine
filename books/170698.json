  "description": "A world record. A challenge like no other. The first multilingual literary work ever created.Twenty-eight distinct languages join forces in one single publication, under the guidance of the anonymous author of The Unwords, as they take you on an unforgettable journey through the interwoven continuum of space and time. Two lovers, separated by the longest possible distance. A story of sacrifice and unyielding persistence, waiting for someone to unlock its secrets. Written in poetic verse and expanding into full-page, full-color illustrations, the book's multilingual structure gives each language its chance to shine. Every language has its own unique voice; its own exclusive role in the progression of the story, with absolutely no repetition of content from one language to the other, and with not a single word of translation available.Also included in this edition is Laid to Rest; the remarkable true story behind the book's creation and an honest look into the life and struggles of the anonymous author.",
