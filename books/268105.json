Our upbringings, our worlds, our rules—they clash at every turn.But opposites? They attract.I shouldn’t want her.She shouldn’t want me.Yet here we are, caught in a pull too strong to ignore.Until the moment she has to choose—me or her family.The easy choice is to walk away.But I don’t do easy. And I sure as hell don’t lose.She thinks she can burn us to the ground.But I’ll fight like hell to make sure we survive.Jagger (The Black Hornets MC #5) is a dark, steamy motorcycle club romance with fiery tension, forbidden love, and an antihero who refuses to let go of the only woman who sets him ablaze.",
