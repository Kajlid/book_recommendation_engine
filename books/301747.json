  "description": "After a kidnapping attempt on Kresley's life, she wants nothing more than to go back to living the life of an ordinary college student. She just never expected her parents to hire a pompous, know-it-all bodyguard who watches her every move with disdain. One whose good looks don’t soften the cold, impenetrable wall he wears like armor. Tristan prides himself on being a professional and taking his job as a bodyguard seriously. But, nothing could prepare him for the high-maintenance, rich girl he's hired to protect. She’s got a smart mouth, is hell-bent on pushing his buttons, and doesn’t take the threats against her seriously. And despite the nightmares that plague her dreams, or the fact that he's the only one who knows about them, he's not there to befriend her. He's there to protect her.",
