  "description": "He's my son's best friend. But it's not what you think...At eighteen, I became my nephew’s guardian, and my once carefree life ceased to exist. The next fourteen years passed in a blur of unconventional parenting and more wine than I’m sure most good moms consume.My dating life? Yeah, that basically became non-existent. So when my boy's best friend, Weston, tells me has romantic feelings for me, I’m too stunned to process the “right way” to react. There are so many reasons I shouldn’t do this…and yet my heart seems to be saying full steam ahead.With a ten-year age gap, I know a relationship with Weston has the potential to be disastrous. And I’m not wrong. Because things just got hella complicated.*This is an older woman age gap romance, that breaks the 'cougar' mold. If you're into books that have you flipping the pages in rapid succession with hot, bossy hero's, heroine's with a mind of their own, and chemistry that burns up your kindle, you need to start reading What If It's Right? today.",
