But who can help when it’s way past time for simple apologies? Elena and Desmond are doing everything they can to help their sons and their mates. But there’s only so much a parent can do to help, and when Desmond lands himself in the doghouse he turns to his sons to help him.

Anything worth having takes fighting for sometimes.” –Victor Marius This book is written in first-person point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
