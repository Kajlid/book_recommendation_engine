  "title": "Hidden Princess: The Rebirth of Making Mary",
  "description": "Set mainly during the transition between the Civil War and the Great Depression, Hidden Princess chronicles the daily travails of a nation - and its people- in flux. The Johnson family soon succumbs to the lure of the Great Migration, joining millions of other poor Black families who are seeking the gifts promised to them under the spell of the North Star.Hidden Princess is a love story written in novel format. But Hidden Princess is more than a lighthearted, witty, satirical, hilarious, most compelling, and gripping love story of all times. It is a serious and magnificent literary piece to be reckoned with. Author Dedra Muhammad presents remarkable, accurate pills of truth that often prove difficult to swallow.Taking on everything from the WILLIE Lynch syndrome to religious zealotry to lasting misconceptions regarding the true intentions of Abraham Lincoln, the love story in the book takes the readers from North to South, toting the culture along in the midst of the Great Migration. Making Mary reads like a treatise on American psychology. Her points are cogent, her logic is flawless, and most impressive is the seamless way she applies rich character descriptions and development within the natural framework of everyday contemporary life.Hidden Princess is breathtaking, historically accurate, and the most compelling love story imaginable.",
