  "title": "The Death of Kiera and Davey and the Adventures Preceeding Their Demise",
  "description": "So many adults take the imagination children possess for granted. Deep within their tiny being lies the ability to see the world in a unique way. Yet, more often than not, children are pushed to grow up too quickly, to develop the skills to cope with the harsh reality of this world. It was precisely these thoughts that birthed this entire book; the entire concept of Kiera and Davey is driven by my belief in the imagination and creativity of the children spread across this world. I admire their courage, their ability to transform the world, even if only in their eyes.",
