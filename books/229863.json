Now he’s missing. It’s just another case for Glasgow PI, Charlie Cameron, until he comes to believe Law was murdered. Did the disgraced surgeon abandon his sacred oath to become a killer? Or did the hospital itself have Law permanently silenced? As Charlie digs deeper, he discovers just how bad the world of medicine can be for his health.Across the city, East End gangster Sean Rafferty is preparing to exploit the already corrupt city council in a multi-million pound leisure development known as Riverside. The project will be good for Glasgow. But not everybody is keen to work with Rafferty. With more than money at stake, Sean will do anything to get his way. So when Charlie’s investigation gets him tangled up in Sean’s business, someone’s going to need a doctor…or an undertaker.What the readers are saying:'An exciting new voice in Glasgow's crime fiction genre - it will have you hooked from page one!'Lorraine PatrickWestender MagazineI have a very pleasurable problem with Owen Mullen's books - after I have finished reading them, I am spoilt for anything else until I come down off my 'Charlie high'.
