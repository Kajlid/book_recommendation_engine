  "description": "Daredevil's craziest ex-girlfriend, Typhoid Mary, is the star of her own twisted fairy tale! Peek inside the crowded head of Mary Walker, whose dissociative identity disorder and mutant talents for telekinesis and pyrokinesis are a deadly combination. But could the psionic psycho become a force for good when she fights for women too powerless to defend themselves? Typhoid's appetite for vengeance draws the attention of Ghost Rider, while her growing contempt for men places Daredevil and Wolverine in the firing line.COLLECTING Typhoid 1-4, Marvel Comics Presents (1988) 150-151, Spectacular Spider-Man (1976) 213-214; material from Marvel Comics Presents (1988) 109-116, 123-130; material from Girl Comics (2010) 3",
