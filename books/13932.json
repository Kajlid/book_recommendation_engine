Can she prove it? No, and she doesn't care that she can't as she takes the law into her hands. How about those who dismiss her fears and believe she is paranoid? Well, they certainly deserve to be punished. What does she do when she starts questioning her own suspicions--and sanity? Hmm. That's complicated.In this disturbing tale of derangement, a young psychopathic woman is slipping into madness as she fights an enemy that may exist only in her imagination. She has to resort to desperate measures when she realizes that a gun, security cameras in her apartment, and constant vigilance will not be enough to survive. It is hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if the cat is not there, but Leslie, with her resolve fueled by paranoia, is hell-bent on finding and slaughtering it.---Bonus: \"Hitchhiker\" by Tim Kizer When a serial killer hitches a ride one sunny day in a beautiful California valley, he does not suspect that he may have met his match, who is dead set to take another life.
