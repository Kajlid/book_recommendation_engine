  "title": "Lady Cavendish’s Christmas Caper",
  "description": "Lady Cavendish firmly believes that she's only a lady in name. All of her friends call her Charlie. She’s convinced that the name Charlotte is too sophisticated and borders on being painfully self-assured. Lately, nothing about Charlie's life bolsters her confidence. In fact, she has absolutely no idea what she's doing...Charlie has until next Christmas to find a priceless missing art piece that’s the only thing standing between her and her inheritance. The cozy British town is hiding more than just the location of the noteworthy artwork. Charlie’s late grandmother wrote that she would only receive the castle and all its treasures after successfully finding the tactfully hidden artwork. As the clock moves closer to the deadline, it will take a Christmas miracle to help Charlie earn her inheritance and keep her wonderful new home.Eager to explore Haversham, Charlie heads out sightseeing. It isn’t long until a flat tire leaves her stranded outside of the local tavern where a tall brooding stranger lends her a helping hand. Intrigued, Charlie proposes an innocent little wager. One harmless bet leads to another and soon she’s agreed to host a Christmas Eve party at the castle. Unwilling to admit defeat, she takes the challenge in stride, but will the town’s sleepy secrets come to light just in time to foil the holiday spirit?",
