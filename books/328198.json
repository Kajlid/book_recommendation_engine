  "description": "I never imagined that one night could end the friendship Beau Bishop and I’d had since birth and sever all ties between our families. Especially when less than an hour prior to that tragic accident at the racetrack that night, he had confessed his love to me under the bleachers. A bond I’d thought could never be broken was smashed to smithereens in an instant.He left Alabama, hightailing it to Florida without so much as a good-bye.Two years later, we’ve crossed paths again. Only he’s no longer known as Beau Bishop. No, now, the boy that I’ve been in love with my entire life is called Bama. And Bama is a cocky, closed-off jerk.As much as he tries to push me away, he should know how persistent I am when it comes to something I want. Losing is never an option. Just ask all of the guys I’ve raced to become number one.Getting everything I’ve ever wanted is finally so close I can almost reach out and grab it. But you know that saying—waiting for the other shoe to drop? Yeah … well, those words were always in the back of my mind. Knowing it seemed too good to be true to finally have Beau Bishop in the palm of my hand.And I was right. Because once again, I was alone.Sometimes, fear makes you do stupid things when it comes to the ones you love. We were a walking example of that.This is book two in the Florida East University series.",
