  "description": "Through compelling reminiscences of his grandfather's life in America and Japan, Allen Say delivers a poignant account of his family's unique cross-cultural experience.He warmly conveys his own love for his two countries and describes the strong and constant desire to be in both places at once: When in one country, he invariably misses the other. His grandfather, he tells us, would understand.Illustrated with exquisite paintings, intimate and memorable, Grandfather's Journey is Allen Say's most personal and remarkable picture yet of the bridging of two disparate cultures.\nAllen Say\n was born in Yokohama, Japan, and came to the United States when he was sixteen. He lives in San Francisco. His book Tree of Cranes was selected as an ALA Notable Children's Book and as a Notable Children's Trade Book in the field of social studies.",
