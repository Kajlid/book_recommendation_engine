Suddenly he was in darkness and could only see the world through the eyes of therapist Sarah Jane Morrison--whose tender loving care ignited a sizzling passion in him no other woman ever had....Sarah Jane suffered from plain looks ... and a fear of rejection. So when she was assigned to help the most gorgeous, sexy blind man she'd ever seen, how could she refuse?

What would happen when he regained his sight and could see her for the woman she really was?",
