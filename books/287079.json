  "description": "Leilani is fragile, delicate like a flower. Her classmates test her weakness, plucking at her pink petals, one by one until the last petal is gone. But, just like every flower, petals grow back. And, they blossom. Alas, Leilani doesn't see her beauty, but Chad does. Sometimes, in life, love finds you when you least expect it to. But, how can Leilani love somebody when she doesn't love herself? Love doesn't have a name. Love doesn't have an occupation. Love is what draws people from their darkest moments. No road is smooth. No road is impossible. Here is Leilani's story. She's as beautiful as a flower but made of stone. Words hurt. Words cut deep. But, words can't cut stone.",
