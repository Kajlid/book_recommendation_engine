  "title": "Peach",
  "description": "A debut poetry collection written between the ages of 20 and 26. Organized into four parts and touching on topics like body image, heartbreak, and love in all of its forms, Peach authentically captures the gooey angst of the author’s early twenties. Here’s to hoping you’ll find yourself in these pages and enjoy the journey - either devoured all at once or savored one delicious bite at a time.",
