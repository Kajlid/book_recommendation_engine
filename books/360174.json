  "description": "A majority of Americans have concluded that morals do not count. They don't care what their leaders do as long as there is a booming economy and prosperity. God is about to crush this abominable American mind-set. Soon the American dream will become the American nightmare. It will occur suddenly--without warning--and no one will be able to explain how or why it happened. There will be sellers only--no buyers. Yet through it all, those who know God can be assured of constant protection and provision from His hands.",
