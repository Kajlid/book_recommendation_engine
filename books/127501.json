  "description": "DeaconFrom the outside, people see me as a businessman who lives with his two brothers and likes to keep to himself.However, the inside is something else. I share my soul with a beast of a bear, and all he knows and wants is to torture and kill.Until we scent him.Our Fated mate.RioMy life has never been my own. My ruthless father and mess of a mother control it. All I want is to spend my days without looking over my shoulder and without the fear of getting so close to someone that my crime-boss father will use them against me.At twenty-two, I’m tired, unloved, and live a dull, empty existence.Until he walks into my world—all intense eyes and broody growls that don’t sound human.Now, there’s no going back. Not when my soul recognizes his. All that’s left to decide is how far am I willing to go to escape my toxic family so I can start anew with the man who makes me feel more in a matter of moments than I have in my whole life. Murder, violence, crime, hate slurs, sexual content, blood.",
