  "description": "Two little words on a blank piece of paper with a phone number taped to a wall: Submission training. Two little words that drive Meghan crazy as she finishes her final semester of college. Meghan is convinced she has it all... a great boyfriend, a promising career, and a fulfilled life. But two little words eventually beckon her to call the number. There she finds a voice. His voice. The voice that will change her life forever, shattering her identity and propelling her into a world of dark deviant bliss. Simultaneously ashamed of her new \"abnormal\" desires and obsessively excited over the seductive thrill ride on which she finds herself, Meghan embarks on a journey to discover her true self... at the command of a man who sends her into ecstatic delight with just the sound of his voice.",
