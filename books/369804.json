  "description": "Poetry. FAIRY TALES FOR WRITERS holds up a magic mirror to the joys and struggles of the creative process and the writing life, reflecting them through the lens of the powerful archetypes of these formative stories. In these pages the reader will find: the new writer who encounters a wolf along the path to publication; that member of a writing workshop who always needs to be the fairest of them all; a writer who gives up her voice for love; even that shy, anonymous author who slips away before the end of the reading, but is nonetheless tracked down at last by an editor who wishes to publish her work. Because sometimes there is a happy ending, even in publishing. Everyone who has ever felt lost in the deep, dark world will find resonance within these cautionary tales.",
