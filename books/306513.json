  "description": "Austin Lively’s life is going right for once. When his new script, Another Kingdom , is unexpectedly purchased by a top producer at an enormous price, his movie career and wildest dreams seem to be taking off. His only problems? A recurring vision of a magical landscape he can’t quite remember, and a giant mouse with a woman’s face who seems to be following him. When his beloved Jane Janeway is accused of murder and imprisoned, Austin realizes this dream life is really a nightmare, and his only hope to save his soul and rescue Jane is to give up his success, return to the Eleven Lands, and find Emperor Anastasius so he can restore Queen Elinda to her throne. It’s a task easier said than done, especially when he discovers the emperor is dead. With a crazed hitman on his trail in Los Angeles and new dangers lurking around every corner in the Eleven Lands, time and luck are running out. As his enemies begin closing in on all sides, Austin must enter the biggest fight of his life to follow the emperor to hell itself and face the most shocking revelation of all.",
