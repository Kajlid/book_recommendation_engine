  "description": "Summer has had TOTALLY enough of her big sister Stacey and the MORGUE of revision that has taken over at home..... why are GCSE's so important anyway! As if that wasn't enough the nauseating 'Three J's' (Jackie, Jeanne and Josie) who are 'too cool for school' have given Summer and her friends the label of the 'Five Mis-fits'! Things have gone too far and Anaya and Amal (who are Muslim and Hindu) are not dealing with it well. Summer tries to understand but leaves school not knowing who she is, or which friends will be with her when she moves on to her new school in September!After a longer than usual summer holiday on Mallorca (I mean... who goes to Mallorca anymore!) Summer realises that she's learnt more from the local Spanish kids than she could ever learn at school..... she's found herself, found a place she can call home, and found true love .....all in the space of four weeks! As the holiday comes to an end she finds the truth lies in How you are and Who you choose to be ..... not in What you are!Based on the old english proverb ' Just when the caterpillar thought it's world couldn't become any worse.... it became a butterfly!' 'Hey! It's Summer!' takes a look at the transience of fighting to stay a teenager whilst starting to embrace the possibilities of adulthood..... and trying to understand some of it!As Summer returns to start at her new school as a 'senior', she looks at the world through different eyes and has a new determination to become the person she would choose to be!",
