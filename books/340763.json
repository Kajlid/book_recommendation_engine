  "description": "From the James Beard award-winning duo behind The Lee Bros. Boiled Peanut Catalogue comes the ground-breaking cookbook for new Southern cooking, featuring nearly 100 recipes. South Carolina-bred brothers, Matt and Ted Lee were raised on long-simmered greens, slow-smoked meats, and deep-fried everything. But after years of traveling as journalists and with farm fresh foods more available than ever, Matt and Ted have combined the old with the new, infusing family recipes with bright flavors. Using crisp produce, lighter cooking methods, and surprising combinations, these are recipes to make any night of the week.",
