  "description": "Rusty and Sam are now alpha and omega werewolf mates, forming a pack along with Mike. Every night brings the new pack closer to the full moon and Sam's first omega heat, but there's still someone missing...  Nick Bellici is scarred in body and mind from his time in the Marines, and now he's struggling alone with life after war. He's driven away everyone who cares about himâ€”except his best friend Rusty, who won't stop asking him to come to California and meet his new boyfriend.  Rusty Jamison is still learning what it means to have a mate and a pack to take care of as their alpha. Teaching Sam and Mike to handle their new werewolf abilities and navigating the politics of the local werewolf packs keeps Rusty busy, but he can't let go of his hopes to bring his best friend Nick into the pack. That's going to mean finally telling Nick the secret he's been keeping for years.  As the pack's omega, it's up to Sam Hurley to bring them all together. Not so tough when there are only two other werewolves, but when it comes to adding in someone Sam's never met, who's been through things Sam can barely imagine, Sam's newfound abilities will be put to the test. And all the time, Sam's first full moon heat is looming closer...  The Omega's Pack is a m/m (and m/m/m and m/m/m/m) werewolf romance featuring alpha and omega mates leading their pack to a happy ending with plenty of steamy action for everyone!",
