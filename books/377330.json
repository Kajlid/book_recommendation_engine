In The Great Satan, the first of his compelling new Shadow Squadron series, author David Black takes their rationale to its logical conclusion to produce his own fictional nightmare scenario: What if the Iraqi weapons that were said to be dismantled in the late 1990s included the ultimate WMD? And what if the deposing of Saddam Hussein left one of his most ruthless military leaders at large, actively seeking revenge?... In The Great Satan, author Black and his main character - Special Forces team leader Pat Farrell - are so close as to be synonymous, both having worked as London taxi drivers during a tenure as Territorial SAS members, ready to be called into action in time of national emergency.
