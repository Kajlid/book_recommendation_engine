  "description": "He came here to take a life, but I unknowingly got in his way. Now he says he’s going to put one, a baby, inside of me.The man he was sent to finish is nowhere to be found. And his contracted target just happens to be my father.I have no idea what he wants from my dad, but I do know exactly what he wants from his daughter, the smoldering dark eyes revealing his newfound desire.What could I be forced to give to save my father’s life, and to my surprise what might I hand over willingly, for the first time, to make sure this day isn’t my dad’s last.He calls me a good girl and says I’m his. I’ve never wanted to be controlled but his guidance and genuine offer of a strong, roughed up hand to hold through this even rougher life might be just what I need.My father’s reckless and unprotective ways put me dead center in this hunky hitman’s scope, but what happens once I’m in the crosshairs as his ultimate target, with his sights set on forever?This is a short, steamy \"daddy-lite\" romance with some daddy elements, but it is not a spot on ddlg story. No OM / OW drama and no cliffhangers. Always a sweet HEA.",
