  "description": "Adults have no clue what it’s like to be eleven years old. Not even a bit. It’s like they were born adults. Actually that makes sense. They probably were. It’s why they always go on about ‘this new generation’ like we’re some sort of disease. It must be because we started life as babies and not adults. It’s his last year in primary school and Sunny Roger’s is struggling to survive pre-teen years. Things change however when the new teacher in school notices the bully harassing him and gives him what seems to be a useless gift. A white pebble. Sunny soon discovers its unpredictable powers and in a desperate attempt to fit in at school, he uses those powers to solve his problems, unwittingly causing more chaos in the process.",
