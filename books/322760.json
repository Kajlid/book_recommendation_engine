  "description": "Annie:I spent the first nineteen years of my life surviving, and the last four running. My mantra: never stay in one place too long. It’s worked for me so far, but I’m tired of running. I never thought I would be able to stop until I found myself in New Orleans. I struck gold when I landed a job working in a bar owned by the man who runs the city’s criminal underground. Sounds shady, but I learned quickly that they treat those who are loyal like family. I finally had someone looking out for me. Everything was great until they found me, and then he saved me. Cole Murphy. The most powerful man in the state – and beyond. I owe him my life, but I’m not sure if it’s a debt I can pay.Cole:As heir to CBM Investments I basically have unlimited power. We control all the money in and around Louisiana – legal and not so legal. If you want to succeed here, you need me on your side to do it. With power and money comes women. Add in my good looks and let’s just say I’ve never had to chase a woman in my life, at least not until Annie Blackwell crossed my path. The woman seems immune to everything I put in front of her. It’s led to an unhealthy obsession. Lucky for me I happened to be in the right place at the right time and ended up saving her life. Now she owes me, and I’m going to enjoy collecting that debt.",
