  "description": "A perfectly melded remix of historical and omegaverse romance. ~~ It is a knotty problem, and it will take some slick moves to mate these two together. ~~ London, 1795 Miss Viola Hartwell has one mission: ensure the Omega Property Rights Act becomes law. However, as an omega she is prohibited from participating in politics. Viola refuses to let her dynamic stand in her way and makes the risky decision to masquerade as her alpha twin sister. All she needs to do now is convince the reclusive Duke of Orley to support her cause. In another part of town, Syon, Duke of Orley, has chosen the widowed Countess of Kellingham as his future bride in a marriage of convenience. But the omega widow refuses to meet any alphas. When the duke's beautiful new secretary offers a unique solution to his problem, he accepts. What begins as a simple exchange of votes for a bride becomes a dangerous game of illicit desire and temptation. ~~ Omegaâ€™s Gambit is a romantic comedy combining genres for a fresh take on the omegaverse set in the late 18th century. ~~ The Hartwell Sisters Saga follows four sisters determined to overcome society's strictures and exceptions. It is set in an alternate history with omegaverse dynamics and a guaranteed HEA. Each book can be read as a standalone, but readers are encouraged to read them in order to avoid spoilers.",
