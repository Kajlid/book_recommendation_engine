  "description": "In this humorous Groundhog's Day picture book by the #1 New York Times bestselling author ofThe A Day at Dunder Mifflin Elementary, it's the day before the big event . . . and the Groundhog goes on strike.Every year, people ask Groundhog the same, boring old question. Is spring around the corner? Or are we doomed to more winter? Sure, they care about his shadow, but what about him and his interests? He’s had enough! Groundhog packs his bags and sets out for a much-needed vacation.Now the town is holding auditions to find someone to fill his spot. None of the animals seem right for the job, though. Not Elephant, not Ostrich, and most certainly not Puppy. No one has Groundhog’s flair for the dramatic, but is it too late to woo him back into the spotlight?With a fresh take on a familiar event and bold, lively illustrations, this hilarious picture book will leave readers wishing it was Groundhog’s Day year-round.",
