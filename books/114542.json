  "description": "In a war between magic, science, and super-humans, who would win? Ayden, Torril and Jye would do anything to stop that war from happening between their homeworlds â€“ but can they keep from starting their own personal war? In the hopes of finding and stopping the nameless traitors inciting the war, the three young heroes are hand-picked from each of their planets by Dulon, a mysterious stranger, and then flung into a terrifying alien world, where they must either put aside their hatred for each other and weave together their different skills, or be wiped out by a gauntlet of stone giants, monstrous spiders, and deadly elementals - and each other.",
