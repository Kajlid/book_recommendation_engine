  "description": "Nearly forty, Claire Abby had thought life would be a whole lot smoother by now. Single parenting her college-bound daughter is trying, her journalism career is fading, her sister’s a handful, her dad is worse, and her mom has been gone so long it’s hard to remember what it was like when she was here.So it’s both a lucky break and a jaw-dropping distraction when Claire lands an interview with British rock star Christopher Penman. Claire spent her teenage years fantasizing he was her boyfriend. In person, Chris is everything Claire feared—off-the-charts sexy, ridiculously charming, and utterly nerve-wracking. He's not about to discuss the rumors he’s dodged for a decade. She must earn his trust and unearth the truth, but she never banked on the heartbreaking secret behind it.His blockbuster story is her first priority when she returns home, a nearly impossible task when Christopher starts calling. And flirting. There's no denying his wit or his buttery British accent, and once she agrees to see him, it's beyond anything her teenage brain ever imagined. But when Christopher's painful past repeats itself, can Claire smooth out her life and save the man she could never forget?",
