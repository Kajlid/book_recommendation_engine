  "description": "*This is an 18+ just met/ friends to lovers romance with very explicit sex scenes, some kinks, and a HEA!*WILLOWI haven't left the house since the accident that left me blind.My one and only friend- my mom's chef, Marie- persuades me to leave the safety of my home and travel somewhere I've never been. I decide to take a trip to a secluded cabin in Alaska for a month, intending on listening to my fantasy audio books and sitting in front of a cozy fireplace for four weeks. When I arrive, I don't expect the cabin owners son to be the one helping me around during my stay.He's got the whole bad boy vibe about him: sarcastic, tattooed, and moody. He's kind of an asshole.Something happens one night and we become friends, but I want more. Especially when he lets me touch him.KITWillow; the beautiful girl who's renting my dad's cabin.Beautiful, bookish, and blind.That's why I'm helping her for the next month. I'm only doing this job because my mom kicked me out of her house for getting into some legal trouble. Again.So I'm making some money helping Dad with the cabin renters here in freeze-my-balls-off, Alaska.I find helping Willow isn't so horrible. She's different from the girls I'm used to back home. I like that she's quirky and has a wild obsession with fantasy novels. She also makes it so damn hard to be just friends. She wants me, but I don't want to complicate things with sex. So I resist her.Until I can't.",
