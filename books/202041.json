  "description": "The first book in the series, LAZY TOMMY PUMPKINHEAD (1966) concerns slothful Tommy Pumpkinhead, who lives in an \"electric house\" that takes care of all his needs. In the morning, Tommy's bed lifts to the ceiling and plunks him into a tub of water. He then slides down a chute to get into his clothes and is fed breakfast from an \"eating machine.\" When an electrical outage occurs, Tommy's life is turned upside down and he realizes (a bit abruptly) that \"I really must turn over a new leaf.\"",
