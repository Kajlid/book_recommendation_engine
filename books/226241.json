  "description": "Going to an eight-day tropical wedding sounds great, right? Wrong.Elle Sahlstrom hates weddings, but she promised her best friend Tory she'd attend her destination ceremony. That is, despite having to endure obnoxious cousins, bad wine, and a phallus-laden bachelorette party. But that’s not the worst part. The worst part just happened to be sitting next to her on the plane, on his way to the same wedding, guaranteed to be the same insufferable jerk he was years ago.Jackson Proveaux knows Elle hates him with a passion, but it’s that same passion that has him convinced she’s perfect for him. Unfortunately, he made mistakes in the past, mistakes that involved cocktails, out of control minivans, and a giant misunderstanding that cost him his one and only shot with Elle. The French expat sees the wedding as a chance to atone for his sins. He offers to spend a week at Elle's mercy, and if she still hates him at the end, he’ll leave her alone forever.   Unable to resist a win-win deal, or Jackson, Elle agrees. Their arrangement quickly becomes more complicated than either of them could have anticipated. The grumpy environmentalist never thought Jackson would be able to make her laugh, and he didn’t count on the hot-headed beauty dominating him in the bedroom…or the fact that he'd like it.A fiery temper, two sets of handcuffs and copious amounts of tequila are guaranteed to make this situation complicated. As the lovers become more entwined in each other’s lives and hearts, one question remains—will their truce survive the wedding, or are they living on borrowed time?",
