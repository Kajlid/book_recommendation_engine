  "description": "Law of Attraction, Meet the Law of Action  The Law of Attraction tells us that whatever we focus our attention on, consciously or not, we attract into our lives. Think happy thoughts, enjoy happy experiences. And vice-versa. The best selling, \"Begin with Yes\" introduces the Law of Action, a principle that reverses the order - and is equally powerful: What we do affects how we think, and the kinds of experiences we have. When we take small, manageable steps, we feel more positive and our lives flow more smoothly. \"Begin with Yes\" is all about setting things in motion and opening new doors. Getting unstuck. In this short, engaging conversation, counselor, mentor, and motivational speaker Paul Boynton maps out a surprisingly easy, logical, and liberating alternate route to a better life. In short, not only does \"Begin with Yes\" make change seem possible, it provides concrete examples that show the way.",
