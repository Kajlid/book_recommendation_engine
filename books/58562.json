  "description": "Easter Hutton just might have the worst mom in the world. Does she really think her slime-ball boyfriend will divorce his wife just because Mom is pregnant? Missing her best friend and her dad, Easter just wants to blend in at her new school, which proves difÞcult when she starts experiencing involuntary bouts of astral-projection. She can't decide which is worse: these mysterious jaunts or the antics of her selÞsh, eccentric mother. Everything changes when Easter discovers Homefree, an underground organization devoted to helping teenagers, like herself, with paranormal gifts. Suddenly she doesn't feel like an outsider anymore. Maybe a normal life-with real friends and a boyfriend-is possible after all.",
