Except for one subject that never comes up--the fact that Harper has fallen for Clark.Each time they are together, Harper tries to find the courage to tell Clark the truth, but anxiety about how Clark might respond to the news never allows Harper to follow through. Then, one day, the two men find themselves stranded on the side of the road. All alone. It's the perfect time for Harper to open up and admit his feelings.Will Harper take a chance and be honest with Clark? Or will fear keep Harper's life stuck in neutral?
