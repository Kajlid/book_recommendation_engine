Kellen believes her moment girl has finally arrived, but there’s one big problem—she’s a Sealy. The McLins and the Sealys are south Louisiana’s version of the Hatfields and the McCoys.Stevie Sealy left Louisiana for college and didn’t return except for holiday visits with her family. After a breakup with her boyfriend, she decides to move back to the town of Sealy temporarily. She never really understood or wanted to be involved in the family feud with the McLins, but she finds herself right in the middle of it when Kellen McLin walks into her life and changes everything. In this romantic comedy, Robin Alexander weaves a tale about how fast love can happen and how inconvenient it can be.",
