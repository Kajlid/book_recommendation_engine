  "description": "Sharp-tongued Isabelle “Izzy” Constance, the tomboy rock-chick, is sick to death of being: The chick with balls. After a makeover—turning necklines into waistlines—she gets a lot more than she wanted: The deadly, alpha-male rock-star Tristan Hart. Just one problem. He’s taken. And not just by any woman. A supermodel. Legs that go all-the-way-up, she has claws—as long as her five-inch stilettos—dug into Tristan’s heart. Dating good-guy Liam to distract her, there is one thing she did not expect… …He. Wants. Her. And nobody denies Tristan Hart. Flung naked in his bed, things take a turn for the worse. It seems he is hungry for seconds. Most girls would do anything to get into Tristan’s pants, but Izzy will do anything to get out when she incarcerates herself into a bittersweet secret-affair. Sometimes tempting fate can get downright lethal. For Izzy, never has that been truer than the moment she breaks the rules: Never fall in love. She’ll need all the cunning, daring, and luck she can muster, if she is to survive: impossible love triangles; pack of blood-lusting groupies; fist fights and hair-pulling; grudges, betrayals and lies; band practice; her interfering upper-class family; and her rock-star ex is back in town... They say every girl has her secrets. But Izzy isn't the only one hiding something. Tristan has a secret too.\t Their torn affair sets off a chain of twists and turns that will unearth secrets of a past, in which both are rarely what they seem... When carnal urges are astir: Lust is easy. Trust is hard.",
