  "description": "I’ve signed numerous players to my family’s agency—I assumed winning over my next client would be just as easy.The last thing I expected was to run into the boy who took my first kiss and broke my heart: only now Drew Bowman is all grown up.Sexy. Scandal-tainted. Second-string. The crush I never got over.I tell myself work is the reason I can’t get him out of my head. I tell him his talent far outweighs his position, and I know I can help. I lie and lie, because admitting that I want a second chance at my first love is impossible. Some lines cannot be crossed, and ours was drawn in the sand years ago.*** I’m supposed to hate her. I’ve been told so time and again for ten years - her father ruined our family, smeared my name before my career even began.But that’s not what I’m feeling now. Brexton Kincade just strode out of my memories and onto my field. Driven. Determined. Grown up. The Capulet to my Montague.Being with her would be an unforgivable sin against my father, but I can’t resist the pull between us. Even if it means hiding what we have. Even if it means confronting the secrets I’ve always feared were lies.",
