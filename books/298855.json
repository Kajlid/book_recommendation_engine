She either finds the pelts and leaves him and her children, or he destroys it, and she spends the rest of her life longing for the freedom she’s denied.This isn’t that kind of selkie story.For one thing, it’s a woman who does the stealing. And Sela the selkie isn’t content to pine away for the sea. She has other plans.Find out how this selkie rescues herself in this new imagining of a classic fairy tale. This is the fifth installment in the Fractured Fairy Tale Series, and the stories can be read in any order.",
