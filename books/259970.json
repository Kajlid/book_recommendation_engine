  "description": "Was it betrothal or banishment?  Was she being given away or given the world?  The dark corners where souls are exchanged for crowns and title never interested Azaria. Until her father uses her as a political pawn. Ripped from the familiarity and comforts of The Savagelands she is hurled into the Delucre Court.  Cultures clash and tempers flare as the country approaches the brink of rebellion and the Royal family attempts to tame their new savage princess. The unthinkable forces her to walk the swords edge rather than wield it.   If she chooses her moves wisely she may conquer the heart of a nation along with those of her three handsome allies.   This is a Reverse Harem Series recommended for readers 18+",
