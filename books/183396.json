  "title": "Narrative of Thirty-four Years' Slavery and Travels in Africa",
  "description": "This book is the Narrative of PIERRE JOSEPH DUMONT (born 1768), a Native of Paris, who was Thirty-four Years a Slave in Africa.Nearly six months ago, the public journals announced the arrival of a Frenchman at Paris, who had been a slave thirty-four years, and who had almost forgot the language of his native country. I paid little more attention to the notice than I should have done to other articles that fall under ordinary observation; but the same intelligence having been repeated with extraordinary circumstances, the reflections which it gave rise to were an inducement with me to go in search of the person that excited them. After brief explanations as to my object in visiting him, I requested to be favoured with some concise notice on the subject of his misfortunes. Scarcely had he touched on two or three points of his history, when I was forcibly struck with an impression of the powerful sensation that its publicity would create.It was agreed between us, that he should repair to my house every day, to furnish me with data that were to serve as the basis of an history of the thirty-seven years of his absence. His dictations I attended to and collected with a scrupulous precision.This book published in 1819 has been reformatted for the Kindle and may contain an occasional defect from the original publication or from the reformatting.",
