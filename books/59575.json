  "description": "Thomas Mann 1929 Nobel Prize winner. How Mann manages to pull suspense out of a story that everyone knows is just amazing. It's a page turner from start to finish.As Joseph is saved from the well and sold to Egypt, he adopts a new name, Osarseph, replacing the Yo- element with a reference to Osiris to indicate that he is now in the underworld. This change of name to account for changing circumstances encourages Amenhotep to change his own name to Akhenaten.",
