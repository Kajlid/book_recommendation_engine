  "title": "Pathway to the Western World: Growing Up in Korea During Turbulent Times",
  "description": "Pathway to the Western Growing Up in Korea During Turbulent Times is a fragment of social history from the nation building period of the Republic of Korea during the mid-20th century. It is an inspiring first-hand account starting when Korea is a colony under the harsh rule of Imperial Japan. Liberation at the end of World War II is followed by chaos and war as Koreans and foreign actors explore broad social, economic, and political issues that ultimately result in the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula becoming a vibrant, progressive, and democratic nation. The story is authentically narrated by the youngest daughter of a family residing in central Seoul, essentially living at the epicenter of Koreaâ€™s tortured struggle for nationhood. Many ways people cope when subjected to oppression, fear, extreme hardship, and war are revealed. Hope manages to manifest itself even during the most desperate conditions.",
