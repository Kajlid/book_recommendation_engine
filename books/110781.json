  "description": "Hayley loves her roommate Catherine. Who wouldn't? She's beautiful, funny, smart, and considerate. Her only fault is that she's straight. Worse still, she's driving Hayley to distraction and affecting her grades. Faced with the choice of leaving Catherine or losing her scholarship, Hayley comes up with a third option - brainwash Catherine into becoming a lesbian. But that's impossible. Or is it? From the author of The Peripheral Cocksucker Series and Next Year's Model comes a novella of obsessive love, lust, and the seductive power of perfume. A warning to potential readers. This is a story of lesbian romance. There are no well-hung pizza delivery guys slipping it to barely legal college girls, no well-hung stockbrokers spanking their barely legal stepdaughters, and no well-hung teachers nailing naughty co-eds. If that's what you're looking for, you won't find it here. A NOTE TO POTENTIAL This second edition ebook is DRM-free, and has been tested on Amazon's Kindle Fire. It looks fine, but if there are problems using other devices, please let me know and I will fix them. Thanks.",
