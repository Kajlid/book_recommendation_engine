  "description": "Son Brother Lover  The love of Drew Walker’s life left to pursue her dream. He told her to go, forced her to go, knowing that a stripper’s daughter would never be able to escape her mother’s past. In the wake of her leaving, she left him with a broken heart. A heart that he’s held very close to himself for the last ten years.  Daughter Friend Attorney  Charity Thomas has worked hard to get out from under the stigma of being the daughter of Jasmine from Wet Wanda’s. Ten years away from home gave her the distance to grow a backbone; it also gave her enough time to miss the hell out of Drew.  When Meredith Blackfoot entices her back to Bowling Green to deal with a situation at CRISIS, none of them realize the danger they are in. Home invasions, a woman and daughter running for their lives, and an attempt on Charity’s life puts Heaven Hill on alert like they’ve never been before.  When the smoke clears, the bad guys are caught, and Charity is ultimately in Drew’s arms, they can all breathe a sigh of relief. In their hour of need, Charity is finally home.",
