  "title": "Officer Bad Boy",
  "description": "Thirty year old management consultant Melissa Franks has a career that’s on fire. She has a passport filled with stamps to some of the world’s most exotic locations, a wardrobe to die for and a bachelorette pad in one of Washington, D.C.’s trendiest neighborhoods. But, something she desperately needs is missing and she’s at her wits end about how to get it -- some routine, hot loving.  She reluctantly decides to attend the wedding of an old high school pal and one of her worst fears comes to life, again. Her friend wants to set her up with a co-worker, a tall, strapping Marine pilot who she believes there’s no way Melissa will be able to resist. She’s in for the ride of her life when she realizes that 32 year old Colby Roberts is far less an officer and a gentleman than he is a virile man who’s used to having things his way. Will she be able to tame the savage beast inside Colby Roberts or will she find out she prefers the rough and direct approach that’s sure to please in her new Officer Bad Boy?",
