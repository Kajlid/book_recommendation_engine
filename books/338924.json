  "description": "In their latest magical adventure, George and his dragon find themselves in a fairytale kingdom under attack from fearsome troll twins, Gobbledegook and Balderdash. The gruesome twins are destroying everything and everyone in their path. Something must be done! George has a plan, but can it possibly stop such a devious duo? Guaranteed to delight fairytale fans of all ages, this sumptuously illustrated picture book is a testament to M. P. Robertson's belief that more than merely decorating a book, illustration should be integral to the narrative.",
