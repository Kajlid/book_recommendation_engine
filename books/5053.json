  "description": "Scotland Yard Detective Sergeant Jack Gibbons has been shot twice, and even after the surgery he isn't out of the woods and may still be in danger because he can't remember how it all happened. While his colleagues dig into his personal life, his best friend, Phillip Bethancourt, focuses on his last case, the robbery of a collection of antique jewelry valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds. Although Phillip is a man of leisure---handsome, charismatic, and fantastically well off---he makes a point of tagging along on Jack's more interesting cases.But this time it's different. Not only is it personal, but Phillip will have to fill in the blanks without Jack, and retracing his friend's steps may put him in the same line of fire.Trick of the Mind, Cassandra Chan's third clever outing for these best friends, written in the classic tradition with a delightfully modern voice all its own, is a charming story that mystery lovers are sure to enjoy.",
