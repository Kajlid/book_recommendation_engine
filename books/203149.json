  "title": "Albatross: About Quantum Physics, Human Beings and other strange things",
  "description": "Quantum field theory is the less known brother of Particle Physics. But Dr. Rob MacAulay has followed it instinctively all his life, as he has followed the flight of seabirds over the island on which he was born. As the EU fractures around him, this gentle, tall man, with his glasses and his laser pointer under his old tweed jacket, finds himself under the steamroller of politics, and on the run from the police. He alone has solved the Unity Theory, but how does that matter now, as the police are convinced he is a terrorist? He himself is becoming quite terrified. Thomas Heddiman, technical consultant with the police, finds himself both running with the fox and hunting with the hounds as he pursues the man, wondering just how odd a bird Dr. MacAulay is.  Award winning author R. A. MacAvoy (Tea with the Black Dragon, The Grey Horse) joins with artist and storyteller Nancy Palmer to present a tale of the possible future, human anger, and human compassion -- and a man who turns out to be a very odd bird indeed.",
