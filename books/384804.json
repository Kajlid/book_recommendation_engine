  "description": "Tommy is a singer of the most popular rock band which is successful all over the world. Kathrine, a single mother bringing up her five-year-old son, is employed in Tommy's band as a lyricist. Cordell is a typical, depraved rock man who lives from one party to another, not taking anyone into account. However, he has experienced tragic events in his childhood which molded him the way he is now. Kathrina, after terrible experiences with the father of her son, escapes from the past and tries to become accustomed to the new city and new life. But looking at her child, who suffers the consequences of her decisions made in the past, she cannot forget what had happened and she finds it hard to take advantage of virtues of the life. Cordell and Russell start collaborating but from the very beginning they encounter accumulating communication problems. After some time, it emerges that they become important to each other and, as the time goes by, love, which erupts between them, helps them to overcome demons of the past.",
