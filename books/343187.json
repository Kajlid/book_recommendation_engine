  "description": "In 1939, Frank Stiffel was a young Jewish student who held a medical degree and had hopes of a promising literary career. A poet and a dreamer, he hardly seemed cut out for the role of fighter. Yet as the Nazis closed in on him and his family, Stiffel discovered within himself resources that would mean the difference between life and death.Drawn from the secret diary he protected throughout his harrowing existence in the Warsaw Ghetto, Treblinka and Auschwitz, Frank Stiffel recreates the horror and miracle of that life - with unprecedented honesty.For Stiffel had a mystical Ring, a cameo with the face of a beautiful girl who appeared in his dreams to warn him of danger. With the ring and his simple unbendable rule - keep your dignity or die - he became one of a tiny minority to survive.During his final flight to freedom in the back of a chestnut wagon, Frank Stiffel woke once again to the exquisite face on the ring. Only this time she was real. Her name was Ione. She and Stiffel were soon married, and the promise of the ring was fulfilled at last.",
