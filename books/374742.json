  "description": "Continuing where her hugely successful Voluptuous Delights left off, best selling author Sophie Dahl offers up a seasonal almanac of bountiful dishes alongside warm food-filled memories and musings.Taking a gastronomic journey through the seasons, from the Victorian Beeton era to a recent sodden Parisian evening, Dahl captures the smoke filled days of Autumn with a nostalgic Squash and Parmesan soup, the blooming warmth of an English garden in high summer with Grilled Peaches with Pistachios and Ricotta; and the burgeoning beginnings of Spring with a Butter Lettuce, Lobster and Crayfish Salad.Bursting with moreish yet nutritious recipes for budding foodies and seasoned gourmets alike, stunning photography and Sophieâ€™s delightfully quirky illustrations, this latest offering promises pleasure, indulgence and of course, simple, good food.",
