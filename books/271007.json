  "description": "From Stan Lee, the pop culture legend behind Marvel’s The Avengers, Black Panther, X-Men, Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, and Iron Man, comes a major literary event featuring two heroic teenagers—one born with extraordinary gifts, one unwillingly transformed. Together they can change the world…or put it in the destructive hands of a danger beyond imagination. Set in Stan Lee’s Alliances Universe, co-created by Lee, Luke Lieberman, and Ryan Silbert, and along with Edgar Award–nominated co-writer Kat Rosenfield, Stan Lee delivers a novel packed with the pulse-pounding, breakneck adventure and the sheer exuberant invention that have defined his career as the creative mastermind behind Marvel’s spectacular universe.",
