Ginger's not about to be pushed around by the superintendent, and investigates the case on her own--taking her into the spicy world of burlesque dancers--despite his warnings: if she doesn't butt out, she'll be arrested for impeding a police investigation.Despite Ginger and Basil's strained friendship, they agree to work together to find the killer. It's a proposition neither one may survive.",
