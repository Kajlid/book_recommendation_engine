  "description": "Murder's on the menu in this savory debut.Gwen (nee Katz) Silver heard the brisket at her uncle's Jewish deli, Murray the Pastrami Swami--the only one of its kind in Nashville, Tennessee--was \"to die for\". But she didn't realize that meant literally... When Gwen learns she's inherited Murray's, the native New Yorker leaves her chaotic career and messy divorce behind to start over in Nashville. But the venture seems doomed from the start. Murray has taken his recipes and secret list of food suppliers to the grave with him, and ruthless real estate developer Royce Sinclair will stop at nothing to try and sandwich Murray's into his already overstuffed portfolio. Then, on Kosher Karaoke Night, longtime customer Buster Sergeant bites into his brisket... and bites the dust. The coroner says food poisoning, but Gwen's not convinced. Now, with the help of hunky police detective \"Nashville Katz\"--as Gwen is quickly nicknamed--will find herself adding \"private investigator\" to her resume--and a new love to her life.",
