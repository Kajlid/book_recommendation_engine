Michael has broken up with her, her bff Lilly won't speak to her, and her parents are forcing her to see a therapist. Even J.P.'s efforts to cheer Mia up (he's being really sweet!) aren't helping.Just when things couldn't get worse, Mia discovers a long-forgotten diary of a teenage princess of Genovia. It could be just the inspiration Mia needs to write her speechâ€”but what it reveals might change everything.",
