  "title": "Two Songs: Song of Prisoner & Song of Malaya",
  "description": "Poet, philosopher and artist, these poems from the distinguished Ugandan writer won the 1972 Kenyatta Prize for Literature. Song of Prisoner confronts the tragedy of Africa's decade of freedom. He traverses the whole spectrum of her political sickness and contrasts it with the enduring reality of the bush - roots of family and clan, and the optimism of Africa's children in the face of hunger, hardship and humiliation. Song of MalayaI, in lighter vein and contrast, is a harshly beautiful, lusty farce about the hypocrisy and cant of Africa's modern moralists.",
