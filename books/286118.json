  "description": "They say you never forget your first love. Clearly, they haven’t tried hard enough. I’ve spent five years forgetting about Christopher Hastings.  His gentle touch? A distant memory. Those gorgeous hazel eyes? Long gone. The sparks that flew when we kissed? Wiped from my mind.  Now my life is going exactly the way I want it to. I landed a teaching job at my old elementary school. I’m happy again. Everything’s perfect.  Imagine my surprise when I find out my school’s gym teacher is none other than Christopher Hastings.  Cue panic attack.  But it doesn’t matter how good he fills out those basketball shorts—I’ve moved on. At least that’s what I keep telling myself. If only my heart would get the memo.  They say you never forget your first love, and it looks like Christopher is determined to make sure I never forget mine.",
