  "title": "The Variant Effect: Skin Eaters",
  "description": "VARION was a popular medication that could cure anything from Anxiety and Depression to Schizophrenia and Zoophagia. Everybody took it back in the day, because there were no side effects ... AT FIRST. By the time they learned about the Variant Effect it was too late. The old building in a rundown part of Metro was a perfect place to find a body, but they wouldn't have dragged Joe Borland out of retirement if it still had its skin. It's been twenty years since Borland battled the Variant Effect, and twenty since he let his partner get skinned alive. Now both of them are ordered back into action to meet a terrifying new threat. This eBook is also available in the Official Variant Effect Collector Pack.",
