  "description": "A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERBalram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem—but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations.Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international sensation—and a startling, provocative debut.AN INDIE NEXT LIST PICKA BOOK OF THE YEAR, 2008, THE SUNDAY TIMES (LONDON)A BEST BUSSINESS BOOK OF 2008, FAST COMPANY MAGAZINEA BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR, NEWSDAYA FAVORITE READ OF THE YEAR, USA TODAY",
