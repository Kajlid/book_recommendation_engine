  "description": "Sir Walter Scott—who invented the historical novel—is still the writer to whom we turn when we seek the undiluted pleasures of narrative romance.  His Rob Roy (1817) is a rousing tale of skulduggery and highway robbery, villainy and nobility, treasonous plots and dramatic escapes—and young love.  From London to the North of England to the Scottish Highlands, it follows the unjustly banished young merchant's son Francis as he strives to out-maneuver the unscrupulous adventurer plotting to destroy him—and allies himself with the cunning, dangerous, and dashing outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor in a heroic effort to regain his rightful place and win the hand of the girl he loves. (Book Jacket Not Jacketed)",
