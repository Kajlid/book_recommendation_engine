  "description": "When Lee first sees her, he is a straight-A middle school student without many friends. After he falls in the school cafeteria and his lunch splatters everywhere, he hears nothing but laughter. As he lies on the cold floor-embarrassed beyond belief and wishing he was anywhere but there-he suddenly feels a hand on his shoulder. Lee slowly looks up into the beautiful emerald green eyes of Autumn, not realizing that she is the girl who will eventually change his life forever. Two years later, Lee has become best friends with Ryan, the superstar athlete of his school. As the two friends become better athletes and better people, Lee's social skills flourish-along with his friendship with Autumn. But when Autumn and Lee begin their freshman year in high school, everything changes the day they share their first kiss and make a pact to stay best friends forever. As quickly as Lee and Autumn begin falling in love, they are torn apart by challenges that neither could have ever foreseen. In Forever and a Day, a young man takes a remarkable journey through friendship, family, and unconditional love-and learns that everything happens for a reason.",
