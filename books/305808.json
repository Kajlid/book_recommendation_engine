You know, the Piper exacted a steep price on a town that cheated him out of his bounty, taking all the village children away in the dead of night. But left untold was the unspeakable revenge the townspeople exacted on the Pipe. A revenge that gave birth to a terrible curse, a curse that transformed the Piper into an immortal being of terrible power. Present day Florida; a gifted musical student is teased relentlessly at the boarding school he attends. When a mysterious stranger presents him with a book that includes an ages old incantation he unleashes the curse and summons the one being that will do his bidding for the steepest price. Itâ€™s time to pay The Piper!",
