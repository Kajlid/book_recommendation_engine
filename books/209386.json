  "description": "A Menage Erotic Romance\n I shouldn’t want this, shouldn’t want them, and I definitely shouldn’t want all the dirty things they do – not just to me but to each other. Except I do want it. I want it so bad I can’t keep my head straight. Why does dirty have to feel so damn good? It’s lust, simple as that. No strings, just two guys, a girl and a whole lot of filth. I can handle that. Sure I can. No big deal… it’s not like I’m going to fall for them or anything, right?  *** \n    Sexy Italian Max has had the starring role in some hot dreams and wild nights for Lauren. Now she will be living with him, leaving her life in Seattle behind while she works for his company in Rome, Italy. There she meets gorgeous Englishman Steve, who is also rooming at Max’s villa. Soon crazy ideas start to form in Lauren’s mind about having both men in her bed. When Lauren’s fantasy becomes reality, the two sex gods take her to heights of filthy pleasure she never imagined possible. So what could possibly go wrong? *** Advisory: vivid erotica and scenes involving BDSM, MF, MFM, MMF. All consensual. Most definitely 18+ only.",
