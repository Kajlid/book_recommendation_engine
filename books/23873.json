  "description": "An irresistibly appealing puppy named Hugs sets out one morning on a quest. He asks every animal he meets for a kiss, and they are all happy to oblige. The pup discovers that duck's kisses are hard and wet; a horse's kiss is a little sticky, but very warm; the pig's kiss is a little muddy and bristly, tickley but tender. He collects lots of wonderful kisses, but when he returns home, he discovers that the best kiss of all is the one he gets from his loving mother.",
