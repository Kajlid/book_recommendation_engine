  "description": "What’s not love when a quartet of cousins visit their wacky uncle’s private island, complete with horror-themed amusement park, on Halloween? The attraction is closed to the public for the night, too, so they have it all to themselves! No crowds! No lines! No waiting! A personal tour guide to take them around from attraction to attraction! But then, one by one, they start feeling not-so-well. Strange things seem to be happening. Is that a real werewolf lurking around in the shadows? Miss Penny’s only wearing a witch outfit, isn’t she? “Anything’s possible when you’re spending Halloween Night on Monster Island, a fun light-hearted read I’d particularly like to see made into a graphic novel or animated feature.” ~ Christine’s Horror Fiction Reviews This is the large print edition of Halloween Night On Monster Island, with a larger font / typeface for easier reading.",
