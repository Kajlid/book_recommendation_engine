  "description": "The Undead Day Sixteen The UK's best-selling zombie horror series Now a best-selling audio book series on Audible A new landscape was formed after the storm and with it the promise of a new beginning. One race to dominate this land. One race to survive. Words were uttered beneath the Saxon while Howie fought the undead. Words that brought a whole new pressure. To be relentless and unceasing. To charge forward and never give up. To do what it takes to survive. That pressure was building and it became too much. Howie faltered, losing his mind as they ran through the fog and sought the doctors so desperately needed at the fort. The final act was a simple one. A stubborn man spoke through an intercom at the munitions factory and his words sparked such a reaction in Howie that he fell apart in front of those who love him the most. The Undead continues with Day Sixteen",
