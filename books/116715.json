  "description": "Christmas is an important time for celebration, reflection, and reunion in the black community. Grounded in the historical experiences of black people in this country, these stories are part of the African-American storytelling tradition that has taken literary form. The Christmas theme is used somewhat as a pretext to explore larger issues in the African-American community, issues closely related to the concerns and dilemmas black people faced from 1890 to 1915. The stories indicate how varied, complex, and exciting the world in which our ancestors lived was, and how similar issues still concern us today.",
