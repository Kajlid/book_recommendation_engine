  "description": "\"I never did get the hang of coin-operated public showers, but nailed sneaking shots of vodka from the freezer while my husband filled up the gas tank.\" Does your marital bucket list include an extended road trip across America? Have you ever wondered what it would be like to sell everything and start fresh someplace new? Are you looking for a road trip resource that will share the reality of all that togetherness, rather than an edited narrative full of sunshine? If so, this book is for you. In January of 2012, Sonja Millings took an early retirement from the fast-paced corporate world of publishing, and reluctantly accompanied her new husband on his lifelong dream of traveling across the country in a small RV with their Golden Retriever. Prior to the trip, they had never spent more than two consecutive weeks together. What could possibly go wrong? After selling almost everything they owned and renting out their house for a year, they set off on what would become the ultimate test of their new marriage. Endless months on the road provided the perfect opportunity for Sonja to look back on her life and brutally examine her role in past relationships, fully grieve the loss of family members, and challenge lifelong destructive patterns of behavior. It only took 14 months and 38,000 miles. Soul searching across America became an unexpected gift after turning off the noise, getting rid of the clutter, and clearing away the distractions of a busy life.",
