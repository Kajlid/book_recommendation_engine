  "description": "For those who loved \"The Three Kiss Clause\" comes the follow up featuring everyone's favorite character, Shoshana, in her own HEA. Blurb:I just opened my eyes and I can't believe what I'm seeing. Both of us seem to be missing our clothes, but that's not the most shocking part of this situation--it's that my arch enemy, cocky ass male influencer and overall jerk, Conor Durden, is sprawled out on my sheets, naked as the day he was born.I don't remember last night, but I think I broke the cardinal rule: DO NOT SLEEP WITH CONOR.I swore to myself that no matter how hot he is, and no matter how much his alpha male persona secretly makes me melt inside, I'd never end up here after what he did to me. I'm Shoshana. I have my own YouTube channel called The Boyfriend Designer where I ask women about their ideal guy. But last night has left me with a question of my own: did I just become Conor's girlfriend, or another one of his many conquests? Guess I'll find out soon enough.",
