Ghosts, or even second chances at life?Losing someone is one of the hardest things imaginable, for Jaylynn-first it was her father-and then it was him.

He, who had promised her he would never leave her just as her father had. Jace, the war hero. High School senior, Jaylynn doesn't know how to cope with this new loss, and when Jagger-a boy that reminds her entirely too much of Jace enters her world- trouble will brew as secrets and mysteries are unraveled.This book will be posted as a blog story on my blog by chapter two weeks at a time, in September the full edition will be available for order.http://natalievaldes.blogspot.com/",
