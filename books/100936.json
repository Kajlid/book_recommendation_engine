So when her professor introduces Ryan Matthews, the new TA, she writes him off in a second. Tall, hotter than hell—clearly a major ego case. Whatever. Guys like him don’t notice girls like her.

Then, only months before finishing his doctorate under an assumed name, he walks into his advisor’s freshman Calculus class and sees her. Alex Reed. The last thing he needs. Young, inexperienced—and off limits. But when someone who shouldn't follows her across campus at night, he’s forced to do something about it.What happens next will change their lives forever.Reader discretion is advised.
