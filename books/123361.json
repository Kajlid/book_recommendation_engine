  "description": "A connection others don't understand... A love that won't be denied... Danger they can sense but cannot see... Dar Roberts was always ruthless and single-minded...until she met Kerry Stuart. Kerry was oppressed by her family's wealth and politics. But Dar saved her from that. Now new dangers confront them from all sides. While traveling to Chicago, Kerry's plane is struck by lightning. Dar, in New York for a stockholders' meeting, senses Kerry is in trouble. They simultaneously experience feelings that are new, sensations that both are reluctant to admit when they are finally back together. Back in Miami, a cover-up of the worst kind, problems with the military, and unexpected betrayals will cause more danger. Can Kerry help as Dar has to examine her life and loyalties and call into question all she's believed in since childhood? Will their relationship deepen through it all? Or will it be destroyed?",
