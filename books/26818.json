  "description": "My passion for writing stems back to the wide range of publications I studied in my childhood days, I possess an enthusiasm of every genres from fiction to nonfiction books and assume that the Russian, American, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, French and German novels and poems have made it easier for me develop my very own visualization in terms of creating story plots. I read through terrific literary masterpieces authored by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, Karin Boye, Émile Zola, August Strindberg, Alexander Dumas, Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. I have as well read through a few oriental books from authors in 5th millennium. My childhood’s goals were stashed with heroes of their tales.I became motivated by one among Alexander Dumas’s collections (Joseph Balsamo) and composed my very first fiction when I was ten years old. When I was 13 years old I composed my very first screenplay and offered to one of the most popular filmmakers who was an associate of my dad. The tale was about poverty. I was impacted by one of Dostoyevsky’s books. I desired to be just like him. I was enthusiastic about his literary stunning success.The film producer told my dad that he would like to have a dialogue with me. It turned out a cold rainy day on a Wednesday morning. My father picked me up at school and took me to his place of work. After compliments and asking me certain cliché queries which grownups normally do, he asked me to read a segment of my synopsis. After that he said: “If you would like to illustrate about the rain you must stand under it, experience it and then write about it. It is advisable to write about issues that are important to you. Compose a tale about yourself, friends and family and your ambitions.” he said.Put them in practice that was the very word he said to me and it was really a great piece of advice. Even after he died two years later, I didn’t forget the excellent pieces of advice he gave to me.For me, writing poems is a form of therapy, a way to process my feelings and experiences in a cathartic and therapeutic way. Whether I'm feeling sad, happy, or somewhere in between, I find that writing poetry helps me make sense of my emotions and find a sense of clarity and peace.One of the things I love most about writing poetry is the freedom it offers. Unlike other forms of writing that may be more structured or constrained, poetry allows for an almost limitless range of expression. Whether I'm experimenting with different forms, exploring different themes or subjects, or simply playing with language and sound, there is always room to explore and experiment when writing poetry.Poetry can be a powerful way to share our experiences and perspectives with others, to find common ground and understanding, and to build bridges between individuals and communities. I always feel a sense of connection and community when engaging with poetry.Of course, like any creative pursuit, writing poetry can also be challenging at times. There are days when the words don't come easily or when I struggle to find the right form or structure for a particular poem. But even on those days, I find that the act of writing and the process of working through those challenges is its own reward.Ultimately, my love of writing poems comes down to the sheer joy and fulfillment it brings me. Whether I'm scribbling lines in a notebook or typing away on my computer, there is a sense of magic and wonder that comes with the act of creation. And for that reason, I know that I will continue to write poems for as long as I am able, always striving to capture and convey the beauty and complexity of the world around me in words.In this book, I present you my poems about nature, the elements, human emotions, my feelings and thoughts, struggles, disappointments in form of metaphor and message of hope and having faith that all will be alright. I hope you like them.",
