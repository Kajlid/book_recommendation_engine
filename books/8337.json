  "description": "Eight years ago, ultra-sensible Kelly Burke left her zany family in a desperate attempt to lead a normal life. When she gets the news that a ruggedly handsome man has moved in on her grandmother -- and the family finances -- she rushes home to send him packing, without the Burke fortune! But once back in the center of her beloved but outlandish clan--pet tigers and all--Kelly discovers that Seth Ralston is far more of a threat to her heart than to her family. For his smile makes her traitorous pulse race, no man should have a body that sinfully gorgeous, and his kisses...oh, those kisses create total meltdown. Suddenly Kelly discovers an unexpected aptitude for being \"wild and exciting\" herself-- and loving it. The question is, is this just a fun fling? Or is Seth a man who'll stay...for life?
