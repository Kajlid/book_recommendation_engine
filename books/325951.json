  "description": "SkyI’ve been hit with a Cupid’s arrow, and I can’t seem to break free of its hold.No, not a Cupid. More like a Demon’s curse.He has me trapped, drowning in the deep brown of his irises.I’m confined and bound by the devilish smirk that lines his sinful mouth.No matter how hard my mind tries to convince me to leave,My heart begs to stay exactly where I am, A prisoner to Hail O’Brien.HailI wish I never laid eyes on her, the girl whose face brings me nightmares of another.She’s a sinful package wrapped in an angel’s bow and I’m the Demon ripping it open.I tried to turn my back, to let her go but I’m too weak.I’ll use the excuse of protecting her to stick around but one day soon,She’ll be nothing but a distant memory, a name on a tombstone, Sky Martin.**This is Sky and Hail's story and even though it will have an HEA. The plot will continue into the next and final book***",
