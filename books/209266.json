Cade Adams saved mine.One kill has changed everything.Since I eradicated the world’s most dangerous demon, the Fallen factions are out for blood, and their target is my family: Genesis—the Origin of humanity. The only way to protect my legacy against an ancient prophecy threatening to take me out is to resume my reign as Chayah, Eternal Mother. But I can't remember her. My own secrets are buried so deep, even I can't reach them.One secret could destroy us all.Thousands of years loving Cade and five lifetimes leading Genesis are lost to me. While I've been off fighting to remember my own life, my family's been fighting each other. Our own demons just may destroy humanity's only defense against the darkness before the Eternal war has even begun.Sometimes the most dangerous battle is the war within ourselves.",
