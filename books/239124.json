  "description": "Ashrac’s life is filled with adventure when it comes to his experiments to make the world a better place for humans in his realm. It is not, however, prepared for a woman and most definitely not a mate.  Everything goes out the window when Ashrac’s dragon shifter body decides it’s time to mate. With no time on his hands, Ashrac decides the Paranormal Dating Agency is just what he needs to quickly arrange a kidnapping so he’ll have a mate with little fuss.  Flora has everything she wants and she likes her life exactly as it is. Her brothers’ insistence that she needs a man in her life is a pain in her behind and she’s unwilling to listen. When her friend Gerri calls and asks for a favor, Flora is happy to put a certain uppity dragon shifter in his place and agrees to go on a date with him to do it. When Ashrac kidnaps her all bets are off and putting the dragon in his place is less important than removing his head from his neck.  Flora has a secret and using her special powers on the arrogant red dragon is a feather in her eagle shifter cap. Forget he’s as sexy as sin and find a way home is her plan.  As everyone knows, when you make plans the goddess laughs and that’s exactly what will happen when you read Dragons Don’t Lie.",
