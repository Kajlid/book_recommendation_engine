Much to my family’s disapproval, I stick with what works for me: casual relationships.So why the hell did I agree to a pretend relationship with my neighbour?Because Emma is an adorable wreck who I want writhing beneath me?Maybe.Because there’s something about that sweet, quirky, clumsy woman that gets under my skin?Probably.But the blame lies mainly with my well-intentioned family and meddlesome small town. Because in return for helping Emma navigate the dating world, she agreed to be my pretend girlfriend to keep my family off my back.After our arrangement ends, we’ll part ways.Now I just have to avoid her adoring gazes, keep my hands from exploring her smooth skin, and remind myself not to devour her pouty lips.That’s the way it has to be.Because Emma’s past has made her crave what she’s never experienced—attachments and love—and I plan to stay far away from both.___________The Landry Love Series is a set of interconnected, standalone, small-town romance novels.Landry Love SeriesBook One: The Experiment (Jess & Emma)Book Two: The Denial Game (Taylor & Lauren)Book Three: The Forever Plan (Evan & Willa)Book Four: The Love Words (Hayden & Chloe)",
