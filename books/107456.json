  "description": "Long overshadowed by Jane Eyre, Villette is widely admired as one of Charlotte BrontÃ«s finest works. This story of a young teacher at a girls school in the city of Villette is a particular challenge for the young reader for it requires maturity of vision, a fine narrative sense and a command of French! Mandy Weston, a newcomer to Naxos AudioBooks, tells the story magnificently.",
