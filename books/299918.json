  "description": "Alísa was born to lead her clan of dragon slayers, but her vocal stammer has robbed her of confidence and respect. If she can't lead slayers, how on A'dem is she supposed to lead dragons?As the only child of a dragon slayer chief, Alísa's purpose should have been simple: lead the clan in ridding humankind of the dragon scourge. But while gaining respect from hardened warriors is difficult enough with a vocal stammer, when they learn her empathic powers connect uncontrollably to the dragon enemy, it becomes impossible.Confidence shattered, Alísa resigns herself to silent service under her father's apprentice. But when her growing connection reveals one dragon's capacity for good, she realizes the war isn't as black and white as the slayers teach. Now Alísa faces an impossible choice: stay with her family in comfortable but condemning silence, or follow the dragon claiming to know her true purpose.",
