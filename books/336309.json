  "description": "Welcome to America, 2073, where what you believe depends on what the Trucast Corporation tells you. The Eagle’s Hammer, the network’s pride and joy, is a paramilitary death squad whose exploits are broadcast daily. You, the viewer at home: you watch as the team hunts down and murders alleged criminals, live for all to see. Not because you want to watch, but because you have to. It’s the law. Taylor Evans, he’s the team’s celebrated leader. He gets the close-up, again and again. And he gets the kill, night after night. But when he finally refuses to pull the trigger, now it’s Evans on the run. Fleeing into the sewers, he discovers a budding resistance movement — this group, they believe Evans can be the leader they desperately need: a real American hero. But what does Evans believe? Having been a network-created monster his entire life, he struggles to see himself as anything else. Enter Patrisse Flynn, a mysterious member of the resistance — and the woman who should be leading the country out of this nightmare. She doesn’t think too highly of Evans, not after all the innocent lives he’s taken. But Evans finds her inspiring nonetheless — maybe he can be a hero after all. Together, they square off against the network itself, determined to bring it down in flames...You, the viewer: you can’t get enough of this. It sounds like the perfect recipe for a revolution, right? But maybe it’s a little too good. Could all of this — Evans going AWOL, the resistance, Patrisse — could it all just be a part of the show? Is the Trucast Corporation still pulling the strings? Brutal and raw, The Eagle’s Hammer leaves you guessing until the very end.",
