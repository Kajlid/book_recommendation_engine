  "description": "The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach…At least that’s what Miss Hazel Hughes thinks. As a self-appointed Mountie matchmaker, she knows she’s found the right woman for one very hungry man when she meets professional chef Tilly Conway. Suffering from the fallout of a scandal that wasn’t her fault, Tilly finds herself jobless, homeless and…hopeless. When Miss Hazel offers her a chance to start a new life in British Columbia as a mail-order bride, Tilly lets fate decide her future. Nolan Wheeler has never met a meal he didn’t like. Well, didn’t *eat* anyway. Naturally, he hopes his bride can do more than boil water, but he wants so much more in a wife than the ability to cook. He wants a partner to join him on adventures, laugh at his dumb jokes and, most importantly, want lots and lots of babies.As Nolan and Tilly grow closer, she can’t help thinking her noble Mountie deserves so much better than a wife with a scandalous past. When she finally musters the courage to share her painful story, his reaction leaves her more uncertain than ever. Will Nolan be able to see beyond her history or is Tilly doomed to start her life over…again?Mail Order Mounties is a multi-author series set in Canada during the early 1900s. Join authors Kirsten Osbourne, Kay P. Dawson, Cassie Hayes and Amelia Adams as they bring you stories of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police and the mail-order brides who love them.",
