  "description": "Serial killers are riveting because they appear as normal humans—a neighbor, a mailman, a relative—but underneath it all, there is no humanity. The PVP Killer, named after the three letters that he leaves at his murder scenes, is a new serial killer in Detroit. The only characteristics about the killer that Detective Tobias Rodriguez can determine is that he’s inhumane, unstable, and still bloodthirsty. Tobias' new partner, Detective Lauren Williams, realizes that the killer is staging his murder scenes like deaths from video games. Tobias is initially unreceptive toward Lauren, but when the killer takes an interest in her, his emotions become tangled and irrepressible. The murders are set up like games and there are only two ways to finish a game: win or die.Tobias and Lauren's story continues in A Trinity of Death",
