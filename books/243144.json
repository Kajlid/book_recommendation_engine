  "description": "The greatest love songs break your heart. When I meet Julian Ashburn, the reclusive frontman of indie-rock legends Breaking Giants, I do what any sane woman would do. Embarrass myself, then insult him. Because you only live once, right?Besides, keeping my distance from the enigmatic, songwriting genius is an act of self-preservation. Julian is dangerous--a pool of kerosine to my pyromaniac. I have a weakness for broken men.But sometimes the stories we tell and the songs we sing--about family, love, and ourselves--have to be rewritten in order for us to grow. Call it fate, or stars aligning, or cosmic accident, but I'm about to find out that of the two of us, Julian isn't the broken one.",
