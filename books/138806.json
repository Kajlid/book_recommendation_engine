  "description": "In this witty rom-com follow-up to Hate to Fake it to You, Jean’s fling with a resort guest turns into a case of mistaken identities in the rugged wilds of South Dakota.The last thing reluctant resort employee Jean Harrington expected to find on a middle-of-the-night towel run was a bashful scientist in desperate need of company . . . and clothes. Charmed by his awkwardness and endearing tangents about reptiles, she returns the next day to give the handsome mystery guest she knows only as “Charlie” lessons in poker.He’s reserved and she’s chaotic, but together, the two of them just click. Their connection might almost scare the commitment-shy Jean if it was more than fun and games. Or so Jean chooses to believe, until she discovers there’s a lot more to Charlie’s story than shyness and snakes—and she isn’t the only person with a pressing interest in his whereabouts, not to mention his secretly scandalous dating history. When Charlie has the audacity to abandon her without a word, Jean responds like any self-respecting spurned woman with a score to settle. Assuming a false identity, she pursues him across an ocean to stage a confrontation at the centennial celebration for the famous family business he neglected to mention. With their exes around to raise the stakes, Jean is gambling she can get the upper hand before Charlie calls her bluff. The real trick will be remembering what they’re playing for, when the biggest risk is putting all their cards on the table.",
