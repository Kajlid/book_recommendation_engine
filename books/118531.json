  "description": "A mystery story set in a German town: Who had stolen the priceless blue gloxinia? How had it been taken from the experimental greenhouse? Many people coveted the plant, perhaps enough to resort to stealing, but only an employee of the nursery would have had access to it. The evidence pointed strongly to the young red-haired apprentice, Fridolin. Aloof and sullen, he did little to defend himself. But ten-year-old Annegret, daughter of the nursery owner, was not convinced of his guilt.",
