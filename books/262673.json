  "description": "Labelled a \"traitor's\" child, Nicole is desperate for acceptance since her recent move to dangerously polarized small-town South Africa. Soon, the bruised vulnerability of the white ballerina collides with the untamable desire of Naseem, a notorious Indian rebel. The intensity of their bond becomes obvious to their families, her brother and Mosh, Naseem's closest confidant and township activist, who cannot accept his new rival's presence.Upon being whisked across the globe, an exquisite socialite lures Nicole into glamorous superficiality. She fails, however, to grasp the sensitive balance between Naseem and Nicole until betrayal and death spiral Nicole into depravation, while Naseem confronts his own bloodlust.Set against the historical tightrope of Apartheid South Africa and the hedonism of 1980s Greece, Ronel Golden's Nicole is a romantic, political thriller that will \"have your heart pounding\" and ultimately \"take your breath away\".",
