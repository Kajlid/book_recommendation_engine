  "description": "Sean Reilly and Tess Chaykin, heroes of Raymond Khoury's bestselling Templar thrillers, return in an edge-of-your-seat story that reaches from the present day back to 1800s Mexico-and possibly beyond. What if there was an herb, previously lost to history in the jungles of Central America, capable of inducing an experience so momentous it might shake the very foundations of Western civilization? What if powerful forces on both sides of the law got wind of that herb, and launched a violent, uncompromising pursuit to be the first to exploit it? And what if FBI agent Sean Reilly and his girlfriend, Tess Chaykin, were, unknowingly, the only two people who could keep the lid on this existential Pandora's box, one that's capable of destabilizing the world?  In Raymond Khoury's million-copy-selling Templar novels, Sean and Tess traveled the globe to unravel ancient mysteries with present-day ramifications. In \"The Devil's Elixir,\" Sean and Tess find themselves in a race-against the clock, against drug kingpins, and even against the DEA-to merge two divergent trails, one several hundred years old, the other as current as a heartbeat, which together may lead humanity to the brink of annihilation.  Packed with the nonstop suspense and unexpected twists Raymond Khoury's fans delight in, \"The Devil's Elixir\" is destined for bestseller lists everywhere.",
