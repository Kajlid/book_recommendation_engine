  "description": "In 2008, the University of the Free State was thrust into the international spotlight when the racist Reitz video became public. Have South Africans changed in any significant way since 1994, or are black and white still constrained by racial stereotypes? This is the question American-born Donna Bryson asks herself as she goes to investigate the tensions on the UFS campus.
