  "description": "Telling the story of the nineties through the TV that we watched and the people who made it, this is a kiss under the mistletoe with the shows the defined a nation and a fumble with the things that fell through the cracks. From \"Bullseye\" to B*Witched, Ben Baker takes a nostalgic potter through the past whilst documenting its impact on the present. Its an era where we said \"Eh-oh\" to the Teletubbies and goodbye to the Trotters, Noel Edmonds was everywhere and people nervously waited out the Millennium and the end of times it would inevitably bring. A time where mobile phones, the internet and DVD were becoming an affordable reality yet co-existed in a world where Bamboozle on Teletext, the Funfax and VHS cassette labels marked in red ink “MUM’S TAPE – SOLDIER SOLDIER – DO NOT TOUCH” were still a regular sight in many homes. It was the nineties and it feels like it happened only two minutes ago and simultaneously in another lifetime. Lets escape the present together, shall we?",
