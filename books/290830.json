  "description": "“There’s only one rule tonight: no regrets.” Those were the last words my best friend spoke to me.\n  A month ago, my best friend went missing sometime during the night of the annual summer beach party.  The police found her the next day--broken and bloody behind a dumpster.  Four boys were last seen with her. Heirs of Westhaven. Arrogant. Untouchable. Richer than God, with power to match.  The police barely questioned them before moving on to other suspects.  But I need to know what happened, and there was only one way to get close enough to that crowd.  A week ago, I enrolled in Westhaven Prep.  Yesterday, I ditched my piercings, my hair dye, and torn jeans.  Today, I camouflage myself in a plaid skirt, knee-highs, and a beauty queen smile. They take the bait I dangle before them.  Tomorrow, I’ll have them right where I want them.  Soon, one of them will pay.  MALICE is the first in The Heirs of Westhaven series. It is an enemies-to-lovers, contemporary, new adult why-choose romance.  Recommended for mature readers due to language and sensitive content.",
