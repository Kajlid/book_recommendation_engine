  "description": "Wemberly worried about everything. Big things. Little things. And things in between. Then it was time for school to start. And Wemberly worried even more.  If you ever worry (or know someone who does), this is the book for you. Wemberly worried about spilling her juice, about shrinking in the bathtub, even about snakes in the radiator. She worried morning, noon, and night. \"Worry, worry, worry,\" her family said. \"Too much worry.\" And Wemberly worried about one thing most of her first day of school. But when it's time to go back to school and she meets a fellow worrywart in her class, Wemberly realizes that school is too much fun to waste time worrying! This warm and comforting back-to-school favorite is from Kevin Henkes, the nationally bestselling and celebrated creator of  Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse ,  Kitten's First Full Moon , and  Chrysanthemum. “This winning heroine speaks to the worrywart in everyone.” — Publishers Weekly  (starred review)",
