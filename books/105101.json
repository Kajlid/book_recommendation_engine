But one of the twins will be king, unless Prince Tansy accepts help from a green Biddlebum Toad!A delightful retelling of the little-known German fairy tale \"Puddocky,\" this fifth Princess Tale from Newbery Honor author Gail Carson Levine shows that nothing is quite as it seems and that anything is possible, with a dash of magic and a barrel of love.",
