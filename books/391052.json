  "description": "For Laura, dating Craig, an air force pilot, has been nothing but great. Bonding with Craig’s three housemates who served with him has been an experience in military closeness and deep admiration for men in uniform. The news that they’ve shared everything, including women, is arousing and a bit of a challenge. And Laura wants to take it on. The guys ease her into action, and soon, she can’t imagine life any other way….even if one of the guys is a bit reserved with her. But Laura's biggest adjustment will be to their weird work schedule. Three months on duty and three months on her!",
