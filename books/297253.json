  "description": "A passionate, utterly addictive standalone MM romance from #1 NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely performed with duet narration by Joe Arden and Shane East!Every bartender should follow one simple rule—don't go home with the customers. That’s been easy for me to stick to, until the night a cocky, confident, and sinfully charming hockey star walks into my bar. This sexy athlete is too hard to resist, especially when he makes it clear how much he wants the “sarcastic, witty, hot AF” guy behind the bar—also known as me.Still, I’m not keen on breaking my own rules since I know where that can lead—no place good. But when that man makes his case with one bone-searing kiss on the streets of London, I throw resistance out the window.What could go wrong with a hot, no-strings-attached fling before he leaves town in five days? Trouble is, soon our nights together lead to days, to long conversations, to getting to know each other, and to something I never expected—falling ridiculously hard for a man who’s getting on a plane to America when I live a world away. My life is here. His is there. And no amount of falling or feeling will change that one big problem. Warning: contains hot hotel sex, loads of dirty talk, PDA all over London, and two sexy, witty, charming alpha heroes…Performed with a full supporting cast including: Andi Arndt, Ron Butler, Jakobi Diem, Vanessa Edwin, Stella Hunter, Zachary Webber, Emma Wilder and with a cameo from Sebastian York.",
