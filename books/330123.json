  "title": "The Domino Men",
  "description": "“An infectious blend of wit, wonder, and the bizarre presented with remarkable style.” — San Antonio Express-News   Jonathan Barnes, author of The Somnambulist, outdoes himself in outrageous invention with The Domino Men . Fans of Neil Gaiman, Jasper Fforde, Susanna Clarke, Matt Ruff, and Douglas Adams will not want to miss this quirky and compelling tale of intrigue, conspiracy, and general oddness. Think The Office meets James Bond fighting aliens with a healthy dollop of H.P. Lovecraft horror thrown in for good measure—and that’s only half the fun of Barnes’s wonderfully bizarre The Domino Men.",
