  "description": "THE EARTH GIVES WAY TO THE SEA, THE SEA BOWS BEFORE THE WIND, THE WIND FEEDS THE FLAME, THE FLAME BURNS THE WORLD OF MAN DOWN TO THE EARTH. Xander Sirocco now has the power of the Wind Elemental at his disposal, but it may be too little too late. The Fire Caste has begun its conquest of the planet, and many of the largest cities already burn. Xander, Sean, and Jessica know what needs to be done—they must find the Water and Earth Elementals to have any chance of defeating the Fire Elemental. The first to be located is the Water Elemental. With her power, they could at least slow the advance of the Fire Warriors. If she would only believe in their mission as much as they do… While Xander struggles to convince the Water Elemental that their mission is just, Sammy fights an unexpected battle of her own. With her body now possessed by the Fire Elemental, she’s little more than an observer as it uses her to destroy Los Angeles. Sammy can still exert her will on occasion, but it’s exhausting. When the Elemental sends the deadly General Abraxas after Xander, she wonders if she’ll be able to influence her body’s actions enough to save the life of the man she loves.",
