  "description": "Exuberant, ambitious, fascinating, and sublime, in The Secret of the Sundance Caves, Sharla Shangeling writes the wild escapades of a young girl whose destiny and courage meet the power of faith head on. Karys Kitane is not like other girls her age. Just as Persephone ate Hade’s pomegranate seeds and became a captive of the underworld, Karys eats the shadon beni bud—a mysterious shoot of green in her father’s garden. Upon eating the scarlet sprout she discovers Dream and Darkness, which she swallows whole and splits wide open. Now, she sees the world differently and it does not matter so much that she is invisible to her parents or that her schoolmates are terrific wretches because she has courage, wanderlust, and curiosity in spades. Beckoned by her great aunt to the furthest hillsides of the Caribbean where she lives, she will embark on an enchanted, unforgettable adventure of mystic mayhem and explore a cave that has deeper secrets than she—or anyone—could ever imagine.",
