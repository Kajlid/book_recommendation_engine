  "description": "When a past you can’t remember, leads to a truth you wish you could forget and a future you hope will last forever...Waking up in a strange place with no memory is hard enough; but when you unknowingly wake as a vampire with an insatiable desire to drain a stray cat of its life’s blood -- then you can bet that you’re about to take a journey down a very bumpy road.Sydney Chance finds herself a stranger to her new life as well as the one she left behind. On a reluctant mission to uncover her past, Sydney’s struggle with bloodlust is magnified when all of her senses draw her to a brooding and intriguing vampire named Demetri Bastian, who seems more intent on fighting her at every turn as he keeps her at arms length while trying to protect and control.To make matters worse, a sadistic ancient vampire, who makes it his hobby to collect beautiful young women and keep them pets, has his fangs set on Sydney. Not knowing her own name takes a back seat to the drama that unfolds all around her as she seeks revenge on the vampire who created her, sending her on a suspenseful trail of love, lies, betrayals, twists and turns that could quite possibly destroy her, immortal or not. Who says what you don’t know can’t hurt you?",
