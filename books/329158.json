  "title": "Savage Kings",
  "description": "Three beautiful, cruel boys rule Kingsworth Prep. And I'm the girl who almost ruined them...It all started with that video I posted of them—you know, the one that went viral. But that was before I knew who they were. Ezra Covington, Bellamy Thorn, and Dashiell Laurier. Three untouchable royals who were just… well, royally touched. Three gorgeous, ruthless kings used to getting exactly what they want. Now they want me. They want my screams against their mouths. My ruin beneath their fingers. My demons exposed to the world. Little do they know, my demons bite back. And that makes me just as savage as any king.WARNING: Savage Kings is a bully romance that contains graphic content and situations that might make some readers uncomfortable. It is a reverse harem novel, meaning the heroine has more than one love interest. It is book 1 in the Savages of Kingsworth series and ends in a cliffhanger.",
