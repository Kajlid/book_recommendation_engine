  "description": "Two brothers. One mission: Restore privacy to the world.The year is 2043. Empowered by the anti-encryption program, ICALL, and the world-wide wireless Blanket, the Global Domain reigns over all colocation centres with its Connectivist ideology, enforcing mandatory online activity for every eartizen and disabling attempts to secure privacy. The Domain’s slogans are: \"Secrecy Threatens Security\" and \"Privacy Prevents Prosperity and Peace.\"From his death-bed in New Zealand, Fenton Ouvert commissions his sons, Topia and Lukan, to locate a flash drive containing the files of Jeremy Winterton, files stolen thirty years earlier from international surveillance agencies. A former investigative journalist, Ouvert hid the flash drive at the end of a chain of clue-bearers around the world. Contacted by the resistance movement known as Arachne, Ouvert believes the drive contains original plans for the ICALL program and thus, hope for a free world.Travelling the globe, the Ouvert boys locate the links, but what will their journey reveal about their father and the effects of the Global Domain's dominance? And what will their quest mean for the world when they reach the end of the chain?“IF GEORGE ORWELL WROTE A HARDY BOYS STORY . . . IT WOULD BE 'THE CHAIN.'” – NIX WHITTAKER, AUTHOR OF THE GLYPH WARRIOR SERIES",
