  "title": "Iron Hand: The Confession of Goetz von Berlichingen",
  "description": "-When his sword hand was struck off, his legend began- Based on the true life of the Baron Goetz von Berlichingen the Iron Hand, the most infamous Imperial knight of the Holy Roman Empire, who marauded through 16th-century Reformation Germany with a prosthetic iron hand. Schoental Abbey, Franconia, 1562. At the end of his long life, a dying Baron Goetz von Berlichingen the Iron Hand travels to his ancestral tomb to seek absolution for his sins. Before he can be buried in his family crypt, the sins of his life must be confessed. Enlisting the services of a Cistercian monk in order to record a narrative of his life as a robber-knight, and hopeful that his confession will not only prove his piety, but will lead to his soul’s redemption- what follows is an epic that spans the entire life of the outlaw knight. The confessional journey they take together may lead to redemption- or condemnation- for both of their souls. „Tom Krupp bietet mit seinem Roman eine zeitgemäße literarische Verarbeitung der schon seit Jahrhunderten die Gemüter bewegenden Biographie Götz von Berlichingens, wenn ich recht sehe, die allererste überhaupt, die jenseits des Atlantiks entstanden ist.” -Dr. Prof. Kurt Andermann, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg im Breisgau",
