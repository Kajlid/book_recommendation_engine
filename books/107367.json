  "description": "Cassie Warren was the fat girl in school, the smart girl, the girl who people poked fun at. When Patrick Cross, the most popular boy in school and her former best friend declares his interest in her, she is unsure how to react at first. She is left devastated when, after a short but intense romance, she catches him in bed with his ex-girlfriend.Patrick can't remember what happened that night, and has no idea why the girl he has loved since he was seven no longer wants anything to do with him. They go their separate ways, each of them following their own path until Cassie has to go through a situation too painful to imagine, and they are brought back together.She has a secret, and one that she will try to keep from Patrick rather than cause herself more heartache. He's more determined to get her back than she realises, this time for good.",
