Then, as a work day ends on a high, his love life hits the skids, and he gets the phone call from his estranged mother that changes everything. \"Your father's dead.\" Life hands Eric a great opportunity, an awkward family reunion, and an ultimatum -- if he wants his inheritance, he has to take a road trip to see his father's old Army buddy, Oliver.

What he doesn't expect is to have Ernest Hemingway's ghost along for the ride. With intentions of helping Eric get it right, Hemingway manages to complicate the situation, resulting in an unforgettable road trip. Help comes in many forms. In this case, it is Hemingway's ghost who is determined to make Eric's first draft at life a good one. With any luck, he'll succeed before Eric loses a kneecap.",
