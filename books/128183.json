  "description": "ASIN B00HX82ZV4 moved to the most recent editionIndia Bell is looking for a regular writing gig to supplement her royalties. She ends up with two assignments - one, to interview up-and-coming lesbian romance writer Tegan Lowry, and the other? To win a bet to write her own lesbian romance, thus securing for herself a job as an editor. There's a bit of an issue with the second of those. India writes science fiction, not romance. There's none of that confusing touchy-feely stuff in her science fiction novels. Hell, she doesn't even read romance, and as for the lesbian aspect, she's not sure how to define her sexuality, but if she's a lesbian, then she's so far in the closet, she doesn't even know where the door is. Maybe Tegan could give her some pointers on writing all those sex scenes she's probably going to have to stick in there? Tegan is thrilled to be interviewed, even by the awkward and socially-inept India. Not that Tegan views herself as anyone's fantasy - she's on crutches, and who would be interested in a cripple? Her deeply romantic fantasies are all lived out on the page. But when India suddenly asks if Tegan will join her in her writing cabin to get some serious work done, she jumps at the chance to leave her horrible basement apartment behind to concentrate on her writing in comfort and peace, with the fascinating, if rather emotionally-unavailable, India Bell. In the gorgeous cabin on the outskirts of the small tourist town of Rain Falls, Colorado, the two women find themselves struggling with temptation and absurdity. It's a situation they never thought they'd find outside of a romance novel.",
