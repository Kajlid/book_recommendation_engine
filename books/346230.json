Why else would she agree to the outrageous charade offered by her buttoned-down workaholic neighbor, Linc Blaise? The history professor needs to have a fianc√©e in order to capture his dream job, and Daisy is game to play the role. But something funny happens on their way to the altar that changes everything.
