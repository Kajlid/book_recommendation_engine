  "description": "My name is Larkspur, and I am an Elemental.My people use the power of the earth to sustain life and defy our enemies. I am the half-breed bastard child of a king. I was not meant to survive the trials cast my way. Yet, here I stand.\nThe world has deteriorated in the years I was banished. The Elemental families are rife with deception, violence, and madness more than ever before.A voice I know all too well calls me to do her bidding. A voice I no longer wish to hear. The mother goddess begs me to save the four families, and stop my nemesis. To do it, I must face each of the Elemental leaders and take from them the power they hold close: the stones I once entrusted to them.Now, the secrets I unearth as I pursue the stones shatter everything I know about my world, and everything I was taught.Yet, I am not the na√Øve girl I once was. If I am to see this through, I must completely embrace the new reality of my life and all its obstacles while forging ahead.Four stones abused.Four families broken.A half-breed princess as their only hope.Through it all, the one I love waits for me to find him. When I do, will he, like everything else in my world, not be what he once was?",
