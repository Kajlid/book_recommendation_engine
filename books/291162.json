  "description": "At Animal Ark, Mandy Hope helps her parents treat animals of all shpaes and sizes. Even outside the clinic, Mandy can't resist helping any animal in need. Wayne Skilton has just moved to Mandy's town from London. At first, he's not enthusiastic about country life and he's not very friendly. But a nicer side of Wayne is revealed when he's seen petting a tabby cat from the neighborhood. When Many and James see the cat again and realize it has an eye infection, they must seek medical help and notify the cat's owner - an old lady named Mrs. Webb, who's a recluse and won't answer her door. But Wayne's soft side soon comes in handy when he finds a way to make contact with her. Who is this mysterious woman, and what can the kids do to help her and her beautiful cat?",
