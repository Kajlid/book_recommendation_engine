  "description": "\"The moment my eyes landed on her sleeping body, I felt like the whole world stopped for a minute. I didn’t believe that someone like her existed. Someone perfectly built just for me.” When a hellhound finds its mate, it could only mean two Love and Death. Henry James Nightclaw II didn't understand humans nor did he want to, but all that has changed when he suddenly caught the scent of fresh jasmines in the air. That could only mean one thing to a hellhound. Mate. As a natural born killer who was created to destroy humans and capture their souls, he was convinced that he would never find love much less fall in love with a mere human. Still, fate has a way of bringing two people together and with his mate's life on the line, can Henry put aside his doubts and mark her for life to save her? Or will he let her die and lose her forever? The choice is his.",
