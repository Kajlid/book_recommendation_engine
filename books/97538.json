  "description": "Kile Veller is now a fully certified level five hunter currently assigned to the small mining town of Coopervill... but for how long? Sins from the past have risen in the wastelands, and events that have been set in motion nearly thirty years ago threaten not only her status as a hunter, but her very life. Within one short month she finds herself wanted by the crown for murder, the tower for kidnapping and her very own guild for the disappearance and deaths of over twenty hunters.Caught up in events that should have had nothing to do with her, she must bring to light a dark secret that has plagued the throne of Aru while trying to stay one step ahead of the hunters that are quickly closing in on her... but have they underestimated her? The only question now is who is the hunter and who is the hunted?",
