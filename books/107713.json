  "description": "Bullies beware! A freak accident gives five middle school bullies super powers. But instead of being able to transform into cool super-beings, they take on the characteristics of the kids they bully. Sure their abilities may be at an all-time high, but do they really have what it takes to save their school when their self-esteem is at an all-time low? \"The Offenders is the best use of detention since The Breakfast Club - funny, exciting, and the most charming thing I've read in ages. Writing something entertaining is tough, but writing something important is even tougher. Jerry and his boys have made it look easy.\" - Drew Pearce, writer of Iron Man 3",
