  "description": "Can Zyan avert the war that’s brewing before her past catches up to her, quite literally?When one of the angelic warriors goes missing, Zyan and Eli head off to Dublin to join the search. As soon as they arrive, they're swept into rising tensions between the angelic forces and the other supernatural races. As more supernaturals go missing, Archangel Michael will stop at nothing to put the perpetrator behind bars, even if it means placing the city under martial law.To add to the mess, Zyan's sister Anna is in Dublin, and where Anna is, Lucifer is only a step behind. Not to mention Alexander, Zyan's sworn enemy. Zyan has more than a sneaking suspicion they’re at the heart of a spree of recent demon invasions. But something is odd about these demons, and if she doesn’t figure it out before Lucifer reveals his ultimate plan, the price could be catastrophic.As if things couldn’t get worse, being back in Ireland where she was turned immortal has dredged up the worst from her past. Including her maker, Olga, who’s none too pleased that Zyan’s come back.",
