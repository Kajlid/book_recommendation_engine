  "description": "Deputy district attorney Carson Tanner has dedicated his life to justice. But he is still haunted by one case that was never the murder of his entire family in cold blood. Back then, the teenage Carson was protected by his girlfriend’s influential father, Senator Randolph Drake. But now, fifteen years later, Carson finds himself facing a whole new world when a man confesses to the Tanner killings. His name is John Stokes. And his confession only scratches the surface of the truth… Carson knows that Annette Baxter uses her brains and beauty as a fixer for the rich and powerful, making their indiscretions disappear in exchange for security and influence. But now someone is using her clients’ secrets—and her own—against her. And even though Carson can’t ignore his attraction to her, he is dead-set on making Annette pay for her crimes…but what if she holds the key to the burning secret he’s spent his whole life seeking?",
