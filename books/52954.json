  "title": "Sue Barton, Senior Nurse",
  "description": "A refreshing and authentic story of a nurse's life. In this story, redheaded, vivacious Sue Barton finishes her training and goes on to the many experiences, both humorous and exciting, that a pretty young nurse can meet in a great modern hospital. Though Sue and her friends, Kit and Connie, are more mature than they were as students, they are still able to get into occasional trouble with the Head Nurse. It is enthralling to follow Sue into new hospital experiences such as her first experience in the operating room, and the operation when she assists the brilliant but fiery-tempered doctor for whom nothing is ever right. Later she has her training in the care of newborn babies and their mothers. Deeply immersed as she is in her work, Sue struggles with the conflict of her love for her career and her growing affection for Dr. Barry, who continues to show as much interest in the pretty young nurse as he did when she was just a student.",
