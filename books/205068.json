  "description": "She’s too young, but I can’t help myself. Until she danced onto the roof of my Manhattan skyscraper—the one with my name emblazoned across the top—my life was devoid of color or meaning. Now it’s rushing in from all sides, carrying me closer to the forbidden. If the only way I can have this sweet, wide-eyed girl is to purchase her from her father—my employee—so be it. The contract is signed. Now she’s mine.",
