  "description": "In this third story set in imaginary Corgiville, home to corgis, cats, rabbits and some eccentric families, Christmas is coming. Mr. and Mrs. Bigbee Brown warm themselves by the wood stove as they drink their tea. Mr. Chicahominy, his two wives, and mother-in-law live in a house overlooking the pond. During the season he puts his haberdashery on wheels, peddling by wagon all about town. Families make special wreaths for the animals, and age Dundee cake for months. Finally, on December 25, the parlor door opens to reveal a magnificent Christmas tree with lighted candles and shining ornaments.",
