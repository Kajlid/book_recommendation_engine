  "description": "The third installment of the Release Series, Love Defamed invites the reader to let go of love that has grown stale—love that isn’t love at all, but cunning manipulation in disguise that keeps us from growing and being our most vibrant selves. Through poignant and candid poetic storytelling, poet Jasmine Farrell urges her readers to realize their worth by putting their trauma behind them and attracting dreamlike love that heals all those untreated wounds of the heart",
