Now it's time to get real.It all started with a faulty elevator...When social media influencer Frankie Paulson's followers turn on her after an embarrassing public break-up with her perfect #couplegoals boyfriend, and she almost plummets to her death with two strangers in a faulty elevator, all she wants to do is hide.A town with no internet is the ideal sanctuary, but Frankie has never done anything without sharing it on one of many apps she can't live without.

Suddenly every rule she's been living by seems far less meaningful and she begins to wonder if her apparently #blessed life wasn't as real as she thought...",
