Unfortunately, groomsman Brock McNeil keeps getting in her way, riling her up in the most delicious of ways. But Brock’s smooth southern charm isn't part of the plan...so how exactly did they end up having searing-hot sex?Regan may pretend the erotic electricity sparking between them is merely a distraction, but Brock knows better.
