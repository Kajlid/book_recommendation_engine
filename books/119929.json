  "description": "From her short hair to her preference for men's clothing, Ally Nevins is the type that stands out. She’s loud, impulsive, and can’t stop teasing her quiet, gorgeous co-worker Ryan, especially now that they’ve both been promoted to co-supervisors at the water park. Shy, beautiful Ryan is the last person anyone would expect to be in love with the aggressive pool tomboy. But he is, and this summer is his chance to show her how much she has underestimated her quiet friend. But between Ally's dark past, and her insistence that she doesn't want a ‘good guy’, Ryan’s realizing that winning Ally over may be harder than he thought. Then again, the best things in life don’t come easily.",
