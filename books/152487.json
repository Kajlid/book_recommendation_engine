She goes to the one place that holds her most precious memories, her cabin by the lake. Life hasn’t always been easy for Cali. She lost someone close to her, was betrayed by her lover, and now she only wants to escape reality. What she doesn’t plan on is her sexy neighbor, who has an agenda of his own.  Owen Matthews goes through the motions every day, but knows his life is missing one essential part – Cali. He has never forgotten about the summers he spent by the lake with the gorgeous brunette. When he sees she is back to stay, Owen knows he can’t let her slip through his fingers again. Others think he has it all with owning a multimillion dollar company, but what they don’t know is that he would give it all up to have her in his arms and his bed.  The road to happiness isn’t always easy. His brother returns to his life and brings with him an old flame who threatens to rip Cali and Owen apart. Will they find their salvation with one another or let the events of their past influence their future?  Please note that this book contains explicit language and sexual content.
