  "description": "Jack accompanies the self-styled \"U.S. Grant\"—an old college buddy—and his regional wrestling promotion on their fall tour in hopes of sniffing out the mystery and escaping his troubled past...and to avoid any more harrowing run-ins with the deadly Aesir gang. Struggling with a budding romance, the specter of his college-era mistakes, and the undercurrents of a fanatic pro wrestling fandom, some of whom may just be willing to kill, Jack soon finds himself dragged into the limelight—and squarely into the crosshairs of his most dangerous enemies.",
