  "description": "After her mob-boss father was murdered, Helena Bertinelli grew up to become the crossbow-wielding vigilante known as the Huntress. Using both deadly and drastic measures that Batman does not approve of, the former mafia princess tries to patrol the streets of Gotham City without crossing paths with the Darknight Detective. But after an undercover cop is allegedly murdered by the head of the Gotham mob, the Huntress finds herself reluctantly working with Batman's protege and former Robin, Nightwing. Now as the two disparate heroes attempt to unravel the puzzling conspiracy of the policeman's murder, Nightwing and the Huntress fall into a romantic relationship that could cost them their lives.",
