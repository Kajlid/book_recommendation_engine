Can the mates pull together and participate in the play, or is Maverick going to put his foot down and demand that the mates give the Brac Pack babies a show to remember? Warning, this book contains a mischievous elf, a pet reindeer, off-key singing, lots and lots of hot sex, and a surprise ending that none of the warriors see coming! ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
