He’s an Hispanic man uncomfortable with his heritage, a playboy who knows he has to settle down, a man who pretends that family doesn’t matter when it does, and an FBI agent who thinks he’s at the top of his game only to be demoted by a serial killer.Nalani Hana is far removed from the US Mainland and prefers it that way. Though a descendent of Hawaiian royalty, she prefers the simplicity of her secluded cottage on Maui. Born and raised into the safe business, she carries on her father’s legacy at N. Hana Safe & Lock Company.Now someone is murdering the country’s legendary safe and vault technicians. Once a month a safeman is found strangled and stuffed into a safe with three fingers severed. Raphael has to find the killer before he strikes again. The question is whether Nalani Hana is a suspect or the pawn of a demented killer.",
