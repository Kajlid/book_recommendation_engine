  "description": "In this short story collection, Michelle Davidson Argyle shares sixteen of her literary pieces written during 1999 - 2011. In the title story, \"True Colors,\" the main character fights her vibrant personality against the true darkness lurking within her. The story builds until a row of six dead birds stop her in her tracks. In the opening story, \"Thread,\" (also published in the 2011 collection, Stories for Sendai), a married couple's reaction to the Sendai earthquake and tsunami on March 11th, 2011 reveals their own earth-shattering issues and what must be done to solve them. The lizard on the cover represents the story, \"The Threshold,\" about a young boy with an intense physical attraction to a girl he's not supposed to touch. True Colors is a collection of quiet stories exploring the hidden, but often overlooked colors we try to hide every day. Sometimes they shouldn't be hidden at all.Also included are several poems and one prose poem picked as the staff choice award in New Mexico's Literary journal, Scribendi (2002).",
