But that’s not what I’m hiding. I’m also my crush’s favorite author and no one knows.I’m Leo Stewart and I have two focuses in my life. My little sister, Rae and running the only bookstore in town. After our parents died, I raised Rae alone and that came with the price of my social life. I work, look after her, and repeat. Now that my little sister is an adult, maybe it’s time for me to focus on myself, and my lifelong attraction to her best friend.Will a secret end their romance, or will it be one for the books?",
