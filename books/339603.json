Now she had a chance to repay some of the pain he'd caused her -- and prevent him from hurting someone else, too.

He wouldn't let her forget the love they'd once shared. Now Zoe had to choose. Should she desert Rory as he had once deserted her -- or rejoice in a love she thought she had lost forever?",
