  "description": "Secrets... of the past. What happened long ago in the cellars of Airstone Hall in Dorset, England, was coming back to haunt the present. Sue-Ellen Hill didn't realize that taking on the task of turning the old Elizabethan house into a bed-and-breakfast would unlock a mystery that was best forgotten... Edward Ormsby-Jones, master of Airstone, was pleased with the progress of his new hotel manager. That is until he was convinced she was in mortal danger of becoming a victim of his family's secret. They both had to find out how the past was connected to the present. Could they stop the menacing evil that lurked in the halls of Airstone before it threatened to destroy their love?",
