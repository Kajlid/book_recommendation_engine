  "description": "In femdom erotica the women who dominate their submissive male or female counterparts are often portrayed as cold-hearted evil bitches that delight in physically and mentally tormenting those in their thrall. If such women existed in real life they would likely be much hated and rightfully considered to be borderline or even full-blown narcissistic sociopaths. And yet, for an indeterminate number of femdom enthusiasts this persona taps into their libido and provides a thrill like no other.As a purveyor of erotica, who am I to judge what is and isn’t erotic to others? Nonetheless, I don’t wish to help perpetuate that particular convention in femdom literature. I choose instead to offer more reality-based femdom fantasies that reflect my sensibilities and hopefully make the genre accessible to a wider base of readers.So, consider yourself warned. Although there are plenty of fairly hardcore D/s scenarios woven into the vignettes of this anthology, the dominant women depicted possess well-integrated personalities. They are all relatively normal ladies who just happen to have a penchant for kink. Enjoy!",
