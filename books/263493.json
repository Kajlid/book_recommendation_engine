  "description": "The things I see aren’t for the faint of heart.And I am no longer willing to ignore them. Not even when my family, and my best friend, tell me to keep quiet about what’s happening. They say people will think I’m crazy.Maybe I am.But the spirit haunting my professor’s house is definitely trying to tell me something, and I’m the only one who can see it.The one person who can help me is my best friend's brother. But I don’t know if I can trust him or his friends. Or if I can step outside the protective bubble I’ve built around myself.At this point it’s a toss up: the ghosts will kill me or my panic attacks will.Either way, I figure I’m going to die.This is the first of a multi-book slow burn reverse harem series. Be forewarned.",
