So as far as he’s concerned, his plan to never have children is not only sound, but also the right thing to do. Besides, he’s having too much fun living life on the edge, bound by no feminine ties.Julie Del Mar is a quiet, romantic dreamer. Orphaned at twelve, she has now lost her surrogate parent—her older sister—to suicide. Returning to the only real home she ever had and someday making her own family is her most profound wish.But now, both are vying for the old homestead, and neither one is willing to bend—at least not until an unusual bargain to share it is struck.However, what starts as a platonic business arrangement, soon becomes a conflagration of sexual desire, and the end result is not at all what either one was expecting.Uncontrollable passion brings them together, but will a pregnancy test tear them apart?For readers who like romances that include small towns, unexpected pregnancy, Texas bad boys, family bonds, and orphaned kittensOTHER BOOKS IN THE TEXAS LOVERS A Heart Is A Christmas In Texas",
