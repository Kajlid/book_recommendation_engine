  "description": "Reece Lassiter was a ruthless bastard.  He had everything a wolf shifter could want. He even had the perfect mate. Jolie was the only woman he’d ever trusted. The only woman he’d ever loved. She had been his everything. Until the day she had betrayed his trust and eviscerated his soul. Reece had cut her out of his life with a ruthlessness that shocked even him. He had encased his broken heart in ice so thick and glacial that nothing could ever penetrate it again.  And he’d been wrong.  His mate had not betrayed him. He had betrayed her and destroyed them both in the process. Now he'll stop at nothing to get her and their cub back. But his ex-wife is not the same woman that he remembered. His sunshine girl had been a creature of sweetness and light, not this hissing, vitriol filled she-cat who wanted to claw his eyes out. Reece might be an unstoppable force, but Jolie had become an unmovable object.  Is the big bad wolf strong enough to reclaim her heart?",
