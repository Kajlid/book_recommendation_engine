  "description": "Surreal and splendidly unconventional, The Hearing Trumpet is an apocalyptic fairy tale quest about an occult old ladies' home and the spry nonagenarian who ends up there. After coming into possession of a hearing trumpet, 92-year-old Marian Leatherby discovers her son's plans to send her to a nursing home. But this is no ordinary place. Here there are strange rituals, orgiastic nuns, levitating abbesses, animalistic humans, humanistic animals, a search for the Holy Grail, and a plan to escape to Lapland and knit a tent.Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington's novel is an exhilarating journey brimming with laugh-out-loud humor and absurd lunacy.",
