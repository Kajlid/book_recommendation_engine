  "description": "In the dust and death of the Collosseum, a slave fights for freedom, a soldier fights for his life, and they both fight for the love that has been forbidden. Captured and enslaved by a Roman legion, Xanthe never expects to end up training for the Colosseum floor, but every night after the day’s march, she is put through her paces by a Roman solider who challenges her, tests her, and excites her.  Titus is drawn to Xanthe, her fire and her spirit, so he breaks one of his rules and brings notice on himself, offering to train her as a gladiatrix to spare her a courtesan’s role. But training her, working with her, soon becomes too much. Titus knows the penalty for taking property that does not belong to him, but how long can he resist?Praise for THE LAST 'The Last Gladiatrix is a historical novella with a rich setting and strong, likeable characters. A quick, satisfying read.' — The Australian Bookshelf'From soldiers' camp to the Colosseum where blood is spilled on the dirt, to a Roman woman's bed chamber, to a traveling caravan, there's no end to the excitement and action. I especially enjoyed the witty repartee between Xanthe and Titus. They made laugh out loud more than once. I also enjoyed the fighting. Some serious research went into this... This was a superb historical romance adventure.' — Book Babe",
