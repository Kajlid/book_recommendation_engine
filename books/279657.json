  "description": "A chance encounter sparks the adventure of a lifetime...For 26-year-old Lucy Gray, life revolves around her family, friends and a classroom full of third graders. Reliable and responsible, she puts everyone's needs before her own, often without even realizing it. In a chance meeting with the psychic at her sister's 80s-themed wedding, Lucy is confronted with the idea that she is missing out on life and should follow the signs of fate happening all around her. Awakening to this realization, these signs spur Lucy to take a last-minute trip to London - the very trip her sister had reserved as a honeymoon backup plan. She'll just have to pretend to be her sister... what could go wrong?Once in London, what Lucy hoped to be the getaway she's always dreamed of turns into an adventure she never expected. Tangled in lies and in over her head, she struggles to follow the signs - and her heart - to figure out who she truly is. With depth and humor, author Nicole Macaulay has crafted a lighthearted, charming read with Honeymoon Alone. Relatable and full of personality, readers will undoubtedly see a little of themselves and their own families in the characters that seem to leap off the pages. At its heart is a story about friendship and romance, and how the most unconventional path can lead to a happy ending.",
