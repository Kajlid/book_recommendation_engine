  "description": "Murder, kidnapping, cruel punishment, and violent revenge -- these are not the bedtime stories mummy used to read. Grimm's Grimmest presents nineteen of the original, unsanitized, unholy tales as they were first collected by the Brothers Grimm -- all fiendishly illustrated in full color. Grimm's Grimmest has the irresistible look and feel of a creaky old leatherbound volume, perhaps discovered in a forgotten trunk or dusty attic. With aged paper and a leathery stamped case, this delightfully shocking collection harkens back to a time when travelers risked roasting or worse and bad manners could yield frightful consequences. From the true horror of Aschenputtel (the original Cinderella story) to Rapunzel's dark secret, here are the authentic stories born long ago in the land of the Black Forest, at a time when fairy tales were not necessarily for children.The Juniper treeThe three army surgeonsThe Robber bridegroomHans my hedgehogThe Willful childThe Death of the little henThe Goose maidThe three snake leavesAschenputtelThe CrowsPrudent HansFowler's fowlThe Girl without handsAllerleirauhThe Mother-in-lawThe Dog and the sparrowRapunzelLittle Brother and Little SisterThe Story of the youth who went forth to learn how to shudder",
