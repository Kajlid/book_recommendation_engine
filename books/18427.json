  "title": "The 8:55 to Baghdad",
  "description": "Andrew Eames, an adventurous, insightful and sympathetic observer, sets out to travel from London to Baghdad by train, following the route of the old Orient Express and an identical journey made by Agatha Christie in 1928. Agatha's journey was to change her life completely and led to her spending thirty seasons on archaeological digs in the deserts of Syria and Iraq.The journey from London to Baghdad by train today is actually far harder than it was in Agatha's day. Many of the countries Eames passes through, from the Balkans to the Middle East, have been deeply troubled in recent years. Eventually he arrives at the Iraq border at the same time as the UN weapons inspectors. As the book approaches its final destination, the shadow of was looms increasingly large.A compelling read, merging literary biography with travel adventures, 'The 8.55 to Baghdad' is the journey of a lifetime ...Bibliographical note; Whilst most editions of this title have a strap-line, 'From suburbia to Iraq on the trail of Agatha Christie' (or something similar) on the cover, this wording is not carried through to the title page which simply reads, 'The 4.55 to Baghdad' and that is how the book is correctly catalogued for goodreads' purposes.With her marriage to her first husband, Archie Christie, over, she decided to take a much-needed holiday; the Caribbean had been her intended destination, but a conversation at a dinner party with a couple who had just returned from Iraq changed her mind",
