  "description": "Another Book About Another Broken Heart is a fast-paced monologue filtered through the consciousness of this clever, albeit self-obsessed and miserable young woman. After moving from Toronto to Montreal, Katy is forced to forge new friendships, some providing new strength, others resulting in disaster. Originally intended as a one-woman show, the voice-driven nature of this novel allows it to \"perform\" for the reader; Katy's cognizance of our presence disrupts the narrative and invites us to participate fully in her often hilarious take on the subject that's been done to death and then done again.",
