  "description": "Displaced from their homeland due to a natural calamity, Lasatis come to Jivavarta in search of a new home. When they land, their leader Nahuja Duja realises that they can conquer the whole of Jivavarta. For this, he relies on his warlords -- the slave turned chief of imperial guards, Yetaal, and the fearsome battlemaster Oga Soka. In this war, Lasatis get help from the rebelling tribals of Jarodha, and the historically wronged highborns, the Grahavars, who are desperate to reclaim their lost glory.While under attack, the court of Jivavarta is in shambles. The aging emperor Ativara has long lost interest in ruling his empire, the elder prince Abhik has all courage but no vision, and the younger prince Anojas is too busy fighting his inner demons. They face challenges from Chief Minister Kahola Vakra who looks at the war as his opportunity to gain power, and resentment from Queen Travi of Rongcha, whose claim as Ativara's successor has been overlooked in favor of Abhik.Caught in this conflict are the commoners -- the abandoned orphan Lokya, the weathered but now burned-out Isaku, and the captive monk Mudita -- whose lives are going to be affected by the war the most.\"Lair of the Monster\" narrates the struggle of these commoners, their sacrifices, and their resolve that eventually helps them triumph against all odds.",
