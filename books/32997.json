  "description": "The Posse is the story of what happens after the big finale of a reality TV competition and of a small town girl's ride through Hollywood. When seventeen-year old Jacey Chandliss enters and wins Generation Next: America’s Top Young Actress, an American Idol-type contest that offers the winner a star-making role in a major Hollywood motion picture, she’s thrust into the bright Hollywood spotlight. She’s got a bonafide Hollywood power-agent and she’s living in L.A. for the summer. It’s all a lot to handle, and Jacey would probably buckle under the pressure if she didn’t have her friends along for the ride. Her best friends Dash and Desi and her cousin Ivy are part of Jacey’s Posse. They’re going to Hollywood with Jacey to keep Jacey from going Hollywood.",
