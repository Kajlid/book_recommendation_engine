  "description": "Alternate cover for ASIN B00LMNE9F6Warning: Mild bondage and discipline, profanity and erotic encounters. Intended for readers aged 18+As Bella and Xander struggle to find their way and make their unconventional relationship work, it seems everyone and everything is trying to come between them. And so their dance of push and pull begins as they both fight their way through their emotions and fear of the unknown.Book 1: Bella Darcy is personal assistant, muse and plaything to wealthy businessman Mr. Pettifor. Their 9-5 relationship is unconventional, but mutually satisfying. Bella had never wanted more until the day she heard passionate cries that didn't belong to her, coming from his office. Mr. Pettifor is alpha male personified; demanding, distant, closed-off, stern, and seemingly indifferent to anything that doesn't involve six zeros behind it. Deeply hurt and realizing that she cannot be with a man who can so blatantly be with another woman while she is mere feet away, Bella turns in her letter of resignation, throwing Mr. Pettifor into a tailspin. Book 2: From the first day Mr. Pettifor laid eyes on Bella Darcy, he knew he couldn't deny himself the indulgence of being with her. Against his better judgement, he hired her, knowing full well he would pay the price with her constant presence. Little did the alpha male know that before him stood a woman who yearned for his touch, his control and his training. Book 3: For Bella, being the fiancé of a busy CEO is difficult enough, but being a full-time medical student as well, is even more challenging as she tries to find the time for her man and her education. For Xander, living the life of a worldly CEO and being the fiancé of a hard-working medical student has its up and downs, too. But he's no common CEO - he's also a dominant and an instructor at a prestigious domestic discipline training center, something he's finally forced to share with Bella, as well as all the feelings he had suppressed for so long. Having only worked together and been lovers for so long, Bella and Xander must strengthen their relationship in order to endure the hardships of longevity. Before they can begin their new life together, they must also learn to accept each other for who they really are - in and out of the office and bedroom. Realizing that being a submissive to Mr. Pettifor 9-5 doesn't compare to being his obedient partner 24/7, Bella thinks she has the perfect plan to strengthen their bond and to spend more time with her alpha male - to attend the school which Xander teaches at so that she learn exactly what he needs in a partner. But is she really ready for that? Xander doesn't think so and he worries the training may harm rather than help their relationship.",
