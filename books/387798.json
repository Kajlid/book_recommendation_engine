  "description": "Once a mere lab assistant, Erin Shay is thrilled over her new promotion. The curvaceous, brainy, somewhat straightlaced lady has been placed in charge of an important new research project: testing a serum specially designed to substantially prolong a couple's lovemaking. With scientists Jay and Laura off on their honeymoon, Erin's been left alone in the lab . . . with her hard-bodied new assistant, Kale Alexander, a sexy stud who has \"playboy\" written all over him. Erin's never even had a one-night stand--but the project's success depends upon her playing the wild, wanton bad-girl to red-hot Casanova Kale. Since she's already learned the perils of leaving her heart too open to heartbreak, this time she'll be the one calling the shots. Her bad-boy partner is going to know from the git-go that this will be a brief sex-only affair--hot, torrid, steamy love in the interests of science . . . with absolutely no strings attached. But when the loving is this deliciously hot, who in her right mind wouldn't want to prolong it?",
