  "title": "The Triumph",
  "description": "A best seller when it was first published in 1968, The Triumph is a satirical tale of political rebellion and U.S. intervention in Latin America. Puerto Santos is the site of a blossoming popular rebellion and a growing headache for Worth Campbell, a hard-working, hard-nosed assistant secretary of state. For years the country has been ruled by Martinez, a corrupt dictator who is nonetheless championed by the U.S. State Department as a bulwark against communism. When the government is overthrown my Miro, a liberal whose dangerous policies include basic democratic principles and modest land reforms, Secretary Campbell loses no time in taking charge of the situation in a truly American diplomatic style - with results not even he could have foreseen. John Kenneth Galbraith's fiction is as erudite and entertaining as his internationally renowned books on the state of our economy. This anniversary edition includes a foreword by the author that considers, with the hindsight of our recent (and questionable) foreign policy in Latin America, \"what it's like to be right too soon.\" A story as timely today as it was twenty-five years ago, The Triumph is a witty yet sobering commentary on American diplomacy and politics.",
