  "description": "This highly anticipated follow-up to The Will of the Many—one of 2023’s most lauded and bestselling fantasy novels—follows Vis as he grapples with a dangerous secret that could change the course of history across alternate dimensions.OMNE TRIUM PERFECTUM.The Hierarchy still call me Vis Telimus. Still hail me as Catenicus. They still, as one, believe they know who I am.But with all that has happened—with what I fear is coming—I am not sure it matters anymore.I am no longer one. I won the Iudicium, and lost everything—and now, impossibly, the ancient device beyond the Labyrinth has replicated me across three separate worlds. A different version of myself in each of Obiteum, Luceum, and Res. Three different bodies, three different lives. I have to hide; fight; play politics. I have to train; trust; lie. I have to kill; heal; prove myself again, and again, and again.I am loved, and hated, and entirely alone.Above all, though, I need to find answers before it’s too late. To understand the nature of what has happened to me, and why.I need to find a way to stop the coming Cataclysm, because if all I have learned is true, I may be the only one who can.",
