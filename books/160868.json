  "title": "Love Letters: An Anthology",
  "description": "A very personal anthology, Antonia Fraser has chosen the letters for their emotional power, or state of love expressed. The categories include Passions, Ecstasies, Fears and Worries, Declarations and Farewells. The anthology includes both the obvious (Byron, Keats, Abelard and Heloise) and the anonymous (a Japanese wife whose husband is in battle, a soldier in the trenches).",
