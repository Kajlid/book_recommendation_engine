  "description": "Two bestselling novellas by two Phaze favorites, together in one volume! The Power of Two: As a vampire Master, Dominic has been eyeing his old friend, Griffith for quite a while. But being a Master in his own right, Grif resisted the notion of Dominic controlling him in any way. With startling skill, Dominic sets out to change that refusal. He has his own deep interest in him, born of watching Grif's submission at the hand of another Master. Even though Dominic can't help but toy with his old friend, in truth, he wants him only as an equal. But how to convince Grif without letting his guard down is Dominic's biggest issue. Aware of some of that interest but not the reason for it, Grif has his own secret. His trust had been violated by his own vampire Master, and since that night, he's refused to let another dominate him. And he'd swore to himself that no one ever would. Dominion: Still dealing with the aftershocks of his ordeal at Tristan's hands, Griffith St. James is fighting the urge to withdraw completely. He feels guilty for what happened, less than a man. The nightmares of his torture at his former master's hands are worse than ever. Dominic Marcellus struggles to draw Grif back into their life before Tristan, but fate has other plans. Finding himself back in the clutches of his abusive former master, Grif is terrified and can only pray Dominic comes for him in time.",
