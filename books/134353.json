  "title": "Women of the Bible: A One-Year Devotional Study of Women in Scripture",
  "description": "Women of the Bible focuses on fifty-two remarkable women in Scripture -- women whose struggles to live with faith and courage are not unlike our own. Far from being cardboard characters, these women encourage us through their failures as well as their successes. You'll see how God acted in surprising and wonderful ways to draw them -- and you -- to himself. This year-long devotional offers a unique method to help you slow down and savor the story of God's unrelenting love for his people, offering a fresh perspective that will nourish and strengthen your personal communion with him.",
