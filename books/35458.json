The survivors scattered in the wake of the Scourge, erecting small towns in the worlds' most sparsely populated areas.For young Gabriel, the walking dead are merely the memories that haunt the eyes of those old enough and lucky enough to have survived. He is more concerned with his hard life in America's desert, where his chores keep him busy and the husks of books stashed beneath the cellar of the library are his only freedom.Until the circus comes to town.\"Circus of the Dead\" is a novelette of approximately 10,748 words.",
