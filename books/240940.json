  "description": "THE CREATURE IN THE WAXWORKS offers nightmare tales of weird and Lovecraftian horror from the authors of THE ABOMINATIONS OF NEPHREN-KA and SHOGGOTH APOCALYPSE. \"The Surprising Sweetness Of Their Blood,\" a sequel to Lovecraft's \"The Dunwich Horror,\" reveals an unspeakable horror hidden in the town of Dunwich, brought to hideous new life by the meddling of a well-meaning outsider. In the collection's title story, a ghastly alien creature hides in plain sight at the Pickman Waxworks, and only one man knows its millennia-old secrets ... and its shocking new agenda. \"The Gateway To Carcosa\" is a tale of \nThe King In Yellow, \na forbidden book that brings madness and death to anyone who dares to read it. \"Aunt Paloma\" takes you to a mansion of horrors where a dying woman must contend with her predatory relatives as she guides her bizarre man-child to his singular destiny. \"Nobody Goes To Paw Paw Town Anymore\" tells of a community that guards its horrors well - because the town's monstrous secret is also its primary source of income. In \"The Glorious Return Of Herbert West,\" a deceased doctor who specialized in reanimation is resurrected in the far future, so he can help a team of scientists to fight the legions of shoggoths that are destroying the Earth. But certainly the team is not prepared for the good doctor's latest prescription....",
