  "description": "Gale is many things. A warrior, a knight, a drinker of blood. He's walked the earth for centuries, fighting off the fae with his fellow knights. Gale is a master of the sword, of flying under the radar, and feeling very, very sorry for what he's done. Damning the king he loved and the brothers he'd sworn to support isn't something one can just move on from. Gale is many things, but pure isn't one of them. He stopped being pure when he stopped being Sir Galahad. But centuries spent fighting and brooding can't prepare him for the reappearance of an old enemy. Caught in the cross hairs is Thomas, an impossibly attractive Arthurian scholar. Gale's pledge of chastity is put to the test as he tries to protect Thomas. Can Gale remain true to his vow as he strives to make up for his past mistakes? Is honor worth holding on to at the cost of the man he loves? Vampires? Check. Gay knights? Double Check. Dark Situations? Yep, those too. It is intended for mature audiences.",
