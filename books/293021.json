  "description": "I’m just trying to survive Shifter Academy. Meeting four gorgeous men wasn’t part of the plan.  I’ve been locked away my whole life, because my alpha thinks that I’m an embarrassment. I’m the runt of my panther pride—not good enough, not strong enough, and different than everybody else. Then I get the letter. Shifter Academy says that my enrollment is mandatory. This is the chance I’ve been waiting for. Once and for all, I will prove that just because I’m a runt doesn’t mean I’m not strong. I’m going to Shifter Academy, and not even my alpha can stop me.  The New Girl is the first book in the Shifter Academy: United Series. It is a slow burn, reverse harem (RH), why choose, fast paced, action packed, young adult (YA) paranormal romance. This book follows Layla, an eighteen-year-old panther shifter, through her senior year at Shifter Academy against the will of her alpha. Her story takes place in a world filled with different types of shifters, fae and many other supernatural creatures.
