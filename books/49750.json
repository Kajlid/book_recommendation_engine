  "description": "Prince Prelude-Legend, begins the Legend story. It tells you why and how Spellbound-Legend came to be.Seductive, powerful Lamia DuLaine is used to getting what she wants—and she wants Julian Talbot. From the moment she sees him in the hedonistic atmosphere of 1814 Brussels, she knows she must have the roguishly handsome lord, and nothing as inconsequential as an innocent chit of a fiancée will stand in her way. After all, Lamia has more than just beauty in her arsenal; a thousand years of living have given the DuLaine unparalleled expertise at manipulating humans, especially men.Julian’s betrothed, Maxie Reigate, however, is more than just a simple, pretty miss; she has powers of her own—some of which even she doesn’t yet know about. And Maxie also has an ally in her corner: the Fae Prince of the House of Dagda. But Prince Breslyn’s role in this battle may be limited, for he has another human woman to worry about, one who has been badly used by the Fae queen’s friend Gaisioch. Plus, Bres has promised his queen that in the matter of Julian, Maxie, and Lamia, he won’t directly interfere…but can he keep that promise?",
