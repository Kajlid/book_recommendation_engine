  "description": "He came to destroy the world. He came to destroy us. But he kept me alive when all else died. It’s the end of us, the humans. Our world is ravaged, burned to the ground, destroyed by the armies of dark fae crawling all over our lands. They seek to end us, weed out the last of our survivors, and tear us to pieces. We hide as best as we can. But it’s inevitable. A dark fae army finds us, hiding in a little village. We’re all goners. All of my group dies, and I’m about to join them in death—until he spares me.",
