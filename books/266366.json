Brought up as a gypsy, he recalls his upbringing, his customs, the legends of gypsies. What makes this particular book so fascinating is that his time as a young man was spent growing up in the English countryside, always on the move, something that his blood ties beckoned him back to. He eventually settled down, but chose to live permanently in the country.",
