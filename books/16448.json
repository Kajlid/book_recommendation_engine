Gradually, with the help of a local boy, she unravels an ancient story that fairies stole a witch's baby, and as revenge she turned a fairy to stone. Natasha realizes that the only way to free the stone fairy, Pillywiggins, is to go into Fairy Land herself and rescue the witch's baby—but legend says that any human who enters Fairy Land may age decades or never come out at all.",
