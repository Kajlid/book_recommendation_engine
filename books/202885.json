But Tehru knows that someone else has access to her power: Quills, a back-alley magic dealer and tattooist who once received a sample of Tehru's essence as payment for her services. Now the murdered daemon's followers are coming after Tehru for retribution, and Quills has to track down the real killer and clear her client's name. If Quills doesn't solve the murder in time, she'll be the one to take the fall.Contains mature themes.",
