  "title": "The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy",
  "description": "The Medieval Kitchen is a delightful work in which historians Odile Redon, Françoise Sabban, and Silvano Serventi rescue from dark obscurity the glorious cuisine of the Middle Ages. Medieval gastronomy turns out to have been superb—a wonderful mélange of flavor, aroma, and color. Expertly reconstructed from fourteenth- and fifteenth-century sources and carefully adapted to suit the modern kitchen, these recipes present a veritable feast. The Medieval Kitchen vividly depicts the context and tradition of authentic medieval cookery.\"This book is a delight. It is not often that one has the privilege of working from a text this detailed and easy to use. It is living history, able to be practiced by novice and master alike, practical history which can be carried out in our own homes by those of us living in modern times.\"—Wanda Oram Miles, The Medieval Review\" The Medieval Kitchen , like other classic cookbooks, makes compulsive reading as well as providing a practical collection of recipes.\"—Heather O'Donoghue, Times Literary Supplement",
