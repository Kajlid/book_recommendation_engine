  "description": "My name is Iris Dimitriadis, after visiting the Oracle of Delphi on my 18th birthday, Iâ€™m shocked to my core, to find out that I am a demigod! Yes, you heard correctly, a demigod! And one that is an offspring to one of the mighty gods.I never believed in the Greek gods until I started showing superhuman abilities, and this drastic change of events has awakened a forbidden prophecy, that no mere mortal could ever hope to complete.The barrier between the god's and humans has never been crossed before, well at least not until now. Everything changed on that fateful night, when the gods received a prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi exclaiming that Mount Olympus will be overthrown and destroyed by an evil fiend, and that only four demigods would be able to save them from destruction.These four demigods, offspring to the mighty gods of Olympus, will hold the fate of both worlds in their hands.",
