  "description": "He's a nobody from nowhere with modest talents. No way should he be pitching in the Major Leagues. But Homer Newbody, against all odds, does reach the Major Leagues, and makes the most of it, throwing no-hitters in his first two starts for the New York Yankees. The rookie sensation is on his way. Or is he? Announcing to the world he would be willing to play for nothing soon gets him on the wrong side of teammates ... opposing players ... the media ... the baseball establishment. And who exactly IS Homer Newbody? Is the small town guy with the aw shucks persona for real? What secrets are in his past? Homer will learn that his biggest battles aren't on the field, but off it, even as his team heads toward the divison title. Nothing Down is a baseball story, a modern tale, of one man's pursuit of the American Dream.",
