  "description": "Sometimes pain is inherited from generation to generation. Secrets locked away where the eyes can't see and the ears won't hear. Pain trapped where no one can feel it. The mind has its own means of survival. The heart has its own means of escape. When the lines blur so does reality. When you lose your grasp on reality it can leave you looking down on the edge of sanity.The Unmastered edition of LEVÆŽLS To My Insanity is a limited, short-run edition no further release will be made once publication ends. This book is the raw, unfiltered look into who Violet is and into the darkness of a traumatized heart.",
