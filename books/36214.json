Her parents have spent all their money trying to find her and the family has moved to a trailer park for Crags - magical creatures that live on the edge of human society - next to the dark forest. Here Emma meets a smooth-talking cat named Jack who has a plan to rescue her sister. He shows her how to shape-shift, to develop claws and cat senses.
