  "title": "The Neverglades: Volume One",
  "description": "Mark Hannigan is a homicide detective in the isolated town of Pacific Glade, located in the dense forest regions of Washington. The town is so shut off from the rest of the world that it has earned the nickname “Neverglades” from its longtime residents. The Neverglades are no stranger to bizarre and inexplicable events, and Hannigan has seen plenty of things on the police force that seem to defy earthly explanation.  Enter the Inspector. A mysterious figure always seen with a cigar and fedora, this otherworldly detective knows more about the workings of the Neverglades than any human being rightly should. There’s a rip in reality around Pacific Glade, he says, making it a breeding ground for the strange and supernatural, and the Inspector is just one of many entities who have managed to slip through.  In these nine interwoven stories, Hannigan and the Inspector traverse the haunted grounds of the Neverglades, where it's going to take everything they've got to make it out alive. Time paradoxes, pocket universes, giant dream-weaving crabs and star-snuffing leviathans - it's a lot for one measly little human to handle. But with an eldritch abomination by his side, Hannigan just might stand a chance.",
