  "description": "How do you get over a woman you never should have been, ahem, under in the first place?Just when FBI special agent Spencer Landry had decided to forget about investigative journalist Maxine — Max — Keller and their one hot night together, there's a threat made against her and Spencer's protective instincts get all riled up. Again.So now they're shacking up on the Louisiana bayou and pretending to be in love so he can keep Max safe until the guy is apprehended.Considering their chemistry and that he cannot stop thinking about the gorgeous-and-doesn't-know-it, smart-mouthed, bold-and-yet-vulnerable redhead, this could be a fun few days, right?Nope. She's all wrong for him.And she hasn't forgotten he can be kind of a jerk.Sure, the naked-times are great, but he told her exactly what he wants — a bubbly, sweet school teacher who bakes him brownies and loves to cuddle — and Max ain't it.Max not only doesn't bake, no one has ever called her sweet. And cuddling? Shudder.Plus his bossiness is super annoying for someone who's been taking care of herself all her life. But now they're stuck together and dammit, besides being hot and very good with his mouth, Spencer is pretty irresistible with baby goats, little kids, and attempts at baking. And don't forget alpha-protective. All of which makes her stomach feel very swoop-y. No wonder her clothes keep falling off.But this is a temporary situation and they're only faking it. So falling for the guy is a terrible idea.She really should have kept that in mind.",
