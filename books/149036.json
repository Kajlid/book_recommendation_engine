  "title": "Why We Are Born: Remembering Our Purpose through the Akashic Records",
  "description": "From the back cover: Have you ever wondered, “Why was I born?” Humanity has always asked this fundamental question regarding life’s purpose and meaning. Our thinking, however, is often limited. If we ponder this question only within the context of one physical lifetime, we cannot reach the answer. In order to know why we are born, we need to know what it was like before birth—and after death, and further yet, even before we assumed individuality. You are not your body. You are the soul currently living in the body. As souls, we are all interconnected and share information about what happened in our past lives, how we felt about the experiences, and what can happen in the future. Such shared information is called the Akashic Records. Why We Are Born, written by renowned Akashic Record Reader Akemi G in her signature straightforward style and with clear words, is a gift of light that dispels many spiritual myths such as “Life is a school.” Whether you consider yourself spiritual or not, you will find in this book fresh insights that will help you remember how marvelous life really is despite its challenges.",
