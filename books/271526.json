  "description": "Bahamian. Haitian. American. Where can I fully belong?At age sixteen, Cholet Josué arrived on the shores of Miami in a wooden boat—and immediately put the past behind him. More than two decades later, the elusive question of identity pursues him, forcing him to confront a difficult truth: the cultures that formed him have each indelibly stamped his soul. Courageously, Cholet dismantles his own story to uncover a way to unashamedly, unabashedly fit in with three different worlds while belonging to none.Honest and compelling, Twelve Unending Summers is a deeply personal journey that resonates with the universal human need to find a home and embrace the legacy of family heritage.\"Twelve Unending Summers is a remarkable and timely tale of the power of the human spirit. So many things went wrong and right in this remarkable young man’s journey. It touches the heart while providing great insight into life in Haiti, the Bahamas, and America for a young man who by all rights should have failed, yet did just the opposite. I am proud to have played a small part in his journey.\" David T. HughesCEO (retired), Boys and Girls Clubs of Broward County \"Cholet Josué’s fascinating autobiography puts flesh on the bones of a story that is often too abstract: the perilous journey that desperate Haitians make to get to America. It is all here, the dangerous boat trip across the Caribbean, the years of living in the shadows as an undocumented immigrant in South Florida, and the part that is far less known: ultimate success in his adopted country. Josué earned a degree in chemistry while still illegal, represented himself successfully in deportation hearings, and went on to complete medical school. This is an engrossing human triumph and a genuine American story.\"Joel Dreyfuss, journalist and correspondent",
