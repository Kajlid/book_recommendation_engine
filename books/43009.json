  "description": "'Reflections of Life and Love in Australia' is a collection of Short Stories set in Australia. Mostly romantic in theme, they are easy and quick to read, and make great reading for bed-time, or when time is limited such as waiting for appointments. A few of the tales fall into the human interest category, such as 'Hand in Hand', which delves into parents' dilemma over their child's love of sport, and 'A Secret, Banished', a grandmother's resolve to improve her literacy. Readers have praised the three earlier volumes in the series as being easier to understand and relate to than Short Stories written by others. This fourth book is, I believe, of equal interest and quality to the others. If you are looking for a well-written selection of Short Stories, devoid of bad language and suitable for adults males or females, why not give consider 'Reflections of Life and Love in Australia'?",
