  "description": "**Author’s Note: This is the prequel to the full-length romance novel SOMETHING RECKLESS, available now!**“You need a good guy. A long-term guy. One who does dates and romance and emotional strings…I’m just an asshole who wants to tie you up, make you come, and walk away.” Samuel Bradshaw is a man with a reputation—the kind of reputation that should have me running the other way. Instead, it has me searching for the shortest distance to his bed. I won’t be the starry-eyed girl who thinks she can change a man like Sam, and despite what he thinks, forever is not what I need. I need the things he makes me feel, the way he turns me on, and the promise of pleasure in his eyes. I need SOMETHING WILD.The Reckless and Real Series includes:SOMETHING WILD (Liz and Sam’s story begins - novella)SOMETHING RECKLESS (Liz and Sam’s story continues)SOMETHING REAL (Liz and Sam’s story concludes)",
