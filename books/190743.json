  "description": "For sixteen-year-old Casper Quinn, there's only one good thing about attending a fire-and-brimstone Pentecostal church in Hickory Ditch, Arkansas, and that's Brant Mitchell, the pot-smoking, worship-leading golden boy he's gone and fallen in love with. But just as the sparks between them finally start to fly, a political firestorm erupts over everyone's favorite fast food chicken chain, Wings of Glory. Caught in the middle of the cultural crossfire, Casper and Brant will do whatever it takes to protect their secret. But feelings aren't the only thing Brant has been hiding in this magical Southern Gothic romance, and when the truth comes out, Casper's faith in him will be put to an unimaginable test. Fans of Jeff Zentner, John Corey Whaley, and Patrick Ness will devour this timely yet timeless tale of first love, fried chicken, and the things we give ourselves permission to believe in. CHICKEN will keep teens and adults alike swooning and swearing 'til the very last bite.",
