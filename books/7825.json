  "title": "Raw Deal: How the Bush Republicans Plan to Destroy Social Security and the Legacy of the New Deal",
  "description": "Social Security is facing the most serious, well-financed, and determined threat to its existence since its inception in 1935. For Americans to make sense of the barrage of conflicting messages on the subject, it's necessary to understand who is behind the campaign to \"reform\" Social Security, what the campaign aims to achieve, and how it misrepresents its goals. Best-selling author Joe Conason exposes why and how this is happening. \"The Raw Deal explores the Right's privatization goals, Bush's hard-fought privatization campaign (built on a stacked \"study\"), the corporate interests behind the plan, the media campaign to undermine confidence in Social Security, and how the swindle can be stopped. Conason's no-apologies, no-nonsense approach clears up the myriad misperceptions surrounding this important, confusing issue and gets to the truth about the big Social Security bluff.",
