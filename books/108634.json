  "title": "Fighting Back: A Battered Woman's Desperate Struggle to Survive",
  "description": "The shocking true story of a woman pushed to homicidal rage by the hands of her violent husband . . .Long before there were abuse hot lines and shelters for battered women, June Briand fired four bullets into her husband's head and was sentenced to fifteen years to life. This is the shocking true story of survival--and the intense bond June shared with her pathologically violent husband, a monster who physically and sexually tortured, degraded, and dominated her so relentlessly that she refused to believe he was dead even after she killed him.What kind of woman would slay her own husband? What kind of man would drive her to do it? Why didn't she just leave him? Based on extensive interviews with June Briand, FIGHTING BACK explores these difficult questions while exposing the twisted sadomasochistic dynamics of a relationship that enslaves a woman--and drives her to kill. At once terrifying and maddening, heartrending and ultimately exhilarating-- including an unforgettable glimpse at life inside a maximum security prison--FIGHTING BACK is a book you will never forget.",
