  "description": "Before George Bush and Tony Blair, there was Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Together they embodied the trans-Atlantic \"special relationship\" and faced head-on the threat of global communism. In her eulogy for Reagan, Thatcher famously said, “We have lost a great president, a great American, and a great man. And I have lost a dear friend.”Thatcher was a formidable and largely self-trained orator and this volume collects her greatest and most famous speeches, as well as the cream of her interviews, alongside other biographical material.To mark the twentieth anniversary of Thatcher leaving power, Dialogue is also releasing a three-hour CD of her greatest speeches, unabridged.",
