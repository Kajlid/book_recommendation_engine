  "description": "When Maggie walked into Chaos Tattoos, she wanted a navel piercing. But Anthony had more in mind for the pretty, submissive brunette. Much more. Detailing what he wanted to do to her, which included a bare ass spanking for beginners, he told her to think it over and return in two days time, if she were interested. He never doubted she'd be back. Although Maggie resisted the tall, dominant Anthony at first, she did return. Giving herself over to her most basic desires, she learned how complete submission could bring her to heights of pleasure she'd never before experienced.Read an excerpt or buy book here:http://cobblestone-press.com/catalog/...",
