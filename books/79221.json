  "description": "Jenn Bergquist, Minneapolis major medical center spokesperson (who doesn’t think she is extraordinaire), expected another ordinary day, as she hurried to what was sure to be another dressing down by another angry nurse and some egomaniac reporter with permanently lacquered hair. In Life Erupted, Jenn still gets yelled at, but she also encounters psychic Bianca Fiona (who is certain she is extraordinaire), a liver transplant candidate on a mission. Jenn thinks Bianca is just barely on the side of sanity, and is sure her rigid Norwegian-American architect father Olaf would think even less. Jenn warily agrees to Bianca's illogical request that she go to Iceland to work on a documentary with Bianca's famous volcanologist brother, Dr. Tony Fionarello and the intense Icelandic volcanologist Dr. Erik Bjarnason. Once in Iceland, Jenn finds something she never thought she would possess, something she’ll need when she is confronted with some decades-old secrets. She can let the revelations plunge her into despair. Or she can take a path far from angry nurses, tense dinners with her father, and worrying about almost anything, at almost any time.",
