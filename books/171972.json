  "title": "The Cat and Shakespeare: A Tale of Modern India",
  "description": "The Cat and Shakespeare is a gentle, almost teasing fable of two friends. Govindan Nair is an astute, down-to-earth philosopher and clerk, who tackles the problems of routine living with extraordinary common sense and gusto, and whose refreshing and unorthodox conclusions continually panic Ramakrishna Pai, Nair's friend, neighbour and narrator of the story. This evocative novel brings alive the raw texture of life in Trivandrum, and delights in its humour.",
