  "description": "Esteli, Medellin, Tegucigalpa, Pantoja, Quito: just some of the exotic, strange — and at times downright dangerous — destinations passed through on this riotous overland odyssey through Americas central and south. It’s a savage journey that takes Mark from El Ceibo to Iquitos — through Guatemala and Honduras and Nicaragua, through Costa Rica and Panama and Colombia, through Ecuador and Peru. On his ride into the dark south of the Americas: a failed revolution, a spewing volcano, a drawer of cocaine; and a surreal succession of encounters with an assortment of oddballs and freaks.",
