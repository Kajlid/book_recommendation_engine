  "description": "\"Challenging but invariably eloquent and elegant answers to the most fundamental questions...: What is life? What is mind?\"â€• Kirkus Reviews , starred review Johnjoe McFadden \"enters new and provocative territory in his marriage of physics and biology\" ( Science News ). His simple but staggering theory of quantum evolution shows how quantum mechanics gives living organisms the ability to initiate specific actions, including new mutations. As Paul Davies exclaims, \"if these ideas are right, they will transform our understanding of the relationship between physics and biology\" and may radically revise the notion of random evolution and the debate over consciousness and free will.",
