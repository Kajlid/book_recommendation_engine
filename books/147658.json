  "description": "After finding out the traumatic truth, Keira tries to move on from the doors of Afterlife and the love lost through a world of pain. But Afterlife’s King isn’t yet done with her and Keira once again finds herself stood opposite the man who broke her heart. However the truth that she thought she knew would soon unravel and Keira finds herself following the ribbon of lies all the way to the very gates of Hell. And as Keira knows more than most, the pursuit of truth can be a dangerous game to play when your opponents are Supernatural killers.  Warning: This book contains a sexy, broody King who can’t control his jealous temper or his obsessive need for the woman he loves. So throw in a new Boyfriend for comfort, a Vampire King for protection, a crazy Imp for humour and the Dravens for some family lovin’. What you get is the ingredients for all Keira will need in this quest for the truth about the man she still dreams of… But can everyone be trusted?  Please note that the book is written using UK English spelling with some local northern sayings and descriptions.",
