How would you know who you are?• Where would you hide if your enemy already knew (and perhaps even controlled) everything you did?Anton Krait must answer these questions when he joins the investigator Ilse Voss in the search for her sister. When it appears that a dangerous cult may be behind Mila Voss’ disappearance, Krait and Ilse find themselves traveling through Egypt in a high-stakes plot not only to rewrite history, but also to change it irrevocably. Crossing both international and psychological boundaries, Yesterday’s Tomorrow presents a game that isn’t just a game. It’s a chance to reshape both yesterday and tomorrow.",
