  "title": "New York: A Photographic Album",
  "description": "This keepsake album is the freshest collection of images published in many years savoring the many facets of New York. Some intimate and detailed, others wide-angled, these photographs explore the grand chaotic serendipity that makes New York so vibrant. Tourists and visitors often comment on this remarkable energy—people feel more alive in New York, especially when they are new to it—and this is the perfect keepsake album that captures (and re-captures) that initial dumbstruck awe and rush of adrenaline that everyone has felt here. The photographs also explore the contrasts that define New York—the highs and the lows, the grand and the ordinary. From penthouses to piers and from bucolic Central Park to carnivalesque Coney Island, the book explores New York’s amazing contradictions that somehow come together in a unique masterpiece. From the heights of the Empire State to the nether realms of the subway, from the burlesque zaniness of Gay Pride to the busting Chinatown streets beneath the bridge, from luxury boutiques to colorful bodegas, and from Lincoln Center to the street corner chanteuse—the contrasts of the city are captured in this album to form a coherent picture of the genius and excitement that is the city.",
