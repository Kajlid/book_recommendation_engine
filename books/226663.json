  "description": "Smart. Sexy. Successful. Sayid has it all, including a bevy of young subs willing to serve him. He should be happy, but he can't shake the feeling that something is missing. He doesn’t expect the quirky, outspoken artist that he meets on sabbatical to be the cure for his melancholia. Meeting a sexy Dom wasn't high on Dani’s priority list. She has enough trouble finding time to sleep and work around her infant daughter’s schedule. She is focused on starting a new life in St. Augustin and a new design business. Then he walked into her studio. It wasn't what either of them were expecting but it may be just what the doctor ordered.Reader Advisory: Grab a glass of wine and put the kids to bed. This story contains an experienced Dom and a single mom who is ready for some ‘me’ time. Graphic sexual language and scenes are expected.",
