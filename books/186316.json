Chris spent his childhood desperately trying to gain his alcoholic parents' love. Allie was dragged through an ugly divorce before narrowly escaping being molested by her mother's new boyfriend. A chance meeting draws the two together and Allie is quickly caught up in Chris' new-found lifestyle. Plagued by poor choices, Chris sets into motion a chain of events that drags them deeper into the murky world of meth. Ultimately pursued by both the police and Chris' volatile tempered drug dealer, Chris and Allie are forced to confront their only real enemy: themselves.",
