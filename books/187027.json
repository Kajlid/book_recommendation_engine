  "description": "How far do you go, and how much do you risk to chase a dream? When all is said and done, what is the high cost of glory? Where is the line between love and loyalty? When top gun race drivers clash in the year 2286 on the Aurora Plains of Mars, they risk it all to win Luna Le Mans 24, the Holy Grail of Moonracing. Terry Glenman lost his best friend in a spectacular crash, and his life-long girlfriend fears for his life. The widow holds him responsible with bitter vengeance. The dream of Luna Le Mans seems out of reach until Anna Lachey, one of the most beautiful and dominant Moonrace drivers, brings Terry on board in the quest to become the first woman to win the prestigious event. Anna toys with Terry's emotions as spirits soar, hearts are broken, and scores are settled on and off the track. The action is fierce and tempers flare at 400mph. Wide-eyed fans watch jet turbine machines blast around huge courses, while those who wait in fear pray for loved ones to return home in one piece.Turn the pages and jump into the Six Worlds, where friendship is tested, hearts rage, and tears are shed as they reach for a dream.",
