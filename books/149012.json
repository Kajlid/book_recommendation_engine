  "title": "One Hundred Horses",
  "description": "Grey Fox grew up listening to tales about a love so passionate and rare that it became worth more than all the horses upon the face of the Earth. He didn’t believe any of it until the day he found the rancher woman injured and near death after an attack by Brother Lion. Now, before him, the vision materialized. Yet he felt nothing but a warrior’s instinct to protect. How could he love anyone so greatly? His heart had died many moons ago...  Sarah would do anything to escape. She could not possibly be the girl the Comanche predicted would come into their world and be the woman of this great love. But as time and suffering passed like petals on the wind, Sarah would come to realize that the only ties that bound her were the ones around her heart—and hope would grow that Grey Fox might ride with a hundred horses to carry her home.",
