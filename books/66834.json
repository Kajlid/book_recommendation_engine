  "description": "The Maze Runner meets Hatchet in this sci-fi adventure with a surprise twist ending that no one will see coming. Survive one world. Save another. Ana wakes on a barren alien world. The instructions in her pocket tell her that she must survive a trek across Paradox in less than 28 hours. Mission? Check.Weapons? Check.Memory? Missing. . . . Meeting up with three other teens—including one boy who seems strangely familiar—Ana treks across the inhospitable landscape, occasionally encountering odd twists of light that carry glimpses of people back on Earth. They’re fighting some sort of disease, and the situation is critical. What’s the connection between Ana’s mission and the crisis back on Earth, and how is she supposed to figure it out when she can’t remember anything?",
