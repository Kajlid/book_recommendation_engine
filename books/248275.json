  "description": "Iia Danner, a robotic bee keeper, is brilliant, beautiful and prey in a twisted game of monkey in the middle. Wanted because she holds the key to the demise of a society, she finds herself in rebel hands and on the wrong side of the law.Life was great before she met Eli. Now she’s begun to question everything she knows. Is she really being hunted? Or is what she’s been told, what she sees, all an illusion to gain her cooperation? She can’t get over the feeling she’s being manipulated, but she’s grown to trust and care for the rebel leader and chooses to take his side. He wouldn’t lie to her, would he? When a swarm or robotic bees attack, Iia must make a decision that will affect every man, woman and child on the island chain she lives on, and until she lands on an alien shore months later, she doesn’t question what she’s done. On what used to be the coast of California, hidden truths come to the surface and Iia realizes she hasn’t reached the end of her story. No, her tale is just getting started, and if she’s going to fix what’s she’s done, she needs to figure out who is friend and who is foe.",
