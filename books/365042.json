  "title": "Southern Plate: Classic Comfort Food That Makes Everyone Feel Like Family",
  "description": "My name is Christy Jordan and I like to feed people.I come from a long line of Southern cooks who taught me home cooking is best, life is good, and there is always something to be grateful for. I created Southern Plate so that I could share the recipes and stories that have been passed down through my family for more than nine generations.You won't find fancy food or new-fangled recipes in this cookbook-just easy, no-fuss Southern favorites such as Chicken and Dumplings, Homemade Banana Pudding, Aunt Looney's Macaroni Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Daddy's Rise-and-Shine Biscuits. (I want to make one thing as clear as How your mama made it is the right way! I'm going to bring it to you how my mama made it, which is the only right way for me.)These stories and recipes come from my heart. They are a gift from my ancestors, but the ability to have them heard is a gift from you. Take a seat at the Southern Plate table; you're with family now.",
