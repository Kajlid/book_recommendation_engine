  "description": "Welcome to Chryse City, where the young seek their fortunes and the wealthy never die...Dezi doesn't own the clothes on his back or the blood in his veins. He's a college dropout working a dead-end job on the most backwater planet humanity has ever colonized. He'd always dreamed of traveling the system, but when he's framed for a facility malfunction, he's forced to flee to the capital of Mars—a city teeming with gangs and space-age aristocracy.He manages to land a job at a luxury casino where a masked VIP selects him as his regular host. Umbra is a perennial, one of the few wealthy enough to extend their lives through a blood-based medical process, and he might be Dezi’s ticket to paying off the bounty hunters chasing him down, but the immortal is as eccentric as he is generous. He claims to be an authentic vampire, and his appetites have Dezi questioning whether he might just be telling the truth.Dezi doesn’t have a clue what an immortal who has it all sees in him, but the connection growing between them is undeniable—even if flings between humans and perennials never end well. It all goes to hell when a storm ravages the city, forcing Dezi to choose between becoming the vampire’s new pet or finding his own way to survive this storm-torn planet.With a vivid world, complex characters, and jaw-dropping twists, Bleeding Mars is a queer sci-fi that offers an ingenious new take on classic vampire tropes.
