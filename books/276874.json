  "description": "One human girl...\n\n\n\nFive scorching hot dragons...\n\n\n\nA thousand reasons not to want them...\n\n\n\nNone of those reasons matter!\n\n\nIt’s been five years since my great-aunt and her husband rescued me from foster care - and since I discovered dragons exist. For reals!\nYeah, I had a hard time believing it too, but now I’m learning what it means to be a dragon keeper - a human with special powers who acts as a sort of liaison between dragons and the unsuspecting human world...\nWhen Uncle Max leaves town and entrusts me with my first case, I’m forced to enlist the help of the last five P.I.s on earth he’d want me to ask - his nephews. As much as I want to hate them, for betraying Max, when we all finally meet face to face, the earth shakes with the instant connection between us!\nAnd those powers I’m supposed to have? They seem to grow stronger, the more time I spend with the devastatingly sexy dragon shifters...\nBut the confusing attraction I have for all five men will have to wait, until we solve this mystery. That’s if we don’t stumble upon an even bigger one along the way...\nSpoiler: We do!",
