  "description": "During the past thirty years there have been published hundreds of books and articles which explain the principles of genealogical research, describe the types of source material, discuss the evaluation of evidence, and demonstrate the sheer fun ones gets out os tracing one's ancestors. The classic of all time is Genealogy as Pastime and Profession, published by Danold Lines Jacobus in 1930, when there were few books to tell us how to go about this complicated business. It was written by a man who has complete mastery of his subject. (This book) has long been out of print. The Genealogical Publishing Company is making an important contribution to genealogical literature by issuing (this Second) Revised edition. Its message is timeless.",
