  "title": "Just Watch Me",
  "description": "Jealousy and excitement warred within Dean, but the thrill was becoming too great to ignore. For Danielle, the game had awoken feelings within her she thought long buried--feelings that scared as much as they excited.Then came the Hawaii trip. Hundreds of miles from home, was this the opportunity to take things further than they'd ever dared? When Sandy approached Danielle at the swanky bar/lounge, full of surfer-swagger and sun-kissed good looks, the answer was clear.While Just Watch Me follows characters from the short story Rediscovering Danielle, it's written as a stand alone tale, not a sequel. Dean and Danielle need no introduction. Just be prepared for a wild ride.",
