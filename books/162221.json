  "description": "Who is the Goddess of Thunder?The secrets of Original Sin have laid low one of Marvel's greatest heroes. The God of Thunder is unworthy, and Mjolnir lies on the moon, unable to be lifted! But when Frost Giants invade Earth, a new hand will grasp the hammer--and a mysterious woman will take up the mantle of the mighty Thor! Her identity is secret to even Odin, but she may be Earth's only hope against the Frost Giants. Get ready for a Thor like you've never seen before as this all-new heroine takes Midgard by storm! Plus: The Odinson clearly doesn't like that someone else is holding his hammer--it's Thor vs. Thor! And Odin, desperate to see Mjolnir returned, will call on some very dangerous, very unexpected allies. It's a bold new chapter in the storied history of Thor! Collecting: Thor 1-5",
