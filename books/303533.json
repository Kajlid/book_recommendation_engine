  "description": "This family has lived through hardships and lessons of sabotage from each other, and so few of us still want a family love. I, for one, fought and succeeded to be myself through the hardships, loss and pain of all kinds. A love once felt, made from hard times, only reins in a few. My love is changeable and has always been misunderstood, but this book is my life, my story, and as my mother once said, \"If the others want their story told, they can write it. Never surrender, child; you are a true writer and I hope someday they feel the guilt that made you fight so hard to be you.\"I am who I am.",
