  "title": "Libraries for Writers",
  "description": "Libraries are a unique entity. Many independent authors want to work effectively with libraries but it's not as easy as asking the library to buy a book. In this book, you'll learn how libraries work and what you can do to increase the chances of your book making it onto library shelves. Sarah Perry has a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) from Wayne State University. Having worked in libraries for over 20 years, she also writes fiction as S.J. Lomas and understands what both authors and librarians want for their books. In this book, you'll learn how libraries get their book budgets, the specific process librarians use to select items for the collection, and what you can do to increase the chances that your book will be accepted into the library collection. Bonus appendices include Dewey Decimal categories, sample Sell Sheet, and how to plan a Local Author Event for your public library.",
