Snyder has filled her cauldron with everything that Halloween means to her and distilled it into a spell-binding volume of stories.

This is the perfect collection to celebrate the season of the dead or to summon those heady autumn vibes whenever you like. You may even find a couple of tales that evoke a certain winter holiday that keeps trying to crowd in on the fun.In the worlds within this book, every day is Halloween!",
