  "description": "French writer Roger Grenier’s stunning novel tells of a group of friends in the southwest of France whose lives are forever changed by the German Occupation. The moral failings of one of them, Charles Merlin, which at first seem trivial and personal, assume more sinister dimensions when he collaborates with the Nazis. The narrator of the novel, a member of the resistance, watches Charles’s decline and gains a poignant education in his own failings as he tries to rescue the women in Charles’s life.",
