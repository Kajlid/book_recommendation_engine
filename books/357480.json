  "description": "Piggy's just your average demon, trying to earn brownie points with the Boss by causing mischief on earth. The problem is that he's not very good at it. Every time he tries to be evil, he winds up screwing up and doing good instead. The old adage of 'every time a bell rings an angel gets its wings' is true in this world, and Piggy keeps earning wings he doesn't want by doing these accidental good deeds. Then he has to go skulking back to the Boss to fess up and get the wings removed.To make matters, worse, he's pretty sure that now he's falling in love. Can Piggy keep the wings off his back and keep up with his new man?",
