After the apocalypse, the two surviving tribes are locked in a war for the Gottermund River, the only water source untainted by the bomb. Mala is a medic's daughter who'd do anything to be normal. Even break the law. She believes she's on the brink of insanity. She keeps having visions. She can't stand to see the injured soldiers her mother treats, their haunted eyes make her hallucinate. To get rid of the delusions, Mala tries an illegal magic spell. And then, all hell breaks loose. An attack by the other tribe becomes a massacre. Mala's mother is killed. And Mala's hallucinations morph into something new-a power no one has ever seen before. She's recruited into a covert group of assassins. They promise her vengeance. But Mala's power draws people like a moth to a flame. And everyone has an agenda... Mala finds herself caught in a web of war, intrigue, and magic. Will she escape alive?",
