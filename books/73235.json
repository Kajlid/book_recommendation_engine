  "title": "Soul Self: How to Tame Your Mind, Uncover Your Blueprint & Live Your Soul Purpose",
  "description": "(excerpt from Part One) \"One wise decision can overwrite a myriad of foolish ones.\"Reading this book can be one of these wise decisions. At some point in life, if you are paying attention, an event occurs that can wake you up to the true nature of your Soul.That's what happened to author Jack Stephens during what was intended to be a short vacation to Hawaii. In a Soul-awakening experience he realized that the life he had been living must end so that a new one can begin. In order to focus on uncovering his Soul's blueprint, he left everything behind and entered into months-long silent meditation with his newly-found Soulmate (whom he later married), the Healer and Channel Stacey Stephens.Using easily accessible yet profound analogies, fables and insights, the author shares the universal wisdom he uncovered within himself, informed by the wisdom of \"The Ancient Ones\", channeled by his wife and confirmed by his own enlightened awareness.With clear examples and simple exercises, the author shows you how to distinguish between your ego-mind and your Soul. He guides you through the steps necessary to uncover your Soul Purpose (or blueprint) so that you can confidently live the life your Soul designed.Author's note: It is with immense joy that I share with you the wisdom and teachings of The Ancient Ones. It is my hope that this book will inspire you to have your own direct experience of your Soul Self, which you can then share with others, igniting a chain reaction that can exponentially change the world from the inside out. This is a book, not of the truth, but of my truth, and a resource intended to support you in finding your truth.",
