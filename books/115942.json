  "description": "Dr John Simmons, a world leading genetic engineer is a genius. Beset by personal tragedies, he created the ultimate drug, a miracle cure for many. Hidden behind his shadow were ruthless men, waiting, calculating, scheming, and desperate. Tucked away in the Swiftgene research facility, John worked tirelessly, expectations high on his success - or maybe not. Richard Jennings, Managing Director of Swiftgene wanted a life devoid of work and was determined to get it. Gwen Taylor is bright, beautiful, and ambitious. Unknowingly, she was a catalyst, used in the game of death by an elusive but powerful cabal, cowering under the cover of darkness. Can a miracle turn into blight as humans devour each other, tearing and killing? Can anyone stop the faceless murderers driven by greed, intent on wiping out generations of humans...?",
