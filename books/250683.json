  "description": "Never send a mission report back to your home world unless you’re certain that your home world is still populated by human beings. Nearly a hundred years after they left Earth, the crew of the USS Cepheus has arrived at their new home in the Eta Cassiopeia system. This was only after they rescued the beautiful and oddly talented Ani Maxima from her three hundred year imprisonment aboard the USS Ptolemy.The life of a start-up colony on a distant world is quite busy, but they manage to find time for fun and for each other. Ani Maxima’s super-ability to control technology with merely her thoughts doesn’t serve much purpose for a farmer, however she can still reprogram spy satellites without losing track of her current conversation.Then the ships start to arrive, and although these are coming from Earth, they aren’t of human origin. They are searching for a ship that disappeared a couple days prior, only they don’t realize that the ship was vaporized by a blonde farmer with supernatural talents. How can Ani go up against a whole armada however when their antiviral technologies evolve so rapidly that she can barely get started before she’s detected. And just because she’s not physically on those enemy ships doesn’t mean that she can’t be killed.The Ani Maxima Files:Ptolemy’s Child SuperVirusVeiled SkyEnigmaFlying in the RainSilent LucidityFlesh and BloodSoul SisterSocial AnimalBrought to you by the international bestselling author of the Mystic Saga, Dominion, Beyond the Event Horizon, Kepler Moon Alpha, and Ghosts of Ophidian.
