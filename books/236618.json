  "description": "Tequila, you failed me.  You left me in a terrible haze, and I can’t find my god damn wallet.  Or my left shoe.  How the hell does one lose their shoe?  I have no f*cking clue.  All I know is that my night started out with one thing in mind…to have a little fun.  The problem with that? I can’t remember a damn thing, except one.   Morgan’s soft and needy moans. It’s a sound I will never forget, and just thinking about it makes my heart race and my pulse quicken. And I want to hear it over and over again…I crave it.  But Morgan’s a mystery. The harder I try, the more she resists. There’s one thing she doesn’t know about me though…I’m not one to give up.  I’ll play her game. I’ll let her think she’s won. But in the end, I will have her.  Because all I need is Just One Chance to prove she’s meant for me…",
