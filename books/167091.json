  "description": "Welcome to the world of Jack Bleacher. Any resemblance to any other fictional character, living or dead, is entirely deliberate. This novella takes our hero to a ghost town deep in the New Mexico desert. Framed for murder, Bleacher must earn the trust of the beautiful lady sheriff (is there any other kind?) and battle assorted bikers, scofflaws, evil nerds, and a ruthless melon farmer to clear his name. He must also uncover a secret in the townâ€™s dark heart and solve a mystery - what exactly is going on in the smelly old factory, and what does Bleacher have to do to stop it?",
