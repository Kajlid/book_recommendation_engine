  "description": "Sometimes, the handsome prince is the one who needs saving. Considered the family disappointment, half-goblin Rii’zae is excited to become the newest library guardian at the imperial palace in Er’hadin. Of course, he never expected to meet a handsome royal who not only talks to him but even finds him attractive! When Prince A’bbni seeks his help to dissuade a persistent suitor, Rii’zae discovers he just might be able to help, if he can only overcome his incessant self-consciousness. A Study in Scholar is a prequel short story set in the goblin continent of Hanenea’a, before the events in The Goblin Twins. It can be read as a standalone and contains explicit sexual content that is not intended for children. Reader discretion is advised.",
