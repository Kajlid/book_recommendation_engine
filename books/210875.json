  "description": "It all started such a long time ago, when Russia was hit by several atomic blasts. No one knows why. All that people remember is what happened afterwards. The explosions replicated worldwide, forcing people to flee their homes, leave behind their belongings. They scarpered like cockroaches, away from sunlight, as far from radiation as possible, but in their hearts the knowledge that hatred had been the cause of these attacks. Radiation devoured the world, feasting insatiable until there was nothing left to feed on. Those of us who survived did so in bunkers deep in the earth, prisoners of this madness, we let ourselves be influenced by it, and poured back into the world the same folly that had driven us underground.My name is Duncan Glisworth and I’m going tell you about the events that led me to have to make the hardest decision of my life.",
