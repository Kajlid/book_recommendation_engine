  "title": "The Lesser Evil?",
  "description": "In three debates Marxist leaders explain why a government that advances the interests of the working class and oppressed cannot be established through support to one of the two parties of big business in the United States. And why backing the \"lesser evil\" of the Democratic or Republican candidates will not slow down or defeat the right wing. They explain how working people -- as they learn through growing struggle that they are part of a class with interests opposed to those of the employers -- will build a mass political party of their own to stop the bosses' march toward fascism and war.",
