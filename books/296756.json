  "description": "Abigail Spencer excelled in all things academic, including graduating at the top of her class. Her payoff came with a job offer she couldn't refuse at the university she adored. Her life’s plan wrapped in a neat, tidy package until the man who lived in her dreams, and never in her reality, knocked down her walls. Wall Street entertained Elliot Thompson until he grew tired of playing with fat cats with no morals. The golden boy changed directions when he charmed his way into the office of the Presidency at a top tier university. Never one to sit back waiting for life to happen, he found himself drawn to the one thing that challenged a rule he swore he’d never breach; an affair with an employee. His resolve wavered when he set his sights on an attractive wallflower. She turned into the one goal he never planned on fulfilling, but she became the one he knew he couldn't live without.",
