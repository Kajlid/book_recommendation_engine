  "description": "They call them broken. They call them bad. I call them mine.What we have is more powerful than the all the Knights combined.Or at least, I hope so…because they haven’t stopped.Those in power seek to take me down, to use me like I’m just an asset. They want to whittle me down until I comply…I won’t.I refuse to stop until my sister’s murderer is brought to justice. Until I get to walk away from the elite world, forever linked to three men whose hearts are bigger than I ever expected.It’s time to show the Knights what we’re made of…together.",
