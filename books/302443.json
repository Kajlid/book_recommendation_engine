  "title": "Drew and Vince",
  "description": "Drew ran away to college to avoid dealing with being gay. That seems like a mistake when he ends up rooming with fellow wrestler Vince to whom he cannot deny his attraction. But maybe not, since Vince wants him too. Publisher's note: This book is a homoerotic love story and contains subject matter that may be objectionable to some readers: male/male sexual practices, including rimming, and sexual fetishes.",
