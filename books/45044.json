One might say that our words are a movie screen that reveals what we have been thinking and the attitudes we have.\"Building on the premises of her bestselling books, Power Thoughts and Living Beyond Your Feelings , Joyce examines how we use words-the vehicles that convey our thoughts and emotions-and provides a series of guidelines for cultivating talk that is constructive, healthy, healing, and used for good results.Topics include:In \"A Dictionary of God's Word\" at the end of the book, Joyce provides dozens of scripture verses, arranged by topic, and recommends that we read them aloud to strengthen our vocabulary of healing words.",
