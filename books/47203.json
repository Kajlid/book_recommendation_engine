  "description": "A short story set in the Wolf's-own series.Life for an immortal can get a little dull. But Skel has just found a new spark of interest in Wolf's new Null, and he's taking another look at life, love, the world, and Kamen Malick. NOTE FROM THE   This was meant as a free gift to the readers of the Wolf's-own series. It is not a 'teaser', it is not a 'lure' to try to get new readers to buy the rest of the books. It is purely and simply a background story that readers asked for, provided to them in thanks for their support. If you have not read any books in the series, you will neither understand nor enjoy this short.Thank you.~Carole Cummings",
