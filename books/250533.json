  "description": "In the summer of 1940, with France on the verge of surrender to Germany, Valli Chattaine, a star in the Paris Ballet Company, must escape Paris and return home to French Morocco. A French Foreign Legionnaire, hired by her family, attempts to get her safely out of Paris. Marc Durell, an adventurous and capable soldier, also brings Valli a secret letter from her older sister, Gisele. But in going home, Valli falls into a maze of dark deceptions and dangers. Through it all she comes to a deeper understanding of God's grace, which is so much greater than her own. His grace helps to bring her and her family beyond devastating circumstances in Casablanca and is equally present in her own romance with the charismatic Legionnaire.",
