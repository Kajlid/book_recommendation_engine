The closest of friends for many years, Craig and Jack are ecstatic that they’ve finally found a woman who’s willing to be with both of them. But they’re also worried. While she was accepting of their odd relationship, how will she react when she finds out that the two men are powerful supernatural beings, able to take on the forms of animals at will? Will the lust triangle survive the incredible revelation, or will it all come crashing down around them? Either way, Michelle is in for a hell of a ride.",
