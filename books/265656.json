  "description": "In Shadovia they say that the darkness whispers the secrets of the dead. From this darkness, a terrible secret is revealed to Prince Leif, and threatens to destroy all Shadovia.  The secret? A twin sister, whose death, at birth, his father ordered because of a terrible prophecy. A prophecy which foresaw Shadovia's destruction at the hands of a demon child born of the Queen.  But in a Kingdom as dark as Shadovia, Fate would not allow the prophecy to be avoided so easily, and the mercy of one man spared the little princess and secreted her away.  Intervening again, eighteen years later, Fate ensures that Prince Leif learns of his sister. Tormented by the knowledge of a sister he never knew, Leif seeks out his long-lost sister to prevent the prophecy's fulfillment.  But, in the darkness of the coming storm, who is to say which child is the demon? Even Leif starts to wonder which child will bring the destruction.",
