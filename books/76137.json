  "description": "Beset by false friends and the weight of a world's expectations, Nish flees his father, the God-Emperor - always searching for the means to orchestrate his downfall. Nish's reluctant allies are Maelys, who believes he betrayed her family; former scrutator Xervish Flydd, now stripped of power; and Colm, whom Nish owes a favour he can never repay.If their fragile partnership survives, they may have a chance to save themselves, and their land. The group must find a hidden tower in a barren arctic wilderness, and somehow convince the dread Numinator, who despises all humanity, to come to their aid. And what of the different futures projected in the Pit of Possibilities? Can they, and should they, trust its portents? They have nothing to lose but their hope - a frail weapon in a war upon a god.",
