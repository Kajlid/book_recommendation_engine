The tapestry of their lives is woven through the powerful tale of a dystopian world that could have been...Jackboot Britain depicts the grim realities of a Nazi Britain and Hitler's Europe through the lives and deaths, triumphs, setbacks and tragedies of a diverse range of characters, all of whom are caught up in the carnage and chaos of war.",
