  "description": "Large Print edition of Big River Big Sea - the Untold Story of 1949. The older readers of books from this era would appreciate the large print. Lung Yingtai (Long Yingtai in Romanized form) traveled all over China and the world, and looked in her own backyard, to collect the stories of the people who survived the bloody Chinese civil war. These are the untold stories of 1949, the year China was decidedly cut in two. Lung said in an interview published in New York Times, \"In this book I don't care about who is on the right side, the victorious or the defeated side. I just want to show you that when you dismantle the apparatus of state, what's inside are these individuals.\" Book annotation copyright &copy 2010 Tsai Fong Books, Inc. All rights reserved.",
