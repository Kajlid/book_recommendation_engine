  "description": "A young woman's yearning for inner peace is about to be realized--at a trip to the woods to unlock the secrets of the ever-thinking mind. Hosted by spiritual master S. N. Goenka, a ten-day vipassana meditation retreat that she attends irrevocably alters her perspective...and her future. Inner Pilgrimage: Ten Days to a Mindful Me is a comprehensive, moment-by-moment description of the author's ten-day vipassana meditation retreat. The story unfolds with her arrival at the retreat as an ordinary citizen seeking a calmer, more centered existence. Sacrificing every luxury and self-indulgence, and following a rigid daily routine that excludes reading, writing, praying, listening to music, watching TV, and talking, the author spends ten hours everyday, meditating.Inner Pilgrimage provides rich imagery and clearly articulated details of the author's physical experience and her mental & emotional states, during sustained meditation. It provides a compelling insight into her experience of discovering the realm and rewards of vipassana meditation.",
