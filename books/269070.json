  "description": "Ruthless Bastard. White Knight. But I just call him “boss.”   Thomas Goldstone. A man of billion dollar deals in custom-tailored suits, he demands more than your best.  He’s scary. Driven. Haunted by inner demons that have taken him to the brink. But beneath the arrogant, controlling façade lies a heart of gold. It makes me want to solve him one growly, messy piece at a time. To be the only one who sees the truth of the man.  But I’m... me. A pink-haired, anime-loving, data-crunching geek with an office in the basement of Goldstone HQ. My chances with the big boss? Statistically insignificant.  His burning gaze and clenched jaw say otherwise though. Gives me hope and ignites a flame so hot my glasses fog up. I shouldn’t mix business with pleasure. Shouldn’t tempt the beast upstairs. Shouldn't keep wondering...  Do fairy tales really come true?  From USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post Bestselling Author Lauren Landish comes Beauty and the Billionaire. Your favorite fairy tale with a side of... dirty. Prepare for twists you'll never see coming and loads of alpha goodness that will make your heart, and your kindle, melt.",
