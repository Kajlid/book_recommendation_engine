  "description": "When a flower girl is killed on the streets of Victorian London, two innocent comedians stand accused of her murder. Vilified by their audience, and hounded by a police sergeant seeking promotion, they find themselves in a murky world of deceit and lies; a world of conspirators and aristocrats, lovers and killers... *** Set in the rumbustious Music Hall of the late 19th century, 'Out of the Limelight' is a tale of conspiracy, murder and love. This is a gripping read - a Victorian novel with a contemporary flavour, full of colourful characters, warmth, wit and humour. *** SHADOW OF THE BRIDGE, a Farrow and Flint novella, is now available REFLECTION OF MURDER, the second Farrow and Flint novel, will be published later in the year",
