Heartbreak, love and the chance to make the most important choice of his life.From Gallipoli to the famous charge at Beersheba, through to the end of the war and its unforgettable aftermath, Frank's story grows out of some key moments in Australia's history.They were loyal creatures, the men and horses of the Australian Light Horse, but war doesn't always pay heed to loyalty.
