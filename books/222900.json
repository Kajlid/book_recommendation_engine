  "description": "From the USA Today bestselling author of School Ties and the Compass Series He needs to be a better man for her sake, but she makes him want to be so bad... Keyne O’Connell leads a charmed life. She has a caring family and a terrific boyfriend. Her senior year is about to begin, and her future looks bright. But one dark summer night robs her of everyone she loves, thrusting her into the care of her boyfriend’s intimidating, much older brother. Dark and brooding, Jasper Andersson is not a good man. His business dealings are barely legal. He’s a womanizer and a casual drug user. He has no interest in becoming Keyne’s guardian, although given her limited options, he doesn’t have much of a choice. He knows he must protect her at whatever the cost. But living in close quarters soon stirs up feelings inside them both that are far from platonic. Keyne needs a firm hand to keep her in line, but what she desires could lead Jasper into trouble...  Praise for the novels of USA Today bestselling author Tamsen Parker “A fictional world that is both dark and joyful, in which an intense, complicated, submissive heroine meets a tender, lighthearted, dominant hero.”—Megan Mulry, USA Today bestselling author of Encore “A smart, strong, brazen debut. Parker doesn’t strip the rose of its thorns.”—Cara McKenna, bestselling author of Crosstown Crush and the Desert Dogs novels “A story that works on all levels, drawing you in with snappy pacing and dialogue, building a slow burn until you can’t put it down.”—Anne Calhoun, bestselling author of Liberating Lacey and Jaded",
