  "description": "SAY WHAT? You're driving down a clean strech of highway. The radio's blaring your favorite Elvis song. Life is good, you think, as you belt out \"people love bagels\" as loud as you can. So what if your best friend insists it's really \"Viva Las Vegas\"? The contagiously popular \"'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy\" hit a real chord with music lovers everywhere-hundreds of fans wrote to Gavin Edwards, clamoring for more misheard lyrics and offering their own aural blunders. \"He's Got the Whole World in His Pants\" brings you more of the best that today's and yesterday's artists have to offer. From traditional folk songs to cutting-edge rock, \"He's Got the Whole World in His Pants\" features the funniest and most popular misheard lyrics, including: \"The cross-eyed baby that you gave to me\"-- (\"The cross I bear that you gave to me\"-Alanis Morissette) \"I want a piece of date bread\"-- (\"I wanna be sedated\"-The Ramones) \"Someone shaved my wife tonight\"-- (\"Someone saved my life tonight\"-Elton John) and the famously incomprehensible \"Louie Louie\" (look it up-it's in here).",
