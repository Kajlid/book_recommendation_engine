For three hours, she uses her wits to defend and prevent his multiple attempts to rape and kill her. After she tricks him into leaving, another real nightmare begins. Fear-filled days and weeks of suspense follow as the perpetrator stalks her. Despite the dedicated work of police and a caring detective, attempts to catch him are unsuccessful. After years of pretending the incident never happened, a storm of events crashes into Cinda’s life bringing with it horrific memories. Now a mother of two young children, Cinda tries to keep her family safe as the unresolved trauma surfaces. Struggling with a sense of endangerment, vulnerability and fragile sanity, she collapses in despair and surrenders to her demons. But, instead of the devil, a benevolent power shows up.
