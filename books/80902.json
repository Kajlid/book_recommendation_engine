  "description": "It's a future in which people live sequestered, from infancy, in tiny cubicles, their only connection to the outside world via the screens that fill their walls. Maeve Wolf is an oddity, being neither genetically modified, nor content to live the cubicle life. Maeve's sister and only friend has died, leaving a newborn baby. When this last relationship is severed, Maeve loses hope of saving her niece from life in a cubicle.Enter Jabar, an evangelist whose secret will catapult Maeve into a new life, as she goes on a journey to the Buffalo Commons of Kansas. Mostly abandoned by humans, the vast open prairie has become a refuge for a variety of misfits, eccentrics, and little old ladies who are just there to help them. Haunted by dreams of her infant niece, Maeve also meets Cal, a scrappy, small-time thief who lives in the high-tech squalor of a squatters' camp in what was Manhattan, Kansas; and Valie, a woman searching for a practitioner of the lost art of natural childbirth.Part dystopian sci-fi, part women's lit, with a touch of romance and a generous helping of nature writing, Post Rock Limestone Caryatids might be the book Marge Piercy and Willa Cather would co-author if they met on a natural parenting forum.",
