And now they ride together in the shadows of the night -- on the run from corrupt minions of the law -- emboldened by the exhilarating heat of the chase...and by a love as wild and free as the wind on the moors.

Yet the proud lady can never betray the passion that joins their hearts...and draws Connor into harm's way to rescue his cherished love once more.",
