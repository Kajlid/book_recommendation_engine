  "description": "\"Wild Tracks: Uncollected Writings 1985-2014\" reprints the best of Christopher Conlon's fiction, nonfiction, and verse not available in the author's earlier books. Published over the past three decades in a wide variety of markets--from obscure, long-defunct poetry journals to national magazines such as Poets & Writers and America--many of these writings have been out of print and unavailable for years. This volume presents Christopher Conlon's work at its finest, offering further evidence that, as Mort Castle (\"New Moon on the Water\") asserts, \"Conlon is one of the best of our time and of the times to come. He is one hell of a writer.\"",
