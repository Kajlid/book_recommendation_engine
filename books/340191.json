  "description": "Brandy Monsoon is looking for love. Since there’s never a shortage of casual playmates at the tropical resort where she works, most of the time she gets it, too. And if Brandy tires of the perpetually curious―but primarily straight―women, there’s always her best friend Tess for a friendly encounter.When an all-lesbian tour group arrives for a week, Brandy is sure she’ll be in paradise on earth. Among the guests is lesbian celebrity comic Celine Griffin, who has an obvious interest in an after-dinner Brandy. Celine and Brandy do find explosive pleasure together,―so why does Brandy feel as if that’s no longer enough for happiness?With days and nights so delicious…who cares about tomorrow?",
