  "description": "Shadow had lived on the fringe of life since he was eight years old. He had been too cold and distant for anyone to even try to reach him… until he’d laid eyes on a twelve year old girl whose life had just been ripped to shreds, but still had the courage to reach out and touch his arm. Years passed and Shadow stayed just out of reach of the girl that had touched him so much deeper than just her hand on his arm. As he watches her grow he realizes that she is home and that he can never ever have her. The life of an old lady in a motorcycle club was no place for a woman like Lacey. Lacey Carson had lived in fear for fifteen years, but not just of the Devils MC that hunted her, but also of the man who had been a dark presence in her life. Shadow was her protector and her nightmare, her greatest fantasy and her darkest fear, but could he also be the one person that could fill the hole in her heart and could she convince him to give her a chance?",
