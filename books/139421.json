  "description": "After emerging from a coma, Faye Wills opens her eyes to complete darkness and the feeling of being trapped. Soon she discovers she is in no less than a nightmare world and awakens in the worst place imaginable. She is one of thousands of bodies in a makeshift mass grave that was once a football stadium.   Left for dead.  There are no signs of life and the only sound she hears is the buzzing of flies that follow the stench of death.  Once out of the stadium she steps into a desolate, barren world, void of all life and people. Faye learns that while in a comatose state, the world was besieged by some sort of epidemic. Without a soul around, there are a lot of missing pieces.  Where did everyone go? What really happened?  Though in a weakened state, she must pull it together and move forward. She focuses on a goal of finding not only answers but survivors. However, the further she moves in her journey, the more Faye realizes that she may never find anyone and must face the very scary and real possibility that she may not only be the last woman on earth, but the last person as well.",
