Sakiya Sandifer to make his literary debut with Thank You And You're Welcome, an entertaining volume of 'Kanye-isms'--the creative, humorous, and insightful philosophies and anecdotes used in creating his path to success. It captures the same wit, playful irony, and piercing insight found abundant in his lyrics.  In Thank You And You're Welcome, Kanye delivers his personal message uncensored, without any five-second delay or media distortion.  'My book is a guide to creating then celebrating your moment!' says Kanye.",
