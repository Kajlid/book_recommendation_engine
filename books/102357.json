  "description": "California has just divided into two separate states. Daniel Bellardi, a man of strong Christian values, would like the state of North California to take a hard stand against its seemingly uncontrollable social problems of drugs, crime, homosexuality, and pornography, so he decides to run for governor. His opponent is a staunch liberal who believes Bellardi's policies may threaten the individual freedoms of the people. The heated campaign turns dangerous as the lives of Bellardi and his family are threatened. Vote of Intolerance, Josh McDowell's first novel, is a suspenseful tale that points to ways Christians can impact society by upholding their morality.",
