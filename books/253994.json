  "description": "Declan Forrester is arrogant, selfish, and insanely sexy. He was the very first boy I ever loved. Then fame and fortune turned him into a man I no longer recognized. I tried to give him everything he needed, and in return... he broke my heart.  Now he’s back, and he wants to make things right. What started as love turned to hate. I told myself I’d never fall for him again, but he’s determined to prove me wrong.  He wants to win me. He wants to own me. He wants to defile me.  And if I’m not careful... I just might let him.",
