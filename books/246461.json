  "description": "\"The world comes to us in impressions,Following one another in rapid successions,Often withering to our biasesâ€™ repressions,Avoiding our inner-voice's confessions\"In this fast-paced and high-tech world which we live in, we make and lose and change opinions on matters very quickly. One minute something is set in stone, and the next it collapses on itself. In such an abstract and virtual environment, sometimes what a person needs is to take a moment and reflect - to look within and ponder matters more important than the next trending album or news of the day. To delve deeper than the mundane and superficial is a sort of nurture for one's neglected soul, and such is done in Impressions.As a collection of poems written within the years of 2015-2017, this book is a collective impression regarding topics which include justice, ambitions, struggle, love, and defining self. The book contains both rhyming and free verse poems, and it emphasizes one's inner-journeys throughout various time periods and topics.",
