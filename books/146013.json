  "description": "Concluding the heart-warming tale of two lovers bound together despite formidable opposition from a woman filled with hate and revenge on her mind. The poignant series 'Til The End Of Time spans more than twenty years as two stars of theatre tread the boards on stages across Australia, Italy and London, until a mesmerising concert in a moonlit piazza in Tuscany and a fateful bend on an Italian hillside... After a distressing New Year's Eve phone call shattered all of their dreams, Adam and Lara must pick up the pieces of their lonely lives – his with a woman whose drunken rages almost destroyed his life, while she fills her days with the welcome sprinkles of a young child’s laughter and nights spent tossing and turning in a lonely bed. Yet the same bond that brought them together on that darkened stage cannot be subdued. After agonising months of heartbreak and loneliness, the young couple once again find themselves drawn into a mesmerising symphony. Until the choices they make are put to the test once again when a heartfelt plea brings devastating consequences to those fragile Silken Images...  ‘An epic love story that readers want to dive into...’ Hannah Gordon Brown, Literary Agent, New York City",
