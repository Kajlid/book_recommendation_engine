  "description": "Palmer is a typical teenager; he doesn’t care much about the world. His parents rarely see him coming outside of his dark and rancid bedroom and his mother doesn’t approve of his “bimbo” girlfriend. But Palmer is not what he appears to be. Palmer is a fake; his online identity is fake; the promises he makes to his “sponsors” are fake; the girls whose provocative photographs he exploits are fake. Palmer’s world may not be real, but that fakeness has made him richer than he could have ever imagined. But while he is mentally swimming in money like a modern Scrooge McDuck, he receives the first email. Fear, worry and paranoia creep in his mind, corroding it from within. No crime goes unpunished; reality always raises its ugly head. I Know… is a black comedy/thriller by David Jester, the best-selling author of An Idiot in Love and The Clinic.",
