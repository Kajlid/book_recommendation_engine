  "description": "Erma Lee is on the run . . . Running from an abusive husband . . . running from a mother who doesn't care -- never cared. Running from a soul-numbing factory job that has held her down her entire life ... Erma Lee and her granddaughter, Cher, flee to the town of Wiregrass, Alabama, to escape the past and start over -- or so Erma Lee thinks. Erma Lee forms an unlikely friendship with Miss Claudia, an elderly socialite who is hiding a few details about her own past. Life in Wiregrass is different for Erma Lee and Cher, for here they find mercy and promise -- until, that is, the day Cher's convict father arrives in town, forcing all three women to come to terms with buried secrets.",
