  "description": "Griffin’s stuck in the crap town he grew up in, half-supporting the payments on his mom’s run-down trailer in the park where his long-time girlfriend lives. He’s dying for something different, but can’t walk away from his responsibilities either.  Lita’s got a name and a reputation to uphold. Forever labeled as the small-town girl who made it big, she’s willing to do whatever it takes to stay on top and shed her southern girl image for the rockstar she is.  When Griffin gets a chance to tour with Lita, neither his mom or his girlfriend can tell him no. It’s his dream, and it’s not permanent.  When Griffin meets Lita, he expects magic, instead he finds a cast-iron bitch. He’s listened to her non-stop since she debuted three years ago, but the harsh exterior makes him second-guess his decision to be on the road.  When he walks in on her during a late night guitar session, her guard is down, and they find understanding in each other they didn’t expect. The late night guitar sessions start to turn into more, but with the pressure for Griffin to return home and Lita to keep up her badass image, the obstacles between them threaten to tear them apart forever.",
