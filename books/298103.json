But when he gets an opportunity to teach wealthy travelers how to paint stunning sunsets, it seems like the perfect break. Until he finds out he’ll be sharing a suite with his ex, charming Benton Aldridge—a British scientist cuter than the baby animals he studies. Mike makes it clear he has no intention of getting back together with Benton, but sharing a suite makes it impossible keep his distance.As they climb over volcanic peaks and swim with manatees through sparkling jade-colored water, can they also help each other have the confidence to pursue their dreams and follow their hearts?",
