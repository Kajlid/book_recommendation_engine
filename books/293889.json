  "description": "Just when things can’t get any worse, they do.  My bestie’s been kidnapped and I’m desperate to find her…but my inability to sprout wings like my dragon shifter guys means we have to adopt a more mundane form of flight. We just have one more important task to complete before we can hop on a plane and follow the kidnapper’s trail to Romania.  With that accomplished, I have time to stew and fret over Zoe, but my guys do their best to keep me distracted until our flight boards. One in particular.  After a deeply passionate encounter with Ash, I feel more connected to him than ever. So why is he pulling away and shutting me out? All I know is whatever bug flew up his butt better not get in the way of rescuing Zoe or there will be hell to pay.",
