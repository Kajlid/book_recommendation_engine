  "description": "In Delinquent Visionaries Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos investigate the changing perspective of architecture. This collection of fifteen essays on subjects ranging from the language and notation of architecture to contemporary architects such as Calatrava, Libeskind, Nigel Coates and Tschumi, is a tribute to the architectural imagination. 'This book should be viewed not so much as a 'visionary' collection of writings, but as a well presented accumulation of thoughts, ideas and observations. As a publication itâ€™s formatting and design earnestly corroborates its contents.' Wrote Deborah Hauptmann, de Architect.",
