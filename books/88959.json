Passion brings Jett home every night, but tabloid rumors and growing distance between them leave Goldie afraid of losing Jett forever. While Goldie secretly longs for a wedding, a baby, and more control in the bedroom, Jett pines for his old life in New York.When Cole, a young man who claims to be Jett's son, arrives at their mansion, Goldie hopes this is his chance for a family...but Cole has a star crush on Goldie and nothing but anger toward his alleged father. Jett's jealousy of Goldie's growing bond with the hot 18-year-old could lead to disaster.There's no doubt that Goldie and Jett love each other, but sometimes love isn't enough. Will Goldie find the courage to confess his needs, or will what's left unspoken destroy what might have been?",
