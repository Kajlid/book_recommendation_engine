  "description": "More Home Cooking, like its predecessor, Home Cooking, is an expression of Laurie Colwin's lifelong passion for cuisine. In this delightful mix of recipes, advice, and anecdotes, she writes about often overlooked food items such as beets, pears, black beans, and chutney. With down-to-earth charm and wit, Colwin also discusses the many pleasures and problems of cooking at home in essays such as \"Desserts That Quiver,\" \"Turkey Angst,\" and \"Catering on One Dollar a Head.\" As informative as it is entertaining, More Home Cooking is a delicious treat for anyone who loves to spend time in the kitchen.",
