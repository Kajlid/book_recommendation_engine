  "description": "Being Lily Parnell’s best friend came effortlessly for Jack. Growing up together, Jack loved Lily and was fiercely protective of her. For almost all of his life all he wanted was to make her happy. When she was happy he was happy, except Lily lived a world away from him now and Jack missed her dreadfully. As far as Jack was concerned there had never been a time in their lives where they hadn’t shared everything and he valued their special bond. In recent years Lily’s ambitions took her overseas and even with an ocean between them, Jack still managed to support his best friend. One day something changed everything between them and their relationship began to shift. Lily had carved her own life and after observing a scene involving her, it made Jack take a close look at his own. Life post-Lily left Jack feeling confused and he decided to take a difficult decision, never realising the potential fallout from doing something he strongly felt was the right thing at the time. With his life laid bare and as a simple, uncomplicated guy he thought he had finally figured things out. Women loved Jack but they had all come and gone in his life apart from Lily. She was always there until one day she wasn’t. A revelation by Lily left Jack feeling betrayed and abandoned by the one person who he thought he could rely on no matter what. During his journey from that moment on Jack faced more separation and loss than he could have ever imagined. How would his experiences shape him as a man and would he ever find it in his heart to forgive?",
