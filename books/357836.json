  "description": "Brownies, phookas, and sprites are just a few of the creatures that the Grace children, thirteen-year-old Mallory and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon, discover in their dilapidated old house. The mysterious goings-on at the Spiderwick Estates are documented in the wonderfully gothic tales known collectively as The Spiderwick Chronicles. The five volumes in the series, written by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, have all hit the New York Times children's best-seller list, and have sold a total of more than one million books to date. The books are now in thirty languages, and two more Spiderwick books are due out in 2005. Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Films have tapped Mark Waters (Freaky Friday and Mean Girls) to direct an upcoming movie based on the adventures of the Grace kids. The Spiderwick Chronicles 2006 Calendar features full-color images from the books by award-winning co-author and illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi. And don't forget the words of Mallory, Jared, and Simon: \"We just want people to know about this. The stuff that has happened to us could happen to anyone.\"",
