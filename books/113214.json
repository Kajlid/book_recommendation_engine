  "description": "Every year between the dates of December 1 and December 24, a strange and wonderful insanity hits Ashton Falls. Most refer to this phenomenon as Christmas Spirit, but Zoe has been around long enough to know that spirit usually translates to insanity, which brings on a phenomenon she likes to refer to as Christmas Crazy. After Hometown Christmas is threatened when Santa is killed four days prior to the annual event, Zoe is pulled into a murder investigation with more twists and turns than the narrow road leading to the valley below.",
