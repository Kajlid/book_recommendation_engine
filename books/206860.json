  "description": "The rise of Kasabian has been a phenomenal one, driven by a mix of self-belief, hard touring and hard living, all from humble beginnings in Leicestershire villages. Their self-titled 2004 debut LP sold over 700,000 in the UK alone, and the band wowed crowds in festivals at Glastonbury, Reading/Leeds and T In The Park that year, as well as touring the US alongside Noel Gallagher. Their second album, Empire, was released in September 2006 to great acclaim and surged straight to Number One in the UK charts, selling to date over a million copies and they won Best Live Act in NME's 2007 awards.Outspoken frontman Serge Pizzorno's pronouncements as to the state of the popular music scene have hit a real chord with the music buying public as the band continues to ruffle feathers and break down barriers wherever they go. Standing on the verge of releasing their third album, the group look set to continue on their quest to achieve the worldwide fame of their inspirations of Oasis, the Stone Roses and Primal Scream. Through a series of exclusive interviews with contemporaries and those involved in the band's remarkable rise, the tale of Kasabian is told in its entirety for the first time.",
