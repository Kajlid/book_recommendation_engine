  "description": "Here is the incredible true story of one woman's fight for survival in the Arctic wilderness. When she was nine years old, Olive Fredrickson witnessed her mother's death in the Arctic wilderness. At nineteen, she married a trapper who led her into a perilous life far removed from the comforts of civilization. Told from a harrowing first-person perspective, Fredrickson recounts the hair-raising experiences of her first years in the frozen wasteland that was her husband's hunting ground. When her attempt to run a farm single-handedly, after her husband's death, threatened to end in ruin, Fredrickson walked 40 miles alone to the nearest village, in a desperate attempt to obtain food for her starving family by bartering against future crops. It was a life-or-death journey filled with bears, wolves, and unparalleled danger. THE SILENCE OF THE NORTH is a story of extraordinary adventure, courage, and human determination in the face of impossible odds.",
