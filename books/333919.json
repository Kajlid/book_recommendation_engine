  "description": "Elena Torres has it all. As a successful soccer star playing for the Denver Defiant, she has money, fame, and, best of all, gets to do her favorite thing for a living. Sure, she’s also a 31-year-old divorcée, has no idea how to go about dating again, and is still deciding how open to be about her recent autism diagnosis. But she’s dealing. Then Harper Wright arrives back in town, and Elena is surprised to discover she has more in common with her best friend’s little sister than she’d ever imagined. And now she can’t seem to get those messy red curls and bright smiles out of her mind…Harper Wright has a Plan with a capital P. Step one, get her new board game café up and running successfully. Step two, cook more often (aka, stop subsisting entirely on muffins from the vegan bakery next door). Step three, stop thinking about Elena Torres, no matter how amazing her arms look in a tank top. Or that she’s starting to look at Harper in a way Harper had only dreamed of back when Elena was her super secret bisexual awakening in high school. Starting something with Elena would be a disaster waiting to happen, but it’s getting harder and harder to remember why. After all, they’re grown-ups now. What’s wrong with a little fun? Elena isn’t looking for anything serious, but Harper will just have to be careful not to let her heart get involved…\nThe Game Changer is a friends-to-lovers sapphic romance featuring an autistic sports gay, a nerdy bi disaster, and an unapologetically queer supporting cast. It is the first book in the Denver Defiant series.\n*Note: This is an #ownvoices work by an autistic author.",
