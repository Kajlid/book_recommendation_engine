  "title": "Practices of Love: Spiritual Disciplines for the Life of the World",
  "description": "Spiritual disciplines are often viewed primarily as a means to draw us closer to God. While these practices do deepen and enrich our \"vertical\" relationship with God, Kyle David Bennett argues that they were originally designed to positively impact our \"horizontal\" relationships--with neighbors, strangers, enemies, friends, family, animals, and even the earth. Bennett explains that this \"horizontal\" dimension has often been overlooked or forgotten in contemporary discussions of the spiritual disciplines. This book offers an alternative way of understanding the classic spiritual disciplines that makes them relevant, doable, and meaningful for everyday Christians. Bennett shows how the disciplines are remedial practices that correct the malformed ways we do everyday things, such as think, eat, talk, own, work, and rest. Through personal anecdotes, engagement with Scripture, and vivid cultural references, he invites us to practice the spiritual disciplines wholesale and shows how changing the way we do basic human activities can bring healing, renewal, and transformation to our day-to-day lives and the world around us.",
