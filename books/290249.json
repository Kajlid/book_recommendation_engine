  "description": "Going on the run was not a part of my summer plan, but it’s either that or get thrown into prison with Calvin for a crime he didn’t commit.\nSaved by new allies, we're once again pulled into another universe, only this time, we have to stick around for a while. It’s all good, though, because being trapped here gives us the opportunity to take our Semester Five classes at a certain spy school all the way up in the sky.The only problem is, you have to be a paranormal to attend, and I don't meet that qualification.\nGood thing I don’t mind bending the rules.\nOn the first day of class, I make the surprising discovery that my team includesRock, Rick, Ruke, and Royce. With Calvin as our sixth, we're catapulted into a semester that puts all our Tracker skills to the test. Being a Tracker agent has been a thrilling adventure, but becoming spies assigned to capture the culprit behind our current dilemma breathes new life into our golden team.With ecstatic missions, steamy moments, and just a pinch of the paranormal, it looks like Semester Five is going to be filled with all sorts of rule-breaking for this foreign Hive Queen.\nGame on.",
