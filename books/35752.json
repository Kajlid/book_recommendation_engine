  "description": "Work. Home. Work. Home. Drink. Smoke. Work. Home. It's a routine that's kept Donnie Guillory a free man ten years after one of the most shocking acts of Post-Human devastation the world had ever seen. Control, caution and a factory time clock run his life, his fireproof suit long ago moth-balled along with hazy drunken memories of tearing up Europe. But someone with abilities like his can't stay forgotten forever, and when he's dragged back into the murky life of manipulation and violence he's come to hate, he'll have the powers on both sides of the law shaking the earth to put him under their thumb. But if there's one thing Donnie's misspent youth taught him, it was that few problems can't be solved with cigarettes, felonies and a well-placed inferno.New Revised Edition uploaded 10/20/2012",
