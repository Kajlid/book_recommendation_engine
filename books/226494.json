  "description": "Ruthless. Unstoppable. Sexy.  So, so bad.  My gorgeous secretary calls me a bad boy in a good suit. I’ve built up quite a reputation over the years. Women have dubbed me \"So so bad\" and men have called me the biggest, baddest shark on Wall Street. They say I’ve been everywhere, done everything… And it’s all true.  I get what I want when I want it. And what I want now is Veronica. Her gorgeous curves beckon to me demanding that I succumb to her irresistible charms. But I can’t. Not yet.  You see, I have a secret. A deep dark secret lurking inside me. For years, I’ve been broken, shattered, betrayed by someone who should’ve loved me beyond reason.  Now that secret is threatening to be exposed. And I can’t have that. No matter what. Not even if it costs me what I treasure the most.  Her.",
