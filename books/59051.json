  "description": "The battle lines have been drawn, and the seelie and unseelie fae will stop at nothing to destroy one another. Caught in the middle of a war that none of them wants, the faelings of Dere must fight for their survival. Street-wise Pook has no desire to take up the role of Prince of the Unseelie Fae. Yet he may have no choice if he is to live through the coming battle and win the heart of the girl he loves. With little magic of her own, Alexandreya hopes that her mechanical inventions can help turn the tide of the war. But as a danger from Alex's past draws ever closer, she finds herself in the center of the maelstrom, torn between seelie and unseelie, with Pook as the prize. For all is not as it seems, and the faelings will soon learn that everything they believed about the faery war is nothing more than a terrible lie.",
