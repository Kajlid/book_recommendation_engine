  "description": "In the Brecon Beacons Captain Richard Yorke's farm, the sanctuary he and the remnants of his platoon battled half way across the country to reach, has been destroyed. Not by carriers of the virus raging across the face of the earth but by bandits; lawless men far more dangerous even than those tainted with the deadly virus.In west Wales doctors at a secret facility transmit a message of hope to any and all survivors: they believe they have engineered a vaccine against the plague. All Yorke and his team have to do in order to be treated is fight their way to the facility through the hordes of mindless infected intent on spreading their lethal contagion.Yorke has an agonising choice to make. Does he lead his small band west in search of a vaccine that may or may not exist or does he pursue the bandit that kidnapped his teenaged Goddaughter whom he is not even sure remains alive and uninfected?Meanwhile, in the North, a politician with her own private army seizes the opportunity to create an empire for herself. She wants not only the vaccine but control of the scientists who created it. And she will stop at nothing to achieve her aims.Viral Revival is the third book in the Virus Sequence, a post-apocalyptic thriller in the tradition of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later.",
