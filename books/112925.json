  "description": "Fate: the development of events beyond a person’s control, regarded as determined by a supernatural power.People say everything in your life is a result of fate. The places you go and the people you encounter along the way are all part of some divine intervention that we ultimately have no say in. I know without a shadow of a doubt it was fate that brought Dax into my life at such a young age and has kept him here ever since. I mean, best friends who join the Army together so they can both pursue their dreams of becoming pilots surely is fate, right? Well, that’s what I had thought. But, when fate decided to separate us after we completed fixed-wing pilot training together, I wondered if it truly existed. That was until I walked into my new Commanding Officer’s office. Sitting across from his desk was the prettiest girl I swear I’d ever laid eyes on, and I wondered if fate was in fact directing me to my destiny. I knew in that moment I was about to be playing with fire. But, I had a feeling my Commanding Officer’s daughter would be worth the burn. Her dad might kill me. But, I’m praying its fate.",
