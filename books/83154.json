  "description": "Paige is just like every other kid. She goes to school. She practices her violin. She plays outside. The only problem is, she cannot quite see the chalkboard, her sheet music, or anything else! Despite Paige’s repeated refrain of “I can see just fine,” the comical illustrations portray a different story. Paige’s parents decide it’s time for her to visit the eye doctor, despite her protests. But Paige’s stubbornness quickly dissolves as she braves an enthralling eye checkup, enjoys a playful frame selection, and, most importantly, ends up with perfect eyesight! Barclay successfully depicts a very real and relevant issue with lightheartedness and gentle humor. Young readers will relate to Paige’s journey and celebrate her triumph of seeing clearly in the end.Praise for I Can See Just Fine\"It’s a useful, non-didactic story for kids in Paige’s situation―and utterly fun, too.”-- Publishers Weekly\"A gentle way to introduce the topic of eyeglasses with a resistant child and what to expect in finding a solution.\"-- Shelf Awareness for Readers\"With an attractive, clean layout and big speech bubbles, this story is one that young readers will easily follow as Paige ultimately triumphs with her new glasses.\"-- School Library Journal\"This is an easy picture book for beginning readers with full-color illustrations.
