  "description": "Faith Watters has a picture-perfect life. Captain of the dance team, popular, happy. She even spent her junior year traveling the world before returning to Orlando High School for senior year. But she's living a lie. Diego Alvarez hates his new life in the States, but staying in Cuba is not an option. Covered in tattoos and scars, Diego doesn't fit in, and doesn’t want to. His only concern is his secret past—a past, which if it were to surface, would cost him his life. The last thing he needs is a beautiful, infuriating distraction like Faith. Keep a low profile. Graduate. Don’t fall for Faith. If only it were that easy.",
