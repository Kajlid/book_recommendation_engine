Now a high school English-Lit teacher, she still keeps her romance novel guilty pleasure to herself, and that suits her just fine.Even though it’s been years since college, Drake Harkins still thinks about that cute, sweet blonde who tutored him. Nor can he ever forget about the rush he got from secretly sending her those dirty books she liked, complete with some extra commentary from him.An unexpected encounter reunites Drake and Evie, leaving Drake wanting more. Evie, however, requires a little more convincing. Can Drake use her guilty pleasure to win her over? Or is he forever benched to living in the shadows of Evie’s book boyfriends?",
