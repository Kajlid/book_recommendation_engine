  "description": "An M/M Age Play Romance. Used to pretending he's someone he's not, twenty-one-year-old college student Micah has been hiding his true self. When a prank sends him into a bar on kink night, he finds something he never knew he needed: a world so strange, yet so alluring, where someone offers to take care of him... even though escaping all the pressure sounds too good to be true. But can he find something lasting with a Daddy who likes to pamper him? Can he trust Carter to be his first in so many ways? At forty, Carter is a widower. Though he's past the stages of grief, he's still completely lost without his late husband. There's a hole in his life he doesn't think he'll ever fill. But Micah doesn't only fit perfectly in Carter's lap -- he's also curious about all things related to age play. Can he coax Micah out of his shell so he can become the femme, carefree, happy little he's meant to be?\n\n\n~71k words. \nTags: Daddy Kink, Age Play, ABDL, Panties/Manties, May/December, age gap, age difference, sweet, taboo, femme sub",
