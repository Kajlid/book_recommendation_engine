  "title": "Little Soldiers",
  "description": "A gripping and intense account of the war from a child’s perspective. This book looks beyond the frontline and documented actions of our war heroes and looks to the children left behind. A fictional yet emotional tribute to all the children who group up through war.“From his dimly lit bedroom, Michael could hear the marching of footsteps en masse. They were just outside his house now, parading through the streets. As Michael peeked out a small section of the window to see what was going on, he could only see wave after wave of soldier below.”A true insight into the thoughts and worries of the children whose lives were touched by war. Whilst this book remains fiction it reminds us that not all wars are fought with guns, some are fought in the mind of loved ones at home.",
