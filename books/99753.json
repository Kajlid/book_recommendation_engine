  "description": "After a theft, Luke ends up in the city prison and faces serious consequences for his actions. The next few years of his life will be spent laboring in a lirek mine. Jagger, a senior guard, splits his time between the mine and the prison. He knows how the cruel system works, and Luke needs someone to help him. Protection has a cost, and Luke will have to be trained to serve and submit in the way Jagger prefers before they leave the prison for the mine. Jagger can be harsh, and he enjoys punishing, but Luke also finds himself being cared for and comforted. Surely, Luke can survive the next five years even if Jagger pushes the boundaries a little.",
