  "description": "What disquiet haunts this Virginia plantation's grounds in the dead of night? Jarel and his best friend, Ivy, seek to uncover the secrets behind her aristocratic ancestry as darkness slowly closes in around them. Whispers of ghostly activity, phantom children, and little Sarah's incessant sleepwalking trouble the family as they are set to host the event of the autumn season: the Everard Debutante Ball.  Join us, dear reader, as four desperate friends find themselves thrust into a post Civil War mystery, fighting ancient phantoms and like horrors rising up from the edges of a local nightmare.",
