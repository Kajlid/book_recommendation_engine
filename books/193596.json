  "description": "John, Sorrel, Wish and Edward Chandler have to spend the summer with Uncle Murdock, their father's half brother. They have not met Uncle Murdock before, as he mostly lived in Livia, first working to dethrone the royal family, and then as as Chief of Staff for Manoff, the dictator who took over. However, since a counter-revolution, Uncle Murdock has been back in England, living in his large house in Cornwall. Manoff, the former dictator, is also there as his guest.The children find that they are virtual prisoners. They are given no access to newspapers or the radio, and when they are taken to the beach, they are closely watched. At night they hear the sound of a child crying in the gardener's house, so they determine to find out what is going on.",
