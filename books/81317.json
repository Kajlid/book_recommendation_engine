  "description": "Ed Crumm is living a life that has come to him by default, not by conscious choices. Late for work, he unwittingly stumbles into events that will change his life forever. This sci-fi short story is fun, witty, and poignant, especially for anyone who has realized that they are not living the life they imagined, or is skeptical about those software \"usage agreements\" we never read.",
