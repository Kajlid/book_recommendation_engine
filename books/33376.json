  "description": "This book of poems is just one of the many beautiful poetic books that I have written celebrating any occasion for that special person or people that you may love. These poems cover sexuality, spirituality, romance, love, healing, forgiveness, strength. Periodically and Briefly some of these these poems share a true story of survival through written poetry as I express myself and how I have made it.",
