  "description": "Make way for internationally syndicated humor writer Katiedid Langrock, whose self-deprecating, unabashed, wacky, charming, fun and brash style is on full display in this hand-picked collection of her weekly column, \"Katiedid vs. ...\"  Katiedid's immodest and cheeky take on pregnancy, motherhood, her own childhood shenanigans and her life adventures will have you laughing out loud.  Regarding a pathetic attempt at pole dancing as a form of exercise, she writes: \"The instructor yelled at me to relish my femininity. I tried again. Bam! Face and floor met. I went home with a bruised ego. an even more bruised nose and nothing to show my eager husband.\"  She writes about sleep as only a parent could: \"Sleep and I were never close -- second cousins at best. But in the past nine months, sleep and I have gone from cool acquaintances to full-on frienemies. ... She takes her sweet time to arrive -- primping her hair, I assume -- visits for only an hour or two and then disappears.\"  And of course, there's a chapter titled \"Potty Humor.\"",
