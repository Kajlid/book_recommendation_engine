But she is also sweet and has a vulnerability about her that she doesn’t allow many to see.She let me in for a split second, and what I found was even more than I had bargained for. Her façade is nothing more than a mask to hide her fears. \nOne wild night in the barn at my cousin’s house, and I’m hooked. \nShe’s intriguing. She’s beautiful.But she also has it in her head that she and I will never work.Which is ridiculous, and I vow to prove her wrong. I’m Colton Thomas, and I’m stubborn too, and I do not give up easily.She better hold on tight because I’m coming for her. And I plan to break down all those walls she’s built so high around her.",
