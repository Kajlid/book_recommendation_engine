  "description": "The moment that Melissa Raymoor saw the small, rundown cottage sitting at the edge of the woods looking so neglected and forlorn, she was all in. Melissa knew that the little house needed a family as much as her little family needed it. The young widow longed for the tranquility that she was sure renting the home would provide for herself and her small son. What Melissa did not expect was to have their fragile peace interrupted by the fast living, foul mouthed, larger- than- life landlord who moved in next door. Crow Mathison knew that he frightened his tenant and not just a little. He had seen the look of terror written all over her face the moment she saw him. But he couldn’t deny it, thinking of Melissa gave him an adrenalin rush. Prissy, mousy, holier than thou, soccer mom Melissa. She was skinny, uptight and totally immune to the outlaw biker thing he had going on. She avoided him, ignored him and called him out on his bullshit every step of the way. And he couldn’t get enough of her. In the small town of Havengate, passions will ignite, secrets will be revealed and the past will come back to threaten the fragile happiness and trust that Melissa and Crow begin to build with one another. ********** This is the third installment of the Hells Saints MC series. It can be read as a standalone.",
