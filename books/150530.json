  "description": "In a chilling literary hall of mirrors, Patricia Highsmith introduces Tom Ripley. Like a latter-day Henry James hero, he is sent to Italy with the commission to coax Dickie Greenleaf back to his wealthy father. But Ripley finds himself very fond of this prodigal young American. He wants to be like him - exactly like him. Suave, agreeable, and utterly amoral, Ripley stops at nothing - certainly not only one murder - to accomplish his goal.",
