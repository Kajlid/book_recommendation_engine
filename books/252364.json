  "description": "Yesterday, I had the audacity to imagine a future.One that didn’t include hunting demons hellbent on destroying humanity or being used as a pawn for my father’s revenge. One comprised of a home and a family and all the things I’d longed for as a broken child.Then in the blink of a silver speckled eye, my foolish hope was extinguished, and my world came crumbling down.We stood strong. We fought. We lost.I lost.Legion, the demon I dared to love, was gone.Now I’m going to tear myself in two and do the unthinkable to find him. I’m going to put my trust in his brother—his enemy—and make a deal with the Devil. And while his darkness and depravity echo mine, I know this won’t end well for either of us.My body may survive, maybe even my soul. I can’t promise the same for my heart. This time, I will not fail. I will not hesitate. And if it comes down to it, I’ll be the weapon I was created to be. I will follow the code of the Se7en and do what I should have done when we had the chance.Kill one to save a million. Kill him to save the world.",
