  "description": "LucyI’m proud of going from a coffee-fetcher and copy-maker to an assistant my demanding boss can’t live without, but I can’t wait to go home for Christmas. I’ve been busting my ass and I could really use a break. But when I’m desperately needed on a project over the holiday, I can’t say no. Guess I’ll be stuck at work with only shy and awkward Evans for company—and apparently my boss and her husband getting it on in her office.EvansLucy is the prettiest, nicest woman I know. And watching her get all hot and bothered when we catch our boss having kinky sex is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. Dating a coworker isn’t allowed, though, and Lucy and I follow the rules. Plus, a woman like Lucy deserves more than I could ever give her. I get to be the luckiest guy on earth and have a Christmas quickie with her while the office is empty, but it can’t be more than that. Even if I’d really like to keep kissing her after the mistletoe comes down.",
