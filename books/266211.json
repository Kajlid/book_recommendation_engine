  "description": "He just made The Naughty List... Marathon runner Sean Jackson's been running all his life -- away from his responsibilities, away from the title of Clan Alpha, and away from Fate. Fate's caught up to this werebear, and so has Santa Claus, because Sean's furry butt ended up...on The Naughty List. Will Sean claim his curvy mate by Christmas, or lose his shift forever? Lesson number 1: He's going to have to start playing by Santa's rules, if he wants his shift back The rules are simple: Sean has to get off of Santa's Naughty List. He'll get his mate mark back. Then, he just has to claim his fated mate by Christmas. That's the only way he'll get his shift back. Oh, and he has to help pull Santana 'Santa' Claus' sleigh -- using the spirit of Dasher, Santana's fastest flying reindeer. Sound simple? Well, Fate and Christmas magic go together like hot cocoa and candy canes... Lesson number 2: BBWs play by their own rules The last thing curvy baker Joy McLedon wants is to have her heart broken for a third time. She's learned her lesson about werebears. Her first bear boyfriend was a playboy -- too hot. The second werebear, well, he iced her out -- too cold. There's no way that she'll give a third werebear a chance -- especially a bad boy like Sean Jackson. So why do things with Sean feel...just right? If Sean couldn't run from his Fate...does this big, beautiful woman have any chance of escaping her own Goldilocks story? And will this fairytale romance end with a happily-ever-after, just in time for Christmas? This story, featuring a bad boy werebear and a BBW baker, is loosely based on Goldilocks And The Three Bears.",
