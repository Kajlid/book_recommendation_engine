  "description": "Maddy and Jackson's lives continue in this story of trust, betrayal, love, and loss. Lowlife is not a love story.  MaddyIt’s been almost a year since I escaped Cordell’s attempt to end my life. The past few months I’ve been sitting hidden and comfortable in my role as a medic in the 82nd Airborne Division. Life is good. For now, anyway. I know my days of comfort are numbered. Because what Cordell Carrington doesn’t realize is I am no longer the sweet, obedient little girl he raised. This time I am ready for him. I’m mad as hell and I want revenge.  JacksonI’m not broken. True, the doctors can’t fix me. I can’t fix me. Maybe I’m not trying hard enough. Or maybe, just maybe, I can’t handle the guilt that comes with healing. None of this means I am broken. All I want out of life is a clear mind and the girl I love more than my own existence to not hate me. But now the army wants to send me back overseas, and the girl? Well, she loves someone else. Okay, yeah, so maybe I’m a little broken. Author's Note: Lowlife is not a stand-alone novel; this book is a continuation of Maddy and Jackson's story. **Lowlife is a New Adult Contemporary that contains mature language, mild violence, and mild sexual content. Discretion is advised**",
