  "description": "Jacqueline I’m messed up. I could say it was a result of my childhood, but honestly I blame myself. The medicine made me feel numb, the blood made me feel high. He wasn’t supposed to be mine, but although he was scared in the beginning, he didn’t run from my demons. He found beauty in my flaws, beauty in the cracks that barely held me together. LeeI had it good, any girl of the week, my dream job, stability, and even then, I knew deep down something was missing. Madalynne opened a door for me, Jacqueline lit the flame. She wasn’t perfect, far from it, but underneath the pain and the scars, I saw her. Sometimes the ones worth fighting for don’t know their worth. Sometimes being broken is beautiful. Beautifully Broken is the fourth book in the Infinite Love series.",
