  "description": "Southern sass and spirit make every Christmas bright! The oldest of seven sisters, Ursula Simmons has followed in her mother's footsteps as a novelist. With a bad case of writer's block, she brings her notebooks and computer home to the old brothel called Paradise where they all grew up, in the hope that being home for the holidays will inspire her―and since it's Christmas, all her sisters will be there too. The sisters take the holidays very seriously, and as soon as they've celebrated Thanksgiving, it's on to decorating for Christmas. As all pitch in to make the spirits bright, younger sister Endora is dismayed to find some of the handsome men who've come to help doing more flirting than anything else. She's determined to show her sisters that no relationship is worth the heartbreak. But it might be Ursula who reminds the family that Christmas is a magical time, and finding new love is always a gift. Praise for Carolyn Brown: \"Fans...will flip for this charming small-town tale.\"― Woman's World for The Sisters Café \"Brown's characters easily inspire readers to care what happens to them.\"― Publishers Weekly for Bride for a Day \"A sweet story about building family out of what life hands you.\"― Kirkus Reviews for Talk Cowboy to Me",
