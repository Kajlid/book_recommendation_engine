  "title": "Catch Me When I Fall: A Story of Punk Rock, Addiction and Recovery",
  "description": "At sixteen, I was just another poor kid in Cleveland learning to play power chords on my guitar. It never crossed my mind at that time that in a few years, I'd be playing onstage in Argentina with my musical idol in front of 17,000 rabid fans. I learned two things on my incredible journey. One is that, no matter where you start, you can reach the stars. The other is, you'd better watch your step when you get there because it's a long way to fall. An EC for Real nonfiction book from Ellora's Cave",
