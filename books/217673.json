The state was the church, and the church was the law; when justice was the tool of the self-seeking, and when imprisonment and poverty weren't enough to satisfy the enemy's appetites...Featuring the stunning artwork of Dmitry Yakhovsky, this debut graphic novel is a bold undertaking. The novel is a complex and visually inspiring epic based in history, and will thrill with its masterful depth of imagery.",
