  "description": "There are a lot of things worse than being \"SLIGHTLY\" ENGAGED...being \"entirely\" broke, \"completely\" alone and \"wholly\" perplexed.It's been a year and a half since Tracey and Jack moved in together, and everything's totally perfect--well, okay, \"almost\" perfect. There's still Tracey's mom, who says they're \"living in sin,\" and her friends, who are all smug, married and totally sure that there would already be a ring on Tracey's finger if she hadn't been in such a rush to cosign a lease. Even Tracey is beginning to wonder whether Jack really is looking for a permanent relationship, or whether she's just renting space in his heart.But just when Tracey's doubts are seriously raging out of control, Jack's mom lets her in on a secret--he's just taken an heirloom diamond out of the family's safe-deposit box, which must mean that he's going to propose any day now.Okay, any week now...Any month now?",
