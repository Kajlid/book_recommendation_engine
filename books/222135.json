Flora starts asking questions, but when she is threatened, followed by a near drowning during a storm and a second murder, the hunt is now on in earnest for a killer. Time is running out as the Minneapolis approaches the English coast. Will Flora be able to protect Edward, her charge, as well as herself, and discover who the murderer is?
