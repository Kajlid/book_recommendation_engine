  "description": "In Sink Reflections, Marla Cilley -- the FlyLady -- helped hundreds of thousands of her fans combat overwhelming household C.H.A.O.S. (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome). Taking a \"baby-steps\" approach, she offered little chores to do every day, to wipe out clutter and feelings of inadequacy. Now, in Body Clutter, the FlyLady and Leanne Ely, the Dinner Diva and creator of the Saving Dinner series, team up to teach readers how to handle and erase the clutter they carry on their bodies and minds when it comes to body image.   The FlyLady and Leanne say that it's not about finding the perfect diet, it's about the way you feel about food and your body and understanding sound nutrition. With warm voices, unique lingo, and no preaching, they apply a step-by-step technique, coaching the readers from beginning to end and sharing their own success stories along the way.",
