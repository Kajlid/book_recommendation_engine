The plan backfires when Gwen is forced to have public sex with her partner to prove herself, and then taken as surety for the heroin he is given. While a prisoner of the triad and its notorious leader Kim-Le, Gwen is subjected to the most vile forms of sexual abuse, and then, when they believe they have been betrayed, torture.
