  "title": "A Wreath of Christmas Poems",
  "description": "A Wreath of Christmas Poems presents a fine selection drawn from the literature of several lands and many centuries, and richly expressive of the Christmas spirit in its different aspects. This book, specially designed and illustrated, differs from others of its kind in its emphasis on the high quality of the poems themselves. Some of the pieces, in fact, will be new and refreshing to most readers familiar with the more common carols and popular sentimental ballads. The collection begins with a translation of the poet Virgil's great \"Fourth Eclogue\" - which men of the Middles Ages believed to be a veiled prophecy of the birth of Christ - and ends with the late Thomas Merton's \"Carol.\" In between are fifteen other beautiful selections that together span the course of nearly two thousand years of Christmas celebration.",
