  "description": "Welcome to my best reviewed series yet!  Sex may be shunned in the English villages of East Anglia, but the Viking settlers nearby are more than happy to show the women what a real man is capable of and how pleasurable sex can be with the right lover!  Hilda has a choice to make, but she doesn't realize how little control she might have over her own future. Meanwhile, Thorstein is eagerly awaiting her answer. A complication ties their two communities together unexpectedly and things escalate. She will be forced to make her decision, one way or the other, and Thorstein will be forced to make one as well. Who will be taken?  Alan Austin is a national award winning author now writing erotic fiction under a new pen name and outside of his established publication outlet in order to delve into some of his deepest desires and fantasies.
