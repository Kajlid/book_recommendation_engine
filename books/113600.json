Carefully scrimping and saving for his future life of expectant ease, he gets the shock of his life when he is let go from his employment.With his entire retirement in serious jeopardy, George is thrown into a panicked tailspin. Facing a job market heavily skewed towards youth, he finds out first hand exactly what aging means in America today.

And then he meets Mimi. It is in the act of being forced down a path that he did not choose that George finds not just himself but the woman that has been missing from his life, all along.Had he stayed true to the imagined life that he was sure he always wanted, then true love and true happiness would have passed him right by...",
