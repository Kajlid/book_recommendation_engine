  "description": "The tale of QaiMaj begins here . . . Iskalon, a cavernous world of ice, and Chraun, a deep realm of lava, have been separated for generations by conflict and prejudice. The youngest ice princess of Iskalon, Stasia, cares nothing for politics and war. She yearns for a place prophesied in her Dreams, a vast blue cavern lit by a golden globe and carpeted in green. Drawing magic from ice, she searches the dark, wild tunnels outside the underground kingdoms. In Chraun, half-mad King Dynat marshals his powerful fire warriors. His “Make Iskalon burn forever.” His edict, and the destruction it brings, leaves Stasia the unwilling leader of a ragged bunch of refugees. Faced with impossible odds, she is bolstered by her love for her people and the loyalty of her remaining ice warriors. Her prophetic Dreams sustain her hope of finding a new home for Iskalon. But before she can begin searching, Dynat forces Stasia to surrender and holds her captive in Chraun. When Stasia desperately searches for magic strength in the heart of the inferno, she learns that she can do the impossible—draw power from both lava and ice. Fire and Ice are inseparable, she realizes. By pooling their power, she and Dynat might just find the vast blue cavern of her Dreams, and change the destiny of both their kingdoms forever . . .",
