  "title": "Witches, Sluts, Feminists: Conjuring the Sex Positive",
  "description": "“Like being deemed a witch hundreds of years ago, being presumed a slut today is cause for ostracism, abuse, and death.” . . . Archetypes of “witch” and “slut” have been used to police female sexuality and punish women; now, feminists are reclaiming them as positive affirmations. This book unearths the sex positive feminist legacy of the witch in art, music, politics, and popular culture, connecting the fictional witch we love to emulate and fear with real women, past and present.Kristen J. Sollee is instructor at The New School and founding editrix of Slutist, an award-winning sex positive feminist website.",
