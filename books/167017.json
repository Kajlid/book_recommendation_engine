  "description": "Jeff Harford is making a pit stop in Las Vegas on his way out to meet the organisation of Time-Stoppers in Los Angeles. He's never been to the gambling capital of the world before but finds the city doesn't really bring much to the table for somebody who can stop time. Pausing briefly to watch the strangest couples you could imagine getting married in a little chapel, he meets Paul and Jessica, sweethearts from the Deep South who had waited until Jessica was old enough to get married only to end up having to run away to do it.  Jeff is instantly captivated by the innocently sultry and totally inexperienced southern belle and decides that he needs to cut in line and have this perfect bride on her wedding night. All things come to those who can stop time.  Click the cover to \"Look Inside\" and check under the heading \"Story Tags\" for a more uncensored idea of what to find in this story.",
