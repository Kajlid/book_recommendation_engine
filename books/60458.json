  "title": "A Poet's Journey: Emotions",
  "description": "A Poet's Journey: Emotions, is a veritable roller coaster of emotions from heights of joy to the depths of despair. The good, the bad, and the beautiful of being human, a work set to the huge dichotomy called life. A POET'S JOURNEY: EMOTION is full of honest human emotion expressed through beautiful rhythmic poetry. This vast collection is perfectly tuned by talented author, Marta Moran Bishop. Her work will leave you laughing, crying, and remembering. From subtle romance in MOONLIT NIGHTS to cries of nature in THE YETI SCREAMS IN PURE DELIGHT, and the ravaging pain of experiencing a loved one's terminal battle in BETRAYAL. This is powerful poetry for all. Sammy Sutton, author of King Solomon's Journey. Ms. Bishop states that most of the poems tell a story of something that happened. Some are built upon a thought or a line that wouldn't leave her. She believes poetry should make the reader feel and connect with the emotion and the story. This unique collection brings together works as diverse and influential as The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Maya Angelou, and Robert Frost.",
