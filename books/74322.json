  "description": "In modern Tokyo, eighteen-year-old Keiko Yamada fights to unravel an unintelligible death poem her father left behind. Her only clues include a rambling note about powerful Japanese Spirits, gigantic, beast-like Guardians, and the cryptic words: Go to Japan in my place. Find the Gate. My camera will show you the way.Determined to fulfil her father’s dying wish, Keiko buries her grief, leaves America, and heads to Tokyo’s Ginza in search of an answer. There, beneath the city’s glittering neon signs, her father’s death poem comes to life. Ancient spirits spring from the shadows. Chaos envelops the city, and as Keiko flees its burning streets, her guide, Yui Akiko, makes a stunning confession—that she, Yui, is one of a handful of Spirits left behind to defend the world.",
