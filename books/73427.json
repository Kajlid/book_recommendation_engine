  "description": "A Legendary Christmas Tale, Ladies of Legend Series.The last thing Chelly Schul wants is to go home for the holidays. She left her hometown of Legend, Tennessee on a wing and a prayer two years earlier and hasn’t returned. Her leaving humiliated her entire family, particularly her sister Suzie, since she ran off with Suzie’s (almost-ex) husband.Legend Police Officer Matt Branson values being alone. Even during the holidays, he enjoys the solitude. Dubbed the town hermit, he tells himself he prefers his “cave” to socializing. His friends say he still pines after “the woman who got away,” although he begs to differ.All that changes the snowy day he pulls over the older model sedan speeding into Legend. His gut slams against his backbone as a tearful Chelly rolls down the car window and looks up into his eyes, and nearly melts his heart. But he remains stoic. Coplike. And gives her a warning and sends her on her way.But it shakes him to the core. His high-school sweetheart is back in town. Chelly. The woman who sent him into his cave in the first place.",
