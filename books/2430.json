  "description": "Shurei Hong, destitute but of noble birth, has always dreamed of working as a civil servant in the Imperial court of Saiunkoku, but women are barred from holding office. The emperor Ryuki, however, refuses to take command, leaving everything to his advisers. Shurei is asked to become a consort to the emperor to persuade the ne'er-do-well ruler to govern. Shurei has been disguising herself as a boy to assist Kijin Ko, the esteemed Minister of the Treasury. Despite Ryuki's plan to allow females to take the civil service exam, many remain opposed to the idea, including Kijin. Will Shurei be able to convince the discerning minister to change his mind?",
