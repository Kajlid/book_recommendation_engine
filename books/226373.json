Will Michael find his \"happily ever after\" with either of those gorgeous, unattainable men? Or perhaps, maybe even both of them?Soon, Michael lays everything on the table, offering Lance and Adam an unconventional proposition, and the three men quickly find themselves in a situation that leads to unexpected consequences for everyone involved. Will Michael, Lance, and Adam make the right decision for their individual families, or will any or all of them crash and burn at the end of their experiment in relationships?",
