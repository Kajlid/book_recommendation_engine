  "description": "A World divided. The Vatican: Relentlessly searches for Un-naturals hiding on their side of the barrier. Those deemed un-natural, are sent through the barrier into the custody of vampires, werewolves, mages, and fiends who are ruled not only by the King of Fiends but by the Casteels. A child abandoned with no memories of her past is thrust into a world ruled by the Vatican. Given a name and placed into the brutal school system. She soon learns that her place in the world is precarious especially when she too is called un-natural and sent across the barrier where humans have no rights. The game is in play, but, there are no rules; especially when the winner rules the world!",
