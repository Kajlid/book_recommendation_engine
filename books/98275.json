  "description": "HereÂ´s the first customer review on amazon: Although CIMARRONA is intended for the Young Adult audience, I found it to be such a page-turner that I could not put it down. The story, which takes place in 19th Century Cuba, tells of how the young girl Chabelis was rescued by cimmaron Cooley Valdez when the coffee plantation where she lived was raided and her mother was killed. She was taken in his saddlebag to the Palenque Cave where a small band of cimmarones, or freedom fighters, lived while helping slaves escape the plantations. Chabelis, who was taught by Cooley to be a cimarrona, is relatable and easy to visualize. She is gutsy, intelligent, curious, and at times impulsive. The fast-moving plot is multi-themed and covers such topics as friendship, sexuality, relating to authority figures, racism, and personal identity. The author combines fact, fiction, and foklore to tell this coming-of-age tale, which reminded me a bit of the work of Isabel Allende. Chabelis learns many painful and valuable lessons on to way to maturity. The book is a bit \"edgy\" for very young teens, but has much to offer Young Adult readers who are preparing for the rights and responsibilities of the adult world.",
