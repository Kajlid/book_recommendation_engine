  "description": "Drawing from writings by such iconoclasts as William Godwin and Jack Kerouac, the author of How To Be Idle returns with sage advice for breaking with convention and living an unfettered life In this delightfully irreverent follow-up to his acclaimed How to Be Idle , Tom Hodgkinson shares his musings on what it means to have true independence and what the common man needs to achieve happiness through freedom. The Freedom Manifesto is an erudite, witty, and useful manual for anyone who wants to look after themselves and take responsibility for their own lives. Hodgkinson advises lowering personal standards, learning the guitar, cooperating with neighbors, throwing away credit cards, and embracing poverty. Peppered throughout are insights from such great minds as Rousseau, Ken Kesey, Nietzsche, and many others that reveal the secret happiness found in a free mind.",
