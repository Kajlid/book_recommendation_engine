  "description": "Charlotte Johnson has never been optimistic enough to believe that there could be far more to the world she lives in than meets the eye. But when the enigmatic dracologist Doctor Mediochre Quirinius Seth unintentionally explodes into her life, she finds that whether she believes it or not, dragons and magic are real and dangerous. Unwilling to let such a revelation go, Charlotte soon forces herself into the middle of a battle of other people's wits where nothing is as simple as meets the eye - neither her newfound enemies, nor her newfound allies, and certainly not Mediochre Q Seth himself..",
