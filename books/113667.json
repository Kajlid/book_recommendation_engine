  "description": "Some Stories must be told and this is one such tale. Ofgrandfather the Wulf and The Garden of Eden, breeding pen, thatit was. Bred for what though, Slaves to mine and rape the Earth,our Mother. Are we not her children, Does not Intellect alone,separate us from our Brethren the Beast. The Titans told it true,for we were bred and domesticated, not to have any Naturalmeans of Defense, but our Mind, again why.To Covet first the Apple and then thy Brothersâ€™,for then and only then, did They know, we were ready to be setloose upon the World? Darwin traced it true, water the Origin ofour Species. For Silver and Gold do not tarnish, lovely are they toBehold. The Brothers Cain and Abel, For Thought/After Thought,the Parody still Humors me. We had to shed our skin/ourdefenses, The Snake you say.For what differentiates us from our Brothers theBeasts, the Ability to convey thoughts and actions, the Word. Dowe not domesticate livestock? Institute breeding programs, do wenot school Beasts. To do what we cannot or do not wish to do.Could we, not be set upon the same tasks? Do all the old storiestell the same tale? What a story that would be? Would it tell of ourOrigins and our rise? Would it tell us why, the same Motifs, Echodown the Halls of Time.Would we even now in this day and age accept the Lessons thatthey teach, Parables, Metaphors? What is the underliningmessage, what vein runs true? The tale I am about to unfold, maybe true. I will let you, judge for yourself. How much Whim, howmuch Fancy. It begins with the dark and loneliness of Space, solike the depths of our great Oceans. An irony that I hope is notlost on you. Depths we have barely scratched, why I ask is it so.It begins with Slavery and the dissatisfaction thatit brings. It begins with those that first taught us the taste of theBit, to Yoke the Beast and later thy Brother. We all know, manwas Created, but for What, A reflection of Who. Shall I tell you,will these words ever be seen by another? Will they beconsidered the drug induced ravings of madness? For I haveknown the Taste of the Needle. The Siren Song of lies she sings,only for you if you have enough. Twirling upon the edge, dancingthe Dream, as you dig It in. I only know. I must commit this topaper. In hopes that a more enlightened mind then mine canfathom the possibilities.Ink&Iron Heroic Fantasy",
