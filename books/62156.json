  "description": "Moving house has become a way of life for fifteen year old Isobel Miller. Her father is an Army Major; her mother,a middle aged, pregnant, chain smoking alcoholic. But the move to the village of Langham could be the straw that broke the camel's back. To the truculent teenager it might as well have been to Timbuktu. Isobel is resentful of the baby, angry with her mother for dragging her away from civilization to live in a village which has no street lighting, let alone any decent shops.The only light in her miserable existence is her grandfather, story-teller elite, her saviour. And when one of his macabre tales is mentioned in the local paper, Isobel is drawn into the depths of evil and devil worship. Her world, and that of everyone around her, turns upside down.The cause? A mysterious book, an omen, which once opened and read starts a cataclysmic chain of events, and their lives are filled with tragedy and disaster. Salvation comes in the guise of three other teenagers-Peter, Oswald and Ariel-and the four form a bond so strong nothing can tear apart-nothing except maybe the devil himself!",
