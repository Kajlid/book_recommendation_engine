  "description": "At a quick glance, Carrie looks just like everybody else in her seventh-grade class. She gets good grades, acts in school plays, kicks a pretty decent soccer ball, and is a sensational Game Boy champion. But watch her a little longer and Carrie looks very different. She shrugs her shoulder a little too often, jerks her head, coughs and sniffs in uncontrollable bursts. She has Touretteâ€™s syndrome. And at a time when all a kid wants to do is blend in with the crowd, she stands out like crazy.From the Hardcover edition.",
