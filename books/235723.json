  "title": "The Strange Horizon",
  "description": "The Strange Horizon ranges from stories less than a hundred words to over four thousand words. There isnâ€™t any profanity, gore or sexual innuendo in any of the short stories. The genre varies from mystery, suspense, contemporary, horror, science fiction and fantasy. You may smile, chuckle, express a tear or two, feel a sudden chill or feel a warmth at the end of the story. Emotions are in the mind of the reader and the heart cuddles or rejects those emotions.",
