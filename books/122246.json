He is in fact a young man trapped in a witch's curse. When he briefly transforms into his human self, Ondine is smitten.

This attracts the attention of the arrogant Lord Vincent, and Ondine can't help being drawn in by his bad-boy charm.With so many demands on Ondine's attentions - and affections - normal has never seemed so far away.The Summer of Shambles is the first in the four-part ONDINE series.
