  "title": "The Barracks",
  "description": "One of the preeminent Irish writers of our time, John McGahern has captivated readers with such poignant and heart-wrenching novels as Amongst Women and The Dark . Moving between tragedy and savage comedy, desperation and joy, McGahernÂ's first novel, The Barracks , is one of haunting power. Elizabeth Reegan, after years of freedomÂ—and lonelinessÂ—marries into the enclosed Irish village of her upbringing. The children are not her own; her husband is straining to break free from the servile security of the police force; and her own life, threatened by illness, seems to be losing the last vestiges of its purpose.",
