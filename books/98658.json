  "description": "“They say the grass is greener on the other side. At least that’s what people think. But we know better. We know that any grass is better than no grass at all. That it represents something that lived there and stayed long enough to die there. But we know better. Therefore we keep to our own kind…to our own side. It was them who crossed the fence. They say the grass is greener on the other side…But we know better…it was them who crossed the fence…”\"There once was a government so divided. It was divided amongst classes, I believe. Because the government was so divided, the people became divided as well. No one agreed on what to do. There was gun-control, health care reform, and something called education reform. Or so I’ve been told.\"The world is divided between the high class and the low class. There is no in between. As the high class looks for the ultimate healthcare, they use the low class as their test subjects. They kidnap young Kiranda and her mother and kill her father. Big mistake! After Kiranda escapes the facility and returns to her world, she readies her self to go back for revenge. But first she has to find out her enemy's weaknesses. They were told they don't have any. While in the enemy territory, Kiranda finds an old friend she long thought was dead. Soon she will be forced to choose between the friend in their world and a friend in hers, all while trying to plan a way to bring the high class to their knees.",
