  "description": "You've seen them. Looking for trouble, and looking irresistible. Boys with an edge so hard it takes a special kind of woman to satisfy them. But some women are made for it... Lora Leigh, the \"New York Times\" bestselling author of \"Nauti Intentions\" and \"Nauti Dreams\" revisits that sultry and \"sinfully good\" (\"Joyfully Reviewed\") Southern landscape with a story of a young woman whose desire for a Boston attorney draws them both into a dangerous undercover investigation, and an adversary as lethal as he is relentless. Jaci Burton, the \"New York Times\" bestselling author of \"Riding on Instinct \"and \"Riding the Night,\" lets loose in a story of a hot biker hired to keep an eye on the reckless daughter of a Nevada senator. She's hooked up with a rival biker gang--a dangerous move that makes the wild beauty more vulnerable than she imagined.",
