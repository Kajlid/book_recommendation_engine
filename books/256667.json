  "description": "Book five of the ONLY HUMAN series…  Abbott agreed to let Kirsten seek revenge on Gavin, and she hopes doing so before she pulls away from the supernatural community will make others hesitant to come after Kirsten or her family.  Before Lauren goes away to college, Kirsten wants to be sure she’s done all she can to prepare her daughter. They take a trip to China, and Kirsten hopes she can get her old teacher to train her daughter. However, when they arrive, things aren’t as they should be.  In China, the Lion Dance and Dragon Dance are ubiquitous, and the Monkey King frequently plays a part in both. Kirsten is friends with the Lion King and Dragon King, and despite the fact this has nothing to do with the legendary Chinese lion or dragon, the implications are far-reaching once she’s back in China.",
