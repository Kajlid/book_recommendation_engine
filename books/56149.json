  "description": "Gwen Branson has a problem. It's not that she's spent the last four years of her life in a mental institute, or that her father is dead and her mother's driving her crazy. Her problem is that she's seen a werewolf and no one believes her. At least...no one human. Eben Lowell has a problem of his own. As an Alpha Were, he must preserve his pack's safety and secrecy. Human witnesses are destroyed. Gwen Branson, however, is a problem not so easily solved. Because Gwen is more than just a human she's his mate.",
