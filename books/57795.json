  "description": "Like a potent mix of Absolutely Fabulous and Sweet Valley High, say hello to Pedigree Girls, North America's next big thing. Privileged since birth and smugly self-satisfied, the Pedigree Girls are the stars of a comic strip written and illustrated by multi-talented Montréal artist Sherwin Tjia. These strips are highly addictive, darkly funny and desperately subversive. Revelling in adolescent dysfunction and sociopathology — from snobbery and sex to fashion and cannibalism — the strips plunge the reader into the daily atrocities that make up the lives of two wicked private school girls. Characterized by a humour that will leave you unsure whether to laugh, cry or call the police, this book lays bare the exploits of the privileged, ambiguous and corruptive Pedigree Girls. A bracing tonic for our status-obsessed and consumer-conscious society, Pedigree Girls redefines the art of satire for the twenty-first century.",
