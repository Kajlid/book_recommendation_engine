  "description": "Country boy Mike is out for a night on the town, blowing off steam like all good hayseeds do in the big city. Except Mike isn't like most country boys, having that whole werewolf thing going for him. Steven seems pretty special when Mike meets him, hot for him, into wild animal sex like he is, but even when Steven gets a little toothy Mike has trouble believing that a vampire would take up with one of his kind. Can they handle the heat they generate, or will their true natures tear them apart?",
