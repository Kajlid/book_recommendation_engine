  "description": "The whole Christian Bible is a hodgepodge of conflicting stories and doctrines that it can spawn up a million and one sects where no two sects can be seen exactly alike. And that is precisely what has happened with our Christianity—the most confusing religion in the world with a thousand and one competing sects, and with a thousand and one more new sects to come. Indeed, the Bible, taken in its entirety, is a veritable corruption of the Word of God. Jesus is the one and only true “LIVING WORD OF GOD”—no other. And only through him can the world be set free—not by any wisdom of any man.All the pure and living truths about Jesus are to be found exclusively in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The Gospel of the four authors can stand alone as the complete “Message of Salvation of God” for the world.Hence, if we want to know about the true “LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS,” meet Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—not in the corrupted version of Paul’s.But if we want to find true “LIFE IN JESUS,” meet Jesus in his Mission. Only by following Jesus in his Mission, can we set the world free and see fullness of life.Amen.",
