  "description": "The stakes are higher ... the risks are steeper ... the chances more fatal.... Rori Maitland has lived her life the way she’s wanted it. After retiring from MI6, she’s her own woman, few friends, no husband and that is the way she bloody well prefers it. After all, her job is hardly normal. Ian Kinncaid, master of disguise, has been estranged from his family for well over a decade. With his deep cover blown, he now needs a safe place to put the little girl he saved from the Prague underground. But the shadows cloak enemies and trust comes at too high a cost. When Rori’s latest mark goes awry and she finds herself helping the intense man--instead of killing him--she’s thrown into a world she'd hoped to leave behind. Now Ian and Rori must work together before someone marks them both for death and kills everyone they both hold dear.",
