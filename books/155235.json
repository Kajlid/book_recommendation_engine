  "title": "Seeing With The Eyes Of The Soul: Revelations From God The Father To a Chosen Soul",
  "description": "The Eternal Father's revelations to Barbara teach us how love and sin can make or break us and how love and sin will now either make or break the world. Seeing with the Eyes of the Soul also teaches us about our present life and eternity and how inevitably both are shaped and determined by the choices we make in our journey back home to The Father. This book is a stairway to that home and is destined to be a classic in Catholic mysticism.",
