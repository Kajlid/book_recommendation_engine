  "description": "Craft beer and the sexy men who brew it.A beautiful neighbor. A complete stranger. That’s all she was when I moved in next door.Adelyn Maxwell is my neighbor but she’s no girl next door. The more I come to know her, the more I discover she’s a good girl with a lovely dark side. And maybe I don’t want her to stay on her side of the fence.I want to disturb the rhythm of her pulse.I want to see the way her hair spills on the bed when she lies beneath me.I want her to teach me the dirty pretty things she desires behind closed doors. And she does.But mostly I want to leave my mark on the most intimate, untouched part of her body. Her heart.A seemingly insignificant intersection of our lives neither of us recalls suddenly becomes a pivotal moment in our future. We aren’t strangers at all. And our paths aren’t crossing for the first time.These twists and turns of fate will become one of two things: a wrecking ball to tear us apart or the connection to bond us together forever.",
