  "title": "Fake Atheism: The Suppression of the Truth and the Atheist Syndrome",
  "description": "Aggressive atheism is attempting to make an impact in the West, and its opponent is God. Yet, a person who claims to be an atheist is suppressing the truth in unrighteousness (Romans 1:18). God’s word also reveals, “What can be known about God is plain to them” (Romans 1:19). Consequently, whenever nonbelievers try to deny God’s existence, the God who made them reveals that they actually know He exists. The fact that people know these things doesn’t mean that they will quickly acknowledge that truth. It usually takes ten minutes or more to have an atheist admit that he is really just an agnostic. Additionally, it is sometimes difficult to convince an agnostic or a hardened atheist that they know God exists—which is a truth that can help set them free. The inclination to suppress the truth in unrighteousness is to be taken very seriously. Some atheists will get very angry when you call their bluff, and some will fight to the bitter end to hold onto that which they know is false. Refuting the likes of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Lawrence Krauss straight on, Mike Robinson reveals the fallacies in their approach, arguing that their irrational and emotional methodology reveals their foolishness and self-deception. Scholarly and wide-ranging, ‘Fake Atheism’ packs some devastating blows as it knocks atheism out of the ring. Atheists really do know God exists, they just don’t like Him! Discover how to debunk the new atheists and expose their self-deception.",
