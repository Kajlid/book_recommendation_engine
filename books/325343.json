The single mom is sexy as hell, and her little daughter Mia only adds to his delight. He knows Natalie is wary of a relationship of any kind...what will she think when she discovers he's an Immortal? His best course of action is to woo her the old-fashioned way.But the course of true love never did run smooth--especially for a vampire and a mortal. And when danger stalks Natalie, Valerian realizes he's playing a game of life and death and if he loses this round, he risks losing her forever.",
