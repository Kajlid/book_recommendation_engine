  "title": "The Trinity River Watershed",
  "description": "The Trinity River Watershed is a fictional collection of short stories about experiences and people who live in this part of Texas. It is a visual representation of various things American - a rhythm unmistakably pulsing through various folk inhabiting this part of the world, but many themes are universal to humanity. A strong aesthetic voice found in each of the fictional accounts in this collection offers the strengths, limitations, dreams and shortcomings of people in genuine exposition - geometric and bold. See who you can recognize in your life from these tales. It is hoped that through these stories, one can sense the heartbeat of generosity, the hollow gnawing of prejudice, the genuine sincerity of low-literate people whose honesty betrays their motives and intents, the foibles and anxieties of society and the mannerisms that betray someone who is called a Texan, an honest reflection of the education, arts, culture and society of that which is American, Texan and specifically North Texan.",
