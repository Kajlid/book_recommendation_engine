  "description": "Capital City is a tough-as-titanium riotous town, but it wasn't always that way. Only a month ago, it was a placid place to live. In this quirky dark fantasy novella, Charlie Landers must navigate a dangerous world of black magic in order to save his little corner of the universe. Somewhat silly, and crap-your-pants scary in places.",
