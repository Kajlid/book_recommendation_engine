  "description": "Rio A Story of the Arizona Rangers Â by J. Reeder ArchuletaArizona in the early twentieth century had more than its share of violent and lawless men who wreaked havoc as they roamed the Arizona Territory. The Arizona Rangers, a small company of tough men, were formed to deal with this criminal element. In a modern age, Rangers fought the outlaws with old-fashioned methods. On horseback with lever-action Winchesters and single-action Colts, they rode after the outlaws through the vast deserts and high mountains of Arizona Territory.When he learns that a rancher's wife and daughter are kidnapped and taken to Mexico, Captain Wheeler, the Ranger commander, sends one of his best men to work with Colonel Kosterlitsky and the Mexican Rurales. Although their approach to enforcing the law is different and sometimes at odds, these men must work together in their common mission of tracking down the gang of cutthroats.The author, J. Reeder Archuleta, was raised on the Mexican border and his roots are four generations deep in the region. He has great admiration and respect for those hardy folks who, in the face of great adversity, settled and thrived in the great Southwest. The many stories he listened to while growing up, some true, some not, served as the inspiration for Rio Sonora.",
