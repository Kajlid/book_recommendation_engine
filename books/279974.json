  "description": "Eddie Boone is being chased by the most terrifying creatures he’s ever seen in his life and he has no idea why. He thinks it has something to do with that he saw at the Italian restaurant he works at. He saw something he shouldn’t have and now the men who work for Louis DuCane are after him. After a particularly hair-raising encounter with these vampiric beasts Eddie learns that it isn’t Coven DuCane that wants him dead, it’s something far more mysterious and Coven DuCane are the only ones who can keep him alive. When he starts to fall for his protector, Robert Alden, Eddie brushes it off. But soon he can’t deny the feelings he has for the tall, dark, and muscular vampire. The big question on Eddie’s mind is, will he live long enough to see if Robert feels the same?  Robert Alden has worked for Coven DuCane for about a century and in that time he’s seen a lot of things, but nothing compares to the creatures known as The Caen. When posted to keep watch on a local, Eddie Boone, who has complained to the sheriff about vampire trouble, he has no idea the kind of creatures he will come face to face with. Most surprising of all? The little human facing down the legion of beasts is his fate-destined Beloved. It’s a race against time to figure out why these creatures want Eddie dead and who is pulling the strings. The biggest question of all may be, how is Eddie not dead already?  Master Louis DuCane said the old ways were back, now old enemies have returned as well.",
