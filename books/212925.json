  "title": "The Longest Journey",
  "description": "E. M. Forster once described The Longest Journey as the book \"I am most glad to have written.\" An introspective novel of manners at once comic and tragic, it tells of a sensitive and intelligent young man with an intense imagination and a certain amount of literary talent. He sets out full of hope to become a writer, but gives up his aspirations for those of the conventional world, gradually sinking into a life of petty conformity and bitter disappointments.",
