  "title": "Over in the Meadow",
  "description": "\"Over in the meadow in the sands in the sun ...\" begins John Langstaff's endearing version of an old counting song for children, a favorite for many generations. But never has it been presented in such gay and happy form. Feodor Rojankovsky's pictures are filled with the beauty of meadow life from morning till the end of day, and the amusing verses and simple melody will give pleasure to children and grownups whenever they gather to sing. \"Over in the Meadow\" is the creation of two very gifted artists, whose previous book, \"Frog Went A-Courtin',\" was awarded the Caldecott Medal.",
