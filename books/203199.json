  "description": "The law will protect you. Until it doesn't. When Peter Garrison's failed defense of a client leads to a retribution plot against him, he's forced to confront a nemesis intent on destroying him. Jason Felding seeks payback after his teenage brother winds up sodomized and mentally scarred during an unfair incarceration. He targets the restaurant owner who put his sibling behind bars and the lawyer who couldn't get a simple underage drinking case dropped. Obsessed with justice, Jason murders the snitch and, in an elaborate ruse, frames Peter as the killer. Peter finds himself the prime suspect in a murder that rocks the small town of Quincy, Vermont, a cruel irony since he left his firm frustrated that guilty clients sometimes escape punishment, while innocent ones are convicted. With the help of a crafty private investigator, Peter vows to solve the crime and save his reputation. But as Peter closes in on the truth, both he and his new girlfriend may be next on Jasonâ€™s hit list.From a small Vermont town to the beaches of the Virgin and Cayman Islands, loyalty and retribution are at the heart of this suspenseful thriller.",
