  "description": "They didn’t know each other, but the events of one single day heralded a pivotal change that would alter their lives forever.  Almost two decades spent locked away in a dark, dank cell, Gray Bennet isn’t used to the sun, the sounds, the scents. It’s overwhelming.  Each year Robin Bishop returns, and while everyone around her is solemn, she lifts her face to the sun and celebrates her freedom. It’s liberating.  He sees her. She stands out in the grieving crowd—her head thrown back, her face bright with contentment—like a beacon offering to guide him into the light.",
