  "description": "Jake and Ash fell in love one wild summer in New York City. To escape the censure of the world, they retreated to the Cascade Mountains where they are free to love each other as they choose. With the death of her beloved father, schoolteacher Evelyn Lockhartâ€™s life has become a solitary grind. Poor and alone, she has no real home. On her way to yet another post, a terrible accident leaves her injured and stranded. Rescued by Jake and Ash, Evie finds she is trapped by a blizzard. She is horrified, knowing her reputation will be ruined beyond repair. When Jake suggests marriage to one of them as the solution to her dilemma, she is dismayed to find she is drawn to both men, and cannot choose between them. Jake and Ash want Evie to be with them, but they fear she will think their love sinful. They conceal it from her, knowing they have all winter to convince her that she belongs with them before they have to confess the truth. But will Evie accept their true relationship, or will she consider that they have betrayed her trust?",
