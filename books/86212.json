But in a twist of Dragon's Luck, Saeb has to wait for Maeya...Maeya Daceae watched Spike Cave-and her Dragon egg-go up in the blue fire of a Wyzard attack. So when she is offered another chance to be a Rider, she takes it, even though both she and her new Dragon are dubious about the outcome.

Along the way, they meet the gifted twins Darvo and Daegny, a Tare who has suffered many losses, and a shadow named Eirenya who brings an unusual friend. Things are changing too fast; their world is teetering. They must all learn to work together to overcome hardships, because only together will they successfully find the Dragon of Prophecy, and their own destiny. Dragon's Lore introduces the second Rider and Dragon pair who will be vital in the looming confrontation with the Wyzards. Meet the first pair, Saeb and Galanth, in Dragon's Luck.
