  "description": "They may have accidentally said, “I do,”But soon, they won’t be able to say goodbye.Daniella. Goodness! The one time I participated, I ended up married. Nope, count me out in the future—no more risk-taking for me. My coworker and I were supposed to be a pretend bride and groom as fill-ins at the wedding rehearsal yesterday. Little did I know that Oliver and I were legally married. After finding out about our marital status, he begs me to attend a wedding for his ex-girlfriend and ex-best friend, selling it to me as a free vacation. Now, I’m going to the Washington coast with my faux-real husband, donning his grandmother’s gorgeous ruby wedding ring, pretending to be madly in love with him. In a week, we’ll get an annulment, and this whole mess will be behind us without anyone else knowing about our little faux pas. I just have to survive goat yoga, a bear, and my new mother-in-law. Hopefully, this accidental marriage won’t be more work than a real one.Oliver. What happens when you accidentally marry a coworker? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine. I just hope we survive the week. Hopefully, Daniella is made of stern stuff, because she comes off as painfully shy and a complete introvert. With Daniella acting as my wife, I can use her as a shield. I’ll do my best to protect her, but I might be the one who needs protection when it comes to my mother. We may have worked together for a year, but I feel like I barely know her. We’ll make this a memorable vacation, and the annulment will be taken care of next week. All I have to do is show her a good time. What could possibly go wrong?",
