  "description": "Solving crimes with science is fascinating -- until a pretend mystery becomes all too real! Nancy gets Bess, George, and Ned to help out with a special program for high school students, a \"chemystery\" camp. They'll visit a forensics lab, a drug company, and a university to see how science is used to solve crimes. Then they'll use what they've learned to work on a made-up case. But the mystery begins even before the program starts when the professor who runs it suddenly falls into a coma. Now Nancy's in charge -- of the made-up case and the real one. Strange encounters of the dangerous kind and a list of promising suspects test all her talents of deduction. From the tiniest clue on a carpet to real menace in a quarry, Nancy's crime lab is bubbling with trouble!",
