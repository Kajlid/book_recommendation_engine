In fact, he's the worst kind of man for a woman like her. Too bad she can't seem to get enough.Bronx Harris doesn't know what to think of the curvy strawberry blonde but he does know that she's pretty sexy and he's down with recuperating with her as his personal nurse while he lays low. But all too soon, Bronx finds himself feeling more than he should - more than what's safe - for the curvy, innocent woman and he knows he ought to walk away. But Delainey is like a drug in his system and before long, walking away feels like the last thing he wants to do...even though he knows he'll never be the man she needs him to be.Can their love survive the collateral damage of two worlds colliding? Find out in the thrilling sequel to Alexx Andria's Kings of Asphalt, Club Chrome series",
