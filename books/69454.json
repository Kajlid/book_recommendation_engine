  "description": "Controversial and headline-inducing, Marvel's \"Heroes Reborn\" project of 1996 was a one-of-a-kind event. Superstar artists like Jim Lee were commissioned to produce year long series featuring the company's greatest characters, retelling their origins and classic early stories with more modern, contemporary sensibilities. Old-time fans cried foul, but their disagreement quickly turned to intrest, as sales on these titles skyrocketed, boosted by curiosity about how these classic stories would be retold.Chief among the titles in the \"Heroes Reborn\" series was Jim Lee's take on the Fantastic Four. Combining his technologically-inclined artwork with his decidedly '90s storytelling, Lee reinvisioned the story of four space travellers, transformed by a cosmic accident into four of the world's greatest adventurerers. Mister Fantastic, the Thing, the invisible Girl and the Human Torch are all here, as are arch-enemies the Mole Man and Dr. Doom, as their original tales are reworked, reinterpreted, reborn.",
