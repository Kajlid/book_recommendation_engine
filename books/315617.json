  "description": "Sadie carries herself with an air of elegance and grace. It was practiced though, curated by it’s very nature. She appears so far removed from his world that it is almost laughable trying to place her in it. But when she meets Cole and runs her manicured fingers across his club tattoo, she knows that things are about to change. But is she willing to dive back into the belly of the underworld for him? And, does he even want her to? “Gone was the shy, uncertain girl putting up a front of elegance and sophistication. Here, beneath Cole, I was wild - released from my own inhibitions.” Sadie is a woman running from a complicated past, and Cole is everything that her past represents. The one thing about Cole though? Once he decides that he wants something, he is lethal in its pursuit",
