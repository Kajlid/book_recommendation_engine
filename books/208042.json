  "description": "To the First Harvest fair Niamh goes, for revelry with others of the island. The Fianna go, too: the finest of the king's young warriors. Of them, Bryan catches Niamh's eye. He is strong of body and fair of face, and he wants her for his \"Lughnasa Sister\"â€”his lover for fourteen nights. But what good is a fortnight, for when it ends she will have nothing. No; no matter how mighty Bryan is nor how tempting his kiss, she will give her heart only to one who wants more. To Bryan she offers an ultimatum: \"There are three things that women want, and it will be your task to learn them if you want to win me.\" Bryan never turns down a challenge.",
