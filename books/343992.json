  "title": "Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions",
  "description": "Why do our headaches persist after we take a one-cent aspirin but disappear when we take a fifty-cent aspirin?   Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup?   When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we?   In this newly revised and expanded edition of the groundbreaking New York Times bestseller, Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, we consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictableâ€”making us predictably irrational.",
