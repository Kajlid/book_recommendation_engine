  "description": "Warmhearted, insightful, funny and poignant, bestselling author, Maddie Dawson, takes the unfathomable ways of love and family, and celebrates [the joys of] the ordinary craziness of being human.  Devoted, creative single-mom Jamie McClintock’s world is thrown into chaos by the sudden death of Harris, her vibrant, elderly landlord. Not only does she mourn him terribly, but she has to face the unkind gossip about their unorthodox living arrangement (free board in exchange for watching adorable grandson Christopher, her own son’s best friend) and assume full responsibility for grieving Christopher, who was left in Harris’ care by his estranged, highly successful son, Nate.  Then Nate returns to claim his son… and that’s when life really gets chaotic... ***This title was originally published under the author's pen name, Sandi Kahn Shelton.***",
