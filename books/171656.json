  "description": "Twenty-one-year-old college student, Adriana doesn't really know what to make of Raptor, the sexy biker who seems to be obsessed with getting into her pants. Hot or not, she knows from their first encounter that he's dangerous, both in an out of bed. What Raptor wants, Raptor gets. Right now, he wants Adriana and will do whatever it takes to claim her as his woman. But, she keeps resisting, which isn't something that the Road Captain of the Gold Vipers is used to. Arrogant, cocky, and stubborn, Raptor takes on the challenge and in the meantime, gets much more than what he'd bargained for. A contemporary erotic romance. For readers 18 and older. Graphic Themes, Language, Violence.",
