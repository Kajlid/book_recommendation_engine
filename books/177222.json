  "description": "Kara Chambers plays by her own rules, she has since she graduated high school. Knowing from experience that her body wasn’t one that guys wanted to keep around, she’d drop them before they could drop her. One night, that’s all she ever gives. One night and she’d be able to get the sexiness, known as Sly Webb out of her system. No complications, no awkwardness, just one night. Yeah, right. Sylvester “Sly” Webb is living his dream, working full time at the gym for his surrogate father and now, a big MMA league wants to sign contracts with them. What else does he need? His best friend, Lox, is newly engaged to a great girl, but that commitment shit has never been for him. He’s always believed in the “hit it and quit it” system. He doesn’t need a full time woman messing up his plans. He damn sure doesn’t want someone like his mother, who never let him or his twin brother slow down her drunken social life. Until meeting Kara for the first time, she threw him for a loop. All of that voluptuous sassiness made his head swim. Then she came to his fight and followed him home, but what happened next was something he thinks he’ll never understand. Now, he can’t get her out of his head. In his eyes she’s perfect, but how can he prove that to her? This book is part of a series, but can be read as a standalone.",
