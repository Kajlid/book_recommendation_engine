  "description": "\"Wake up, Lorelei . . .\"  Icy words, whispered upon her lips in the night, used to scare Lorelei Huntington. But that was before. Before her mother tried to have her killed, before her world went back 50 years, before the magic of the swap found its way into Lorelei's blood. Now she finds the whispers and the cold breath of the dead a comfort. That is until she is warned, by a vaguely familiar ghost, about the secrets of the blood thirsty family she resides with. Whit's family, it seems, are not all they appear to be. Just like Lorelei's mother is not the only ghost haunting her. When Lorelei discovers the Midnight Coven, she is forced to choose between love and survival. But survival comes at a cost, one she isn't sure she is willing to pay.  Don't miss this sexy paranormal romance!",
