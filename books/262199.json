The pressure of meeting Landon’s entire family is building, added to by the fact they’re still hung up on Landon’s ex boyfriend. He’s all broad shoulders and tanned Australian muscle, with seemingly zero respect for Archie and Landon’s relationship.Plus he can give Landon the one thing Archie isn’t sure he’s comfortable with. Because being in a relationship, will eventually lead to more than just kissing. And in real life, that might be more than he signed up for.",
