  "title": "The German Empire: A Short History",
  "description": "In a remarkably vibrant narrative, Michael Stürmer blends high politics, social history, portraiture, and an unparalleled command of military and economic developments to tell the story of Germany’s breakneck rise from new nation to Continental superpower. It begins with the German military’s greatest triumph, the Franco-Prussian War, and then tracks the forces of unification, industrialization, colonization, and militarization as they combined to propel Germany to become the force that fatally destabilized Europe’s balance of power. Without The German Empire ’s masterly rendering of this story, a full understanding of the roots of World War I and World War II is impossible.",
