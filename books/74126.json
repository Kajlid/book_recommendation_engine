  "description": "When poet Orien Sage overhears of a tragedy, involving the destruction of a historical monument, he is prompted to get out his old radio to tune into the news programs. He learns of a late youth in his village that has poisoned herself and speculations of bullying being a factor in her death. Orien also finds his appreciation for music rekindled, unfortunately he fails to learn to play harp and to win the heart of singer Holli Belle. Orien, being a social outcast and attempting to overcome his situation, he joins a webgroup using the technologistâ€™s latest invention of the cyber-box networking device, but network associations are risky as an underground cult is recruiting members and Orien finds himself concerned about a disturbed late youth poet whom he met at a party and who may have ties to the bullying case.",
