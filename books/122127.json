  "description": "When Harper's father invites her to his new cabin for a weekend, Harper has a bad feeling deep in her gut about it. She isn't interested in meeting his new sweetie, Peggy. But, knowing she needs to take some time away from the chairs and sort her life out, she reluctantly agrees to go. As soon as she arrives, she is certain something is terribly wrong. Her father is not there to greet her, which is highly unusual for him. And, from naked meditation to invisible cats, Peggy’s eccentricities grow more unnerving by the moment. So, when an unexpected storm traps them together, Harper fears the little old lady with whom she’s sharing a cabin isn’t quite as sweet as she seems—especially once she learns about all the dead husbands Peggy’s left in her wake. With no phone and no survival skills to speak of, Harper finds herself going back to the one thing she knows she can depend on, the one thing she feels certain can save the chairs.",
