  "description": "Kaci agreed to the most important question of her life. And then she had her fiancé taken hostage.  He played her game and trained for battle. And now he is completely unprepared to lose.  Loving her once, Sal fell for her eccentric, wild pixie. She used her abilities—aiming her target to get revenge—but Kaci stumbled into a dangerous love, putting Sal through a gut-wrenching hell.  Can Sal ever forgive her sins of the past?  With the questions on the table, one inescapable truth looms before their relationship. His calculating mind and intimidating body built for the greater good, leaving Sal changed. No longer the curious submissive boy of the past, his new outlook is one of defiance, kink, and control.  Will Kaci embrace the changes – or – is the end closer than she ever imagined?  There is nothing he can do— No praying on his knees for forgiveness No bargaining with the devil to save their relationship In this heartbreaking battle, Sal will lose.  In the fourth and final book of The Story of Salvatore, Sal Raniero begs to reverse the clock as reality leaks into his perfect bubble. With his love of the fetish world shoved to the backburner, he learns not only the meaning of love, but how precious time is.  The war begins when Sal rages into Sugargrove— Nothing safe from his wrath Nothing sacred in his path …including the Hope he longed to keep.",
