Now Suki is plunged into a fight for her daughter's life as well as a struggle over what is--and isn't--possible.This story of a mother-daughter relationship caught in the crossfire of modern life, kids with too much knowledge of the world, and adults with too little, is a vision of all that is possible if we are willing to take off our blinders.",
