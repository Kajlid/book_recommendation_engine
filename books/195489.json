  "description": "Her Serene Highness Pommelina Alix Louise Canella of Monaco has lived her life as the “ugly duckling” of her glamorous family. But graduate school has kept her too busy to pine for a relationship, and being ignored by the media allows her to devote time to humanitarian projects without interference. Prima donna Formula One racer Thalia d’Angelis knows she’s been hired as a publicity stunt, but that only fuels her desire to be the first woman on an F1 podium. She might be on the verge of making history, but her behavior off the track is as risky as her driving.The approaching Monaco Grand Prix—the crown jewel of the Formula One circuit—brings them together, but will these opposite and headstrong stars collide, or are they destined to cross?",
