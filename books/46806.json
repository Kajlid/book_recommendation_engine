  "description": "Part 3 of the trilogy is titled \"The Queen.\" Discover the dreams, the magic, the quest. Kids of all ages will love this inspirational epic fantasy adventure, suitable for the entire family. The three parts of Maycly found in the paperback are sold separately as Ebooks. Part 3 brings a much needed break from the heavy hitting action. It starts off with a light hearted chapter telling us about Iona's childhood, then leading us to \"real time\" on both Earth and Maycly. There are several twists, turns, and surprises that keep you turning the pages. If you've had questions about things in the past two Parts, rest assured they are answered in Part 3. Another epic battle is fought; new creatures are introduced, and the terror - passion - and determination provide an adrenaline high. Still more illustrations are seen for the first time, helping readers understand what the characters are dealing with. But by no means think to yourself you have it figured out, as the ending will drop your jaw and leave you wanting to know what happens next, in more ways than one.",
