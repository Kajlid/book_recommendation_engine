She possesses only one gift of witchcraft -- the power to fly. Like all young witches, she sets out at age 12 to find a town of her own. With her ever-present companion Jiji -- a cynical and faithful black cat -- Kiki departs on her broomstick and arrives at a big town near the ocean. Though nervous at first, she soon sets up a business delivering packages.Kiki meets all kinds of people and has many adventures. She befriends the thief who stole her broomstick and saves the town's traditional New Year's marathon with some courageous and timely flying.Throughout, Kiki's confidence and self-awareness grows as she learns to value her unique talents. And with Kiki's help, the townspeople realize that everyone has some \"magic\" that gives them their own special character and vitality.This is a charming and delightful tale that is reminiscent of children's favorites \"The Worst Witch\" by Jill Murphy and Astrid Lindgren's \"Adventures of Pippi Longstocking.\" Black and white line drawings sprinkled throughout reveal the humor and warmth in everything Kiki does.",
