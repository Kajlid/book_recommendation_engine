  "description": "Ducalion finds that the road to Hades is paved with bad intentions when he must venture to the death lands in search of a kidnapped goddess.\"Richard Purtill has done a masterly job of breathing life into what scant detail we have recovered, like the physical restoration which has raised the palace of M'nos up again, and built new walls to rejoin old, so that the modern visitor can imagine what a glorious thing once stood there—a breath and a step removed from gods and demons, where magic lived in the land.\"— C.
