  "description": "Meet Hella Paige. She kills zombies. Well, technically her virus kills zombies, the one that she contracted after being bitten by her undead neighbor. The virus is invaluable, killing everything undead around her. But it is also destructive, unless Hella can escape the truth, she might be doomed to a terrible fate.All Hella wanted to do was graduate from college, but she is thrust into a world she never imagined, one filled with moments of sheer terror and the idea that humanity can be saved by a few. She brings together a tribe of survivors, keeping her virus a secret; instead claiming the village they live in is protected by a mysterious zombie-killing aura. Hella has to sacrifice so much for the people she grows to love, for she canâ€™t leave the village without risking their death.When Hella meets Huck, he captures her heart, but it is his friend Zeke that can help her save humankind. Two heroic men, one she hates and one she loves. Can Hella rise above the chaos of her heart and chose the one to benefit the world? The right choice might mean the difference between surviving and survival of the species.",
