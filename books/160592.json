  "description": "Most sixteen-year olds aren't worried about the fate of their immortal souls. May Krieg should be. Typically, honors student May's biggest problems have revolved around her super-hot arch-rival, Jack. But when a school project takes them ghost-hunting in a local cemetery, she discovers that an ominous force roams in the darkness around her. And it follows her home. It claws its way into her life, burning messages into her wall and imprinting them onto her body.Even worse, she can't tell if it's trying to possess her... or protect her. May's thoughts soon become actions, causing the target of her anger severe physical pain and giving her a rush the likes of which she has never experienced. She quickly realizes that she needs to find a way to reign in this power before she kills someone. May hates the pleasure it gives her, hates herself for hurting others, but she can't stop. As her entire world shatters around her, she is forced to ask what her soul is worth-- and who would she risk losing her soul to save?
