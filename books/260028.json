  "description": "One and done. It was supposed to be one night. I knew his type. You don't fall in love with a man like Reese Summer, but I did. He swept me off my feet, seduced me, refused to take no for an answer. We became a power couple. The syndicated crime reporter. One of the country's top criminal attorneys. The fantasy became happily ever after until the next big trial of the century. Reese is defending a woman accused of killing her father for billions. I'm reporting on the case. And then the world around us explodes. The trial turns to danger right as a secret from Reese's past shocks me. Someone who wants to destroy our happily ever after. Someone wants to end me.CONTINUING CAT AND REESE'S STORY (read the beginning of their story in Dirty Rich One Night Stand)OTHER DIRTY RICH WORLD COUPLES - AVAILABLE NOWDirty Rich One Night Stand (Cat and Reese's story)Dirty Rich Cinderella Story (Cole and Lori's story)Dirty Rich Obsession (Reid and Carrie's story)Dirty Rich Betrayal (Grayson and Mia's story)",
