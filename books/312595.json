  "description": "I used to dream of the day I would be able to carry on my Mama’s legacy. To follow her footsteps and attend her alma mater. I would listen to her for hours during her chemo treatments about all the friends she made and the amazing parties and events she attended. But life had a different path for me. I never thought my soul mate would become my step-brother, or that my sorority sisters would hate me just for being a legacy. What was supposed to be four of the best years of my life turned into lies, betrayal and heartache. My college experience was nothing like I had hoped, but if I could go back and change things, I wouldn't dare. My eyes are open now. I will never be blindsided again. I had made a promise, but some promises are too hard to keep. It's time I take charge of my own life, and live for myself ... but is it too late? Has my life been forever changed? This book is dark college bully romance and contains multiple triggers. This is a reverse harem, why choose MMFMMM romance, which means that Carson will have more than one love interest and her harem will grow throughout the duet. Also that two of the men in her relationship have an already established relationship, before meeting her. This is book 1 in the Forever Changed duet so there will be a cliffhanger—I know I know, I'm sorry, but I promise to have an HEA at the end of the duet! This is a thick 110K word book and has multiple POVS.",
