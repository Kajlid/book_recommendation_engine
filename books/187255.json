  "description": "Would you jump for a second chance at love? Unhappily married, Charlotte fears the man who shares her bed. When a water line bursts in their kitchen, the unimaginable occurs and the one guy who still owns her heart comes flooding back into her life as the Project Manager. It’s not just her home he’ll repair; he’s going to fix his past mistakes. With her. One moment after another, they spend time reminiscing, laughing and fighting their intoxicating chemistry as if thirteen years hadn’t passed between them. But her husband—a wonderful, generous man to the outside world, and the nightmare she’ll never wake from—forbids further contact. He’s worked too hard to mend the original damage, and he’ll fight to the death to stop her. There will be no leaving. There will be no happily ever after. Not with him. Not with anyone. Does she accept where her past choices have brought her, or does she risk her life for a chance at a new beginning?",
