  "description": "KatyBeth Reilly, horse-trainer extraordinaire, is capable, responsible and hard-working -- she hates backing down in a fight. When she meets -- completely by chance -- Hollywood heartthrob, Asher Fitzpatrick, she decides she wants nothing to do with him. He's arrogant, self-assured, and seemingly very assured of her.Asher doesn't like taking no for an answer -- he's determined to get to know Katy -- so he makes a couple of phone calls that set the stage for their second meeting. When Katy comes face to face with Asher again, she knows she's going to need help this time -- not because she feels out-maneuvered, but because for the first time in her life she knows she doesn't want to fight.",
