  "title": "The Puzzle of 911: An investigation into the events of September 11, 2001 and why the pieces don't fit together",
  "description": "The events of September 11, 2001 has changed the world forever. But are we really meant to believe that the world's largest and most powerful government and military bodies on the planet was taken aback by them? And is that same governing body not accountable to provide a factual and logical explanation of what happened? And why has the American tax paying citizen not asked 'If $350 billion a year for a national security infrastructure can not protect its own headquarters (the Pentagon), will more funding really protect the nation?' The global community are not being told the truth about the events that occurred that day. This book opens and explores, using official protocols, what was supposed to happen that day, and what was (perhaps) allowed to happen. Piece by piece is put together that creates a much different picture than given to us from the American Government and media.",
