  "description": "Cleveland, Ohio. 2006.  After a chance encounter, three people soon find out that life can sometimes thrust us into the public eye - even when taking great measures to avoid it.  Cooper Madison was the best pitcher in baseball after being drafted number one overall in 1996 from the small Gulf Coast town of Pass Christian, Mississippi. One year after announcing his sudden and shocking retirement, he finds himself seeking anonymity in Cleveland, Ohio.  Cara Knox is the youngest sibling to three older brothers. After a tragic work accident to her closest relative, she has built up a tough exterior as she begins her final year of college at Cleveland State University.  Jason Knox, Cara's oldest brother, is the lead detective on Cleveland's Edgewater Park Killer case. After months without a suspect, he is feeling the heat from his media-hungry chief.  Serendipity intervenes, and all three learn that perception and reality are paths that rarely ever intersect.",
