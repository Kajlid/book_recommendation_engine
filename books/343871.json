At forty, with those dreams a distant and painful memory, she is Director of Golf at Catawamteak, the grand resort on the coast of Maine. She maintains a clinical distance between herself and the guests…until she meets Gillian Benson.Widowed and left wealthy by a husband “the whole town knew was an abusive, philandering bastard,” Gillian comes to Maine in search of a piece of summer and perhaps a summer of peace. Catawamteak’s acres of oceans and tides of sweet-mown grass open horizons as limitless as her newfound freedom.First Resort explores the bonds of friendship and the growth of affection and love between women.",
