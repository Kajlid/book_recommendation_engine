One day, he gathered together the greatest, wisest minds in all the land — not sorcerers, but scientists — and he bade them fashion him a son. A prince. A perfect prince to embody his father’s legacy.The scientists each brought the prince a beauty, strength, ambition, intellect, pride. But they must have forgotten something because when he saw the mermaids dance at the Cirque de la Mer, he ran away to join them.For a year, he trained them, performed with them, thought he was happy. For a year he thought he was free. But then Nerites A merman who refused to be tamed. A captive from another kingdom. A beast in a glass cage.The old stories always end with happy ever after. But this isn’t one of the old stories. This is a story of princes and monsters.Word 10,200; page 39",
