  "description": "I washed ashore in a little lake town. A place where everyone knows everyone, yet…No one knows me.I don’t know me.If a woman doesn’t know her own name, does she really exist?I don’t know my natural hair color, my birthdate, or where I live.I am invisible.To everyone, to everything, even to myself.Except to him. I see the recognition deep in his stare, the way it lingers on my face as if I’m a puzzle he’s desperate to put together.I just want answers, the truth… knowledge. His lips are sealed. Still, his eyes beguile me.I can’t trust anyone, not even myself. Someone wants me dead, the same someone who tried to bury me in a watery grave. They’ll come for me again… I won’t know their face.I don’t even know mine.I am amnesia.",
