  "description": "A mysterious pocket watch, six mage shifters, and one deceased lover...My name is Crimson Arashi and I'm your typical 22-year-old, finishing my Bachelors of Arts degree. Sadly, my father insists I become a doctor, having supported my attempt as an artist for far too long.In this world full of magic and shifters, it sucks that I am the only child to a powerful Warlock - my father - and a Kitsune shifter - my mother. I'd already disappointed them because I am a human child - neither shifter or mage. Iâ€™d be lucky to light a candle with the snap of my fingers.After one night of drinking, drowning my sorrows of being a disgrace to my family, I crash into a man on the run with six men in pursuit to catch this thief. None of them notice the pocket watch that escapes their grasp, lying on the cold, wet ground. I didn't think opening it would grant me all the power and strength of the previous owner.I also didn't think it would belong to Storm Yuna, the strongest female magician known in our world. Too bad she was murdered, and now, I'd inherited not only her powers but feelings too. Yeah...feelings.It will take all my strength to navigate the Storm of power and feelings swirling inside of me.I just hope I can survive the trials that await me.",
