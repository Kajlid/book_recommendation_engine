  "description": "Amy Yamada is one of the most prominent--and controversial--novelists in Japan today.  She burst onto the scene in 1985 with her short novel \"Bedtime Eyes,\" which for critics embodied the spirit of the 'shinjinru'--i.e. Generation X-- in much the same way that Less Than Zero, Bright Lights, Big City, and Douglas Coupland did in the U.S. Bedtime Eyes is the first English-language publication of three of Yamada's novellas/short novels: \"Bedtime Eyes,\" \"The Piano Player's Fingers\" and \"Jesse.\" While all are centered around the relationship between a Japanese woman and a black American man, each explores love, sex, and the vast gulf between from different and equally revealing viewpoints. Starkly imagined and sharply observed, Bedtime Eyes introduces to the English language some of Yamada's best known and most influential work.",
