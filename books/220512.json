  "description": "Addiction: the state of being enslaved to a habit or practice or to something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming.  Ruby was sin and sex. The ultimate indulgence and worth every penny she cost me. I paid for her body, but didn't know she'd end up embedded in my soul.  Elias was dark and tempting. Unmatched in intensity and passion compared to my other clients. He handed me cash in exchange for my touch, and he dug himself into my heart instead.  Money changes things, firms up the lines of a relationship. But when it becomes an addiction—an all-consuming, life-changing addiction—the lines are completely obliterated.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Addicted is an erotic escort standalone in the bestselling Tempting series. The characters are interconnected with previous books, but it's not necessary to read them before reading Addicted.",
