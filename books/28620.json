  "description": "A TRUE STORY SET ON THE ACTUAL 'MAMMA MIA! ISLAND OF SKOPELOS In November 2006, Linda and Dario gamble everything on their dream-a new life on the tiny Greek island of Skopelos. They've studied Greek, done their research, and have a simple goal: to set up a small natural cosmetics business and live happily ever after. But the Greek Gods have other ideas, and before long the couple find themselves snarled in a web of lies and incompetence, their dream slipping hopelessly out of reach. In Greece, connections are everything. But will the efforts of their friends-the proud and complicated Dr. Yiannis; Takis, the island's chess-playing, motorcycle-riding Adonis; and Iliana, the mayor's gentle daughter-be enough to help them overcome their difficulties before their slim finances run out and they're forced to abandon their dream? Comic and tragic by turns, Aegean Dream is a compelling tale of love, resilience, and the power of friendship. A charming window on the daily life of a Greek island and the spirit of its people, this book also provides hard insights into the broken institutions that would soon shake the entire global economy.- Whatâ€™s it really like to live on a tiny Greek island?- Why is the Greek economy so messed up?- What IS \"The Secret\"?...and what do mysterious skulls, Russian prostitutes, President Bush the elder, and Pierce Brosnan have to do with it all?Dario Ciriello's 'Aegean Dream'. All story. All true.",
