  "title": "The Book of Wealth: Wealth in Relation to Material and Intellectual Progress and Achievement",
  "description": "The Book of Wealth is a much sought-after book written by Hubert Howe Bancroft, the first volume was published in 1896. The book details the wealth of historic figures and dynasties dating from ancient times up to 1896. It was written to be the companion book to The Book of the Fair and took about six years to complete.Four hundred copies total copies were printed. There were 150 copies the first edition (called “Cygne Noir”, or “Black Swan”) and these sold for $2,500 (or about $89,000 in today’s dollars). Each copy of the first edition was signed by Mr. Bancroft. The second edition (called \"Fin de Siècle\", or \"End of Century) consisted of 250 copies and sold for $1,000 (or about $33,000 today). Note that in my research I have also read reports that the second edition consisted of 950 copies, making the total copies in print to be 1000.The books were printed in Chicago and are 17\" x 22\", bound in heavy golden silk, lined with white decorative fabric, and contain about 3,000 images consisting of original watercolors and engravings. The book also contained 100 paintings by popular artist such as Thomas Moran, G. H. McCord, W. Granville Smith, C. Y. Turner, C. A. Vanderhoff, E. Benvenuto. The cover of each section of the first edition displayed an original water-color by a well-known artist. The styling is very similar to The Book of the Fair, you can view The Book of the Fair here.The books are divided into ten volumes (or sections), twenty-nine chapters, and contain a total of 1,000 pages. The book starts by detailing the nations of antiquity, starting with the oldest, and then moving to the next, and the next, until it finishes with the United States.",
