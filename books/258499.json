  "description": "Joshua Smith had no reason to trust the cop who’d saved his life. After all, to the son of a criminal, a rozzer is the enemy. But when ex-Sergeant Ross Munro is hired to discover why Joshua’s bride disappeared, Joshua agrees to help. Guilt-ridden because he’d vowed to protect Matilda, the pregnant girl he was forced to wed, Joshua is driven to help her. Partnering with the Scottish detective might solve one problem…and raise others. Haunted by the memory of a woman he couldn’t save, independent investigator Ross Munro is determined to locate Matilda. Her marriage to Joshua is clearly a sham, but Joshua’s role in her disappearance is less obvious . Worse, muddying it all is Ross’s unexpected attraction to the scowling, growling bruiser. An attraction that Joshua seems game to explore.  On a desperate search for the missing woman, their tenuous bonds of trust are tested when betrayal is unearthed, murder’s afoot, and loyalties are questioned. Unraveling this mystery may unite two men from opposite sides of the law…or drive the cop and the criminal apart.",
