  "title": "The Madness and the Magic",
  "description": "Minerva is a witch on a mission to beat the dreaded menopause disease while teenage daughter Rhiannon faces up to the trials of an unexpected pregnancy. The story undulates between Minerva's ridiculous antics to snare the local guitar-playing vicar (with tarot cards for guidance and brandy for confidence) and Rhiannon's emotional turmoil. A horse-riding accident and many crazy spells later throw mother and daughter into both a tragic and comical cauldron of change. How much difference will it make? And as one thing leads to another and madness threatens to engulf their small world...will magic save the day? Enter the almost familiar world of contemporary magical realism written by an author with first-hand experience of modern witchcraft. This book is alive with laughter, magical possibility and the challenges and realities of life.",
