  "description": "Do you believe in Fairies, Sprites, Elves or Gnomes? Just because we cannot see them doesn't mean they don't exist.... Welcome to The World of Traegonia where mystical things really do happen. Close your eyes hold out your hand and allow the spirit of the Sunbow Prophecy to draw you in to a place you have never been before. Meet a community of unknown beings who are the protectors of the Earth. See how they bring hope to a seemingly hopeless situation, a home to those who are at risk of losing theirs and a voice to creatures who cannot speak for themselves. Watch as three young friends work together to bring about change. No matter how big or how small one is, belief and passion can change the world. Choose to see the beauty in that which is different. Put aside the fear of what you do not understand and you just may find something truly special in the gifts that others hold. What they have to share could just be the thing to change our lives or maybe even our world. Do You Believe?",
