  "title": "Alay-Oop: Life and Love Among the Acrobats, Told Entirely in Pictures",
  "description": ". A story told in pictures: an opera singer weds a female acrobat, makes her leave show business; later, her old partner comes back and convinces her to leave her husband (with her two twin children). In the end, the singer sells fruit on the street, the male acrobat is a steel worker, and the woman and her kids are acrobats. Despite being out-of-print for nearly 85 years, it has been hailed by historians of the graphic novel as being one of the best early examples of the form.",
