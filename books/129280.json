  "description": "This book is to be viewed by persons of age 18+ It is an erotic romance and does include strong sexual scenarios and strong language. Following All-State and All-American statuses, Kade Toney was climbing baseball’s minor-league ladder. Earning a reputation as a free-swinging slugger, he was walloping legendary home runs out of ball parks and in bedrooms across the nation. He was living proof that chicks really do dig the long ball. A knee injury, however, derailed his dream just days before he was set to debut on a major-league stage. Sixteen years, numerous one-nighters, and a wife later, his post-baseball days had been anything but a casual stroll around the bases. Subsequently, his life left him stranded at third, unable score. Frustrated, Kade returned to college and finished his one remaining semester. Then, the financially-strapped school teacher also began spending his summers on freshly-mowed and chalked fields of dreams . . . as an umpire, reliving his glory days on the diamonds in a different role. The only question for the former star-turned-teacher/umpire is, will he ever race the final ninety feet to finish circling the bases and step on home plate? As Kade learns, it’s amazing what true family can do. Warning: Contains one sexy ump piling up the home runs using his bat & balls. Approx: 32,000 words",
