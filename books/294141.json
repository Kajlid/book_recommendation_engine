  "description": "Mav disappeared before I could ever tell him -- about the child I carried. I’ve had years to get over him, and I’ve tried. But the second I see him again my heart lurches -- and it’s like all that time evaporates. I still burn for him, even though I know it’s a bad idea.I try to remind myself about the bad things:his possessiveness, his quick temper, but -- he’s different now. More mature.Protective. Settled.And hiding something...Something bigger than the child we share...Allowing him back into my heart could crush me -- but I’ve never felt saferthan when I’m in his arms. Can I really have the man I love for good? Or will our past mistakes keep us from a happy future?",
