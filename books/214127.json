  "description": "From the Bestselling Author of Seth SpeaksSpeaking exclusively through Jane Roberts, Seth has repeatedly stressed the concept that we create our own reality according to our individual beliefs. But how do our realities merge and combine to form mass reactions such as the overthrow of governments, the birth of a new religion, wars, epidemics, earthquakes, and new periods of art, architecture, and technology?In this pioneering work, Seth explores the connection between personal beliefs and world events. He pinpoints the unconscious — and often negative — beliefs pervading science and religion, medicine and mythology, and offers thought-provoking reflections on Darwinism, Freudianism, religions, cults, and medical beliefs.With fascinating and inspiring implications, Seth asserts that the personal impulses we are often taught to see as dangerous, chaotic, or contradictory, are instead crucial to the best interests of the species and the natural world, for they lead us to live “not only as loving caretakers but as partners with other species.”“ Only people who trust their spontaneous impulses can be consciously wise enough to choose from a myriad of probable futures the most promising events….”  — Jane Roberts, Speaking for Seth",
