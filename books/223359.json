Saved by an allegiance of necromancers, humanity is now subject to their capricious rule. In this dark new world, Isela Vogel dances to bring her clients the power of the gods. When she's hired to help a necromancer track down a killer, she finds her newest patron as compelling as he is infuriating. But what should have been an easy paycheck puts Isela in the crosshairs. Now she must survive a world of ancient grudges and supernatural creatures she never knew existed. And the deepest secrets are the ones closest to her heart.The necromancer Azrael can make the dead walk but Isela's refusal to bow to his will sparks his interest in more than her choreography. Hunting a killer uncovers a conspiracy within the allegiance and Isela is a temptation he can't afford.Reluctant attraction turns to desire, but when keeping Isela alive becomes more than just a means to an end, Azrael knows he's in trouble. And it may cost them more than their lives.",
