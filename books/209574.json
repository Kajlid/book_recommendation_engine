  "description": "Frances Reed has kissed a lot of toads, but has yet to find her prince. Recovering from another disappointing date that not even three margaritas could improve, she consoles herself by shopping at her favorite lingerie shop, Cupid's Closet. Before she can get to the Aphrodite Ultra Sleek push up bras, she trips headfirst into the decorative Aphrodite fountain. Lying in the fountain bleeding, Frances watches the stone deity come to life. Angry, Aphrodite berates her for damaging her shell and for being an unworthy descendant. Wait. What? A descendant of Aphrodite? Later, after her hunky paramedic falls for her best friend, and a spark is ignited between her mom and her doctor, it becomes apparent that people fall in love when in Frances' presence. She's just got two questions-what in the world is a goddess born of the sea doing in Tornado Alley? And why can Frances make love connections for everyone in town but herself? Aphrodite may have given her the gift of matchmaking, but it will take Cupid to teach her how to use it.",
