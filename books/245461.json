Since then, the series has sold over seven million copies in the United States alone. Now, this phenomenally successful series is being translated into a graphic novel format. Eoin Colfer has teamed up with established comic writer Andrew Donkin to adapt the text. For the first time, rabid fans will be able to see what Foaly’s tin hat looks like; discover just how “Beet” Root got his name; and of course, follow their favorite criminal mastermind as he plots and connives in action-packed, full-color panels.",
