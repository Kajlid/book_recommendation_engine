And yet, it calls to me, seducing me, all the while consuming little pieces of my soul. It’s a right bastard like that.I don’t know how much longer I can deny its strength, because in this world strength is safety, and safety is all I can offer those around me. May the gods have mercy on me, because I have it in me to deny the magic that blackens my blood any longer….",
