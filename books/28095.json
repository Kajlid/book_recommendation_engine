  "description": "Besides family fortune and good looks, Lance Vanderholden had it all-a Navy career, a society marriage, and a bad-boy notoriety. But his true desires turned this young man to angry rebellion and his loves into violent insatiable guilt and the guilt into self-inflicted punishment. His descent into dangerous thrills is fast, and no one denies him whatever he desires. Until he meets Robbie Cosling, a young man who has done it all before-and who loves Lance enough to risk everything for him.Gordon Merrick was the author of more than ten novels, including Perfect Freedom and the much-loved Peter and Charlie trilogy- The Lord Won't Mind , One for the Gods , and Forth Into Light -as well as the posthumously published The Good Life . He died in Sri Lanka in 1988.",
