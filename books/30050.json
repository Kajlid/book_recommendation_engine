  "description": "Blush sensuality level: This is a sensual romance (may have explicit love scenes, but not erotic in frequency or type).Do-gooder Maggie Chase throws her thesis out the window when she wakes up in the arms of a hot Scottish knight. When she realizes she's somehow ended up back in time, she embraces the persona of Lady Margaret. But she may be in over her head when she discovers she has to keep the sexy knight alive during a jousting tournament in order to get back to her own time.Sir Finian \"Finn\" McCullough is a gambling man and owes a very large debt to an evil earl who's after his family estate. When the beautiful Maggie arrives in his bed, he can't remember tupping her the night before and thinks she's a spy for one of his neighboring clans. He intends to find her kinsman and return her safely but he can't resist her charms, her smart mouth or her sex appeal. Instead he keeps her close, taking her with him to a jousting tournament-one he has to win lest he lose his castle forever.",
