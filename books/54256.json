  "title": "Runaway Train",
  "description": "A Mallenford Mysteries novel. Luke's new friend, Dylan, is obsessed with ghosts, but particularly with the ghost train that runs through Mallenford. Is the nearby railway tunnel haunted? And what is that voice they can hear in the tunnel itself? Runaway Train helps children think about what happens when you die and examines Revelation 21:3,4. It is particularly suitable for children with little experience or knowledge of Christianity, but can also be enjoyed by church children. Kathy Lee's Mallenford Mysteries series focuses on the residents of Mallenford. The four books in the series can be read in any order and each one features different main characters.",
