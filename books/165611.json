  "description": "After Jim Harrison and Ted Kooser had exchanged letters and poems for years, Kooser was diagnosed with cancer. \"Ted's poetry became overwhelmingly vivid,\" Harrison recalls. \"Then we decided to correspond in short poems, because that was the essence of what we wanted to say to each other.\"\"Braided Creek\" contains over 300 poems exchanged in this longstanding correspondence. Wise, wry, and penetrating, the poems touch upon numerous subjects, from the natural world to the nature of time. Harrison and Kooser decided to remain silent over who wrote which poem, allowing their voices, ideas, and images to swirl and merge into this remarkable suite of lyrics.Each time I go outside the worldis different. This has happened all my life. * The moon put her handover my mouth and told meto shut up and watch. *A nephew rubs the sore feetof his aunt, and the rope that lifts us all toward gracecreaks on the pulley. *Under the storyteller's hatare many heads, all troubled.
