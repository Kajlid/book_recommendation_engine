  "description": "When Cody Johnson first caught sight of structural engineer Abra Wilson, he thought of endless possibilities. She had style and confidence--and was distracting as hell. She'd called his design an impractical piece of fancy, but then he'd always preferred frankness to subtleties.Abra had met men like Cody before. They usually thought they could smile their way out of trouble, and this overconfident East Coast architect was no exception. She'd told him to back off, but he wasn't listening.Sparks ignited in the desert building site, and then passion soon followed. But was it enough to stop someone from trying to destroy their first project together? Would they be able to find out who it is before any more damage is done?",
