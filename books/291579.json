  "description": "Redemption of the small town mean girl romance\nFelicityThe day I left that small town behind, I swore I’d never be back. I was better than Lexington and its small-minded residents. No one bothered to look beyond the mask I wore to protect my heart. Then or now.Sometimes life doesn’t turn out the way we plan. Having kids was the best thing that I ever did. Returning to the one place I’m least welcome might be the most humiliating. The one thing about this town is a reputation follows you. So despite life humbling me, this town won’t forgive easily, and my past bad deeds still haunt me. ConnorRunning from one war to another in the military, I spent years trying to find what was meant for me, to figure out where I belonged. It wasn’t in the city where I grew up or overseas. My soul needed settling and Lexington seemed like a good place to be alone.Then I met her. She owned my attention from the moment I saw her, my heart right after. Through the grapevine, I learned Felicity had a past worth gossiping about. So do I. Maybe that’s why I’m drawn to her. I moved here for a fresh start, a second chance to live a peaceful life, but she has me reevaluating that plan. Maybe it’s not peace I need but love that I’ve been missing all along.",
