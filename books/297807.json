  "description": "Frank Clayton’s life has fallen apart in the wake of his son’s death. His wife has left him, he has been blacklisted from employment and his citizen-consumer status had been taken away, leaving him no choice but to enlist in a murderous reality show. When an opportunity comes up to escape his predicament, he finds out that he still has something to live for: revenge.Armed with wealth and influence, Frank decides to bring the war to the studio, the powerful corporations and the society that has forced him to make an impossible choice. But hidden interests are manipulating him, trying to turn him into a pawn of the very forces he’s fighting against. The world he moves in now is every bit as lethal as the trenches and machine guns of the kill zone.",
