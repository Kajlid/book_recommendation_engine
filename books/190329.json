  "description": "It's been asleep for centuries, and now it's awake. It wants things ... and you have to give it what it wants ... Seven hundred years ago the Anasazi people built massive cities in what is now the Southwestern United States ... and then they vanished. Stella, an archeologist specializing in Anasazi culture, and David, a mysterious Navajo boy, are on the run from something terrifying. As they flee up into the snowy mountains of Colorado, they are carjacked by criminals. Caught in a blizzard, they must take refuge in what they believe is an abandoned cabin. It's there that they will face horrors beyond their imagination.",
