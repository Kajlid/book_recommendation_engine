Only a handful of survivors remained, all isolated.This is the story of Matt, one of those survivors. He goes from working at an unimportant job in some office to being the last caretaker of civilization. He ensures his own survival by getting the pumps working at a local gas station, and putting in enough supplies to survive his first winter alone.But he also longs to connect with the other survivors that he knows must exist. With his knowledge of radio, he is able to get an AM radio station on the air, which is eventually heard by other survivors. Eventually, he hears some fleeting signals on the CB radio that ensures that someone else is out there. Through his tenacity, and through coaching the other survivors how to respond, he is able to eventually make radio contact with them, and then eventually arrange a rendezvous.In the process, he also meets Amanda, the love of his life. After meeting, they realize that they were destined to meet, disaster or no disaster. Matt and Amanda team up with another couple to begin the task of rebuilding civilization.  Caretaker is currently in the process of being expanded and re-edited.  The updated version will be available within a few days.",
