  "description": "He’ll break all the rules to keep the last promise to his best friend. Commander Ryan Tyler is a true American hero—a former Navy SEAL and the man who saved the International Space Station. Yet he couldn’t save the best friend who died in his place. Fallout from that tragic accident thrust Ty into a dark and dangerous lifestyle, but when he’s given the unexpected chance to fly again, he grabs it. Gray Barrett never imagined that her dream job as a flight psychologist would depend upon keeping an astronaut-gone-wild on the straight and narrow. Yet here she is, babysitting the gorgeous and insufferably cocky Ryan Tyler. Everything hangs on his ability to maintain a new image for the public eye to make up for past sins. But as they spend time together, she’s drawn to the shattered man who refuses to let anyone through the impenetrable façade he’s built around himself. Their goals are firmly in place and almost within grasp. The only thing that could screw it up is falling in love.",
