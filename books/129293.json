  "description": "Peter and Lucien are back in this third book in the Soul Mates series!Following Bound by Blood and Deceptions, Soul Mates: Sacrifice, picks up after a vicious attack on Peter's new paranormal family. Peter may have rescued Lucien but their problems are far from over. A vampire who was once a friend, is chained in the dungeon and waiting judgment. Peter's time is running out. His body is dying; he's no longer human, but not a vampire or Lycan either. He needs Lucien to make him a vampire, but no one knows what he might become if Lucien goes ahead with the change—or whether he will survive it at all. With his control slipping, even as a human, Peter needs Lucien to help him control his instincts, to keep him from hurting the people he loves the most. As enemies gather and allies appear in the strangest of forms, Peter has to make choices that may affect not just his life with Lucien, but also the lives of those who look up to them both for leadership—their Coven. Unrest among the werewolves, friends' betrayals, and broken emotional connections conspire to keep Peter off balance and have him looking to Lucien, as well as within himself, for answers. Answers that could cost him everything, including his life. Good thing Peter thinks some things are worth making sacrifices for.",
