  "description": "ARMED WITH MADNESS introduces a group of youthful but disillusioned characters who live a bohemian existence on a strange quest when an ancient chalice is found at the bottom of a well. A startling novel, ARMED WITH MADNESS introduces Scylla Tavemer, her lover Picus, her brother Felix, and their closely-knit circle of friends, all in the vigour of youth and overflowing with passionate intensity. The discovery of the chalice ignites a fury of conflicting emotion, and propels them on an adventure of mythic proportion -- a virtual re-enactment of the Grail Quest.",
