  "description": "An idealistic, young greenie... A cynical tycoon... A rugged Mediterranean mountain range... When Chloe Harris begins her environmental protest against Zac-Cycorp’s scheme to exploit her island’s pristine paradise, she never imagines she’ll lose her heart to the wolf himself. The moment she sets eyes on the new ‘lapdog’ sent to deal with her, she knows she’s in trouble. Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome makes her pulse race and her legs weak. Will she be able to keep protecting this unspoiled land? Aggravated by the bad publicity that could cost millions, Zac-Cycorp giant, Nicholas Alexander Zachariah, is determined to deal with the pesky ecologist himself. Every woman has a price. He simply has to find the fanatic Greenie’s and be done with it. When she mistakes him for an employee, his task is made easier. If he has to charm her, he will. There's only one hitch. Will this clash end with his own heart intact?",
