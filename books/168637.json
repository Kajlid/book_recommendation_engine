  "description": "Hailey - She has been put down by men all her life for her round and beautiful curves until she is ready to just give it up. She works at a solitary job and has a few good friends. Who needs more than that? Okay, maybe some good, sweaty sex wouldn't be too bad. Suddenly her life takes a weird turn. An average day of going to work finds her kidnapped and in a cage on an alien ship and no clue, how she got there. She knows there are no Knights in Shining Armor to ride to the rescue and so works on getting herself free, until a delicious, giant, red alien God is brought into captivity with her.  Jarrek - He wants to exterminate all Krakill. That is all that he has dedicated the last thousand years of his life to. While he prays to the Goddess of All Life for a species to help keep them alive, he has resigned himself to never finding his Cordisa until he joins the Goddess in death. He finds himself a captive in enemy hands, but that is not all that he has found. A living, breathing Goddess.  The Goddess of All Life has heard his prayers and has guided the future King of Athria to his destiny...if he can win her heart and convince her that he is her Knight in Shining Alien.",
