  "title": "Tennessee Moonlight",
  "description": "Ann Mason is a gumboot-shod, overall-wearing, shotgun-toting Tennessee woman who became strong and self reliant after surviving an abusive father and a brutal husband. Jackson Barrister, a spoiled Midwestern playboy, is banished to Tennessee to learn the family business from the ground up, and hopefully mature into manhood. They meet in a clash over Barrister's plans to build a resort on property bordering Ann'sâ€”and sparks fly. Soon Jack is neck deep in the mystery surrounding Red Mason's death five years before. Given the helpfulness of an old black man named Haber Judd, a huge, ferocious dog named Peanut, and Ann's lifelong distrust of men, what are the chances love will bloom in the \"Tennessee Moonlight?\"",
