  "description": "This is how an empire falls... The year is 2041 and the newly appointed Governor of New Zealand, Emma Calloway, has been backed into a corner. She needs to subjugate the Resistors in her invaded homeland before the core of the Australian Empire decides its not worth the effort to keep and nuke it off the map, population and all. She may a brilliant soldier and tactician, sure, but she's no administrator. Unfortunately, those are the skills she needs as she is besieged on all sides: from an uncle who doesn't realise she can look after herself to an old school-enemy turned reporter digging where she shouldn't and a brother who doesn't realise who his family is and which side they're on. And those are just the threats to her personally. Twenty years after she supported the Resistors against the Empire that now has her complete loyalty, its only a matter of time before people start asking uncomfortable questions. Well may she say that she has nothing to hide, but Emma would still rather not answer the question: just what happened to her and her father, Prime Minister John Calloway, during the final day of the Invasion?",
