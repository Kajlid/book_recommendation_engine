  "description": "Callum hasn’t time to take on a new sub for training. He has his BDSM club, Pure, to remodel and open on Friday. He certainly doesn’t have the time to train Lee in all the nuances of submission, even if Lee seems to be a natural.  But someone else wants him. Another Master who has no limits and doesn’t believe in safe words.  If Callum doesn’t wake up and accept the gift of Lee’s submission, someone else will take it – forcefully.",
