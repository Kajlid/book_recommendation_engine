  "title": "The Unruly Queen: The Life of Queen Caroline",
  "description": "\"There are two types of British queens,\" says Columbia University historian David Cannadine.\"Those who hold the position strictly as wife of the king, and those (few) who have ruled as sovereign in absence of a male heir.\" Queen Caroline, who briefly held title when King George IV was crowned in 1820 is numbered among the former. Vulgar, selfish, and undisciplined, she fled from the husband she hated and became nearly as well known for her promiscuity as King George IV himself. Viewed by the public as a wronged woman, she survived George's attempts to dissolve the marriage, but opinion turned against her and she died in 1821.",
