Chemical agents dropped mercilessly on friend and foe alike have created two new humanoid species and the world population has been reduced to small colonies of humans fighting against them to survive.Out on a routine patrol, my team and I run into the worst kind of trouble.

Fighting zombies, mutants, and our own transformation. Aligned with vampires and on the run... We thought things couldn't get worse until a hidden threat finds me.When conspiracy is the norm, who can I trust?The war is not over. The fight between the species has just begun.Note: Renegades Exiled is a RH romance. It is also a complete overhaul of the previous title: Rox's Renegades. It has been fully rewritten, revised, and edited! Enjoy!",
