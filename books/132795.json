But she doesn't know what to make of the man who surprises her as she considers her find….Larkan is surprised, too. He's a shapeshifter, trained to protect his dragon kin from the outside world. But Keltie is…different. She's a warrior, just like him. And even though it's his role to mate with the dragon queen, Lacan's desire for Keltie provokes a battle between his love and his sovereign lady. What none of them knows is that Keltie is the only one who can see a new future for the dragon tribe.",
