  "description": "The first-ever collection of tales by the Victorian era's most prolific author of Christmas ghost stories!\nMove over, Charles Dickens! The author of \"A Christmas Carol\" may be the most famous writer of Christmas ghost stories from the Victorian age, but the king of the genre was James Skipp Borlase (1839-1909), who published dozens of them over an extraordinarily long career spanning from 1864 to 1907. This volume collects thirteen of his best from rare and obscure provincial newspapers in England and Australia, none of them reprinted in over a century.",
