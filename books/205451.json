Now that he’s discharged, one of them offers him another lifeline: a new future on the Caribbean island of Miralinda. But when he arrives at the abandoned estate he’s supposed to whip into shape as an executive training facility, he finds it already under renovations — overseen by the beautiful director of the island’s Historical Society. Cara Levasseur is too young for her job. Too pretty. Too… unorthodox. She’s heard it all, and now that she’s finally secured Villa Sucre, she’s not going to let anything get in the way of her first big professional coup.
