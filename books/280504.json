  "description": "The open road has owned my heart for as long as I can remember.Until a certain sassy little singer stole it.Hookups don’t lead to happily ever afters.A couple nights together. Nothing more.We made no promises.Our worlds couldn’t be more opposite.She’s sweet lyrics and sunshine.I’m danger and destruction.She’s miles away, but all I see when I close my eyes.The rhythm of the road is what I need to settle my mind.Problem is, it’s taking me straight to her.",
