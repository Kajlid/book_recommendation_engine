  "title": "Pinnacle Reef: Curse of the Forgotten",
  "description": "Several strangers traveling together find themselves castaways on an island in the Caribbean. A rescue effort for one of their fellow travelers leads them to be marooned on another island with an obscure history dating back hundreds of years. Luckett Island is surrounded by topography that has caught unawares a collection of astounded souls who have been unlucky enough to encounter itâ€™s most prominent feature, Pinnacle Reef. Once there these visitors, meet and form a partnership with another survivor from a similar calamity occurring twenty some odd years earlier. Together they embark on an adventure aimed from the outset to leave the island and return home but unknowingly find themselves immersed in long-ago foretold events that lead to a galvanic climax, and finds each member caught up in the swirls of time, forced to reckon with choices they have made, past misdeeds for some and ultimately the elusive promise of redemption and renewal for all that they have lost.",
