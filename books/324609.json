She marched into my life with no preamble and refused to be ignored. No matter how hard I slammed the door, she’d find a window to tap against. The people of Sycamore Mountain gave me a wide berth and I liked it that way. All I wanted was peace and quiet, so how did that curvy red head continue to insinuate herself into my space?RemleJasper Raj. That man was equal parts arrogant and enigmatic. He was a puzzle I couldn’t piece together. My career depended on getting his distillery, Lakshmi Bourbon, to join the National Bourbon Association before our big National Bourbon Day celebration. Yet, I’d knock on his door—he’d slam it in my face. I’d send a cookie basket, and I’d watch him toss it to the birds. There had to be a way to get onto his calendar and in my lineup of clients. The harder he pushed me away, the deeper I dug my heels in. When did our little cat and mouse game become fun?When traumas are uncovered, and feelings unearthed, will these opposites finally give in to their attraction?
