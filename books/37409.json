  "description": "Reeth Caldason's quest for vengeance—and for freedom from the twin plagues of rage and immortality—has brought the able swordsman to Bhealfa, where fear, magic, and brute force are weapons employed by the authorities to control the populace. The paladin clans—an order of mercenary knights—are determined to crush a growing revolution while Devlor Bastorran, sadistic heir apparent to the clan leadership, plots a gruesome retribution . . . against Reeth Caldason. But Reeth has more pressing concerns, for he has been entrusted with delivering much-needed gold that will help establish a rebel state on a remote island. And a powerful enemy stands in his way—one who could destroy not only the Covenant but Reeth's one chance for redemption as well.",
