Even work with the arrogant, albeit handsome, one-time actor turned real-estate mogul on his new land development deal in her beloved hometown of Harvest Ranch. That is if she doesn't throttle him first. But she has bigger fish to fry than him—like bringing to justice the man who robbed her cousins and a bunch of other people in town of millions of dollars.

He doesn't want to get involved with the townsfolk of Harvest Ranch or anyone for that matter. They all just want him for his fame anyway.But he can't stop thinking about the local he and his business partner hired to film their project for them. Jessie's apparent disgust for him is refreshing, her wit, charming, and her eyes, distracting.Not that it matters, he's not here for the girl. If only he hadn’t tried to kiss her within minutes of meeting her . . . maybe then she wouldn’t loathe him. Besides she’s more interested in the one man Alex hates more than anything.An enemies to lovers romance that will have you laughing out loud and reading past your bed time.",
