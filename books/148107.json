  "description": "The temperature in Thailand is a humid ninety degrees but things are about to get a lot hotter for Philadelphia lawyer David Elliot. Thailand is a hedonist’s paradise but David isn’t interested in the sinful pleasures Bangkok has to offer. His only concern is taking care of business so he can return home and patch things up with his ex. Then on his first night in town David meets Kai, and the younger man turns his world upside down. Kai is close-lipped, and David knows he's hiding something, but Kai brings a joie de vivre into David’s life that’s long been missing. Then after a few blissful weeks, Kai disappears and David is hurt. He knows this was never meant to be anything more than a pleasant diversion, but now that it's over can he walk away without looking back?",
