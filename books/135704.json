  "title": "The Secret History of Bigfoot: Field Notes on a North American Monster",
  "description": "From the shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest to off-the-wall cryptozoological conventions, one man searches high and low for the answer to the real or not, why do we want to believe? Journalist and writer John O'Connor takes readers on a narrative quest through the American wilds in search of Bigfoot, its myth and meaning. Inhabited by an eccentric cast of characters – reputable men of science and deluded charlatans alike – the book explores the zany and secretive world of \"cryptozoology,\" tracking Bigfoot from the Wild Men of Native American and European lore to Harry and the Hendersons, while examining the forces behind our ever-widening belief in the supernatural.  By turns an ardent, philosophical defense of nature, investigation into what Kurt Andersen calls our peculiar \"American appetites for immersive make-believe,\" and a gonzo trip into alternative reality, this is the story of our Bigfoot obsession – where it comes from, what it means today – and the people driving it. Tag along with O'Connor as he treks through the shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest, studies indigenous legends, and attends off-the-wall cryptozoological conventions. Perfect for readers of Bill Bryson and Douglas Preston and with sharp wit and an adventurous spirit, this heartfelt exploration of a cornerstone of American folklore unpacks why we believe in the things that we do, and what that says about us.",
