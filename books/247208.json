  "description": "The Earl of Saltaire had a reputation as a rakehell, an abductor and ravisher of women, a dandy and a demon on horseback. Much of what was said about him was true. Then what lady of means and of irreproachable character would consider marrying himâ€”especially if she knew the reason for the match was primarily to win a bet? Certainly not Lavinia Davenham, a beautiful lady whose was wealth was newly acquired, but whose independence and integrity were lifelong qualities. Why, he'd have to carry her off by force in the dark of night! And so he did.",
