  "description": "The Secret of Instant Healing is a step-by-step instruction about how to heal physical and emotional pain in minutes. The process is called Quantum Entrainment and does not require any previous training to learn. QE is not traditional or energy healing but a new form of healing that elicits pure awareness from beyond the mind. Both the person performing QE and their partner experience a delightful healing presence as the QE process gently unfolds. What if you knew that just by being aware of a problem you could fix it? The Secret of Instant Healing is more than just a book, it is a practical, hands-on guide to changing your life . . . in moments! Through the simple technique called Quantum Entrainment (QE, for short), Frank Kinslow demonstrates the power of pure awareness, then shows you how to open your mind to create instant healing--anytime, anywhere, with anybody and anything. It's fun, it's joyful, and it's easier than you think!",
