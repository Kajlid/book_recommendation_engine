  "description": "“I hear voices and they don’t like you.”Meet Hank. He’s your everyday run of the mill bomber who specializes in blowing up anything the little voice inside his head tells him to. On the other side of the country a teenager is reading a book. It's a scary book about a murderer breaking into the house and then she hears someone coming up the stairs. Stanger still, 20,000 feet in the air and breaking the sound barrier in her brand new fully armed F-22 Stealth Rapture Air Force Jet, Major Sally Jahnsen is on her first bombing run when the voice begins to talk to her. Blain Carter, lead LA Homicide Detective, may be the only person in the world who can stop the mayhem. Blain was born with a supernatural gift and can see people in colors. RED always means a murderer and he needs to use his talent to put a stop those naughty little voices.",
