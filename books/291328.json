  "description": "A marriage of convenience...A clash of wills...An uncompromising love!  Adelaide Amanda Pinkney was glad to bid Chicago farewell. After the bustle and crowds of the growing city, the news that her aunt and uncle had left her their California farm was like a dream come true.  But Addie's idyll was shattered the moment she reached California, and learned there was another claim on her land. Montana Creed was tall, headstrong elemental...as much a part of the rich and rugged California terrain, as the fields and valleys that dotted its majestic landscape. As a boy, Montana had watched his father slaughtered, his land stolen -- and he had vowed that, one day be would fulfill his father's dream.  Addie soon discovered that Montana's stubborn streak ran as deep as her own...and that his seductive smile was almost impossible to resist. As his reluctant bride, she came to cherish Montana's tender, passionate caresses. But she knew that one day he'd have to face the demons of his past -- or lose the bright and loving promise of their future!",
