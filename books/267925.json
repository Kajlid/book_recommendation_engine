  "description": "When Brielle was taken by the prince of darkness, a large part of me died inside. How can I move on? How can I accept that she's gone? I can't. After searching every possible way to bring her back, I finally accept that she may be gone... forever. If that's the case, then I can't stay in Angel City any longer.  *Author note: This is a follow up 30,000 word novella to Fallen Academy: Year Three that is told from Lincoln's point of view and covers his one year without Brielle. Happy reading =)",
