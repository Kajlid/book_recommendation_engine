  "description": "The Clarion Review says, \"Harrie Rose's debut novel brilliantly explores the causes and effects of depression and anxiety, as well as how early experiences shape one's life for good or ill...Rose balances the intricacies of the therapist-patient relationship with a fascinating yarn about a woman recognizing the contradictory influences on her life and ultimately coming into her own....Therapy is recommended for anyone who enjoys a meaty read with a strong female protagonist.\" Written in a vivid first person narrative that sweeps the reader along, this bold novel introduces Barbara, a 52 year old woman who has it all. So why is she sunk in an abyss of depression? Barbara is so real that, as one reader said, \"I'd love to get in a car and drive along the country roads until I find Barbara's house, so we can chat over coffee.\" Delving into the complexities of psychiatry, from its necessity to its folly, the author recounts Barbara's journey to a realization of her true worth. But is this because of her therapist or despite him? What are his true motives? the moral and ethical issues Barbara ultimately faces make excellent fodder for discussions. This is a superb choice for book clubs, but also for individuals. Despite the media's message that you must fight old age, Barbara proves that maturity itself has its own beauty, both inner and outer. Even the young admire her for her warmth, wisdom, and guts. Like the flowers in the gardens she grows, Barbara is reborn after a winter of despair.",
