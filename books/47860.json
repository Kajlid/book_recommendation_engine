  "description": "A tattoo can be a work of art...or a curse. When Jason Harford meets the tattoo artist he nicknames Sailor, ink is the last thing on his mind, but he's hurt and angry from a recent loss and makes an impulsive decision to go under the needle. Sailorâ€™s work is extraordinary, though, and the griffin tattoo is a thing of beauty, leaving Jason with no cause for regret. Until he hears the flutter of wings in the night. Finds drops of blood staining his sheets. Sees a brick wall where the tattoo shop should be. The truth is as sharp as a monster's talon, and if Jason can't find a way out, everything he knows will be destroyed and everyone he cares about will pay the price.",
