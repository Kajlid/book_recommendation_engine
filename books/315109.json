  "description": "I left with the intention of never returning to the Undertakers compound… Until one day, he comes to claim what’s his. Years I’d left and never looked back and while it wasn’t all glitter and roses during that time, it sure as hell beat the alternative. Owned a bar, had a business partner who put up with my sh*t, everything going exactly how I wanted. Until one day I wasn’t fast enough to get away and I found myself back at the criminal enterprise I’d known my whole life. Staring at the man who used to be my childhood best friend, but that was in the past. His great looks would never take away that he thought he owned me mind, body, and soul. His wife and all the crap about till death do us part. But soon enough, Cyrus will learn that I’m no one’s property.
