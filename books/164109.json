He works as a carpenter and woodcarver and is the perfect man to ensure Danâ€™s home becomes wheelchair accessible.When Dan hires Connor, neither of the men are ready to open their hearts to the possibility of love. As they learn how much they have in common, both of them must weigh the possibility of family and a future against the risks of getting hurt again.",
