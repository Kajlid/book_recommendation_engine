He longs for peace rather than power, and is bitterly disappointed when a chance for peace fails. Then the violence in the Desert reaches all new levels, and Tribes believed long vanished reappear with deadly intent. Sahayl soon learns that there is a new enemy in the Desert, and it is not one the Tribes are prepared to fight. To save his Tribe and the Desert, Sahayl must take drastic measuresâ€”measures that will reshape the Desert in a way only a Sandstorm can...Note: This story features polyamory",
