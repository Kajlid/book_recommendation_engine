  "title": "The Tree House",
  "description": "For several years now, Kathleen Jamie's work has addressed two principal how we negotiate with the natural world, and how we should define our conduct within family and society. In \"The Tree House\" Jamie argues - as Burns did before her - for an engagement of the whole being through a kind of practical earthly spirituality. These often startling encounters with animals, birds, and other humans propose a way of living which recognizes the earth as home to many different consciousnesses - and a means of authentic engagement with 'this, the only world'. Together they form one of the most powerful poetic statements of recent years.",
