  "title": "Kyles Bed & Breakfast: A Second Bowl Of Serial",
  "description": "The long-awaited second collection of the wildly addictive syndicated comic strip Kyle's Bed & Breakfast has arrived! This volume finds the boys of the harbor-town B&B up to their collective ears in romance, drama, intrigue, insanity, laughter and the occasional heartbreak… sometimes all in the same episode! The regulars are all Brad, the hunky, closeted minor-league baseball player…Lance, the take-no-prisoners ad exec…Richard, the club-hopping, gossip-spreading fashion plate…Eduardo, the struggling college student…and Kyle, the warm, compassionate, calm at the center of the storm around whom all the whackiness unfolds! We also meet some new characters, such as the gruff, buff Canadian hockey player Breyer and the mobility-challenged sci-fi maven Dave. As always, mixed in with the laughter, some serious issues facing the gay community are addressed, too... but never in a heavy-handed way. Also included is a three-episode story never-before printed elsewhere, and a nice “Who’s Who” section introducing you to all of the major & minor characters. You don't need to have read the first volume to enjoy this; the strip is designed so newcomers can jump right in and join in the gay antics! (And you don't need to be LGBT, either... the comic strip has plenty of straight fans). It’s hard to think of these characters as “cartoon characters” once you get involved in their various stories; there is a humanity & heart-felt backstory behind each one of them. Once you check into Kyle's B&B... you'll never want to leave!",
