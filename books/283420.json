  "title": "Excuse Me",
  "description": "A razor-sharp collection from the acclaimed New Yorker cartoonist and Instagram sensation, Liana Finck, whom Vulture recently called \"a remarkable young talent.\" With her trademark, scratchy style and keen eye for the absurd, Finck has amassed a large, devoted following who love the deeply insightful, delightfully odd way she describes how we all experience the world. Excuse Me assembles more than 500 of her most loved cartoons from Instagram and The New Yorker over the past few years, in such distinctive chapters as \"Love & Dating\"; \"Gender & Other Politics\"; \"Animals\"; \"Art & Myth-Making\"; \"Humanity\";\" Time, Space, and How to Navigate Them\"; \"Strangeness, Shyness, Sadness\"; and \"Notes to Self.\" Melancholy and hilarious, relatable and surreal, intensely personal yet surprisingly universal, Excuse Me brings together the best work so far by one of the most talented young comics artists working today.",
