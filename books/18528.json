  "description": "Vi Travilla is about to take on a challenge unlike anything she's ever done before. Vi knows that her dream will not be easy to achieve, but she is little prepared for the complications that await her. Who will come to her aid as she confronts the unknown forces that are determined to end her mission? What must she do to win the hearts of the people she wants to serve? Will her faith sustain her as she faces distrust and danger? The fourth in the A Life of Violet Travilla series, Violet's Bold Mission is based on characters created by Miss Martha Finley, a nineteenth-century novelist who penned a series of best-selling books about the Christian life. Her books inspired millions of readers in her own time. Mission City Press is pleased to continue Miss Finley's tradition of Christian storytelling in these new adventures of Vi Travilla---a young woman committed to live her faith every day through service to others.",
