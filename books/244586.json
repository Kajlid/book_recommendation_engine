  "description": "Eugene Field's classic bedtime poem—about three children’s adventures sailing in a wooden shoe—is brought to life with Johanna Westerman's vivid illustrations.“Westerman’s minutely detailed watercolors depict a Dutch landscape. The luminosity of the moonlit sea is captured in muted shades of blue that create a soothing mood for the dramatic verse.”— School Library Journal“Westerman captures the tone of the poem in a fittingly traditional way. . . . a pleasing rendition of an old favorite.” — Booklist“Westerman’s inventive design elements provide a soothing accompaniment for the familiar text, a staple for bedtime reading.”— Publishers Weekly",
