  "description": "I’ve been in hiding for four years. On the run from the man in whose bed I once slept.  I saw something I shouldn’t have seen. Took something I shouldn’t have taken.  And he’s just found me.  But it’s not just my safety I have to worry about. I have a little boy. His little boy. The secret baby of a Russian mobster.  He told me in no uncertain terms that I’m his. That we would be a family.  But his uncle still wants me dead and I know the man who's been hunting me is the only one who can keep us safe.",
