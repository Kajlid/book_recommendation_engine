  "description": "While trying to stop a cyber-attacker stealing all Space Team's hard-earned money, the cyborg, Mech, unlocks a secret partition in his hard drive, revealing a mysterious set of co-ordinates.  The co-ordinates lead the team to Funworld, a planet-sized theme park with a worrying number of artificially intelligent clownbots, and a shocking disregard for Health & Safety.  With no weapons, and a shapeshifter who can no longer shift shape, Space Team's quest to unlock Funworld's mysteries leads them deep into the planet's core - and to the horrors that inhabit it - where they uncover the shocking secret Mech had no idea he was keeping.  Featuring space clowns, the second-last human alive, and at least one fleeting reference to Scooby Doo, Space Team: Planet of the Japes is the seventh hilarious book in the internationally bestselling Space Team series.",
