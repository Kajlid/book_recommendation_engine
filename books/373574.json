  "description": "Book Two in the Trinity saga.So what does one do when one is a seventy-year-old man in love with a headstrong eighteen-year-old girl who has a knack for finding trouble? One pushes her away and right into danger, of course.In Lucius Knight's defense, he is a half-human, half-vampire hybrid that ages four times slower than your average human, so his seventy-years is only seventeen to him. But the girl of his dreams is human, and there are laws enforced by the FBI's Unidentifiable Phenomenon Department and the council of angels called The Nemuri that forbid him from being able to love Imogen. However, in trying to let Imogen go, he inadvertently becomes involved in a cat-and-mouse chase with an assassin called The White Knight.Things become personal for Lucius when The White Knight has Imogen in his grasp.Between being loyal to the Nemuri, being faithful to Balthasar, and being true to himself, Lucius is falling apart at the seams as he tries to save Imogen, keep a certain maniacal fire-bending villain at bay, and solve the mystery behind The White Knight.Includes preview of The Trinity The Memory Keeper.",
