  "description": "Is the church's inward focus robbing the poor?Jesus intended His church to carry on the ministry He began, but the church today is hiding in its pews, entangled in its own organizations, while Satan is winning the war in the streets. It is time for the church, with or without its current leaders, to challenge Satan in his strongholds by returning to its mission - helping the helpless, effecting rescues, and spreading good news.",
