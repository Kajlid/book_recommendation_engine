  "title": "Baby Driver: A Story About Myself",
  "description": "Just as Jack Kerouac captured the beat of the '50s, his daughter captured the rhythm of the generation that followed. With a graceful, often disturbing detachment and a spellbinding gift for descriptive imagery, Jan Kerouac explores the tortured, freewheeling soul of a woman on her own road. From an adolescence of LSD, detention homes, probation, pregnancy, and a stillbirth in the Mexican tropics at age 15; to the peace movement in Haight-Ashbury and Washington state; to traveling by bus through Central America with a madman for a lover, Baby Driver moves with the force of a tropical storm.",
