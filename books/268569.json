  "description": "He’s a notorious crime lord, a kidnapper, and an artist. Scarification is his outlet, and he just captured a new canvas. Kate refuses to surrender beneath his blade or the cruelty in his beautiful eyes. But she’s drawn to the man inside the monster. A man who makes her ache with his touch. Who owns her with his kiss. A man who worships her as deeply as he hurts her. She can run, but there’s no escape from a bond carved in scars.  DELIVER series (HEAs with no cliffhangers - must be read in order): Deliver #1 Vanquish #2 Disclaim #3 Devastate #4 Take #5 More to come!",
