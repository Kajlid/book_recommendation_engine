  "description": "As a production assistant for the Puppy Cup, Hailey Lincoln knows all things puppies and football. So when Seattle Lumberjacks star quarterback Cole Bennett asks for PR help, she agrees. She's not swayed by Cole's good looks or stellar career, but by the puppies they can help. Okay, maybe she's swayed just a tiny bit by his good looks.Winning at puppy football, however, is only the start. If she really wants to win—the game, the man, and the warm, welcoming family he takes for granted—she needs to pull out all the stops. And Cole, who's spent his entire life playing a game, has to realize that losing at football isn't nearly as catastrophic as losing the woman he loves.",
