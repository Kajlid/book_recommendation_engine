Sean Michael presents two more great stories in paperback in this fourth installment of the Velvet Glove series. In Puppy Love, who can resist a free room at the Velvet Glove in exchange for rehabilitating an abused puppy? Certainly not Dane, who accepts the offer, but is surprised find that the pup in question is actually Tyg, a young man and sub who was left by his master, in a cage, with no food or water. Tyg needs help and, Dane is the man for the job, even if he's used to working with animals, not humans.Â  Can Dane rehabilitate a human as he would a dog? Does he even want to? As his relationship with Tyg blossoms into something sweet and heartwarming, Dane thinks he just might, but what happens when Tyg's \"owner\" returns? In Anything for a Byline, hard-working Nat needs his first by-line to get his big break in journalism. When his friend Al arranges an interview for him at the Velvet Glove, Nat figures all he has to do is show up, do the interview and write his story. Heck, it's all for show, anyway, right? Nat knows he's wrong, and in over his head, the minute he walks into the club. And when he meets the man he's supposed to interview, Nat knows that his life may never be the same. Can Nat still get his coveted byline, or will he lose himself in the new world he's discovered?",
