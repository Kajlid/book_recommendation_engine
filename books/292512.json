  "description": "I have a lot of titles. Jace Connor, Sexiest Soccer Player. Top-Scoring Athlete. America’s Favorite Party Boy. But I’m sick of being what other people expect. Starting with the last one, I’m ready to earn some new nicknames.  So I absolutely, positively, can’t go anywhere near my coach’s daughter.  Brooke Darringer was warned up and down about my rep as a reformed bad boy when she got hired as sponsorship manager. What no one told her was that all my swagger hides a gentle family man who loves his nieces and nephews even more than soccer. And she likes it.  She couldn’t be more off-limits, especially as she tries to prove she wasn’t hired for her name.  I truly want to stay on the straight-and-narrow, but it isn’t just her sexy-as-sin body that’s tempting me. Her warmth and bubbly personality are everything I never knew I wanted.  Brooke is trying her best to keep things strictly professional, but all these late-night gym sessions and covert dinners might just convince her I’m finally done playing.",
