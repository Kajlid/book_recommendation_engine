  "description": "Henry Alan Bishop is a man on the run from his past as an orphan, from an ugly divorce, and from his own addiction to synaptic activators—little red pills that let him dream a different world than his job as a communications troubleshooter aboard the Far East exploratory space vessel Waco. As a radio operator, Bishop is no stranger to making sense out of seemingly senseless patterns and messages, but when he begins picking up anomalous signals on the airways that coincide with events in his increasingly chaotic dreamscape, it becomes his singular mission to decode them. As he begins to fit the puzzle pieces into their proper patterns, he unwinds the mystery of a past that never was and a future he cannot imagine. Noise is a novel about lies—about the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive.",
