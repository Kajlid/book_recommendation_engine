  "title": "Forbidden: A Prince's Most Coveted Possession",
  "description": "The story of a young servant, Roselynn, who is content with her circumstances but is still the consummate dreamer. She catches a glimpse of the Prince (soon to be King) and begins having fantasies of being his bride. Much to her surprise the Prince, Philippe, takes a liking to her as well. He arranges a meeting with her under the pre-tense of needing a younger woman to become his chambermaid (a claim that the prior woman has grown sloppy in her old age is his reasoning). Quiet, unspoken exchanges happen (she being unable to repress her fantasies, he being unable to hide his growing desire). He tries speaking with her, testing her intelligence, and she feigns complete ignorance. He stumbles upon her singing one day when she believes that he is gone. Their lives change in ways they never suspected.  Will Philippe defy all and give in to the calling of his heart? Or will he suppress a feeling that causes him turmoil? Will Roselynn allow her dreams to possibly come true? Or will she deny herself happiness for the betterment of the kingdom?",
