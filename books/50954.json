  "description": "Jack Devlin awakes with a shotgun pointed at his face. Sally, a whore, lay dead beside him. He’s arrested for murder, although he remembers nothing of the previous night. Could he really have killed her? And if so, why? He has questions, but some folks in the town of Gasher Creek don’t want them answered. And after a lynch mob storms the jail, he manages to escape into the vast and empty prairie. Now he has no food, no water, and no horse. And he’s not alone. Meanwhile, Sheriff Tom Tracker is missing his prime suspect. He’s certain Jack is the murderer, but without a confession he’ll need evidence. What he finds is unlike anything he’s ever seen before. If Devlin is guilty, then he isn’t the simple odd jobs man everyone thinks he is. Instead, he’s something much more calculating and dangerous.",
