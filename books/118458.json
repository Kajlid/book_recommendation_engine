  "description": "Bad Boy…Best Man. Natalie Campbell – super-organized, dutiful daughter, and manager of the family event planning business – is organizing her brother’s wedding. No matter how long her to-do list (and at the moment it seems never-ending!) she’s grateful for the distraction. Because if she’s fiddling with the table plans and arranging flower centerpieces she’s not thinking about last summer. When she fell into bed with Chase Malone—her brother’s best man. Now this is going to get awkward! Chase is all wrong for Natalie – she’s sure even the word commitment would send him running for the hills! He never promised her a future, and he doesn’t want anyone to know about their past. But with the wedding coming up, their little secret is getting harder and harder to keep…and almost impossible not to repeat!",
