  "description": "The mating heat ignites between a dominant alpha-heir and a forbidden wolf-witch hybrid when they're forced to find his kidnapped sister and stop a war. Now is not the time for Kane to have found his mate. But the Goddess is never wrong. If he gives in to his desires for Sheridan, her lineage could cost him everything. Yet as his body aches for her, and thoughts of her curves cloud his mind, he finds himself willing to risk it all to claim her. Forced, out of friendship and loyalty, Sheridan joins the hunt and gets more than she bargained for. A dangerous attraction to a darkly handsome wolf. While she seeks to distance herself from pack politics, Sheridan can’t deny that the first place she has ever felt she belongs is at Kane’s side. Not everyone agrees, and some will stop at nothing to destroy their love, their family, their future.",
