  "description": "The Price of Innocence was recently re-released through Holland Legacy Publishing, updating the cover and interior, and is available in paperback and eBook version. The story is historical fiction, with romantic elements, set in 1878 Paris. It is the first in a series of three entitled the Legacy Series.It is the tender story of Suzette Camille Rousseau, a young woman in late 19th century Paris, who makes a difficult journey from innocence to maturity. After losing a sheltered life with her father, Suzette is thrown into the harsh reality of poverty, struggling as a homeless woman on the streets of Paris. In order to survive, she faces difficult choices that offer little hope of redemption. Her journey takes her from the charities of St. Vincent de Paul, to a local laundry house where she toils endlessly in filth and squalor. To her surprise, one of her customers is the Chabanais, the most famous brothel in France that only caters to aristocrats. Like a fly drawn to a spider's web, the mistress of the brothel entices Suzette into a world of opulence, comfort, and beauty, but there is a price to pay -- her innocence. Succumbing to a life of prostitution, she meets a handsome English Lord who saves her from the unthinkable. The author transports her readers back to another time and place, weaving facts of 19th century life throughout the story. The Price of Innocence sets the stage for book two in the series, The Price of Deception, due for release in late summer 2011.",
