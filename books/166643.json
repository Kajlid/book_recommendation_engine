  "description": "The 26th book in the best-selling Pure Gold Classics line. Based on Simpson's religious experiences, four points were crystallized and publicly conveyed as the distinctive doctrinal conviction of his movement. These four points, which comprise the fourfold gospel, focus on Christ as the Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer, and as the coming King. Concerning Christ as the Saviour, the simple way of faith was emphasized along with the experience of regeneration and the joyful assurance of the forgiveness of sins. All the believers in this movement were then encouraged to live a life of commitment to evangelism both at home and overseas.",
