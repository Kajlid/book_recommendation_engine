  "title": "What Happened - Where Did I Go?",
  "description": "I have told the story of my menopause here, the hot flushes, the depression, the confusion, the changes in body shape, the decline of my confidence and my self-esteem. I've recounted the occasions where I thought I was lost with no hope of feeling good about myself again. Having hot flushes affected my self-assurance, becoming indecisive affected my self-belief, my changing body shape and increasing fat levels affected my self-image. My libido lessened to the point of disappearing altogether. If you want to learn about how your menopause and menopausal symptoms can potentially change you, read this. If you've always been a confident, self-assured, high-flying female, you might find this menopausal account interesting. If you need some reassurance that you're not the only one suffering the symptoms of 'The Change', then read on; you'll come to understand that you're most definitely not the only one and far from alone.",
