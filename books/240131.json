Khesat, where decadence is an art form and intrigue is a way of life--and where, more than twenty years after the end of the Second Magewar, power struggles within the ruling family threaten both the Mageworlds and the Republic.The Khesatan crisis has broken the spaceways apart, reviving old alliances and buried rivalries. Warring factions, criminal guilds, and supranormal forces all have their eyes turned toward Jens Metadi-Jessan D'Rosselin, only child to the scapegrace brother of the current--and childless--Highest of Khesat. Whoever controls the heir controls Khesat, and whoever controls Khesat controls the galaxy.Jens doesn't know that he's the first item on a long roll-call of agendas. He's off to see the galaxy in company with his cousin Faral. They're looking for excitement and adventure. Before the dust settles, they'll get more of both than they bargained for...And the civilized galaxy may never be the same again.",
