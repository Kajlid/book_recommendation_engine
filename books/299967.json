Recently unemployed, I started working for the vampires who remain hidden from the rest of society.

Little did I know they had only just begun.Aside from keeping my sassy grandmother out of trouble and worrying about my overly dramatic, angsty fifteen-year-old, now I had a vampire boss faced with mortality who was convinced I held the key to her survival. Not to mention I’m attracted to my new neighbor (a sexy tattooed biker) as well as my longtime friend (a hot bartender) who have their own supernatural secrets.Will I be able to sort out this mess and keep the people I love safe before it’s too late? And will I be able to choose between the two men who want me?",
