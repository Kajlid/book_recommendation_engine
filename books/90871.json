  "description": "\"A Baker's Dozen: 13 Tales of Murder and More\" is a compilation of short stories created over 30 years, written by a former journalist and including contributions by her mother, a professional proofreader.From murder in the mountains of Tennessee to the adventures of an all-woman air conditioning repair crew in Northern Virginia, a trip down the runway of a senior citizen beauty pageant, and the secrets revealed in the aftermath of a violent tornado, this page-turner is a blend of psychological suspense, surprise endings, satire, tearjerkers, and laugh-out-loud fun.Stories include: \"Dog's Best Friend,\" where a farmer's wife is forced to make the ultimate decision between life and death; \"Mrs. Gallagher,\" the tale of an active 85-year-old who is not exactly what she appears to be; \"The Sampler,\" the co-author's award-winning short story about a happy retired couple with a really big secret; and “What Do I Know?,” a first-person account by a very intelligent house cat who witnesses a brutal murder and lives to tell the tale.",
