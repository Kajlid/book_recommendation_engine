  "description": "What would it be like to be straight in a world where everyone is gay? Adam is a closeted straight man who meets Helen, a straight rights activist, and must choose between love and security; Liam is a bisexual politician who conceals his straight attraction from the public; and Ariella is a conservative televangelist who preaches that being straight is a sin. Follow along as they collide in a world where the rules of society are the same as ours, but the orientations are opposite!",
