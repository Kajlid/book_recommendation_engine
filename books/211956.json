It was the driving force that kept me going when our world as we knew it was ripped away from us in one horrific night. I didn't know who brutally killed my parents or why, but when the vicious killers turned their focus onto my brother and sister, I did the only thing I knew to do: I ran. I packed them up and left everything we knew and loved behind and headed for Memphis.ClutchThe club was my life. I'd do anything for my brothers. Hell, I've taken more than a couple of bullets for them and I'd do it again. But I needed to step away to clear my head.

She was a mystery to me, and even though my gut told me she was hiding something, I felt a pull to her that I could not deny.**Clutch is book four in the Satan's Fury series, but it is considered a standalone romance.
