  "title": "Season of Ash",
  "description": "Season of Ash puts a human face on the earth-shaking events of the late twentieth century: the Chernobyl disaster, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Soviet communism and the rise of the Russian oligarchs, the cascading collapse of developing economies, and the near-miraculous scientific advances of the Human Genome Project. Told through the intertwined lives of three women- Irina, a Soviet biologist; Eva, a Hungarian computer scientist; and Jennifer, an American economist- this novel-of-ideas is part detective novel, part scientific investigation and part journalistic expose, with a dark, destructive love story at its center.",
