  "description": "17-year-old Dylan Towns has lived a life filled with pain and suffering. Her past surfaces in the form of intimacy issues and flashbacks. Thinking she was less than deserving, Dylan never imagined that she’d be asked to attend an elite boarding school for the rich. With a sprawling campus nestled within a private forest, Halder Academy was something out of a dream; even when she learns she’s required to choose a specialty to train in. When an error forces Dylan to spend time with three drop-dead gorgeous brothers, her time at Halder Academy becomes a bit more complicated. Dylan has to learn to navigate: a new school; a specialty she didn’t want; her growing feelings for Seb, Connor, and Gray; and the unwanted attention of a stalker. This is a reverse harem novel. Book 1 of 3 in The Halder Brothers series.",
