  "description": "Vail Tamang is a playboy. He’s never claimed to be anything else. What he does claim is that he doesn’t want a mate. The truth is a little more sinister. When he scents Draven Mansetti, Tim’s half-vampire, half-warlock mentor, he realizes his worst fear has come true. Draven is his mate. Vail tries to avoid the man, but Draven manages to track him down anyway. He’s left with no choice and shares a family secret. His family line is cursed. Can Draven convince Vail that some curses can be broken? Or will Vail walk away before giving them a chance?",
