  "description": "The Terran Empire is in a state of chaos after the successful sack by the Valdi armada. As the Terran fleets struggle to reorganize, First Marshal Scott Pearson led the charge to cut into the enemy flank and stem the tide of reinforcements. With Orion help, he was succeeding, until Captain Traci Ganner interferred--again. But Traci must bring the Terran marshal and the chief Orion councilor together to confront a Terran threat from the future. Facing daunting new technology, Traci finds herself in the clutches of a new Terran enemy and if they force the location of the rift from her, both the Terrans and Orions will be lost. The final book of the Traci Ganner trilogy puts Traci and her officers through their most difficult trials yet and leads Traci to a mystical temple that holds the keys to her very survival.",
