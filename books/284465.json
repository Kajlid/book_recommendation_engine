  "description": "This soldier is on a mission—a picture perfect proposal that she can’t refuse.\n  A standalone holiday story from New York Times bestselling author Vivian Arend.  Mack Klassen is no longer a Canadian Air Force firefighter, but he’s still fighting fires. The one burning between him and a certain small town mechanic might be the hottest he’s ever faced. When Brooke Silver requests his help in making this holiday season extra special, it’s the opportunity he’s been waiting for. A chance to impress her, impress her seemingly unenthusiastic father—and finally find the perfect way to ask an all-important question about forever.  After Brooke catches her dad muttering about an old-fashioned Christmas, she enlists Mack and her friends in Heart Falls to make this holiday season one for the memory books. Cookies, decorations, songs and presents—it should be easy, but between one disaster after another and the impending arrival of the storm of the decade, the perfect festive season seems to be slipping away.  Then suddenly it’s not about the day but surviving long enough to enjoy their future. It’s going to take a holiday miracle for everyone’s wishes to come true.",
