  "description": "RUBY KROSS  Who is Corbin Sterling to me? That's what people always want to know. He was my first friend. He was the love of my life. And he was my only heartbreak. The problem is that I love the big jerk, and I've refused to give up our friendship, even if it does mean it'll eventually ruin me. So, to answer the question... Corbin Fucking Sterling is the Bane of my existence; that's what he is.  CORBIN STERLING  People tell you to learn from your mistakes, but the problem isn't learning from them; it's undoing them. I wish I could go back and undo a lot of shit. Maybe then I wouldn't feel tortured every time Ruby calls me her \"best friend.\" This might be the last chance I have to make everything right, but she's sure as hell not going to make it easy. The games we play will either finally stop, or turn into what I've always wanted. This time I won't fuck it up. Hopefully.",
