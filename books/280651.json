  "title": "Beautifully Scarred",
  "description": "With her past firmly behind her where it belongs, Juliette has made a career out of turning her scars into art. She uses her skills to help others cover the evidence of their pain, too.  But some scars are too deep, too painful for anyone to hide completely.  Juliette has everything she could ever need--great parents, her dream job, the best friend a girl could ask for, and a new body to warm her bed whenever she wants. With her focus firmly on the here and now, she never expects a kiss from a stranger to throw a bomb in the middle of her carefully constructed life.  Every wound leaves a scar. Every scar tells a story. Her story left her beautifully scarred.   *This book contains sensitive subject matters and a graphic scene, which may be distressing for some readers.",
