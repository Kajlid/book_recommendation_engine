  "description": "When the going gets tough, the tough brew potions\nI made a potion to fix my mum’s broken mind but only time will tell if it will succeed – or if it will fail like all my previous attempts. As her condition worsens, I’m doing everything I can to save her, but when there’s an attack at the Other circus my priorities have to shift.The circus is the Other realm’s equivalent to a witness-protection programme, and I’ve hidden two of my witches there. When one of them is nearly killed, I realise there is a mole in my coven. I need to find out who the traitor is before it’s too late.Things are heating up. It's becoming clear that I need to confront the black Coven and its immoral leader – who just happens to be my estranged father. I’ve heard the prophecy about the coming conflict between us, but I’m more than happy to say ‘screw you’ to my supposed fate. No one tells me what to do; I’m the captain of my own ship and I dictate where she sails.Yet whether I want it or not, my destiny is calling – and she says that death is on the cards. But whose?Don't miss this witchy series if you like humour, heart and a strong heroine with a slow burn, enemies to lovers, fade-to-black romance.Written in British English.",
