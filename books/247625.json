And he got the girl - the beautiful, quirky girl he’s just made his wife. Yes, life is good. If only fate would stop screaming in his ear. Lucky is the best word for Casey McKallister. She has an awesome support system, a nerd’s dream job at a prestigious accounting firm, and best of all, she’s married to the hottest rock star to ever roam the earth. Yes, life is perfect… until it all comes crashing down around her. They say love conquers all. That’s what Jake and Casey are counting on.",
