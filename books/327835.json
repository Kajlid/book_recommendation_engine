What she didn’t expect was to wake up in her birthday suit next to pop star Landon Paige with a massive diamond on her ring finger.  It was supposed to be one night of wild recklessness. But what happened in Vegas didn’t stay there. Now they have to fake it until they bake it.  That’s right, bake it.

The man requires a real nanny and a fake wife, and she needs the contest’s prize money to keep her grandmother’s house from getting repossessed. It’s a business arrangement.
