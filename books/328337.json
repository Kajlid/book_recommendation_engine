When journalist Cassandra Bell moved to the town of Brookville in upstate New York, she thought she was leaving the madness of the big city behind, but what she found instead was madness of a different kind. The people of Brookville, once ordinary and predictable seem to change personalities overnight. Their behavior is accompanied by a series of strange events â€“ lost time, hallucinations, and memories of a past with which they are unfamiliar. Cassandra had heard of haunted houses, but could it happen to an entire town?Will she be able to get to the bottom of these occurrences before they reach a violent end?
