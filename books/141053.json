  "description": "ONE UNWITTING CYBORG AGAINST THE UNIVERSE.I entered The Program as a small child, purely human and terminally ill.I escaped The Program as an adult, sort-of human and virtually indestructible.But I left someone behind.I enrol at Nova Academy, an elite school for military training, after discovering their connection to The Program, desperate to find my friend. But there’s a catch. Nova Academy is an all male school, and I am most decidedly a girl.Can I find my way back to save my best friend without anyone uncovering my secrets?This is book 1 in a why choose sci fi romance series where the FMC does not have to choose between her love interests. This series will get darker and spicier with each book while the FMC builds her harem. I am a British author and write in British English, so there may be some spelling differences from American English. For example, yes I know I only used 1 L in ‘enrol’ but I can assure you it is correct. I’ll give you ‘aluminum’ but that’s it… I promise I can spell!",
