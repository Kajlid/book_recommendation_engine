  "description": "*Box set includes The Line That Binds & The Line That Breaks*Wishes don't come true. I should know. If they did, my addict mom wouldn’t have left, and my dad wouldn't have lost his job. I wouldn't have moved cross-country to a creepy old house on an estate willed to me by some crazy great-aunt I never knew. It's not exactly the best way to start senior year, but life in Las Vegas is over, and change is exactly what I need. When I meet the groundskeeper’s smart-mouthed grandson, I can tell by his gritty style that he’s the kind of change I probably should avoid. And when I ask him about my family’s past, his dark, mischievous eyes tell me more than his words. But it's not until I find the well and the headaches begin that I realize how much he's really hiding. Maybe wishes do come true. With a price.",
