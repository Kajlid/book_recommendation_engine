Five years out of college, she’s got a steady job, a home she loves in the big city, and good friends who always keep her her stylish but nosy roommate Evette, happily-married Cecie, and of course, good old Mitch, her seriously cute co-worker who’s been stuck in the Friend Zone since the day they met.

Things get even more complicated when hunky JP enters the scene. What’s a girl to do?

Maybe her roommate has the right idea after forget the men, and stick with a canine companion instead. It’s time for Kate to figure out what she really wants in life. But can she dig her way out of the mess she’s created before she ends up permanently in the doghouse? Please This book contains adult language and mild sexual content.",
