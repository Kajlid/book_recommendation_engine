  "title": "They Do the Same Things Different There",
  "description": "2015 World Fantasy Award nominee! Shirley Jackson Award nominee! Robert Shearman visits worlds that are unsettling and strange. Sometimes they are just like ours-except landlocked countries may disappear overnight, marriages to camels are the norm, and the dead turn into musical instruments. Sometimes they are quite alien-where children carve their own tongues from trees, and magic shows are performed to amuse the troops in the war between demons and angels. There is horror, and dreams fulfilled and squandered, of true love. They do the same things different there. Robert Shearman has written four previous collections of short stories, and they have collectively won the World Fantasy Award, the Shirley Jackson Award, and three British Fantasy Awards.",
