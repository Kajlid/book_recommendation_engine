  "description": "Set in the antebellum Creole community surrounding New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral, L'IMMORTALITE offers a fine gumbo of horror and history, comedic characters and conflicted spirituality, and serves it up Cajun style in the attic of New Orleans' most haunted house. A reclusive lay sacristan shares the quest for immortality with a runaway slave, a sadistic socialite, and a mad scientist. Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau intercedes with a lesson in the power of compassion when their fates collide at the infamous Lalaurie Mansion. L'IMMORTALITE is based on the true story of the fire that led to the discovery of the Crescent City's most horrifying crime, an event that has generated legends of terror for almost two centuries. The tumultuous events of the 1830's, the lives of two powerful women, and the ghosts of a dozen characters torn from the pages of history all come to life in L'IMMORTALITE",
