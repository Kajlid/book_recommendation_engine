  "title": "Billy Budd, Sailor",
  "description": "If Melville had never written Moby Dick, his place in world literature would be assured by his short tales. \"Billy Budd, Sailor,\" his last work, is the masterpiece before his death in 1891 in which he delivers the final summation in his \"quarrel with God.\" It is a brilliant study of the tragic clash between social authority and individual freedom, human justice and abstract good.",
