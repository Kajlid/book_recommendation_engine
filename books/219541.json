  "title": "CrimeSong: True Crime Stories From Southern Murder Ballads",
  "description": "CrimeSong is a double medalist in the 21st Annual IPPY Book Awards, winning a Silver medal in Southeast—Best Regional Non-fiction and a Bronze medal in National for Cover Design—Nonfiction. Also, CrimeSong is a 2016 Foreword Reviews Book of the Year Awards INDIES Finalist (True Crime).CrimeSong plunges readers into a world of violence against women, murders, familicide, suicides, brutal mob action, and many examples of a failed justice system. This compelling investigation of the gripping true crimes behind American ballads dispels myths and legends and brings to life a cast of characters—both loathsome and innocent—shadowy history, courtroom dramas, murders, mayhem and music.Although these ballads and stories are set in specific times, cultures, and places, they present “timeless, universal themes” of love, betrayal, jealousy, and madness through true-life tales that are both terrifying and familiar—stories that could be “ripped from today’s headlines.”In CrimeSong, law professor and authentic storyteller Richard H. Underwood recreates in engaging and folksy prose the true facts behind twenty-four Southern murder ballads. Underwood has resurrected these stories and shares them with the reader through his “old lawyer trifocals.”He presents his case studies, documented through contemporary news accounts and court records, as a series of dramas filled with jump-off-the-page real and memorable characters.",
