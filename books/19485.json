  "description": "Originally published in 1934, 'The Chalet School and The Lintons' was broken into two volumes in paperback, the first part (this volume) retaining the original title, the second named 'A Rebel at the Chalet School'.The girls stared eagerly as the curtains draped across the top end of the room were drawn apart. The next moment the stage was in full view, and the excited girls saw a strange sight. There stood a broad lady in an ample black skirt, huge shawl and a bonnet stuck on her head. She had heavy black eyebrows and several teeth missing. Behind her stood a rigid group - Prince Charlie, a prim Florence Nightingale, Joan of Arc, Napoleon and a young Queen Victoria. But it was the huge woman in black who held their attention most strongly. Who was she? And what was her connection with all these famous faces of the past?",
