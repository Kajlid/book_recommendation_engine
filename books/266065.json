  "description": "The Murder At The Carousel Club challenges Detective Lieutenant Matthew Alexander to build a rock solid case against a suspect who, rather than fleeing from the scene of the crime, is found unconscious just feet from the murdered man with no sign of the murder weapon in his posssession and no witnesses to the murder. Similar to the spinning of a carousel, Lieutenant Alexander has to work harder than ever to avoid running in circles with a suspect who threatened to kill the murdered man, was known to carry a semi-automatic revolver in the glove compartment of his automobile, and who had laid-in-wait for the victim outside the Carousel Club. What happens next leads Lieutenant Matthew Alexander and his partner Sergeant Jake Jackson on a merry-go-roound of a homicide case as the Lieutenant solves the murder in the lastest installment of the Matthew Alexander Mystery Series, the Murder At The Carousel Club.",
