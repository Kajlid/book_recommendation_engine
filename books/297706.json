  "title": "Bakery Recipes: Bake your own Treat at Home",
  "description": "Baking is fun once you know the simple tricks and tips. Those who do not bake may fear the art of baking at first, but once you get the hold of it, you will never stop baking for the rest of your life. Baking is definitely an art, and you can be as creative as you want with it. There is no hard and fast rule for baking. We all visit the local bakery quite often for little treats, and it does cost a good amount of money in comparison to making it at home. You will be able to make 6 servings of a treat with the money that it costs to buy one single serving from the bakery. Another important point is, you will never know how fresh the baked goods are in the bakery. Some stores do care about fresh ingredients and freshly baked goods, but it is difficult to ensure which bakery is to trust. So, letâ€™s stop relying on any bakery for freshly baked goods and start making them at home. This book contains 30 delicious bakery recipes that are easy to make and tastes very good.",
