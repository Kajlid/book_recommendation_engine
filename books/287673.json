  "description": "Ridge Faulkner was a renowned luxury house builder. When Ridge was selected at a charity bachelor auction, he was surprised when it wasn’t for an actual date. The woman only wanted him to help fix up her house.  Savannah Ambrose was starting her life over in Shadows Landing. But she needed help with the fixer-upper she was moving into. With little money to spare, she thought her best bet was to buy an expert for a date. She told Ridge Faulkner it was only to fix her house, but one look at Ridge in a tuxedo had her rethinking that plan.  The trouble with making plans is that nothing ever goes the way you want. A fire here, an accident there, and suddenly Ridge and Savannah’s lives are in danger. Only who was the target and why? Ridge and Savannah begin to unravel the mystery, but will they live to see who is pulling all the strings?",
