  "description": "All spoiled vampire Ezra wanted was a night of fun. Drinks, dancing, and hopefully a lot of sex. What he gets instead is kidnapped by a rival vampire clan. He escapes his captors only to end up lost in the woods. In the middle of a blizzard. Seeking refuge from the cold and snow leads him to a seemingly empty cabin.Morgan just dropped a bomb on his family for Christmas—after years of training in the family monster hunting business he’s quitting, effective immediately. To escape their judgment he runs away to a friend’s cabin for a week of solitude. No family. No phones. Unfortunately the cabin has a little vampire problem: Ezra.But this vampire is unlike any monster Morgan has come up against before. For one thing, Ezra is dressed in five inch heels and follows Morgan around like a lost puppy. For another, Morgan can’t stop thinking about what it would be like to kiss a vampire instead of killing one. And the longer the snow keeps them trapped together the more vampire and hunter wonder if they’re really meant to be enemies at all.",
