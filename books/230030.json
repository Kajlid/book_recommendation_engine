Fans of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, Divergent and iRobot, and robot cyberpunk dystopia will love this world with two young but strong female heroines who must save the fragile system crumbling around them. This story will even satisfy those looking for something with more philosophical themes and is a perfect fit for the sci-fi, artificial intelligence, and robotics interested readers.
