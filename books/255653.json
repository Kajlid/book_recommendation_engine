  "description": "\"Hunger Games meets Shade of Vampire.\" ♥☣☢⚔♛☠♥ YABookWorm  A vampire prince. A beautiful rebel. A love that could topple the kingdom.  The covenant protects both races. Without the elite, the infection from the poisonous ash would turn us into monsters. Without the humans, the bloodlust from the elixir would drive the elite mad.  I've always been a loyal citizen. I've always believed the lies they tell us.  But when it's my turn to be chosen, I find that my new home is a gilded cage, and the politics of the citadel are far more dangerous than the beasts that roam the wilderness. When the bodies start stacking up, I realize the peace between our races is far more fragile that it appears, and based on secrets that could topple the kingdom. I'll have to fight to prove my place here, to protect a system I'm not even sure I believe in anymore.  Not everybody is happy to be ruled. And some will fight to be free. The only question is, I'm no longer sure of who I really am, or which side I'm fighting for. My new husband is hiding things from, and when he learns the truth about who I really am, I'm not sure even he has the power to save me.  Luckily, once I embrace my newfound abilities, I might just be strong enough to save us both - as long as his father, the king, doesn't kill me first.  Taste is a dystopian vampire romance. Fans of the Hunger Games, Red Queen, futuristic scifi and classic paranormal romance will love this unique twist on the 'vampire hunter' mythology.",
