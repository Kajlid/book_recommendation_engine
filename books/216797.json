  "description": "After leaving Earth on what she thought would be an adventure, Caria Montgomery quickly ends up in way over her head. Captured by hostile aliens, she faces the prospect of perishing on an isolated planet until she is rescued by Commander Phahlen Verdar and his crew. Phahlen is delighted to have a human female aboard his ship. In the years since the women of his own world were nearly wiped out by a terrible plague, taking a mate has become all but impossible for most males of his species, and he doesn’t plan to let this opportunity pass him by. His plan to claim Caria is aided by the fact that, due to the unsavoury nature of the crew of the ship on which she was travelling, she is now a wanted fugitive back on Earth. Though Caria is initially defiant, a sound spanking on her bare bottom demonstrates her admittedly handsome future mate’s resolve. His bold dominance awakens an intense need within her, and before long she finds herself yearning for the pleasure of his masterful lovemaking. But is she truly prepared to surrender herself fully to her alien commander, or will she seek to return to Earth and clear her name as soon as possible? Publisher’s Her Alien Commander includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.",
