  "description": "The Foundling begins with a chance encounter between an old man named Balbus and a small boy named Elerian. They meet in the depths of a dangerous forest, and believing Elerian to be an orphan, Balbus decides to take him home, a decision that turns his quiet life upside down. Balbus discovers that Elerian is no ordinary child, and that he is being hunted by a number of enemies, all of whom are determined to kill him for reasons of their own. To keep Elerian alive, Balbus is forced to contend with shape shifters, Goblins, and other magical creatures. He is often aided by his good friend Tullius who possesses magical powers. And sometimes, Elerian, who possesses magical powers of his own, is forced to step in and rescue both of his protectors.The Foundling is the first of six books about the life and the adventures of Elerian. It is an integral part of my Hidden Realm series because it reveals many details of Elerian's younger years and his introduction to magic, but the book itself is written for children and the young at heart. If you do not fall into one of these two categories then I would suggest that you move on to the The Mage, the second book in the series. The Mage and the four books which follow it are more suitable for young adults and adults.",
