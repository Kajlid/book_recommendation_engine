  "title": "Hell Camp: How to Chew on a Crazy Childhood and Avoid Choking",
  "description": "\"Hell Camp\" is one helluva ride. A fast-paced, slap-you-in-the-face journey through a bizarre childhood with a crazy mother. A mother who will stop at nothing to get what she wants; a mother who crashes cars, beats up the maid, extinguishes cigarettes on her arms, sleeps with the neighborhood, runs away from home for months at a time and eventually \"kidnaps\" a toddler. \"Hell Camp\" is laugh-out loud funny and heartbreakingly sad - a tragicomedy of momentous proportions. A story of love, determination, betrayal, violence, sex, abuse and utter madness - you won't be able to put this book down.",
