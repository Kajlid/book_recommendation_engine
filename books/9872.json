  "description": "Jaded police detective Mike Palmer has been trying to take down suspected bank robber Donovan Carter for eighteen months. However, this pales in comparison when Mike’s ex-wife threatens to take their daughter away to another country and he needs a lawyer to fight her for custody. Mike turns to Donovan for money and is enlisted by him to help pull off his next heist. Donovan has his own problems too; under the thumb of a dangerous gangster forcing him to perform the heists to pay off a debt and keeping his crimes hidden from his wife. As the former adversaries work together on Donovan’s biggest heist to date, they also have Mike’s partner Jade Edmonds closing in on them, hoping to take them down.",
