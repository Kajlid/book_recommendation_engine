  "description": "A happy ending for all but one. It’s the last stage of Azalei’s extensive, daring, world-inclusive plan. One more move and it’ll all be over, for good. But with all of the Southern Country’s people trapped in an inhospitable wilderness, some of her most prominent allies among them, the last piece of strategy isn’t enacted before Carson uses his influence to turn her closest companion to his side. Losing allies and watching as the world teeters on the edge of giving into Carson’s threats, Azalei must return home and confront her people. Yet, even though tensions are rising world-wide, at home she is welcomed as their country’s rightful queen. Her people ready to rise to her call, the world waiting for the moment she takes the throne and resolves this war before it begins, the Families prepared to back her in whatever way she asks, she makes a final move that no one could have seen coming. In twist after twist that rattles everything Azalei’s allies thought they knew about her, Arae’s true intentions finally come to light, and they’re nothing anyone could have imagined. With Carson exposing a new side to his own plan that pushes the world to the brink, and their faith in Azalei disintegrating before their eyes, Azalei’s friends start to question everything they thought they knew about the game they’ve been playing these last few months. In the aftermath, the only questions that will remain are Who is friend, who is foe, and who will burn? “The shocking finish to a series everyone should read – Azalei’s Fall is in a category all its own.”",
