  "description": "Kevin always had one ability that set him apart from everyone else. Healing. He healed his classmate Rachel when they were six years old, even though it almost exposed him. He lost his parents after starting high school. Now a senior, he struggles to stay out of his sister’s way as she takes care of both of them. He sleeps on the couch in their one-bedroom apartment and walks to school. His sister is the only person he calls a friend. As if that weren’t enough, he discovers his power goes far beyond simple healing. Kevin is a witch. On top of everything, he has to deal with the surprises of the supernatural world. It turns out witch-hunters, vampires, and werewolves don’t like witches all that much. Kevin will need help from his new girlfriend Rachel, the sympathetic vampire Victoria, and every trick in his spell-book to survive.",
