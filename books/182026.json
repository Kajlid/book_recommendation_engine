  "title": "The Muse of the Violets: Poems",
  "description": "Writing in a rigid French verse form (including sonnets, hendecasyllabic verse, and prose poetry), Vivien was virtually unknown in the US prior to Naiad’s translations of her works into English. Comprising eighteen poems inspired largely her tempestuous relationship with fellow lesbian poet Natalie Barney, as well as her unrequited passion for her childhood friend, Violet Shillito, who would remain a fixture in her work until her premature death at the age of 32. Founded by Barbara Grier, Naiad’s focus was preserving out-of-print lesbian classics and publishing the work of iconic lesbian feminist writers. Translated by Margaret Porter and Catherine Kroger, with an introduction by French writer Louise Faure-Favier, excerpted from her biography of Vivien.",
