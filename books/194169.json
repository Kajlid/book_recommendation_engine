  "description": "To most of us, werewolves conjure images of lurid Hollywood horror fantasies. But where did the idea of the terrible transformation originate? Why is it meant to happen at the full moon, and why should silver bullets counteract it?From Paleolithic animal cults to modern psychiatric wards, Adam Douglas traces the history of lycanthropy through myth, legend and literature from all over the world - Ancient Egypt and American Indian societies, the witch-hunts of seventeenth century Europe and Celtic, Norse, and Hindu cultures, classical literature and modern cinema.Ranging from 'scientific' to shamanistic explanations for lycanthropy, from Lon Chaney and The Company of Wolves to Romulus and Remus, Mowgli, or psychiatric case histories, The Beast Within is a compelling reassessment of one of mankind's most potent and enduring symbols.Photography: Andre Chapman",
