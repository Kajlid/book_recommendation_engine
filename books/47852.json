  "description": "Lifemobile tells the story of Benjy Bennett, an honor student with Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome, who upon graduation from high school hopelessly despairs that there is \"no place in this world\" for someone as different as him. But then his widowed father brings home a \"Deathmobile,\" an old Corvair, famously characterized by Ralph Nader as \"unsafe at any speed.\" When Benjy learns that the U.S. government ultimately found Nader's sensational charges untrue, he decides that the Corvair is \"not disabled, just different,\" as he is, and has been unfairly stigmatized by a world that does not understand it, just as he has. The different boy becomes the different car's champion, determined to prove to the world how wrong it is about both of them.",
