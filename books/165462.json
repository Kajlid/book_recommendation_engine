  "description": "Book 3 of the 4-book series The Stark Affair  Is Colton Stark a criminal? What is the Talon Group? Can he be trusted?  These are Sofia's questions as she continues to investigate the man who dominates her sexually in sessions of hot steamy delight.  Tensions also mount in the Miami-Dade Police Department as Sofia gets closer to discovering the identity of the mole who goes by the code name \"Beacon.\"  Torn between her duty as a cop and her ever-growing feelings for Colton, Sofia soon discovers the evidence she needs to put him away.  Will she use it to arrest him? Or will she decide to join his escape plan?  WARNING: My books are the raw, unfiltered vision of a slightly schizophrenic, sex-obsessed, vodka-swilling \"living contradiction\" with profanity issues. They are often unrealistic (translation: FUN) depictions of what life would be like if erotic romance fantasies came true, so sometimes... gasp!... things happen that aren't \"realistic\". (You know, kind of like how dull boring everyday life is realistic. Seriously, do you want to read about that?) If you are offended by the excessive use of dirty words, crass descriptions, or crude stream-of-consciousness writing laced with potty-mouthed expressions and graphic descriptions of non-traditional carnal delight, then you need to RUN from my writing right now! Don't say you weren't warned. (Oh, and you'd better be over 18! Don't even think about buying my books if you aren't.)  Approximate length: 13,000 words  This is the third title in a series. There IS a cliffhanger ending. You have now been warned about that too.",
