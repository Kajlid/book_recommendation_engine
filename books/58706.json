  "description": "With his family torn apart and his life in danger from the British Secret Service, Jimmy seeks refuge in the USA. But running isn't good enough. His enemy will always find him.They see everything.They're in every shadow.They're inside his head.It's time to end the chase.The Times (London):\"Despite the search for the next Anthony Horowitz or JK Rowling, children’s publishers often fail to realise when they have struck gold. They pump money into solemn, literary offerings by established authors which no normal child is going to hanker after and leave the rip-roaring read to fend for itself. Joe Craig is a case in point. His Jimmy Coates series is about a twelve-year-old boy, who thinks he is normal until he discovers that he is only 38 per cent human. Scientists have manipulated genetics to grow Jimmy into something that will become an assassin, “designed to reach active service capability” once he is 18...\"Like Anthony Horowitz’s splendid fantasies, they tap into almost everything a bolshy boy wants and feels. Immensely clever, immediately engaging, they will prepare a child for Orwell and Huxley... Pure gold for boys who have read everything by Anthony Horowitz — or have not been able to tackle him yet.\"Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA):“The perfect primer to the Bourne series by Robert Ludlum.”Red House Children’s Book Award:“A stimulating thriller that kept everyone enthralled.”INIS:“…an immensely entertaining espionage thriller for young readers… Most importantly, this novel is quite simply fantastic fun to read, and will keep many readers aged 10+ entranced for hours.”",
