  "title": "Into the Dead Fall",
  "description": "This is a full-length, science-fiction/science-fantasy, MFM alien romance novel that was previously published as part of a two-book collection with The Scorpion's Mate. This is a revised edition with significant additional story content. Though she was raised by a survivalist, Alice was not prepared to be ripped from her dimension and dropped without ceremony into the massive junkyard of a parallel dimension. She’s wounded, alone, and lost in a world her mind struggles to comprehend. Then a four-armed alien with the face of a dangerous lion reveals that his heart is not so predatory, when he comes to her aid and saves her life. Because of her wounds, she has no choice but to accept his help. She finally begins to grow comfortable around her leonine companion, until another warrior intervenes to save her when creatures from the Dead Fall attack them during their exploration, suddenly making everything much more complicated. Alice still doesn’t understand what either of the warriors is saying, and if she can’t find the right words to soothe her beastly new protectors, they’ll end up killing each other. Author’s 18+ These books contain scenes that are not suitable for younger audiences. It should also be noted that the alien heroes in these books are alien in both appearance and attributes, and this might make some readers uncomfortable, as their cultures and mating habits might not be for everyone.",
