  "title": "Tales Pinned On A Complete Ass: A Journey To Romania",
  "description": "\"In the raucous and bawdy spirit of P.J. O'Rourke and Hunter S. Thompson, join our intrepidly baffled author in his satire on ethnography and travel-writing as he visits one of the most exotic, beautiful, yet Kafka-esque nations on Romania. Proving that one can become drunk and destitute in any language, watch as our author races converted school buses that catch aflame, bribe moustachioed foreign police officers, flee panicked moments of grievous linguistic misunderstanding, defend Canadian drinking honour by bending the elbow with gypsies and ex-Soviet poets, dodge skull-pinching anthropologists, travel across the rusted landscape in rickety trains, and eventually return to his native land an utter gibbering wreck.Faucher negotiates cultural differences with a double-barrel blast of absurdity and audacity, but with a treatment that is both ridiculous and touching.\"",
