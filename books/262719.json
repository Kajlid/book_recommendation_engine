  "description": "The second book in the red-hot Kings of Sydney series finds Xander King working with his sexy stepsister, Poppy. But can he keep his dark past hidden when their sizzling chemistry takes them from the boardroom to the bedroom?I don’t know what’s hating my stepsister or lusting after her. I knew that hiring Poppy could be a mistake, but what choice did I have? Nobody else wants to work with a King—my crime lord father made sure of that before my brothers and I sent him to prison.It’s not all bad, though; Poppy is a little more open-minded than I remember. It turns out my attraction to her isn’t completely one-sided—apparently, she finds my authority as exciting as I find her body. The animosity between us only makes it more exhilarating…But a dark secret from my past could ruin everything. Poppy’s father used to work with mine, and I know more about his death than she guesses. I’ve been living with the guilt for years, and now that I’m so close to Poppy every day, I don’t know how much longer I can hide it. I could tell her everything and risk our thrillingly wild fling—but am I willing to give up something that feels so good?Sexy. Passionate. Bold. Discover Harlequin Dare, a new line of fun, edgy and sexually explicit romances for the fearless female.",
