  "title": "The Elf-Witch Chronicles",
  "description": "Your parents were no ordinary witch and wizard. With those words Amber's life is changed forever. After weeks of bizarre incidents and strange occurrences she finally discovers the truth about who she really is. But, not everyone in Mysterica is pleased by the revelation and they are prepared to kill in order to stop the teenage witch from fulfilling her destiny. Surrounded by danger and betrayal, Amber must use her unique skills and find the strength to save Mysterica from the forces of darkness that threaten it by taking on the deadly Prince Brogan in a battle that only one of them can survive.\"The reader will enjoy being back with Amber as she grapples with new exciting adventures. The author has created a world unique to her bewitching heroine, so apparently easily accessible from the day-to-day prosaic reality of our own world-just a portal from beneath a bed or a tree and you're there!\"-Charles Muller, Diadem Books",
