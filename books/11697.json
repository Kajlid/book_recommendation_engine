  "title": "Nineteenth-Century Women Poets: An Oxford Anthology",
  "description": "Beginning with Anna Laetitia Barbauld's petition to William Wilberforce and ending with the myth-making Irish writers of the Celtic revival, this major new anthology brings to light diverse female traditions that have, for years, remained in obscurity. While the editors showcase a host offemale writers well-known in their day--Felicia Hemans, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Christina Rossetti--they widen the focus to less familiar works by working-class, colonial, and political writers.The anthology's chronological progression highlights the development of women's verse from the late Romantic period through the Victorian fin-de-si√®cle. The editors examine the political formations and cultural groupings to which the women belonged, along with the structures which made thedevelopment of their work in particular, the numerous minority journals which allowed them a coherent voice. They consider common preoccupations with marriage, slavery, military conflict, national identity, and religious and sexual discourses, and reveal how styles and genres changedacross the century. The anthology draws on first editions for texts wherever possible, retaining the spelling and punctuation of the originals for a faithful representation.",
