  "description": "Eric Horton has been having visions - terrible dreams that wake him up at night - of explosions and fire and someone screaming.On the soccer field, he’s been in the ‘zone’, saving shot after shot as one of the starting keepers for his high school varsity team with what feels like supernatural awareness of where the ball is going to go next. And the connection he feels with Renee, the hot new exchange student from France, seems almost like he’s known her forever. But all these wild visions and synchronicities are nothing compared to the strange experiments Renee’s dad is cooking up in the physics lab at the University. He’s asked Eric to take part in these tests, and that makes Eric question whether what he’s seeing and hearing is reality, or something far beyond it.Then when his best friend Will starts drinking way too much and Renee has eyes for other guys, Eric loses the edge he’s always had in the goal, and confidence in himself. If he’s going to pull it together, Eric must tap into a part of himself that he never knew existed, and that might just be the part that connects us all.",
