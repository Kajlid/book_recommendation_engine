  "description": "Like any big-city paramedic, Shaw Chandler had probably seen a thousand suicides in Miami. But he knows a murder when he sees one--and this time it's his own father. Suddenly he's got a metal cannister marked \"US NAVY\" in his hands, and he's dragged back to the crazed, coral shores of Key West to explain it. There he comes face-to-face with a deranged killer--and a psychotic mastermind.",
