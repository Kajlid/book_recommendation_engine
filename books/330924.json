That’s always been my goal.So, when I’m finally assigned a case that promises to see some action, I’m beyond excited…Until the Army steps in and assigns a team of Green Berets to babysit me.I don’t want their help and they sure as hell don’t want me on their team, but none of us have a choice.In the deserts of Iraq where the sun is hot and the tension is hotter, Keller, Alden, Torque, Rush, and I are hunting a dangerous terrorist that’d do anything to find us first.If we don’t learn to trust each other, we’re as good as dead.
