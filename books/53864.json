  "description": "The Last Horsemen is the inspiring story of John Dodd and his family, who have lived on Sillywrae Farm—the last farm in Britain to be worked by horses—for more than 150 years. Telling the inspirational story of a year in the life of John Dodd, his family, and the farm, this book compellingly evokes the beauty of the countryside. With a farming industry that seems to lurch from crisis to crisis, learning from people who have chosen an alternative way of life becomes ever more important. The Last Horsemen is a truly inspirational opportunity to view first-hand scenes rarely played out in Britain's countryside in the 21st century.",
