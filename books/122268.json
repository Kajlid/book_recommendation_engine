  "description": "In a world devastated by corporate greed and baked dry by the harsh sun, the only entity capable of feeding the populace when the government collapsed was an agribusiness conglomerate known only as The Farm. Years later, The Farm has relocated the people they deem useful to resettlement communities where they control every aspect of their lives. Where their tenants live, what they do, who they can marry, how they dress, and even what they are allowed to eat is all dictated from above. The necessities of life donâ€™t come cheap and continuous debt to The Farm keeps the population in line. In the arid wastelands that remain of North America, failure to comply means reeducation or death.As her sixteenth birthday approaches, FERN KERNER faces the most important pronouncement of her life. When young people reach the age of maturity, the Row Evaluation determines the job they will do for the remainder of their life. As the big day draws nearer, she begins to develop strange new powers.

Confronting dangers and feelings unlike any they have ever known, they uncover the truth about their abilities, and face the consequences of their actions.",
