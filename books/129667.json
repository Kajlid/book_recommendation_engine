  "description": "Kendall and Cruise ignite the pages in the final installment of the New York Times and USA Today bestselling Someone to Love series. Kendall Jordan knows she doesn’t need an elaborate wedding with a Vera Wang dress and a three-tiered cake. All she needs is the love of her life, the hot and romantic Cruise Elton. But she’s been dreaming of a picture-perfect wedding since childhood, and so with her finances in peril and a rock band squatting in the Elton B and B Kendall must take extreme measures. She decides to pen a book about the kinky sexcapades of one Penny Whoredon and one Cruz Belton, but in order to do the writing justice she’ll need to conduct some sexy research with the love of her life. It looks like Kendall might just pull it off—but when her protective older brother and Cruise’s jealous ex-girlfriend get involved, tempers and insecurities rise, threatening not just her dream wedding, but the possibility of having a wedding at all.",
