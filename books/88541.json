  "description": "[Siren Allure: Erotic Paranormal Romance, werewolves, HEA] Janos Farkas is one of the Princes in hiding. His parents were murdered in a revolt that was brought about because of greed. It isn't until he meets Mina Tremayne that he realizes that sometimes accepting the help of the Packs that swore their allegiance to the Crown and his family isn't such a bad thing. Mina was completely alone in the world, her every action carefully taken into account so that there was no misstep that would send her failing miserably and landing on the streets, or worse. It is by total happenstance that she walks into Janos's world, a cracked keg of beer being the catalyst that will send her carefully shaped world into complete chaos. To him she is a thing of beauty, pure in her mind and soul. To her he's the man of her dreams and is the only one that can shake up her well-ordered, if poor, life. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
