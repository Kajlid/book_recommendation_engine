  "description": "Six months ago, Tom Halliday left his job. Two days after that, his wife left him. Now, with his mother seriously ill, he is forced to return to his childhood home and rejoin the family he has worked to avoid for the past twenty years. As the weeks pass and his mother’s condition continues to worsen, secrets are revealed and longstanding grudges resurface within the Halliday home. But by re-examining their shared histories and the status of each tattered relationship, the family begins to reconnect in moving and unexpected ways, and Tom is finally able to make sense of the mess his life has become. From the author of ‘Hunger for Life’ comes a smart, funny and emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, friendship, family, and the ties that bind – whether we want them to or not.",
