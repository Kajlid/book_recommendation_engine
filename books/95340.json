But with only half of the legend in her possession--the other half disappearing years ago--everything around her is mired in secrets and mysticism.If the legend is real, it lies waiting for Anna, and has brought her here to the Faeran Valley, haunting her, pursuing her with its curses, with its ribbons of shadows and hope.",
