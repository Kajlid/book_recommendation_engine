  "description": "Every man has a little beast inside ... every woman longs to tame him. Where will you be when the beast roars for you? Bad Moon Rising: Dey has a taste for ancient treasure--Keg is the one assigned to guard it. Ancient ziggurats protected by forgotten technology are no match for Dey, but Keg is one challenge she can't dismiss. Sexy and irrepressible, Keg doesn't understand why the woman in the pink snakeskin jacket and sassy ponytails would swagger around with a gun. The conflicting signals of full lips, sweet curves and a yen for danger make other men wary, but he finds it an irresistible attraction. What better way to keep her out of trouble than to make her his own? Ghost in My Heart: The quintessential geek, Vana had never had a lover. The ultimate warrior, Dagon had never had a wife. Thanks to a rift in space, she's about to become both. Rating: Contains graphic sexual content and mild violence.",
