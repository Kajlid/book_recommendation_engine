  "description": "Jackie, Jayne and Gina - three of the 'Tattoo Girls' - were having a night out and unwinding after a long hard week. The club was getting rather crowded but Jackie could still find the handsome stranger by the pool table. She looked him up and down as he bent over to make his shot, the jeans fitting like a glove but when he stood and turned to make sure his friend had seen the shot, her jaw almost hit her shoes. Tapping Gina on the shoulder as they walked by, she said, “Look! Look! Three o’clock at the pool table, buns so tight you can bounce a quarter off them. And check out that...hello!” She hated to sound so adolescent about the whole thing but it was a rare sight. It was the male equivalent of wearing a low-cut shirt to reveal cleavage, and she appreciated someone who used what they had to their advantage.  Back at their table Jackie turned to her friends. She asked, “So, what’s the biggest you’ve ever had?”  Jayne blushed.",
