  "description": "Southern Investigation is the story of four Vietnam Veterans who form a private detective agency in order to stay together in a society which isnâ€™t quick to accept its returning war veterans.One afternoon, David and Bill, two of the four partners, while returning to Clinton, Alabama, from Atlanta, stop at a convenience store. Three would-be robbers enter the store and fail to notice them in the back of the store getting coffee. The partners stop the hold-up, killing two of the perpetrators. However, David is seriously wounded. Bill elects to take David to the hospital in Clinton, their hometown. At the top of Lookout Mountain, David is beginning to lose consciousness when the CB radio in the Jeep springs to life and Bill hears, \"Viper One, this is Greyhound One. How do you copy?\" Within seconds, an Army helicopter lands in the middle of the highway. An Army nurse stabilizes David, and he is transported to the hospital in Clinton on board the helicopter. The nurse and crewmen take David into the emergency room, turn him over to the duty doctor, and immediately leave. A few weeks later the mystery Hueys and their crew rescue Bill, David, Shirley, and Robert from another jam. This time they tell the partners their story: explaining that they are prisoners in Vietnam and have been for almost twenty years. They tell the partners how they are able to be in two places at the same time, but add that the ability to do that cannot free them. The partners of Southern Investigation devise a risky plan to break them out of their prison, and Vietnam, and return them to the United States.",
