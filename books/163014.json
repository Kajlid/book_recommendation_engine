  "description": "War pigs. Road savages. And the crumbling asphalt of the open highway.  After nearly four years, the zombie epidemic has almost burnt itself out. Gus’s new life on a communal farm is peaceful. The daily routine of policing the fields is rarely disrupted by straying undead. His drinking binges are over. Long days have thrown time over the memories of Annapolis.  But this will all change.  When Gus is asked to search for a group of missing scavengers, he reluctantly agrees. What he finds is a new predator unleashed upon the land, one determined to harvest every last mortal life…  And feed it to a ravenous machine.",
