  "description": "Bianca has seen a grisly murder take place. The housekeeper was killed in cold blood when Bianca was babysitting Little Katie, the rich infant in the neighborhood on Saint Simons Island. She cannot remember the details of that night, though she saw the face of the killer. Two years later her memory is starting to come back. Is the killer the young man she has come to love in the meantime, upon whom she completely depends? The choice is increasingly clear --- her love or her life.",
