  "description": "\"If you had asked me about myself a few weeks ago, I would have told you that I’m your everyday, girl-next-door, struggling to pay off student loans working in a job I hated. Sounds pretty normal, right? That was before I started working for Mobius, Inc., when my whole world turned upside down. \"Why? Shortly after starting work at Mobius, I began seeing “force lines,” strange energy-filled cords floating through the air. Unfortunately, no one else seems to be able to see them, or store the energy inside them like I can. Now, I find myself being chased by a deranged fallen star, watched over by a seven foot tall leprechaun with a penchant for Guinness, and occasionally conversing with an inanimate fossil suspended in the lobby at work. Needless to say, I feel anything but normal.\" ------ Force is a lighthearted fantasy, following Alexis Warren as she tries to make sense of the mixed up fairy tale that finds her working side by side with wizards, shape shifters and even gods. As the world forgets about the myths which society was built on, the power of them wanes; while many immortals accept this natural progression, some cannot, and they seek out alternative power sources.",
