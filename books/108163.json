  "description": "As a teenager Alexis Carter enjoys the thought of men, with many men going in and out of her mothers’ house unannounced; it’s no secret that men are on the top of Alexis’s to-do-list. But when an innocent game of truth or dare between her female friends uncovers more than just a few truths, Alexis Carter quickly finds out that her curiosity for women would unfold into a surge of feelings for which she never knew existed. Will Alexis Carter continue in her lustful pursuit of women as a young adult? Or would she decide to take the road of faith and follow after a path of righteousness for her souls’ sake? Alexis Carter is Dying To Be Straight! Too and it might just take an act of God to lead her and guide her on the path of heterosexuality. What would you do if the feelings you once knew to be so--- wrong, now made you feel so right? How would you react if your sexuality was under attack?",
