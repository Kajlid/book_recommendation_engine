  "description": "Neville Goddard was one of the most gifted and yet most underrated spiritualists and mystics of his time. His books \"Power of Awareness\" or \"Prayer â€“ The Art of Believing\" belong to the best books spiritual readers can find. And so are his lectures. In words very easy to digest and going straight to your heart and soul he shows the way to your own consciousness, to your own new and unique way of living your life from today onwards.Every lecture is only a few pages. Yet they are more powerful than a book with thousands of pages. Read them in a few minutes before you go to bed or use them at your own discretion whenever you need Neville's words to continue your daily habits and work.I have been sent to tell you of a power of which you may be totally unaware. To tell you that you do not need any social, intellectual, or financial background to achieve your goals. Do you realize you could be number one in the social register, have the intelligence of an Einstein and the money of a Rockefeller - yet not reach your objective? And you can have none of these things, yet fulfill your every desire if you will but believe me.",
