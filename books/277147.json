  "description": "Celebrate the joys of motherhood with this gorgeous Mother's Day gift edition of the modern picture book classic! Mums everywhere will understand the plight of poor Mrs Large. All she wants is five minutes' peace and quiet away from her boisterous children! So, taking refuge in the bathroom, she fills herself a hot, foamy bubble bath and takes in a tray of her favourite breakfast and the morning paper. But there's never a dull moment with the Large family, and it soon becomes clear that mum's quiet time is to be very short-lived! Family life is beautifully observed in this warm and funny modern classic from Jill Murphy. \"If you are not familiar with these stories, you really have not lived ... you just couldn't get better\" Guardian",
