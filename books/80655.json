  "description": "After being dumped the day before her wedding, Leigh stopped believing in 'happily ever after'. She moved forward, picked up the pieces, and decided that having a physical relationship with her brother's best friend, Jax McKay, would be the perfect way to jump start her new single status. She knows he doesn't do commitment, and that's exactly what she needs.Jax had always thought of Leigh as unobtainable. Not only was she his best friend's little sister, but until recently she was spoken for. When she propositions him, he devises a plan to make her his, even though he knows sheâ€™s only looking for something temporary.Will he be able to keep her for always, or only For Now?*~*For Now will be \"New Adult\" and probably won't be 'appropriate' for readers under 16... unless your mom is like mine and spoon fed you Harlequins in Junior High. True story, that really happened. :P",
