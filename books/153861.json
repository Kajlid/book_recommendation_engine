  "description": "This Amazon Kindle eBook is a near-exact reproduction of the title authored by the greatest escape artist born yet, magician Harry Houdini, in 1907. Born on 24 Mar 1874 in Budapest, the author moved to the USA in 1878. Starting out as an ordinary magician, he took Illinois by storm by performing his handcuff act in 1899. Within months he became known all over the USA. The rest is history. In this volume, Houdini demonstrates with pictures, the various methods of undoing locks, handcuffs, straitjackets and kindred devices. He travels to various countries of the world and takes on the greatest performers in his sphere, of many lands. The man whom no lock could restrain wrote this book at the young age of 23. He wrote one before and five later and was also a very capable and unbiased author in his own right.",
