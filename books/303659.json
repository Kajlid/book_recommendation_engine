  "description": "Sofia My entire life had been planned from the moment I was born maybe even until the day I die. Of course, that's what it's like when you're the princess of the Mexican cartel. Valentin was perfect at first, until he wasn't. One split second wrecked my entire world . . . and suddenly being away from him was the only thing I wanted.I was never told love could be so deceptive, but here I am, reaping what I've sewn. Deceptive Love is the first book in a prequel duet by Elizabeth Knox, featuring the Volkolv and Mackenzie crime families. Deceptive Love is extremely triggering, and it is only recommended to read if you have little to no triggers.",
