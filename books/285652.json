  "description": "Salmek has always known she has an important role to play in keeping our world safe, ever since she was given her powerful rose quartz crystal in another dimension. Back then, she didn’t understand the vast and mysterious energies of the world – or herself. Gradually, the true significance of the Earth’s sacred sites, different cultures and how we are all connected have been revealed to her. She’s met fascinating children and elders from all over the world who have shared their ancient knowledge and supported her Journey through the Chakras , enabling Salmek to gradually come into her own personal power. She has learnt more than any school teacher back in Glastonbury could ever have taught her. In the culmination of The Rainbow Serpent Trilogy , she and all the other chosen children are called upon to use their healing knowledge in the ultimate showdown with the followers of The Dark Serpent. Although they know what they must do, the enormity of the challenge feels overwhelming as the time draws closer. Can 7 children from around the world defeat The Dark Serpent who is intent on destroying everything? If they don’t, what will be left of Mother Earth? This is the third and final book in The Rainbow Serpent Trilogy.",
