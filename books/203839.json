  "description": "\"A swicked adventure that will leave you smiling and wanting more.\" -HM Ward, New York Times Bestselling Author There are no minor gods. I thought things were strange already, but it got even weirder when golden, robotic women kidnapped us. They're strong, swift, shiny, and made from pure 24 karat gold. These chicks could bench-press a dump truck. Things are looking less mythical by the moment. If this is all true, and I really am a Greek goddess, it means I have to figure out how to fight the biggest, baddest monster ever. Walking into an epic battle of the gods is not a priority, but it seems I don't have a choice. Suckage.I should have taken ninja classes, because I'm totally screwed.Genre: MG/YA Paranormal Contemporary Greek Mythology Adventure Type: Novella, 3 of 6Length: Approx. 100 pgs ea.",
