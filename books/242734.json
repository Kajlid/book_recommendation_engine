  "description": "Christmas is just around the corner and the streets and people of New York are bustling with holiday cheer. Well, everyone except me. After years of working retail, I’ve had it just about up to my neck with tacky holiday ornaments and the cringe-worthy jingles that blast on repeat throughout the Bloomington’s department store. I’ve grown to resent the holidays, and am looking forward to the calm of the New Year. I think it’s safe to say, I just really hate the entire season. To top it all off, my boss tasks me managing this year’s Christmas display. A display, he says, that should to be new, innovative, and needs to rival our competition and impress the shoppers beyond measure. I might as well have died and gone to hell. But things look up when a brilliant idea strikes me, and my best friend Lucy and I decide to deck the Bloomington halls with a sexy and spicy holiday surprise. A surprise that, turns out, perhaps wasn’t all too appropriate for a family-oriented department store. Now, not only am I in deep Christmas shit with my boss, but go from bad to worse when two men claiming to be elves show up to bring me to the North Pole. Surely the stress of the holidays has finally made me crack.  The Naughty List is a fun Christmas-themed reverse harem serial. New installments coming every week until Christmas. Celebrate the holidays with Holly and her elves.",
