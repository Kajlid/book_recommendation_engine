  "description": "She's the Domme with a secret...or two. He's the Dom with a twist. Constance Monroe knows the importance of balancing the good and bad in life. As a psychologist and a Mistress, she helps other people achieve what she can't seem toâ€”find happiness. With a full patient schedule, a hectic home life taking care of a depressed paraplegic, and the fallout from neglecting her own needs, Connie is in trouble she can't talk her way out of. The Masters of Avalon take matters into their own hands, determined not to let their friend slip into a place she can't come back from, but the Mistress is just as determined to handle things by herself, her own way, to keep her secrets safe. When Thane Isaacson first lays eyes on the curvy Domme, she stirs something inside him. Given the opportunity to help the Masters on their quest to keep her safe from herself, there's no way he can say no. Wounded from an old accident, battle-scarred and wise beyond his years, Thane's familiar with the undercurrents of turmoil running under Connie's skin. As their bond forms, and trust grows between them, can the Domme submit?",
