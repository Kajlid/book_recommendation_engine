  "description": "A haunting tableau of a lost world...from the author of 'The Hungry Wolves of Van Diemen's Land' comes this unforgettable portrait of an era now lost forever. 'The Thresher' chronicles the 1980s and '90s, as seen through the eyes of ambitious young men who rebel, using the form of rebellion most common at the time: being in a band. No mere exercise in nostalgia, 'The Thresher' is an exploration of the conflict between individualism, nationalism and globalism, and of the role of art in an increasingly sterile and conformist modern world.",
