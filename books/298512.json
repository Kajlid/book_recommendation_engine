Taken hostage by Orion’s elder brother, I come face to face with the most dangerous fate I’ve ever known. Tyr’s betrayal is dangerous not just to me, but to all of Faekind.A wicked plan. A King blinded by hate. A girl with a secret in her blood. There are liars and deceivers all around, and if I want to survive to see the end of this Gods-forsaken war, I’m going to have to draw power from the three people who’ve trusted and protected me for the last few months. There has been enough of this senseless death and bloodshed. If we have any chance of survival, then we’ll need to look for the path of redemption even if it comes from the most unlikely of sources.",
