  "title": "Her 37th Year: An Index",
  "description": "HER 37TH YEAR, AN INDEX is the story of a year in one woman's life. Structured as an index, the work is a collage of excerpted conversations, letters, quotations, moments, and dreams. An exploration of longing and desire, the story follows a moment of crisis in a marriage and in the life of a woman who remains haunted by an unassimilable past. Allan Gurganus called an early version of the work a \"thoroughly engrossing almanac of desire\" when it was published by The Iowa Review.",
