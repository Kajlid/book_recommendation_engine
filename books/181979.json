  "description": "Reminiscent of the early stories of Jhumpha Lahiri and Allegra Goodman, this is an award-winning collection about characters at the crossroads of geography and faith, from a new voice in international fiction.This debut story collection shows the universal longings that diverse cultures share.Travelling from the bustling streets of downtown Jerusalem to the sun-drenched beaches of Tel Aviv to the cold of Canadian wintersThese stories present characters who are all trying to find someone to believe in.In the opening story “Tikkun,” a chance meeting between a man and his wild former lover—now a restrained, Orthodox Jew—sees the couple narrowly avoiding a tragic death, and forever changed by the experience.In “Casualties,” Tsabari shows us one woman’s perspective on Israel’s mandatory military service, and what happens when she begins breaking the rules to serve her own needs.Artists, soldiers, lovers, grandmothers and grandchildren, Christians and Jews and Muslims, struggle to connect across the chasms of faith and identity.Often focusing on the lives of Mizrahi Jews, these stories draw from nationalities as diverse as Russia, India, Ethiopia, Baghdad, and the Philippines.",
