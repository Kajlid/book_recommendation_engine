She's an undefeated sword duelist and risen to underboss in the Shadow Guild, but her family keeps dragging her back to her life as a duke's daughter—and no one will explain why.\nWhat Kita doesn't know is her future was written before she was born.\n\n  When the Commander of the Legion of Yorq arrives to recruit a member of the noble family, Kita's mother informs Kita of her destiny: a powerful role in Arcone, a place Kita's never heard of. This is the opportunity Kita longs for—it will take her far from home and give her protection from her father.\nBut nothing's free.\n\n  To claim her birthright, Kita must win the harrowing Proving Ritual but the deadly challenge may be more than Kita can handle. She would rather die than live with failure. But to win, she may be forced to reveal her darkest secret.\n\nAwards\n\n\nBest Overall -- The Pearl Awards\n\n1st Place Science FIction -- The Lilac Awards\n\n1st Place Science Fiction -- LGBT+ Wattys\n\n1st Place Science Fiction -- The Blue Rose Awards\n\n1st Place Science Fiction -- Eminence Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nAngel of Yorq BONUS STORY NOT INCLUDED!
