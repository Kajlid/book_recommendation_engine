Sinclair Fletcher has rested her laurels on a hundred-year-old spell that makes everyone fall in love with her cooking. The only drawback? They fall in love with her as well. So it only makes sense she doesn't allow anyone to get close, not even mouth-watering SCPO Cole Rodriguez. But when she gets one taste of the sexy sailor, things start to heat up, and he leaves her hungering for more.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations and graphic language.",
