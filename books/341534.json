  "description": "Come back to 1980, to the Northeast of England, and meet David. Some might say he's a strange boy. He's smart, sensitiveâ€”and convinced he has secret super-powers. Life for him and his brother is a constant whirl of would-be step-families and overbearing friends and relations. And even aged ten, he's finding he's not sure what he thinks about girls when 14-year-old John down the road seems so much more interesting.",
