All major governments have been wiped out and the land is now under the control of the company Terrafall.

And can Terrafall really find out who is behind the recent wave of abductions? When someone close to William disappears, he decides it's time to take matters into his own hands. But in a land that is on the verge of tearing itself apart, is it a life worth fighting for? If your world was falling apart, how far would you go to save it?",
