  "description": "Cozy Mystery Adds Herbal Detection to Handwriting Analysis Kat Everitt, the handwriting analysis sleuth, teams up with top herbalists to uncover a killer in “Murder Most Floral.” A bouquet of flowers, and a handwritten note with hidden meaning invade the victims’ homes. The third book in this cozy mystery series again features brain over brawn as Kat races to find the killer of two friends while trying to protect another. The setting in the Pocono Mountains may seem idyllic, but suspects abound and the mystery requires the help of friends to follow numerous paths to find the killer. Handwriting analysis provides leads and eliminates suspects for our sleuth as she examines notes from friends and enemies in this cozy area of the northeast. The meaning behind the flowers adds dimension and sometimes confusion to her conclusions. Who warns with a bouquet of flowers? Handwriting clues reveal characteristics that lead to red herrings as well. Kat keeps the police informed of possibilities while they pursue other avenues to solve the crimes. Typically, Kat doesn’t capture the killer but paves the way for those who do. And so it is in “Murder Most Floral,” though Kat reveals new skills in stopping assailants. As in the first two books of this traditional, yet cozy, mystery series, readers can follow written clues to learn more about the suspects . . . or themselves.",
