  "description": "Antonia is eager to participate in the new peer counseling program at schoolâ€”until she learns the person she's supposed to counsel is Jasmine Luther. \"Jazz\" is anything but Antonia's peer. She's a punker, a druggie, a gang hanger. As their peer counseling sessions progress, Antonia and Jazz discover they have more in common than they could ever have imagined. Can a \"normal\" person like Antonia trust a psycho freaky whacked-out punker like Jazz? Does she dare?",
