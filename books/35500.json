  "description": "Bertolt Brecht's Stories of Mr. Keuner is a collection of fables, aphorisms, and comments on politics, everyday life, and exile. From 1930 til his death in 1956, Brecht penned these ironic portraits of his times as he was \"changing countries more often than shoes.\" An ardent antifascist, Brecht roamed across Europe just ahead of Hitler's armiesâ€”only to wind up poolside in Los Angeles and then interrogated by Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous committee.Bertolt Brecht wrote The Threepenny Opera, Mahagonny, Mother Courage, The Life of Galileo, and many other plays. A major poet of the twentieth century, Brecht also wrote extensively on the theater. At war's end, Brecht became director of the renowned Berliner Ensemble in East Germany.",
