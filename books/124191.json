Kerr's approach to home cooking and to issues of authenticity and cultural borrowing have much more in common with Mario Batali and Jamie Oliver's outlook than with Kerr's 1960s contemporaries. This reissue, updated with an introduction by the Lee Brothers and commentary from Kerr himself will appeal to generations any home cook.A new edition of a beloved cookbook celebrating the classic dishes and witty humor that were signature to TV chef Graham Kerr's \"The Galloping Gourmet.\"",
