  "description": "Jack Cade already has enough on his shoulders with his four brothers, his struggling Wyoming horse ranch, and his adopted mama going through chemo again. He doesn’t have time for a woman, and he doesn’t trust them. But when Everlea Donovan falls into his life—literally—he can’t stop fantasizing about her. Wanting her. But Everlea’s hiding something, always looking over her shoulder, ready to run at any moment. She can’t risk putting Jack and his family in danger, but she’s never wanted anything—anyone—the way she wants him. When she starts feeling at home at Cade Ranch with its wide open meadows and breathtaking mountain views, she begins to let down her guard—to both her heart and her safety—and that’s just asking for trouble… The first book in the Cade Ranch series, BURNED, is a steamy romance about learning to trust and letting love guide you home…Trigger warnings: This book contains subjects of a mature nature and language. Issues of parental loss, abduction, and burn victims may be triggered. But there is a guaranteed Happily Ever After and lots of good ol' down home sexy fun.",
