  "description": "Gather ‘round the fire one and all. Wink out the candles. That creak you hear? Only an old floorboard. The howl in the distance? Only a dog or perhaps the wind. The shadow in the hall? Just a dark cloud racing across the moon. A murder in the cellar you say? Come closer my friends, and let me tell you a story.The Victorian Era and the early years of the 1900s were rife with tales of haunted houses, vengeful spirits, phantom screams, ghostly presences, and frigid chills in dark corners. Newspapers and magazines were filled with both fiction and real-life accounts of gossamer souls lost between worlds. Almost all the great writers of the age contributed a story and some, such as Sheridan Le Fanu, became masters of the art.Firbolg Publishing presents The Gothic Masterpiece Series: Victorian Haunts. This collection features the finest names in Gothic ghost tales. Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, Sheridan Le Fanu, Guy de Maupassant, Thomas Hardy, Elizabeth Gaskell, Ambrose Bierce, and many others offer up bone-chilling encounters with those who should have departed our earthly realm, but refuse to leave. From the malevolent to the bizarre, each story will assuredly satisfy what Virginia Woolf called “that strange human craving for the pleasure of feeling afraid.”",
