  "description": "This edition is out of print. Alternate cover editions can be found here and here.Wearing naught——teeth chattering——trapped in a pit——staring at the moon that never seemed to move——cowering. Weeping. Who were they? What had they done? What did they want with her, a lowly serva?Who, what, what.She wished for an end to her unrelenting questions and she wished, too, for escape before...What they wanted came to her like a zigzagged bolt illuminating the sky. There was no choice—she had to get out, had to flee. She told herself it did not matter the pit was several times her height or that her knees threatened to buckle as she stood, told herself neither was it of consequence that her legs wobbled in getting her to the wall with the most outcroppings. She reached up and began to climb, whimpering each time her fingers gripped the jagged rocks, moaning when those edges cut into the soles of her feet.The pain was unimportant. Nothing compared to what her captors planned.",
