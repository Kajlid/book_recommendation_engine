  "description": "Poppy Benjamin, Media Relations Director of Syracuse's storied NFL team, the Bobcats, fought tooth and nail for her career. Ever since her intern season fifteen years ago, it's been nothing but early mornings, late nights, barely dodged inappropriate advances, and relationships lost with boyfriends who didn't get it. That's why Poppy relies on the Women Against Groping Shitheads (WAGS), a support network that knows her far better than her own family. In-house counsel for an NBA team, a celebrated reporter—all the WAGS are high-ranking women in sports who need a release from the indignities and frustrations that come with navigating the ultimate boys’ club. But on the same morning that Poppy’s legendary head coach is found dead in his home, five notes ordering members to \"tell the truth or pay the consequences\" hit the WAGS like 300-pound linebackers. Who's aware of the little group they've tried to keep under wraps, and what reason would they have to threaten it? As long-buried secrets are brought to light, Poppy is forced to revisit a dangerous mistake from the start of her career that puts everything she's built at risk.",
