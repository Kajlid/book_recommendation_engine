  "description": "One of Annie's oldest friends has come looking for her—and what's more amazing is that she's found her Denise is the ultimate party girl, and she is determined to bring her old friend Annie out of her shell. Mitchell is delighted, but George really thinks the last thing they need to do is to go out and meet new people. Annie and Denise throw themselves into organizing a Bingo night at the local sports hall—after all, it's for charity, and what’s not to love about having a good time? But why is Denise back in town? Why have Bristol's vampires suddenly started hanging around wherever they go? And why does George get the feeling that Bingo night is going to go horribly, horribly wrong?",
