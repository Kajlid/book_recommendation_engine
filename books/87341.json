  "title": "Flight to Eden",
  "description": "Civilization is advancing rapidly, the world population burgeoning. Satan has caused the fall of man and now wants complete control of earth. His chief problem is the annoying line of humans descended from Seth. They insist on honoring the Creator. His other problem is the prophecy spoken in the Garden of Eden. There's a Redeemer coming who has the power to \"crush his head\" and ultimately defeat him. Satan is determined to stop this from happening. Knowing the Redeemer must be born of a human to be truly both human and God, Satan initiates a grand scheme to pollute the human bloodline and prevent the prophesy from coming to pass! Based on Genesis 6, this story will inspire readers as it transports them to an ancient time in the development of Christ's lineage! Download the Readers' Guide.",
