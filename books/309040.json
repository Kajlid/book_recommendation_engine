  "description": "She’s fought me for ages, and I won’t keep holding myself back. HammerOver the last couple months Rosa’s past has stirred up a lot of trouble for the club, but that won’t stop me from fighting for what I want, no matter the cost. Shiloh and I have been beating around the bush for ages and considering everything that’s happened I know one thing for sure--there’s no time to be wasted. I want her and she’s always kept me at arm’s length, but I’m not an impatient man, I’ve waited, and I’ve waited, and I’ve kept waiting. But I won’t keep doing so.We all watched and saw how Axel and Rosa have turned their relationship into something else, and it’s given me enough courage to finally risk fucking my friendship up with Shiloh. I doubt it’ll happen, but it’s the excuse she’s been giving me for years. Now she can’t say jack shit to me about denying what we’ve both made clear we wanted, if the timing was right. There’s no better time than the present, but just like Rosa, Shiloh has secrets she hasn’t told anyone about. When her mother rolls up to the club and tells her she needs to come back home for a few weeks to help with her step-father’s campaign, I see a totally different side of her.I see the way her body runs cold and the fear taking hold of her. But what shocks me the most is when she agrees. It put me in a position I never thought I’d be in. I don’t want to leave Montana with the club shit going on right now . . . but there’s no way in hell I’m letting her go by herself. I’ll show Shiloh I’m the type of man who will treat her like a queen, and in the process I’ll face her demons by her side.",
