What do you do when that man is the son of your best friend? If you're Doctor Joe Pressman, you fight it like hell before succumbing to the once in a lifetime feeling. Incoming freshman Rocco is more of an artist than an athlete which doesn't sit well with his father, Coach Collin Williams. When his dad kicks him out, Rocco runs to the one place he knows he'll be welcome, right into Joe's open arms. Just when they thought their lives couldn't get anymore complicated, a situation on campus puts their love in the centre spotlight. Will the attention cement their relationship or drive them apart?
