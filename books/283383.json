  "description": "I never had a thing for football players. That is, until I met the three of them.  I normally don’t like college parties. I only went that night to keep my roommate company. Yet when the sexiest, most muscular man I’ve ever met started flirting with me? Well, let’s just say I didn’t go back to my dorm room that night.  But the devilish rogue who took me home isn’t just another student. He’s Danny Armstrong, the star quarterback of the football team. And getting into my pants isn’t the only thing on his mind.  He and two of his teammates need a physical trainer for the season. Someone to monitor their workouts and help them avoid injury. And as a kinesiology student, I desperately need the work credits that come with the job.  Danny Armstrong, the clean all-American with a steel jawline and sexy blue gaze. Lance Overmire, a goofball wide receiver with washboard abs and an “I just thought of a dirty joke” grin. Fernando Martinez, the dark-and-handsome place kicker from Chile who pronounces my name like it’s an exotic meal.  I’ll be working with them every day for the fall semester. Watching them lift weights in the morning, monitoring football practice in the afternoon. And giving them far more specialized physical therapy in the evenings. Can I be the physical trainer that helps them go to the playoffs? Or will they end up falling for me along the way?  \nFULL CONTACT\n is a scorching, stand-alone reverse harem love story filled with humor, suspense, and excitement. HEA guaranteed!",
