  "title": "Taking Up Space",
  "description": "A groundbreaking exploration of the problems of diversity in education, by two extremely talented young graduates.\nAs a minority in a predominantly white institution, taking up space is an act of resistance. And in higher education, feeling like you constantly have to justify your existence within institutions that weren't made for you is an ongoing struggle for many people. Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi, two recent Cambridge graduates, wrote Taking Up Space as a guide and a manifesto for change: tackling issues of access, unrepresentative curricula, discrimination in the classroom, the problems of activism and life before and after university. Featuring honest conversations with students past and present, Taking up Space goes beyond the buzzwords of diversity and inclusion and explores what those words truly mean for young black girls today.",
