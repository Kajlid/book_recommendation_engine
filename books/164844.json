  "description": "Emma had wanted a break from everything so she decided to move out of town to the ranch. The last thing she expected to find in her new life was romance.\"That was it...Emma had decided she had enough of the city life. This was the third time in two years that the loft had been broken into. It was time to pack it all up and start over...The money she came into, through a good investment would allow her to take a couple of years off and just do her thing. This was the perfect time to start..she was sick of her job at the newspaper..she had no partner, so there was nothing to hold her back. except her fear of the unknown. She had hooked up with this realtor named Amber a couple of weeks ago and Amber called the other night raving about this old farm house she had found for sale...said it would be perfect for her...just what she was looking for. \"",
