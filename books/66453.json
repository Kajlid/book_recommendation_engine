  "description": "In, this fun children's book, Astro’s Rampaging Rats, Melbourne City Airport is being destroyed by monster rats. People think dogs are responsible so Astro and our valiant team not only have to destroy the rats, but they also have to find out who created these terrible creatures and clear the name of The Organisation. If they don’t the strong bond that exists between people and dogs may be ruined for all We won’t find out how Indy stopped a dog-eating crocodile or why there’s a dog that thinks his name is Stop It! Astro is a grey shaggy dog who works for a secret organisation that exists without detection and operates right under our very noses. Its sole purpose is to save dogs from neglect. It is manned by a tunnel digging terrier who carries a diamond encrusted nail file. A large dog for which the complexities of door handles are a complete mystery and who, instead, opens everything with his head. As well as, a commando, khaki wearing Blue heeler who is armed with a hunting bone and a smell grenade. And that’s just to name a few!",
