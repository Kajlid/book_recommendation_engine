  "description": "Inaction Man lives as a bum on the streets of Paris defending humanity against the forces of evil. He possesses the gift of sight, allowing him to see things that aren't really there, aided by the consumption of copious amounts of methylated spirit vision juice. He also exploits his superhuman powers of inaction, which enable him to do nothing for a very long period of time.Together with his assistant, a broken bicycle called Symbol, and the worldâ€™s second great superhero, the Illogical Woman, he fights action with inaction. Watch him battle the dark pan-dimensional forces that surround us. From shape shifters masquerading as park attendants, to changelings who wear the skin of junkies, to vampire sewer rats and crack dwelling spectres. Only Inaction Man stands between us and the dark lords who wish to end time and space.A must read for all mortals. Let Inaction Man help you to escape the fatal fog of routine and stop your innards being ossified.",
