  "title": "Pathology of the Elites: How the Arrogant Classes Plan to Run Your Life",
  "description": "In this bracing collection of provocative essays, the author examines the false benevolence that characterizes the power classes in contemporary America. While they tragically conceive their desire for authority as a form of virtue, the elite classes have set about remaking schools, rewriting the U.S. Constitution, dehumanizing charity, and making war on tradition in the name of a crude form of Social Darwinism.",
