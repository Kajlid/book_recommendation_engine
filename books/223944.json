  "description": "Hannah wants to relocate herself and her cat, Jimi, to the countryside of Calgary. So, when she finds a turn-of-the-century home in a small town at a good price she jumps at the opportunity. Shortly after she moves in, strange noises, disturbances, and slamming doors hamper her efforts to make any changes in the house. Jimi starts acting odd, and the disturbances only increase in intensity. But, Hannah is no quitter, and by talking with long-time residents of her town, and with the help of a psychic, Hannah pieces together the tragic story of her resident ghost. By understanding why the ghost is unable to let go, Hannah comes to terms with her inability to let go of her own heartbreaking past. Will this new home and its non-corporeal occupant be exactly what Hannah needs to move on and find new love?",
