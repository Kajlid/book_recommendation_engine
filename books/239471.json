One rash decision forced them apart.Abi Sinclair is a determined social worker and committed party girl. But underneath the bravado and empty one-night stands, she’s hiding a broken heart… Jamie Dawson is Abi’s lost love, the only man who’s ever made her feel alive. When he left two years ago to take care of his terminally ill mother, they agreed to communicate only by letter, both believing their love was meant to be. Suddenly, Jamie is back, and he’s Abi’s new manager. Only, he’s a different man—too different. Desperate for answers, Abi must decide: is the love she and Jamie shared worth the risk of permanent heartbreak? Or can they recover what they lost all those years ago?This novel is a second-chance-lovers-reunited contemporary romance. It also contains strong language, mainly from Abi. She can’t help it. Jamie is guilty too, particularly when passion gets the better of him. This is the second book in the Music and Letters series but can be read as a standalone with no cheating or cliffhangers.",
