  "description": "The million-copy French series makes its English language debut! Meet two wonderful young girls who happen to be sisters-Maureen, and her older sister Wendy. Both are full of personality and a strong sense of independence. So while they may love each other with all their hearts, it's not always easy for the two of them to be together. After all, when kids are still very young, age differences are much more meaningful. While Maureen may want to hang out with her older sister, nothing could be more embarrassing for Wendy. See how despite all odds, they still manage to get through each day without killing each other... well, at least so far!In addition to the main story, this volume features great backup features including the \"Guide to Sisters\", Maureen's journal entries and much more!",
