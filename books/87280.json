  "description": "It's her last semester at Davis, an HBCU, and Kelly is looking for love in the most likely place. Or so she thought. It proves to be much more than she bargained for after being dumped by the last good guy on campus. For someone who appears to have it all together, she's quite a mess in the male department. And like most women, she doesn't know who to blame: herself or the men? She's attempting to do what some see as the impossible. She's attempting to find a man without lowering her standards or sacrificing her wants. Kelly's relationship with her suitors, brother, best friend, professor, friend's boyfriend, and father all help bring her to womanhood. The Men I Let Define Love is Kelly's love story. She just thought there'd be more romance.",
