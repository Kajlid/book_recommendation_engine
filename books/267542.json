  "description": "\"I'm not going to die.\" That was the promise Estelle's cousin demanded, before he shot himself. Because of his sacrifice, she had enough food to get her boat to land, even if on a deserted island. Because of her promise, she learned to survive, enduring for years under the unforgiving sun. But when an Islander refugee and a handsome warrior appear and Estelle's new world shatters, she has to face the demons of her past: her marooning–and thus, her cousin's death–were arranged. By her own family. Survival isn't enough, not now. Now, Estelle wants vengeance. No matter what lines she has to cross along the way.",
