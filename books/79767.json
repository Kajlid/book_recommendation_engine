  "description": "The Valentine Grinch (Novella)  Hearts, cupids, and diamond rings!  When Amanda Goodwin returns to Cranberry Cove for her grandma’s wedding, all she wants to do is forget about cherubs and chocolates and men who had crushed her heart.  Until, that is, she encounters long time friend, Dane Weatherby.  Amanda hasn’t seen Dane since high school, and the nerdy boy she remembers has grown into a hunk of the worst kind…the kind that makes her want more than his friendship.  So what’s a girl to do when she’s stuck in the middle of all this Valentine-induced romantic madness? Escape back to her lonely life in the city or dive headfirst into the craziness?  Fortunately she’s not in this alone. And if Dane has his way, he just might convince Amanda to say I do instead of bah humbug.  * * *  Special The Valentine Grinch novella was originally published in the WG2E All-For-Indies Viva La Valentine Edition.",
