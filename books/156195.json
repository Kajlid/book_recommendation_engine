But its the outlaw life we chose. It was a choice we all made, and I wouldn’t fuckin’ take it back. Not ever.Until she walked into my life and made me second guess everything, I have ever known. She is an angel, and I am tainted in darkness.She is pure perfection, and I am stained and bloodied.I want her, but I know I will never have her.I just hope that I can come to terms with the fact that she belongs to someone else, and there is nothing I can ever do about it.My name is Ryker, and this is my story.",
