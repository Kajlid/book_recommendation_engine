  "description": "It can’t get much worse than finding your fiancé banging his secretary over the back of your couch, right? Wrong. Try discovering your unforgettable, dirty talking, arrogant as f*ck one-night stand is your new boss. The same man that you hate with a fiery passion but your traitorous body refuses to read the memo. I’ll admit, Liam Maxwell’s cockiness is not unwarranted—in the bedroom or the boardroom—but I’m a professional. I refuse to let an inconvenient attraction affect my career. I’ll just have to do what I do best: manage the situation objectively. Why do I get the feeling that’s going to be much easier said than done?\n\n\n\n\n*Note: This book was previously published in a boxed set collection under the title, Bad PR. It has since been revised.",
