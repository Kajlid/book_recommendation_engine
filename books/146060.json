  "description": "Building an 101 Solutions to Animal Suffering is a first-of-its-kind, inspiring look at practical solutions for the humane treatment of animals and animal liberation. Animal cruelty has many factory farms, habitat destruction, animal product testing, the abuse and neglect of companion animals, the illegal trade in endangered species, unsustainable fishing, and climate change. All these create unnecessary suffering for animals and destroy animal rights. For several decades there has been a global movement building, an ever-increasing consciousness that will soon affect animal welfare and the future of life on Earth—if it’s given time to do so. Building an Ark is the story of this movement. Extensively researched and drawing on practical examples from around the world, it provides a voice for both the animals and the humans who have dedicated their lives to building a sustainable future for all species. The ark is ready for all to board. Individuals, action groups, schools, businesses, governments, farmers, fishers, developing nations—there’s a role for everyone on this journey. Building an Ark offers a host of solutions that, if adopted, will ensure that animals will suffer less today, and that humans and animals will share a more sustainable planet tomorrow. Ethan Smith is a writer, animal welfare advocate, and author/editor of the anthology Softly On This Joining Those Who Are Healing Our Planet . Guy Dauncey founded the Solutions Project and is author of several books, including Stormy 101 Solutions to Global Climate Change .",
