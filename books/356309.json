  "description": "Dark Horse hits the ground running with a newly expanded and redesigned edition of master storyteller Masamune Shirow`s Dominion. A wild sci-fi police comedy set in a future where the norms are vast, bio-constructed cities, air so foul that citizens must wear masks outside, and a police department that includes a squad of crack tank police! Join Leona, her pet tank Bonaparte, and her lovesick partner Al as they confront the villainous Buaku and his felinoid accessories-to-crime. Leona`s to rescue Crolis, a mysterious green-skinned girl with the power to cleanse the air around her, and the potential to renew the poisoned earth. Added to this edition are Phantom of the Audience, a 1994 Dominion one-shot never before collected in the U.S., and an all-new cover!",
