  "description": "They are known as the Greys. They are fast. Powerful. They blend in with the humans, lest their abilities are discovered and then they become the hunted. The House of Light, the self- righteous avengers of truth and justice, and the sworn enemy of The House of Darkness has slaughtered them to near extinction. Because of an age old prophecy, their ruthless Queen Lucena, sees them as a threat. Humans are caught in between a collision of forces that threaten the very fabric of the veils which separate the supernatural and the natural. A prophecy foretells the future of both Houses, centering on the House of Darkness’ most powerful Dawn Stewart. Dawn is just an ordinary Grey wishing to live an ordinary life -which is impossible when both of one’s parents are legends. Things change as the prophecy begins to unfold, when it is revealed that she is anything but ordinary; and the fate of her race is now in her hands. Aiden has sworn to protect her even if it costs him the throne. The former prince of the highest court of Light has chosen love over duty and will stop at nothing to win Dawn’s heart and keep her alive, even if that means he has to die to do it.",
