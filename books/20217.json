It never seems to matter how much he walks, because his shadow is always there. When he meets younger Valerie, an inquisitive and sensitive soul, a few rays of light begin to penetrate through his dark curtains. But what about her jealous ex? How is it that some things inevitably tie together? And where does one's shadow lead to?\"I have someone new to admire.”—Joe R.
