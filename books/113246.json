  "description": "Emily Masterson needs a place to live. Ryan Walker has a spare room. She’s recently single because her boyfriend cheated her, so when meets Ryan as he’s half naked and surrounded by women, she thinks someone is playing a joke on her. He loves women, he’s never short of beautiful women to take to his bedroom … or living room … or bathroom … or kitchen, so when he ends up living with the one woman that seems disgusted by him, he doesn’t know whether to laugh or curse fate. They don’t get along. They argue about anything and everything, they insult each other at every opportunity and they love nothing better than to mess with each other. When they finally realise how attracted they are to each other, the friction at home only gets worse, at one point no one will even risk knocking on their apartment door. So they’re stuck with each other. With late nights, early mornings, holidays and no one else to spend their free time with, they get to know each other. They find out that they might just have a thing or two in common and sometimes, the best person for you, might be the one who stole the last piece of cake.",
