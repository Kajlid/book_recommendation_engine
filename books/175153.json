  "description": "Pleiade (Addy) Enders has her place among the glittering stars of Chicago… in name only. Despite the fact that she has always dreamt of marrying a baseball player, it seems she’s not really cut out for it. She’d much rather be home watching Shark Week than out hobnobbing with the local celebrities alongside her quasi-famous husband Matt.  No one ever told her what her Baseball Wife dream would really entail while Matt worked his way out of the minors: Addy was too busy coupon clipping and keeping track of Matt’s ERA to carry out her Master’s research on the mating habits of sandbar sharks. Now that he’s in the Major Leagues, Addy longs to have a career of her own. But, after a chance meeting with her college sweetheart Ryan, Addy realizes that she must choose between the vows she made when she married Matt and the promises she made to herself.",
