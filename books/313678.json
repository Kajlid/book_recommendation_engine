  "description": "OUT OF PRINTIn this world, you're either predator or prey. I come from a long line of pure-blood predators, but when my shift finally happened, I turned out to be prey. A bunny to be exact. A freakin' bunny.The guy I'd been promised to since birth rejected me. My own father has turned his back on me - shipping me off to Apex Academy even though it's practically a death sentence with what I am.Oh, and of course, my ex-fiance and his friends are here at the academy and more than happy to make my life a living h***.But then I met my teachers. Five incredibly gorgeous apex predators, each one more mysterious than the last. And all of them, very much off-limits.There is something dark at Apex Academy - something that's killing off students and teachers alike. As prey, I'm afraid I'm the easiest target, but who can I trust to keep me safe?",
