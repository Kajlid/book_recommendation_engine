  "title": "Love Finds You in Poetry, Texas",
  "description": "In the German community of Poetry, Texas, Belinda Bauer spies an opportunity. The tiny town is filled with loggers and railroad men in need of wives, so she sets herself up as a marriage broker. She writes little poems to be printed in newspapers all over the country, and, one by one, women begin to arrive in Poetry. There's only one problem: Belinda doesn't have a clue what she's doing and all the brides marry the wrong men! One client is particularly unhappy. Georg Kaufman, the local barber, has lost more than one prospective wife to Belinda's fumbled attempts. For some reason, she just can't seem to find Georg's perfect match, though it's not for lack of trying. Is there a poetic ending in store for Georg and for Belinda herself?",
