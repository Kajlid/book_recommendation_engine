  "description": "When Alexandria Ray's romance series becomes an overnight sensation, the world and its demands close in on her. After years of struggling to maintain the pace her publisher, agent and the world expects, she needs a break. Enrolling as a student at Columbia University is step one to finding herself again. Finding Arsen Daniel was not on her list. Arsen Daniel, along with his best friend, built an empire in the form of an exclusive, psychology-based dating service. When an old friend invites him to teach a course at Columbia, he accepts. The course? The Psychology of Love. Sounds simple enough and the publicity alone will make it worth his time. Arsen didn't expect to meet his match in the form of a sarcastic blonde, hell bent on holding to her belief that true love doesn't actually exist. After all, what woman, especially a world-renowned romance writer, doesn't believe in happily ever after? Something in Alexandria's eyes tortures him. She reminds him of someone from his past and that is a very bad thing.",
