  "description": "I fell in love with a boy a long time ago.  I was only a small girl. Scared and frightened, I was taken from my home and held against my will. His father hurt me, but he protected me and kept me safe as best he could.  Until I left him.  I ran the first chance I got and even though I knew he wasn’t behind me, I didn’t stop. The branches lashed out at me, punishing me for leaving him in the hands of a monster.  I’ve never felt such guilt in my life.  Although I survived, the boy was never found. I prayed for him to be safe. I dreamed he’d be alright and come back to me. Even as a young girl I knew I loved him, but I betrayed him.  Twenty years later, all my wishes came true.  But the boy came back a man. With a grip strong enough to keep me close and a look in his eyes that warned me to never dare leave him again. I was his to keep after all.  Twenty years after leaving one hell, I entered another. Our tale was only just getting started.  It’s dark and twisted.  But that doesn’t make it any less of what it is.  A love story. Our love story.",
