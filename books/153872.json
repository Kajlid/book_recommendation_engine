  "description": "Armed with a passion for classic B-grade horror movies, a script co-written by his twin brother, and a wicked crush on his death-obsessed neighbor; hardcore horror fan Jason Nightshade must finish his student film.But his plans are derailed when the children of suburban Silver Creek start disappearing – his twin brother among them. Battling a possessed video camera, a crazy zombie dog, a monstrous bully, and a frighteningly broken down family life, Jason embarks on a mission to find his lost brother so the two can write an ending for his story.As an any horror fan knows, saving the day won't be easy, as Jason finds himself forced to face the real world where death isn't just a splash of fake blood on a camera lens.\"Ryan Bradford proves that he’s up to the challenging work of never underestimating young adult readers in their ability to sniff out and reckon with nuance, while never overestimating adult readers, either, for being too wise to remember their youth. Horror Business is for all: a warm outstretched hand, and a chilling reminder.\" ~Adrian Van Young, Electric Lit",
