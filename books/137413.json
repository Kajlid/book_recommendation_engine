The perils he faced over the centuries in search of that love and the crisis of conscience undergone.The Year 1013 AD, Brasov Romania:Count Luca Stefani Dalca was a spoiled selfish individual, who wanted for nothing. He had spent most of his adult life driven by his own sexual desires. Tall and handsome he could have had, and indeed took any woman he wanted, but there was one he truly desired. A young maiden named Larisa. She was like no other the Count had ever known; her innocence beguiled him. He had fallen in love with her on sight. Certain the love of a woman such as Larisa would make him a better person. He finally persuaded Larisa to meet with him and wins her over with his charms. However, their love was not to be and Larisa was cruelly snatched away from him through treachery. A plight which brought to the surface the Count's cold and ruthless nature. Learning that there was a way for him to be reunited with his lost love, he embarked on a journey filled with peril which would mean him having to give up his humanity to succeed. A small price to pay as far as he was concerned. For he was prepared to die or sell his very soul if it meant he could be with Larisa again. A man who previously had no knowledge of the supernatural was about to get an advance course in a world where he did not belong. Nonetheless what is learnt cannot be unlearnt. Luca will use this knowledge and his new found powers of immortality in search of Larisaâ€¦ into the 21st Century.",
