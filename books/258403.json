Against his better judgment he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare. What he finds there will change Mack's world forever.In a world where religion seems to grow increasingly irrelevant The Shack wrestles with the timeless question, \"Where is God in a world so filled with unspeakable pain?\" The answers Mack gets will astound you and perhaps transform you as much as it did him.
