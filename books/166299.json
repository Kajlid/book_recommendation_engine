  "description": "They look, smell, sound, and act just like human males: only they're not: they're so much more... they're cyborgs! and when we say \"no strings attached\", we mean it! Hire one of our studly cy-males for sex, without any of the worry or usual risks. no diseases, no pregnancy, no commitment, no strings: perfect for birthdays, bachelorette parties, extramarital sex without guilt, recreational sex, as well as escort needs for weddings, dinner, and business functions: our cy-males are so realistic that it is impossible to distinguish them from a living, breathing human being: we guarantee it! Some clients even completely give up on dating humans after experiencing the benefits of being with a cy-male.After seeing an unusual help wanted ad in the paper, Amy and her friend sign up to be part of a test panel for the new cyborg sex workers. A busy medical student with no time for real dating, she figured ‘why not’? It’s any girl’s dream, right? Still, she is a bit apprehensive about the whole thing. Not only has she not had sex for over a year, but she is about to have it with a robot. She debates whether that is just too weird, too desperate.But if Amy allows herself to go through with it, she will have the opportunity to experience every different kind of sex from a wide variety of men, or rather, cyborgs, for eight weeks. They each have their own looks and ‘personalities’ to appeal to different tastes. However, when she discovers this for herself, is she instead at risk for losing herself to their charms and, as a result, forgetting their main purpose? They are designed for sex, not for love. So then, why does it seem Amy has more feelings for one of them than she has felt in a long time for a regular guy?",
