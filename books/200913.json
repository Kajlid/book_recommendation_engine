  "description": "In India, the life of women has never been easy by any stretch of the imagination. Swati's Marriage and Other Tales of India brings their eternal struggles to a new audience by engaging the subject head-on through the eyes of young women in the 21st century. Western audiences may have assumed that such considerations as dowries, arranged marriage, and abuse of spouses, servants, and the elderly would be tempered in the age of social media.\"Fans of Masterpiece's Indian Summer and the stories of Ruskin Bond will welcome this female perspective on modern-day Indian life. These short stories are full of epiphanies and restrictions that remind one of James Joyce and Katherine Mansfield's work and show how little the human experience changes, despite cultural differences.\" -- Tyler R. Tichelaar, Ph.D. and award-winning author of Narrow Lives and The Best Place",
