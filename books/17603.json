  "description": "The popular Demo Tapes series continues with The Demo Tapes: Year 3. It's the same format you've come to know and love: short fiction previously posted on The Meet and Greet at West of Mars, and intros to each that let you, the reader, look into the mind of the author and creator of the indomitable Trevor Wolff. Trevor and his best friend Mitchell Voss are in fine form in these stories, first published online between March 2008 and April 2009. From Thanksgiving to Halloween and a few new characters who help round out The Musical Hanukkah Celebration, we once again get to watch the guys go from kids into the men who ride the wave of being rock's biggest band: ShapeShifter.",
