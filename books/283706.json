Welcome to senior year ... \"One day, I'll destroy you, inch-by-gold-digging-inch.\"That's what the boy who'd introduced himself as Kade--just Kade, like he was the second coming of Jesus--said right after I tossed his drink order in his face. My outburst cost me my summer job, but it was worth it. Standing up to an arrogant bully always was.At least ... that's what I thought until my first day at Lancaster Academy.I already knew I wouldn't fit in. I mean, in the elite world of one-percenters, I stuck out like a narc in a trailer park. I just never figured I'd start senior year with a target on my back.Remember Kade? He's not only here, but he's one of the three legacies that dominate the halls of this school. Filthy rich and stunningly gorgeous, they're gods among mere mortals. Royalty. What they say goes, and my name?It's already on their lips.These boys want my submission, my degradation, my very soul--and they're determined to bring me to my knees before they run me off for good.Too bad they don't realize I've never been the one to kneel.*** WICKED LEGACY is a full-length dark reverse harem, high school bully romance. It is book one of three. Contains cursing, sexual situations, and other mature themes. Reader discretion advised.",
