  "description": "“Normal people don’t have control over anything. And they only affect some things. We affect everything, and we have control over most things. But it comes with a price.”Peter Alexson is an average high school student—until he wakes up in a ditch surrounded by the dead bodies of his friends and his head filled with voices, so very many voices. So Peter does the only thing he can do. He runs.He runs right into the path of Joshua Jones, who looks twenty-two but was born in 1899, who can dissolve the windows in a high-rise with the touch of his hand, who can disarm a bank robber with a single thought, who can bend the whole world to his will if he chooses. Joshua can teach Peter what the voices mean and how to use the energy that comes with them, but Joshua has spent more than three decades running from the evil in his own past.Together, Joshua and Peter must find how to harness their powers to defeat their darker natures, and discover dangers they cannot outrun.",
