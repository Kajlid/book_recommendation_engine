  "description": "What if you could see the angelic or demonic manifestations of people's characters in mirrors? And what if, in your world, this gift was fatal?  Since early childhood, Lexi has repressed a rare ability to See. For most of her life, and from most people who know her, this is a well-kept secret. Raised by a family of mirror-makers, glass-blowers, and wolves, Lexi trains herself to See selectively, plagued by her otherness. She comes of age when the nation's leader bans man-made reflective surfaces, plunging the nation into a dystopia where government agencies annihilate families like Lexi's and redraw the lines of normalcy, tradition, and trust.As her family breaks apart, Lexi falls for a man whose secrets run even deeper than hers. Betrayal and deceit ignite dangerous consequences in a world of blurring realities. Caught up in a battle as old as time itself, the last mirror-maker must revamp a break up into the greatest wake up of her life, embracing her forbidden capabilities in an attempt to rouse her world from darkness. THE WAKE UP is a modern-day parable about love, truth, and self-discovery. It examines how our choices determine the manner in which we live before we die, and how we stop fearing the monsters beneath the bed once we discover them within us.",
