  "description": "Living with Mace is killing me. Can’t eat. Can’t sleep. What could be worse? Losing Mace.The world fell apart after the virus killed billions, turning most male survivors into violent monsters out to destroy the world and everything in it. Shit, I’ve got the nightmares to prove it.Then I met Mace and he changed everything I thought I knew. He’s not a monster, but a wolfman, a hybrid created by the werewolf virus. Mace’s pack have come a long way toward blending what’s left of their humanity with their wolf instincts. Personally, I’m not too thrilled with this whole dominance/submission thing but that doesn’t make them monsters.Unfortunately, not all of them are like Mace. We call the others rabids. Wild and crazy dangerous, most run when they get their asses kicked. We tripped over the one group that won’t run -- and now the real monsters are pissed.",
