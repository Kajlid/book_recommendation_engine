  "description": "Although now better known for her haunting fiction, in the 1950s Shirley Jackson charmed millions with her best-selling domestic reminiscences, Life Among the Savages and Raising Demons, affectionate, hilarious, and sophisticated tales of dubious parental equilibrium in the face of four children, their friends both real and imaginary, assorted dogs and cats, criminal household help, impudent teachers, and other minutiae of domestic existence.In Shirley Jackson's hands the chaos and crises of 1950s Vermont family life become something else entirely, and the two books give further evidence of Jackson's remarkable insight into people -- especially children -- and why they behave the way they do.ISBN 0965780066 (ISBN-13: 9780965780063)",
