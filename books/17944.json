  "description": "In 1855, an ambitious eugenics experiment pits a British craniologist, Dr. Samuel Bates, against his French rival, Jean-Louis Belavoix: two infants, a black boy and a white girl, are raised on a deserted island by a mute nurse and monitored twice yearly. But doubts surface in London about the scientists' real intentions. Eventually, the ferry captain who supplies provisions to the island agrees to help the nurse escape with the children; but, before he returns to rescue them, an \"accident\" turns their reunion into tragedy.",
