  "title": "Shake Like A Mad Drum: The Eternal Friendship of Rumi and Shams",
  "description": "The works of the great Sufi poet and mystic, Jelaluddin Rumi, are perhaps more relevant today than they were in the 13th Century when he wrote them. His greatest inspiration was a vagabond named Shams of Tabriz, of which very little is known, until now. In Shake Like a Mad Drum, Shams of Tabriz speaks for himself. He tells us about his life, his adventures, and how his meeting Rumi changed both of their lives. Rumi also speaks of how his friendship with Shams not only jeopardized his reputation as a great scholar, but forced him to rethink his core beliefs. It was Shams who led Rumi to discover God within himself.More than anything in the world, Rumi and Shams yearned to know God beyond books and dogma. What they found was a new way of looking at life and at themselves. Now they share these experiences that we may expand our perspective of God, and in so doing, discover a life of joyful adventure. This book is a channeled work by meditation teacher John Windwalker, and his student Jamila Hammad, who served as scribe.",
