  "description": "Barbara Bice has a story that needs to be told. On top of that, she has an amazing gift in telling it. Just Right is a realistic and inspirational book about one of the great battles in our country and in most of our families . . . drug addiction. In Just Right, Barbara will walk you through her husband Ed's descent into addiction and her battle to save him, her marriage, and her family. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will learn. You will learn about addiction, how to confront it, and how, by the grace of God, to overcome it. Truly, it is a story that needs to be told and a story you need to read. I have seen firsthand how this story has changed lives. You or your loved one may be the next. When you come to the end of this book, you too will say, \"It is JUST RIGHT!\" Buddy Bell Senior Minister Landmark Church Montgomery, AL After many years of tears, turmoil, and tattered dreams caused by drug addiction, Ed and Barbara's prison turned to passion, their conflicts turned to commitment, and Barbara's unforgiveness turned to forgiveness.â€‚Just Right is a true testimony of faith and hope. Though the road from addiction to redemption was paved with much loss and heartache, God has truly taken what Satan meant for evil and used it to His glory. The words jumped off the page when Barbara said, \"I wouldn't take 'nothin' for my journey now.\" Oh, to have her faith! Al Millergren, Ph.D. Marriage and Family Studies Children and Family Minister Montgomery, Alabama",
