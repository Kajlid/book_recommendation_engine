Wendy settles into an exhausting practice schedule, made worse by strange nightmares, while Gilda finds herself falling in love with a British boy. But when Wendy discovers a ghostly message written in the frost on her window, Gilda realizes her friend’s life could be in danger, and the key to solving the mystery may be in learning the truth behind the untimely death of a previous piano virtuoso.",
