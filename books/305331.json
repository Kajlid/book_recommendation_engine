  "description": "A 40-Year Search for TruthOne bright summer afternoon on weekend errands with his mother, 10-year-old Ronald's faint suspicions that he is adopted are confirmed by his mother's careful, well-practiced announcement of the truth. As a child whose appearance is close enough to that of his extended African-American adoptive family, he has always felt a part of them, but now things make a little more sense, and a 40-year odyssey of seeking his genetic truth is triggered. The formative years of spiritual training by his Baptist Minister grandfather return to steady him as he is confronted by startling revelations of his birth-parents' past and his abandonment at a Detroit hospital shortly after birth. Spitting Image is a sweeping saga spanning hundreds of years that results in the creation of one unique human being who against all odds survives them to deliver a message of faith and great hope. Are you ready for the truth?",
