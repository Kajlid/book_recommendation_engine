  "description": "A Reaper who doesn’t reap is like a custard donut without the custard. Pointless.Between getting my ass kicked by Azazel in the training room, avoiding Conah, and verbally sparing with Mal, I’m beginning to get a feel for what it means to be a Dominus Reaper.The guys might not think I’m ready to get out and do my job, but I have a team of reapers relying on me, and I’m not about to let them down.Leadership? No problem.Teamwork? Bring it.It’s time to jump into the fray.While the guys track the Dread who attacked the Academy, I’m forced to work alongside Grayson, the Regency pack alpha, to investigate a missing persons case involving vamps.The alpha is stubborn, bossy, arrogant, and sexy as hell. I’m torn between kissing him and punching him. But when he’s taken by the bloodsuckers, there’s no doubt in my mind that I need to get him back. Even if it means venturing into forbidden territory to do it.Death awaits with fangs and claws, but I’ll be damned if I let it walk all over me.Here’s to hoping I keep my head.",
