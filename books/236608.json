  "description": "From dream to reality…  Margo Menlove adores everything Scottish. But when she wins a Highland vacation, she’s disappointed by the whirlwind tourist trail she’s taken on. She wants to experience the Scotland of warriors such as legendary Magnus MacBride. When she explores on her own, she picks up a beautiful stone on the shore – and awakens to the sight of MacBride himself in the heat of battle.  Magnus MacBride has seen many things while fighting the Viking hordes, but when a soaking-wet naked woman appears out of the surf, he is truly stunned. Even more stirring is the passion he hasn’t allowed himself to feel in all the years he has lived only for vengeance. But giving in to his wild desire would place Margo in mortal danger – unless they stand together and fight for the love neither can endure without…  “Heated Romance, Scottish allure, and a hunky Highlander hero… a delight!” ~ Romance Junkies",
