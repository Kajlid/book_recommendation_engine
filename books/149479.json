  "description": "ðŸŽ§Listening Length = 15 hours and 37 minutesIn Ian Caldwellâ€™s masterful follow-up to his international sensation The Rule of Four, a lost gospel, a contentious relic, and a dying popeâ€™s final wish converge to send two brothersâ€”both Vatican priestsâ€”on an intellectual quest to untangle Christianityâ€™s greatest historical mystery.Ten years ago, Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomasonâ€™s The Rule of Four became a literary phenomenon that earned comparisons to Umberto Ecoâ€™s The Name of the Rose and Donna Tarttâ€™s The Secret History. Hailed as \"ingenious...profoundly erudite\" (The New York Times), \"compulsively readable\" (People), and \"an exceptional piece of scholarship\" (San Francisco Chronicle), it spent forty-nine weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, sold nearly two million copies in North America, and was translated into thirty-five languages around the world. Now, after a decade of painstaking primary research, Ian Caldwell returns with a new intellectual thriller that confirms his place among the most ambitious popular storytellers working today.In 2004, as Pope John Paul IIâ€™s reign enters its twilight, a mysterious exhibit is under construction at the Vatican Museums. A week before it is scheduled to open, its curator is murdered at a clandestine meeting on the outskirts of Rome. The same night, a violent break-in rocks the home of the curatorâ€™s research partner, Father Alex Andreou, a Greek Catholic priest who lives inside the Vatican with his five-year-old son. When the papal police fail to identify a suspect in either crime, Father Alex, desperate to keep his family safe, undertakes his own investigation. To find the killer he must reconstruct the dead curatorâ€™s secret: what the four Christian gospelsâ€”and a little-known, true-to-life fifth gospel known as the Diatessaronâ€”reveal about the Churchâ€™s most controversial holy relic. But just as he begins to understand the truth about his friendâ€™s death and its consequences for the future of the worldâ€™s two largest Christian Churches, Father Alex finds himself hunted down by someone with vested stakes in the exhibitâ€”someone he must outwit to survive.At once a riveting literary thriller, a feast of biblical history and scholarship, and a moving family drama, The Fifth Gospel is a novel about the depths of sacrifice and the power of forgiveness. Rich, authentic, erudite, and emotionally searing, it satisfies on every level.",
