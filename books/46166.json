Kale, rescued by three high school students and nursed back from the brink of death, is given the chance to experience life as a human. When the other Galdoni are threatened, he has to use what he learned in the world outside the Academy to face the Arena and return to the human girl he loves. Dark and exciting, Galdoni pushes the boundaries of love in a world of violence.",
