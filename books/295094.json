  "description": "EVIL INCARNATE OR ANGEL IN DISGUISE?Tory Wells arrived a Sundance Ranch with only her battered suitcase, little more than two dollars and a letter from a friend, promising her employment. An Olympic-class diver recovering from knee surgery, Tory desperately needed this job and though the owner was an angel to be giving it to her. But Ethan Reever was no angel. With his dark presence, cold gray eyes, and explosive temper, he could be only one thing - the devil himself. Tory was in dire straits, but she would never ask Reever for anything. Not a job. Not a bus ticket. Not money, and most definitely not for his love.",
