  "title": "The REAL Poop!: A Cassandra Matthews Adventure",
  "description": "Poop! Nine year old Cassandra Matthews couldn't believe that it all came down to poop...in this case, pigeon poop. Cassie's feelings had flown as high as the birds that she fed and photographed when her project won first place, only to come crashing down...just like the bird feeders she now had to take down, and all because of poop. And all because of that nasty Stephanie Bartwelle too. Stephanie had been incensed that she was only a runner up, and she'd vowed that she'd find a way to take Cassie's spot on the TV show...the prize for first place. Cassie hadn't believed her, after all, how could Stephanie prevent her from feeding and photographing the birds in her back yard until the show came to town? Well, Stephanie had found a way. The city had a bylaw against feeding pigeons, and now the big bird feeders had to come down, even though other birds and animals used the big feeders, not just pigeons. Cassie knew she had to find a way to fight the bylaw, and save her spot on the show, but even more importantly, to save the birds and small animals from starving over the long cold winter. Can a 9 year old fight injustice and pigeon poop prejudice? Maybe with a little hellp from her friends...and a giant poodle named Boo.",
