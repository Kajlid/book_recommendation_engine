  "description": "Hunter Happa-Hewitt’s life has never been more stressful. With his divorce behind him, he thought that life with his five-year-old son would be easier. But now his father is in the hospital and has asked him to take his place as the CEO of Gleam Enterprises, a part that he has no interest in playing. Hunter is about to refuse when he suspects that his father’s accident perhaps wasn’t really an accident at all. Now, he will do everything in his power to learn the truth.  No one is more surprised than Sam Cosi is when she finds the sexy billionaire in her office, asking for her help. Although this isn’t her usual MO, Sam can’t say no to the job—or the man. But working alongside Hunter proves difficult, especially as she can no longer hide her feelings for him.  Can love still bloom in the midst of mystery? Or will their love run out once they discover the truth that binds them?",
