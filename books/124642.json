  "description": "The Morphodite by M.A. FosterHow do you destroy a conspiracy without making waves? Because every such underground movement has a key person, the subtle way is to remove that keystone and watch the rest of the organization fall apart.Their world was ultra-conservative, isolated, opposed to change. Their secret police had tried many means to keep it that way. Now they had contrived their cleverest secret weapon. This was a genetically-patterned, laboratory-raised human genius, the Morphodite.The Morphodite needed no computers to detect the key to any conspiracy -- the know-how was structured into his/her brain. The Morphodite needed no assistance to make a foolproof escape after such an assassination. The know-how was built into his/her body.But the Morphodite had one defect its \"gestapo\" parents had not planned. He/shecould think for itself And its thoughts were total subversion.",
