  "description": "***Newly edited and re-released edition***Sagely has no idea that supernatural beings exist, let alone that she's in danger from a powerful dark warlock. That is, until sheâ€™s attacked and mortally wounded. That tips her off pretty quick.Luckily for her, a sexy warlock from the nearby coven saves her life by transferring some of his magic to her. Not so luckily, the \"gifted\" magic turns Sagely into a witch herself. The magical powers aren't bad, and the fact that she gets to choose a collective of supernatural men to protect her has a certain appeal. But being a witch is not all brews and broomsticks. Magic comes with deadly consequences, especially for someone who has just a *bit* of trouble controlling her impulses.Just when Sagely gets a handle on her magic, the unthinkable happens. The coven discovers the legendary art of void magic locked inside Sagely. And suddenly, every supernatural creature in the world wants a piece of her.***This is a slow-burn Reverse Harem series of FULL-LENGTH novels set in the 80's, suitable for ages 16+.If you're more of a OTP (one true partner) kind of reader, you might try my Girl Among Wolves trilogy, set in the same world, in modern times.",
