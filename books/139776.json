  "description": "90-year-old Esther Carey lives alone with fond recollections of her husband Hugh, who was killed during the second world war. The chance discovery of an old letter shatters her tranquility. Helped by a keen young lawyer, Esther learns that Hugh bigamously married an Italian woman, Luisa, in 1935. Luisa later emigrated to America, where she died in 1981. It seems Esther's investigation has ground to a halt, but a faint hope remains. Luisa's body has undergone cryonic suspension; perhaps in 100 years scientists will be able to revive her. To uncover her husband's secret life, Esther too must take an uncertain leap into the future.",
