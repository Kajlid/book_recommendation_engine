  "description": "Described by the author as \"a little nightmare produced by the unaccustomed high-living of a brief visit to Hollywood,\" THE LOVED ONE is an outrageously comic novel of the commercialzation of death itself. This book is not only satire at its most ferocious. It is a macabre frolic filled with laughter and ingenious devices.",
