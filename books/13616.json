He's engaged in a constant tug o' war as both his lovers compete to win his affections. Only, Lucerne's not so eager to choose. Matter of fact, he's beginning to wonder if he's not the one that's being left out, considering the effort Vaughan and Bella pour into tormenting one another.When the three lovers attend a society music recital, jealousy again rears its head, which convinces Lucerne that it's time to take matters into his own hands. The decision doesn't go down at all well, particularly with Vaughan, who shows his displeasure by dishing out erotic punishments to both Lucerne and Bella. However, the tug o'war isn't over until there's a winner, that is, unless the lovers can put aside their differences and decide that all three can have the passion and satisfaction they derive only from each other, no matter which one of them is in the middle!
