  "title": "The Cephas Code of Christ",
  "description": "The Bible written by over forty authors took over four thousand years to complete. Then in 1227 and 1551, Stephen Langton and Robertus Stephanus, two revered and distinguished gentlemen who lived over three hundred years apart, inserted into the script of the Bible the chapters and verses that we know and use today. Wherefrom and how they got the numbers remains a mystery. It has always been assumed that these numbers are random and purely for the convenience of Bible readers — that is, until now.The Bible chapter and verse numbers are not only inspired, they are Jesus Christ's own creation that have gradually, stealthily, systematically, and for over seven centuries been carefully crafted into the Bible to form part of the Seven Seals of the Book of God seen by Saint John in Revelation 5:1. This Numeric Scripture sealed inside the Bible is the conclusive and written proof of God's existence written by God Himself.The Cephas Code of Christ reveals the Cephas Code 16∓3, also known as the Sign of Jonah, that was promised by Jesus to the Pharisees and ultimately unveils the redeeming six-word message from God to mankind divinely wrapped within the twenty-five-word Golden Verse of JOHN 3:16.This book just about wraps up the Bible.",
