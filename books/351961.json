  "description": "You can read about Maria Anne Hirschmann's amazing life in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia, her blind devotion to Hitler and the atheistic Nazi system. Her story will take you through the horror of World War II, her escape from the Communists, her chance at romance, and the reawakening of her love for Jesus Christ. See the United States with Maria's eyes when she immigrates to this country with her small family. Through it all, you will see the hand of God. This commemorative edition includes a new chapter updating Hansi's life as well as photos not included in the first editions. Go with her to Belarus as she finds a new calling from God. All proceeds from this re-release will go to help the Believers in this former state of the Soviet Union.",
