Business booms, supplying him with thousands of dollars of tax-free cash per week and the connections to experience South Beach nightlife as a VIP. Cameron raises the stakes, signing up hundreds of customers and taking on a group of jet-setting international bettors. As his operation grows, so does his ego. His stormy relationship with Grace Cooper, the purity ring-wearing daughter of a prominent Republican Party lobbyist takes its toll on the business, and his business partner's reckless lifestyle threatens to bring him down completely. High Rollers gives a window into lifestyles of the young and rich, exploring the consequences of ambition, wealth and relationships.",
