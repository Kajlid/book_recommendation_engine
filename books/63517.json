  "description": "Professional historian-hero and time-traveler Alex Balfour returns in the most exciting of his critically acclaimed adventures. This time he wakes up literally in the middle of the Civil War. And this time, he’s not the only one traveling through time. Last seen falling asleep on a small Japanese island shortly after Hiroshima, Alex, a twenty-first century New Yorker, awakens between a Rebel stand and a Union charge led by George Armstrong Custer. Wounded by crossfire, Alex is taken to a makeshift hospital, but not before he witnesses the gruesome murder of a helpless soldier long after the fighting has ceased. Meanwhile, in present-day New York City, Alex’s girlfriend and intrepid Times reporter Molly Glenn loses her way chasing a story and winds up in the thick of the Civil War herself. As Alex tries to make sense of the murder and Molly, in cumbersome crinolines and petticoats, tries to make headway against prevailing male attitudes toward women, they meet such historical figures as Abraham Lincoln, Sidney Lanier, Ambrose Bierce, and Walt Whitman. Confronting hard-hitting historical truths, exploring moral dilemmas, and packing page-turning adventure, In Time of War continues the timeless series beloved by legions of fans.",
