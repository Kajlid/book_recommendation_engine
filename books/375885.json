  "title": "The Heidi Chronicles: Uncommon Women and Others & Isn't It Romantic",
  "description": "The graduating seniors of a Seven Sisters college, trying to decide whether to pattern themselves after Katharine Hepburn or Emily Dickinson. Two young women besieged by the demands of mothers, lovers, and careers—not to mention a highly persistent telephone answering machine—as they struggle to have it all. A brilliant feminist art historian trying to keep her bearings and her sense of humor on the elevator ride from the radical sixties to the heartless eighties. Wendy Wasserstein's characters are so funny, so many-sided, and so real that we seem to know them from their Scene One entrances, though the places they go are invariably surprising. And these three plays— Uncommon Women and Others , Isn't It Romantic , and the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Heidi Chronicles —manage to engage us heart, mind, and soul on such a deep and lasting level that they are already recognized as classics of the modern theater.",
