  "description": "Demon SeedOnly a sacrifice will appease the overlord that has banished him from the only world he knows. And yet almost from the moment he captures Colette, Nuri is captivated and can think of nothing but possessing her himself. Innocent in her desire, and desperate to save herself and her younger sister, Colette tempts Nuri beyond caution, drawing his overlord's wrath down upon them both. Rating: Contains explicit sex and language, bondage, oral sex, sexual mastery. Belly of the BeastLady Mariel has no clue her life is forfeit until the Trull, Behsart, comes to collect her to take her to the Castle Valdamer to be sacrificed to the demons. She has only one ally-Cavan, Lord of Reugal, whose body the lesser demon, Behsart, occupies. Her only weapon is the one Behsart has given her--his lust for her. Each time he succumbs to carnal pleasure, he grows weaker and Cavan grows stronger, but time is not something she has in plenty. Behsart is to take her on pilgramage to each of the seven demons so that they may sample their bride. If she can not escape Behsart, or please the demons and convince them that she is worth more to them as a concubine than a sacrifice, her spirit will be yielded up to them for eternity once she has reached the Castle Valdamer. Rating: This is an almost no-holds-barred BDSM erotica. Contains explicit sex and language, some F/F scenes, multiple partners, bondage, domination/submission, anal sex, oral sex, sexual mastery as well as a subplot of romance.",
