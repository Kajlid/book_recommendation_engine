  "description": "Madalyn Walker was a gorgeous brunette therapist in Seattle who went out to tease and please with her pretty redheaded friend Debra Zale. A handsome mystery man seduced them both and before the limo even stopped the sensual ride of their lives had started. When they gave up hope of seeing him again, his gift to the redhead Debra had the beautiful Maddie Walker green with jealousy. Then she too received a gift from him, and when he showed up in the lovely therapists office as a patient, her life changed and her magical mystery tour started. The playboy without a name knew how to give private treatment to Madalyn Walker that made her wonder if she had been hypnotized, and the therapy she received was equal to what she gave. Then things became serious and Madalyn Walker began to learn from and expert what desire was all about.",
