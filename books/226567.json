  "description": "Jason Emory has one motto: play hard, love hard…and win at all costs. It doesn't matter if he's on the ice or playing the field, his only goal is to win. For a life goal, it sounds pretty good. So why does he feel like he's drifting aimlessly instead of having the world at his feet? At least, that's what it feels like until one hot night with a beautiful stranger who seems oddly familiar—a stranger he can't forget.  Megan Bradley loves working at her parents' bar. Why shouldn't she, when that gives her a chance to see her long-time crush up close and personal? Not that Jason knows who she is. Why would he, when she's nothing more than a modern day ugly duckling swimming in a sea of glittering swans? At least, until her best friend hatches a plan for an extreme makeover.  All she wants is one night to never forget—but sometimes getting what you want isn't what you need. Can she walk away from the connection that should have never happened? And what happens when it's time to face the truth—especially when she realizes that one sexy hockey player will stop at nothing when it comes to winning?",
