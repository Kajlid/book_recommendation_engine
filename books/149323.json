  "description": "Deep within a Colorado cave, a teen drifter discovers an arrowhead shaped crystal harboring an evil sentience. Acting as the crystal’s host, the boy is endowed with psychic powers and extreme rage. He embarks on a cross country mission, eager to exact revenge for crimes committed more than a century ago; able to track his intended victims through a biological conduit. Caitlin Diggs became the FBI’s top agent by being brazen and unconventional, but her experience and training had not prepared her for this new enemy, a murderous teenager whose twisted union with a crystal has spawned a biological internet threatening all of humanity. A trail of bodies leads Agent Diggs to a terrible conclusion; to halt the murders, she must take control of the crystal herself. But Diggs is not herself. Plagued by nightmares of her partner and lover’s murder, she has revenge issues of her own. Can she come to terms with her vengeful lust and stop the killer? Or will she be lured into the crystal’s blood web?",
