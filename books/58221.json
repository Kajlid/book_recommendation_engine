  "title": "The Stone Roses: And the Resurrection of British Pop",
  "description": "The first biography of the seminal band that was the catalyst for the resurgence of British pop in the 1990s. In The Stone Roses, John Robb ``The Roses were the legendary band of the late 1980s. They changed British pop by putting a cool street band back into the mainstream; they made pop and guitars cool again. When they put out `Fool's Gold,' they virtually invented the perfect 1990s pop record.'' The book looks back to where the band came from, their roots in post-punk youth culture, and their seizing of the moment in the post-acid-house fallout as they took first Manchester, and then Britain, on a swift, swaggering pop adventure that promised so much, yet ultimately burned out. John Robb looks at the glorious late 1980's rush of Manchester street life that was soundtracked by the Roses and copied by a nation. Just as importantly, he examines the impact on the lives and tastes of Britain's youth and the hundreds of bands that followed in the wake of this astonishingly influential band. 256 pp 6 x 9 18 b/w photos",
