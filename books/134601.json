  "title": "Start A Home Cleaning Business",
  "description": "Author Amber Richards owned and operated a single person home cleaning business for three years. She shares tips and advice she wishes someone had shared with her before starting up the business. With transparency to both mistakes and successes, this e-book is packed with useful information and strategies from someone who actually worked in the business.  The emphasis is not focused on practical cleaning tips, although there is a chapter about products in general.  This book is perfect for someone who is thinking about starting a house cleaning service, as well as someone who already has one started, yet wants to grow and expand their business. It offers many creative ideas to help pinpoint where exactly you want to go in that business, marketing ideas, and gives 'out of the box' suggestions to help hone your home cleaning business to your individual needs and circumstances.",
