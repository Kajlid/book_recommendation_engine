  "description": "Being bonded to a peevish adolescent wyvern can be pretty irritating, and Conner Stonefield wants nothing more than to ditch his dragon and get back to his simple life. But he soon discovers that the dragon may be the only one on his side. While human and dragon struggle to find common ground, word reaches both the Harmonic and Anarchic orders of the first human-dragon bonding in over five hundred years, and an urgent race to find the pair begins.Meanwhile, Princess Veressa finds her bond, but her connection with the animal is stronger than she could have imagined, and the future that's revealed to her in a vision veers far from the path she is expected to take. When tragedy strikes, Veressa is faced with a host of new responsibilities, and she must find the courage and wisdom to begin making difficult choices.Unforeseen circumstances force Conner and Veressa to cross paths again--this time resulting in a connection that will prove anything but fleeting.",
