  "description": "No celeb was spared during the writing of this tongue-in-cheek stroll down the red carpet of fashion, fame, ego, and blinding glitter. Written by the man who isn’t afraid to tell Christina Aguilera her hairdo is a disaster, Red Carpet Diaries could make you feel you know more about Hollywood shtick than Nicole Kidman’s stylist. If you begin to get too much pleasure from Cojocaru’s lizard-skin-jumpsuited journey from ridiculed misfit to #2 on Cynthia Rowley’s speed dial, put the book down and turn on an episode of Antiques Roadshow to calm your heart rate.Imbued with style that is pure Steven, and packed with insider gossip from a man who spends his days chatting with the stars, this irresistible memoir is a peek behind the glamorous façade to the real deal—the dirt beneath the red carpet.",
