  "description": "Run little squirrel...\nZeus...She can't hide from me. I caught her fair and square... Now Lucy is mine!I want to mark her all over, so every time she looks at herself she'll think of me. Her every breath, every cry, her every moan of ecstasy belongs to me. By the time I am done with her, she will no longer be able to deny me! I want her every thought, to fulfil her every need.I want all of her, and I don't plan on letting her go...Not until I have taken her body and soul. Not until I own her thoughts, know her feelings, can intuit her every move!I intend to give her so much pleasure... so much pain, that it will wipe out everything that came before!She is mine to take, to ruin, to do with as I want!So what stops me from having my way with this wisp of an omega who dares challenge me?Precisely nothing!",
