  "description": "Girona, Spain. 1353. Struggling to save his patients from the plague, and avoiding the even greater danger of his wife's temper, Isaac discovers that pestilence isn't the city's only killer. A nun dies in the public baths. Then it is revealed that she is not a nun at all, but an attendant to the queen in nun's disguise. The Bishop of Girona calls upon Isaac to help determine the strange circumstance of her death--and the purpose of her deception. But Isaac soon finds himself and his family caught in a tightening web of royal intrigue designed to destroy the Spanish monarchy--and whoever else gets in the way...   * First in an all new medieval mystery series * Fans of The Name of the Rose will love it * Fantastic advance praise from acclaimed authors Bruce Alexander and Candace Robb",
