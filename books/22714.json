Cogan incorporates all pertinent materials from the debate on the ratification of the Bill of Rights. Arranged in chronological order, the work presents each clause in its finished form, and traces its development from its origins.

He includes data from diaries and correspondence, pamphlets and newspapers, as well as the Congressional debates. He publishes, for the first time, each version of thedrafts from the manuscript collections of the National Archives and Library of Congress. The result is the most detailed and useful record of the debate over the Bill of Rights available.Including the correspondence of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and John Adams among many others who debated the issues that the Supreme Court considers law today, The Complete Bill of Rights is the first and only comprehensive collection of texts essential to understanding theBill of Rights. Organized in an accessible and practical manner, it is an invaluable tool for law students, judges, lawyers, and law clerks, as well as scholars of the law, history, and political science.",
