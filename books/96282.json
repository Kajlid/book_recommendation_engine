  "description": "After a series of shattering losses, all Jackson Sansbury wants is solitude. Hoping to escape his tiny hometown of Trinity Falls, Ohio, with its concerned neighbors and painful memories, he's purchased a secluded cabin resort and thrown himself into renovating the property. He doesn't expect any distractions—until an unlikely guest arrives—a woman who hasn't roughed it a day in her life, yet whose fearlessness just might be contagious. . .A successful songwriter, Los Angeles native Audra Lane has come to Harmony Cabins to recharge her creativity. She's not looking for company, but she does need a guide—and she can't help noticing the sexy, albeit grumpy, Jackson. Soon she discovers that this insightful, private man has more to teach her than how to hike and fish. And as Audra inspires Jackson to express his emotions, the two find themselves falling in love. But neither can hide in the woods forever—and when the past brings challenges, their newfound strengths will be put to the test. . .",
