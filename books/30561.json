Celia treats him as a family friend and nothing more-until they share a heated kiss beneath the mistletoe... Celia is shocked by the passions that surge within her at her dear friend's kiss. One touch and one taste aren't enough to satisfy her cravings, and she is startled into action. Damien has stirred something inside her that she never expected to experience again, and she must have more. Full of shameless desire and emotions newly discovered, she decides to pursue Damien and won't be deterred. Will she be able to convince him to stay-both in her heart and life-forever? 20,000 words",
