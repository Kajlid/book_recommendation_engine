  "title": "Neil Young: Don't Be Denied - The Canadian Years",
  "description": "One of rock music's most fascinating personalities, Neil Young has persistently charted his own career, ignoring pop fashions, creating innovative music ranging from folk classics like \"Heart of Gold\" to rock and roll anthems like \"Down By the River.\"Don't Be Denied charts Neil Young's formative years, from his high school days in Winnipeg, Manitoba through his adventures in Toronto's Yorkville district to his ultimate successes with Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, and as a solo performer. When asked by biographer John Einarson why so little is known of his Canadian years, Young replied, \"No one ever asked me!\"Revised and updated by the author in 2012, Don't Be Denied also includes over 40 rare photographs from Neil Young's early days, from 1960 thru 1987.\"Neil Young has been an inspiration to musicians and non-musicians alike. He can be truly called the voice of his generation...Neil, just by being himself, has forged a style and identity like no other. His voice and his guitar playing are instantly recognizable anywhere in the world.\"-Randy Bachman\"I learned a lot from Neil. He impressed me so much as a writer, as an artist, as someone to work with. I have such fond memories of what we created together, the five of us in Buffalo Springfield. He's a neat guy - he really is.\"-Richie Furay",
