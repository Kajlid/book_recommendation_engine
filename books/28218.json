  "description": "Once upon a time, after a particularly weird day, I muttered to myself: life is a haunted safari. I never really knew what that meant, but it sounded right.Welcome to the Haunted Safari (previously known as Blinky & Sal). Here you will discover a cartoon realm full of gods, monsters, bats, beavers, depressed narwhals, cranky hole-dwellers, and other such inky, crusty critters. Thatâ€™s how we like it around here.",
