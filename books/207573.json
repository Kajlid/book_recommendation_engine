  "description": "Welcome to the luminous world of The Ghost in Love. A man falls in the snow, hits his head on a stone curb, and dies. But something strange occurs: the man doesn't die. And the ghost that's been sent to take his soul to the afterlife is flabbergasted. Going immediately to its boss, the ghost asks, What should I do now? And the boss replies, We don't know how this happened, but we're working on it; in the meantime, we want you to stay with this man to help us figure out what's going on.The ghost grudgingly agrees. It is, after all, a ghost, not a nursemaid. But a funny thing happens—the ghost falls madly in love with the man's girlfriend, and things naturally get even more complicated. Especially when the man discovers why he did not die when he was 'supposed to: because, for the first time in their history, human beings have finally decided to take their fates back from the gods. It's a wonderful change—but one that comes at a price.The Ghost in Love is about what happens to us when we discover that we have become the masters of our own fates. No excuses, no outside forces or gods to blame—the responsibility is all our own. It's also about love, ghosts that happen to be gourmet cooks, talking dogs, and picnicking in the rain with yourself at twenty different ages.At once otherworldly and deeply heartfelt, The Ghost in Love will haunt you with its breathtaking originality, its brio, and its wise soul.",
