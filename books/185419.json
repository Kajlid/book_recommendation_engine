  "description": "At one point in time, Charley Lane ran barefoot in the orchards surrounding her grandfather’s old farmhouse. She picked berries that stained her fingertips purple and lay on her back among the hops, marveling at the vines reaching heavenward and wondering about the giant who might live in the clouds. Many afternoons had been spent tending the hops with Gramps and brewing beer in the barn. Now, ten years later, 519 Copper Drive looks nearly identical to that image she carries with her from childhood, but one thing is missing as she returns as an adult: Gramps.Her intent is to sell the farmhouse, but as Charley spends time in the home, surrounding herself with memories, she finds herself unable to part with the magical structure… for the farmhouse is magical. Its floor plan, unlike other architecture, isn’t static. Rooms come and go; its layout is constantly changing.It doesn’t take long for the farmhouse to charm Charley and change her plans. She realizes she wants to honor both her grandfather and the memories of her childhood by turning the farmhouse into a brewery. Charley recruits the help of Juli Singer, Lake Caywood’s musical handyman, and Addy Birch, a troubled teen, to manifest her vision for the farmhouse. As she grows closer to Juli and restores her relationship with Addy, her old fears start creeping back. Although Charley doesn’t want to hurt anyone again, such an outcome is inevitable.",
