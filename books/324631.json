  "description": "The latest novel from Orange Prize finalist Xiaolu Guo is the enchantingly comic story of a young Chinese woman’s life as a film extra in hyper-modern, turbulent Beijing. Though twenty-one-year-old Fenfang Wang has traveled 1,800 miles to seek her fortune in urban Beijing, she is ill-prepared for what greets her: a Communist regime that has outworn its welcome, a city in slap-dash development, and a sexist attitude more in keeping with her peasant upbringing than the country’s progressive capital. But after mastering the fever and tumult of the city, Fenfang ultimately finds her true independence in the one place she never expected.At once wry and moving, Twenty Fragments of a Ravenous Youth gives us a clear-eyed glimpse into the precarious and fragile state of China's new identity and asserts Xiaolu Guo as her generation's voice of modern China.",
