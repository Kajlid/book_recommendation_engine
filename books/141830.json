  "description": "New Version with Active Table of Contents!Tristan of Parangor fights his crown prince brother’s ignorance and godlessness until he is swept a hundred miles downriver and a world away from his royal life to the tiny town of Larcondale. Forced to make a living and wait for the Lord’s time to return home, Tristan becomes a farrier, teacher, and encourager to the town’s minister and all its people. Idolatry and occult forces make Tristan’s struggles heavier but he finds friendship and budding love as he works and waits. A seemingly insurmountable tragedy presents Tristan with an opportunity to increase his power to do good. Day by day he struggles to learn the lessons God has to prepare him for the moment when the past and present collide and Tristan must return to his kingdom. He has no idea that he will face old enemies and find unexpected friends.Psalm 33:16There is no king saved by the multitude of an a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.“Do not continue to oppose me, prince,” Shneea warned. “This man you have loved since childhood will die here, and he will only be the first.”“I have no choice but to oppose you,” Tristan said. “You feed off innocent men’s flesh.”“You will submit,” Shneea said. “You and I shall wed, or I will destroy you without touching your body. Prince Tristan will cease to exist.”“How can you do such a thing?” Tristan was baffled.“Do not tempt me to show you,” Shneea said. “Marry me, handsome prince.”“It’s impossible,” Tristan gritted. “You have a husband, and I have a wife.”“My husband will be dead almost any moment,” Shneea laughed. “But you have got yourself a wife, have you? The marriage will be annulled.””I have no desire to be rid of my wife, nor to wed you.”",
