  "description": "Callan O'Rourke is doing a favor for an ex fling. Pick up her new ward at the train station and drop her off. No biggie; Callan's no one's idea of an errand boy, but he figures if he doesn't do it, the poor kid might end up stranded there all night, since his ex bed warmer was a cold hearted witch. From the description she gave, he's expecting a homely country hayseed. So imagine his surprise when the new ward turns out to be a stunning beauty who makes his body heat up with just one look, and bring thoughts and desires long dormant to the forefront. In that first meeting he sees her for exactly what she is, everything he's ever wanted in his life, and in his bed.",
