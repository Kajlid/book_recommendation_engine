  "description": "Finding your eternal soulmate - easy.Stopping a true-love-hungry evil - not so much…After breaking a centuries-old romantic curse, Emma Connor is (almost) glad to get back to normal problems. Although... it's not easy dealing with the jealous cliques and gossip that rule her exclusive Upper East Side prep -- even for a sixteen-year-old newbie witch. Having the most-wanted boy in school as her eternal soul mate sure helps ease the pain... especially since wealthy, rocker-hot Brendan Salinger is very good at staying irresistibly close…But something dark and hungry is using Emma and Brendan's deepest fears to reveal damaging secrets and destroy their trust in each other. And Emma's crash course in überspells may not be enough to keep them safe...or to stop an inhuman force bent on making their unsuspected power its own.",
