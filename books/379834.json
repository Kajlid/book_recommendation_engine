  "description": "The day after a weekend with Terence McKenna, I was offered DMT by a woman I’d never met…“If you are looking for something different, try Ian Winn’s debut novel… It has all the travel fiction requisites in spades: trippy drugs, local eccentrics and dirty dreadlocks, as Winn recounts his journey from the pyramids of Egypt to the beaches of Goa with crazed enthusiasm and humour.” — The Sunday Times“Inventive, brilliantly realised characters… the book displays a rampant thirst for mysticism and self-discovery. One cannot help being won over by Winn’s enthusiasm and intellectual energy.” — The Times“Strangely gripping.” — The Scotsman“If you meet a man named Ian Winn at a party, make your excuses and run.” — The Big Issue“I loved (this) book. Could not put it down until I finished it. This novel runs perilously close to pornography, shocks, startles, pushes to the limits of decency. But the most startling thing of all is that it conforms to the age old prophesy that the second coming of Christ will come when and where you least expect it. I am not concerned with the idea that the second coming will be an actual person (I doubt if the first coming was an actual man) but will be a new kind of consciousness breaking in on mankind.” — Robert A. Johnson, Jungian analyst and best-selling author of He, She, We, Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche and Inner Work: Using Dreams and Active Imagination for Personal Growth",
