  "description": "Here for your delectation is the SPECTACULAR AND RARE--------------Kids Say the Darndest Things by ART LINKLETTER, ILLUSTRATED BY CHARLES M. SCHULZ OF \"PEANUTS\", INTRODUCTION BY WALT DISNEY............Arthur Gordon \"Art\" Linkletter (born Gordon Arthur Kelly, July 17, 1912 â€“ May 26, 2010) was a Canadian-born American radio and television personality. He was the host of House Party, which ran on CBS radio and television for 25 years, and People Are Funny, on NBC radio and TV for 19 years. Linkletter was famous for interviewing children on House Party and Kids Say the Darndest Things, which led to a series of books quoting children. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1942. .................... This is the softcover stated CARDINAL EDITION FROM SEPTEMBER 1961. Other than slight yellowing from age, the binding seems fragile because of the glue used by the publisher---and a couple of pages need to be taped. The book (no dj) is in excellent reading condition. There are no rips, tears, markings, etc. (see photo). ** All books listed as FIRST EDITIONS are stated by the publisher in words or number lines--or--only stated editions that include only the publisher and publication date. Check my feedback to see that I sell exactly as I describe. So bid now for this magnificent, impossible-to-find HUMOR COLLECTIBLE.",
