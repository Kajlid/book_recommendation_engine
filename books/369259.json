  "description": "Book 3 of the beloved Poldark novels, which are the subject of a major new series on Masterpiece™ on PBS® Ross Poldark faces the darkest hour of his life in this third novel of the Poldark series. Reeling from the tragic death of a loved one, Captain Poldark vents his grief by inciting impoverished locals to salvage the contents of a ship run aground in a storm-an act for which British law proscribes death by hanging. As Ross is brought to trial for his involvement, his wife Demelza tries to rally support to save him and their family. But plenty of enemies would be happy to see her husband convicted, not the least of which is George Warleggan, the powerful banker whose personal rivalry with Ross threatens to destroy the Poldarks, including their newborn son, Jeremy. The third book in Winston Graham's hugely popular Poldark series, Jeremy Poldark brings to vivid life the clash of rich and poor, loss and love, powerful and powerless in a mesmerizing saga you won't forget. What Readers \"The Poldark series is the most powerful reading experience I have ever had.\"\"Wonderful characters, evocative sense of place and time.\"\"If you haven't read the Poldark series, and care anything for Cornwall, the eighteenth century, historical romance in its truest form, historical fiction, or just a darn good story that will change your life, then you should read this book.\"",
