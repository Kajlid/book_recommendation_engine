  "description": "They are the world's gravest super-villains: Ultraman, Owlman, Superwoman, Power Ring and Johnny Quick--the legendary Crime Syndicate of Amerika. Nothing has ever seriously threatened the global corruption they proudly enforce, but now a twisted mirror image of the CSA has arrived from the flip side of reality. Can anything stop this so-called \"JUSTICE LEAGUE,\" or will the stable, perfect evil of the Earth 2 fall victim to the tyranny of law, righteousness and freedom?",
