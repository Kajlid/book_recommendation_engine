  "description": "No other book on the Southern Appalachians is more widely known or cited. \"Awonderful book. I like it especially for its color and anecdotes. It is a classic, not only for its accuracy and breadth of insights into the people of the region, but because these people themselves are so interesting and strong.\"--Annie Dillard, author of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek",
