  "description": "What happens when the bossiest cousin ever comes to visit for the weekend? This classic picture book about sharing and accepting others is a funny and realistic look at handling a friend or family member who isn't so good at sharing. Wendell was spending the weekend at Sophie's house. Playing house, Wendell was the father, the mother, and the children; Sophie was the dog. Playing bakery, Wendell was the baker; Sophie got to be the sweet roll. But when Wendell gave her a new hairdo with shaving cream, it was the last straw, and Sophie made up a game that left Wendell speechless for a time—and won the day for friendship. Written and illustrated by Kevin Henkes, the nationally bestselling and celebrated creator of  Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse ,  Kitten's First Full Moon , and  Chrysanthemum,  this classic picture book is \"a hilarious read-aloud\" (The Bulletin). Whether shared at home or in the classroom, this picture book for ages 3-7 will make kids laugh in recognition.",
