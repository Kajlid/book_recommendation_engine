  "description": "At Claire Benoit’s sixteenth birthday party, all anyone can talk about are the recent werewolf attacks that have ravaged her town. Claire, however, is more interested in the flirtations of soccer god Matthew Engle, who graciously ignores the mysterious rash on her hands and ears. His attentions are the highlight of her evening—until she transforms into a werewolf! After learning she’s the latest in a long line of she-wolves, Claire is compelled to help her pack find and defeat the rogue werewolf who’s been killing humans—but she must keep her lupine identity a secret from her new boyfriend Matthew, whose father hunts her kind.",
