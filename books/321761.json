  "description": "Can a widow find love again during the holidays?Pamela Cunningham isn’t sure whether it’s the smell of cinnamon in the air, the glowing lights in every festive window, or the fact that each of her four grown sons has recently fallen in love, but she’s finding herself thinking about things she hasn’t considered since her husband died.All thanks to the debonair winemaker she hired from France to teach her to turn her dream winery into a success.Jacques, in the meantime, gets a text that his work visa will not be renewed, which means he’ll be starting the new year back in France. He thinks he may have misread the entire situation with Pam, and that she does not have warm Christmasy feelings for him that match the ones he holds for her. He vows to enjoy the short time they have left, however.Will the text before Christmas ruin this second chance at love?The Text Before Christmas is a novella-length story featuring a holiday misunderstanding, all the Cunningham brothers and their significant others, every side character you’re hoping to see once more, and a traditional Cunningham grand gesture.",
