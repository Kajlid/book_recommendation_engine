  "description": "Chicago Racketeers Book One I don’t do casual hookups, so I have no idea what to expect when I meet not one, but three hot guys who are into me.I’m an introverted, failing-book-shop-owning, romance-writer wanna be.But after my dating disaster at a hockey game—all caught on the jumbotron—I somehow have the attention of three men.Nathan Armstrong is the hot, older, sophisticated billionaire owner of the team.Why does this man want a night with me? I’m baffled…but I’m not saying no.I should also say no to the romantic, suave, brilliant team doctor, Michael Hughes.And the team’s new hot-shot all-star player Crew McNeill.But I don’t.And I’m loving every minute. Especially the minutes they decide we should all spend together. Golden Retriever Crew is all in, bossy, broody Nathan is reluctant (to say the least), and sexy, confident Michael knows what we all need. They’re all here, promising to make every one of my fantasies come true.And they do. Night after headboard-banging night.But it can’t last.Good thing I was okay with a short-term fling because as soon as the fans find out what we’re doing, our lives–and my heart–are going to be all pucked up.\nPuck One Night Stands is a steamy, fun why-choose rom com! No cheating, a guaranteed HEA, and the guys are all about her. If you like Lily Gold, Emily Rath, and Lauren Blakely, welcome to the world of Emma Foxx!",
