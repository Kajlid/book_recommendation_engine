  "description": "Blood is really warm,                                                like drinking hot chocolate                                                 but with more screaming.Poetry is dead. \"Zombie Haiku\" is the touching story of a zombie's gradual decay told through the intimate poetry of haiku. From infection to demise, readers will accompany the narrator through deserted streets and barracaded doors for every eye-popping, gut-wrenching, flesh-eating moment. The book is illustrated with over 50 photos from the zombie's point of view and designed with extra blood, pus, gore, and guts!                                                      Biting into heads                                              is much harder than it looks.                                                     The skull is feisty.",
