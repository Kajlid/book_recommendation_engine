  "description": "Sarai Ravensbrook has never known power. She has never been in control of anything in her world. She has lived in the shadow of her stepfather and uncle's abuses to both her mind and body. All she has ever wanted was to have what was hers, to control her own destiny. But when a beautiful and mysterious woman comes into her life, Sarai is guided down a strange path....a path that will lead her to a queen from the ancient past, an extraordinary lost relic and to a destiny that is finally her own....or is it? This page-turning story set in the late 1960s during a period of cultural rebellion (with a flashback to Biblical times) shows the power of consequence and the hope of redemption. The past events of this allegoric novel are interwoven within several themes that have insightful parallels to today, taking readers on a gripping and thought-provoking journey.",
