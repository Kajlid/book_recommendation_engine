  "description": "The road you take cannot be undone.  Kasha never quite fit in. So she left home long ago to pursue her career in art. Hell, she ran as fast as she could away from her minister father and his judgmental ways. Yet, she loved her parents, so when the dreams surrounding a church filled with fire and blood kept repeating itself, it was all she could paint. She had to warn them. Only to arrive too late to save them. Now she found herself running once again, only this time away from a nightmare.  In her mad flight, she took a turn off the highway. Soon realizing she might have run toward something even worse. This time she couldn’t run, she couldn’t lie to herself anymore. She was more than an artist. She had to learn to fully embrace and unleash her powers within. She had to know who and what she truly was and learn to stand her ground.",
