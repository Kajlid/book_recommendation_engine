  "description": "Sheriff and single mother Taylor O'Brien has enough worries as it is, what with spearheading a campaign for her re-election as sheriff, keeping the peace in her Montana mountain town, and raising her ten-year-old son. The last thing she needs now is a complicated romance....Then into Taylor's life wanders Sam Evans, a ruggedly handsome cowboy who looks like he just stepped out of the late 1800s. As if his clothes aren't strange enough, Sam has never tasted a french fry, jumps at the jingle of a phone, and has never seen a woman in pants, let alone a lady-sheriff. The fact is, he did just step out of the nineteenth century--through a time-travel change. By traveling through time, Sam had hoped to forget his woman troubles for a while.But it was over a hundred years ago that he swore off women and time has a way of changing one's mind.",
