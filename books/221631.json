  "description": "Our Sins Define Us. Or do they? Jaxon Jennings, private eye and brand new father, sees the world in a new light. One where he and his wife, Victoria, can raise their young daughter sheltered from the sins of this world, from his own sins and past mistakes. He has responsibilities and priorities. He has a new life. And his daughter Michelle is the center of it. So, when a prominent local business owner—who had hired Jaxon for his private investigative services—ends up with his throat cut, the victim of a killer whose methods seem familiar to a case Jaxon had put to bed over twenty years ago, Jaxon’s past, once again, rears its ugly head to haunt him. Reynolds Maubry, a psychopath who used a short, curved blade to take his victims’ lives, was serving a life sentence in Virginia. Jaxon had seen to that as a young homicide detective in Washington DC. Maubry’s methods were distinct and the evidence he left behind, unique. So, how could he be in sunny north Florida, taking lives again? A copycat could be the only answer. But when Jaxon discovers that things are not as neat and tidy as they seem, he must face the mounting evidence that he and his family are in danger. And from a place he would never have suspected. Jaxon badly wants to live this new life. But he can’t escape his past sins. To keep himself and his family safe, he must sin again. But who will survive?",
