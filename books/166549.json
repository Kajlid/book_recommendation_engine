  "description": "Thirty-something Mara Gilgannon finds herself back in her dinky hometown of Aldoburg, Iowa, helping her Aunt Zee keep her struggling radio station alive while unraveling clues surrounding the murder of Glad, Zee's longtime partner. Mara begins to suspect that Glad's vocal opposition to a Wal-Mart opening in the town, an issue that has sharply divided Aldoburg, may have more to do with the murder than was originally supposed. But nothing is ever simple-especially when a beautiful police officer catches Mara's eye. Mary Vermillion is an associate professor of English at Mount Mercy College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She is a member of Sisters in Crime, and her writing has appeared in Birthday Blessings and Testimonies .",
