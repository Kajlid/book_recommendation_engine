  "description": "You think you know me? Manwhore. Partier. Fighter. You know what? You’re right. I’m all those things. F*ck with mine and I’ll f*ck you ten times harder. Suspensions. Arrests. You think I care?  So yeah, I may fit the bad boy image, but there’s so much more you don’t know.  I'm loyal to a damned fault. I'll never leave your side. The real Logan Kade isn’t a manwhore. When I love, I love hard and completely.  Taylor saw that side of me. Inside of me. She saw my darkness and pain, and the second she did, she owned me.  You may think you know me… …but she’s the only one who sees me.",
