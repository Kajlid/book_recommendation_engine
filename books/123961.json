  "description": "Join The Man and his Nemesis, the obese tabby, for a nightmare roller coaster ride into this postmodern history. Take Alice in Wonderland, Dark City, and Pilgrim's Progress. Put them in a blender with a lot of dry ice. Mix and serve in a dirty, broken glass. And that's just the first chapter of Some Things Are Better Left Unplugged. This postmodern fable examines the need for myth, metaphor and identity. The story satirizes many of our everyday obsessions, including the pursuit of wealth and materialism; the thirst for empty spectacles and violence; and the need for obtaining social status. This absurd tale will delight you in the tradition of Camus' The Stranger and Beckett's Waiting for Godot.",
