  "title": "About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution",
  "description": "An elegant, witty, and engaging exploration of the riddle of time, which examines the consequences of Einstein's theory of relativity and offers startling suggestions about what recent research may reveal.The eternal questions of science and religion were profoundly recast by Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications that time can be warped by motion and gravitation, and that it cannot be meaningfully divided into past, present, and future.In About Time, Paul Davies discusses the big bang theory, chaos theory, and the recent discovery that the universe appears to be younger than some of the objects in it, concluding that Einstein's theory provides only an incomplete understanding of the nature of time. Davies explores unanswered questions such as:* Does the universe have a beginning and an end?* Is the passage of time merely an illusion?* Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time?About Time weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.",
