  "description": "HISTORY IS ALL YOU LEFT ME meets WHAT IF IT'S US in this adorable, heartwarming story of two boys grieving the loss of a friend and their chaotic yet charming path to healing.— ⁠— ⁠— ⁠— ⁠— ⁠— ⁠—TYLER: Life sucks. There’s no point in acting like it doesn’t.Why else would it make me gay, give me a family that hates who I am, throw me in a town that would rather “my kind” be shipped off, and then decide my boyfriend had to die? Or maybe that last one was my fault... The point is that life sucks. Everything about it sucks.Oh yeah, and now I’m stuck venting about it all to my archnemesis, Aidan.AIDAN: You know what? Life hurts sometimes.It does right now. I miss my friend, and I don’t understand why he had to die. But there’s a part of me that knows he’s looking down from the stars right now, and he wants me to smile again. It might be fake at the moment, but it’s something. The crazy part is I never imagined Tyler would talk to me again, but here I am trying to help him through the same hurt I’m feeling.I just wish I knew why he hates me so much.--------------TW: Conversion Therapy, Homophobia",
