  "description": "Marcial was everything Carsten had wished for; handsome, kind, young, industrious and willing to be helpful. A Spanish \"little Elf.\" A dream come true for the rich man. His only drawback? The ravenous Platypus living with him, the Georgian mobster determined to make Marcial his newest boy-friend, and Pelayo, his meddle-some childhood friend. For the hyper-rational middle aged programmer, nothing makes sense anymore as he finds himself plunged into a world where reality and fantasy merge and sanity is a scarce commodity.",
