  "description": "After Mack Draycovich's parents died, he pushed away everyone, including Jane, the girl he loved. He turned to alcohol, drugs, and back alley fighting to ease the pain he felt inside. It wasn't until a retired MMA fighter took him in and helped him channel all of his aggression into something productive that things began to change. Ten years later and Mack has his life back, but he has never forgotten about Jane or what she means to him.  Jane Reynolds left the man she loved when he turned his back on her for the chemical kind of comfort. Years have passed and she is back in the town of Absinthe. But when she sees Mack fighting brutally in an abandoned warehouse and her love for him rises violently to the surface.  But Jane has someone in her life. Can Mack show her he is worthy of her love before she commits herself to another?",
