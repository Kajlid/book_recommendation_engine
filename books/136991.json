The Waverly sisters must save themselves before all is lost.Since the Waverlys arrived in Paris, the streets have grown more fearsome by the day.

By all indications, the fallen angel's Harvest is near-and the timing couldn't be worse.Targeted by vengeful gargoyles, Gabby has been exiled to London for her own protection. Meanwhile, the gargoyle castes are in disarray, divided between those who want Luc to lead them and those who resent him and his fondness for humans. The Alliance is crumbling from the inside as well, its members turning against one another, and possibly against the Waverlys, too.Axia has promised that the world will burn. And now, unable to trust the Alliance, separated from Luc, Gabby, and her twin, Grayson, Ingrid is left to face the demon uprising alone.",
