  "description": "Ten different species. A female alien whose hair changes color with moods: blue for arousal, red for anger, green for climax, white for sadness . . . A man who calls himself a human. Secret agencies. A tenuous peace after the largest inter-galactic conflict in recorded history. And a string of murders only two people, Wes and Sarza, are allowed to investigate. Agent Wes Venta knows that working with a Sparcus is complicated. The fact that his people, the humans, committed an act of genocide by sterilizing every Sparcus male is something neither he, nor she, will ever forget. But when he meets Sarza Beshemet, the IPP Covert, he doesn't realize quite the impact she will have on his life. In fact, he doesn't realize what their joint investigation of a murder will do to the history of our galaxy. Sarza Beshemet hates humans. All of them. And the only purpose of her association with them is to uncover Project Genesis, the rumored antidote to her people's mass sterilization. But part of her cover is to act like an IPP agent. To that end, she will have to work alongside Wes Venta to solve an increasing and varied string of murders on multiple planets. Being a Sparcus, her desires and urges are hailed as proof of her health, strength, and wholeness of being. But when these desires turn to Wes, the human, there's a lot more to be confused about than just her changing hair color.",
