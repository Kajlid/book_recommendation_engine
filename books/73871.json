  "description": "Skye Bancroft is a hard-working assistant art director at Night Moon Publishers. Dealing with the occasional spoiled and egocentric model is part of her job description. But she didn’t count on one so delusional to think he was a Scotsman from the highlands of 1814.Cailin Thorburn is every woman’s dream—a warrior who is fierce, passionate, and wields a very large sword. Rendered unconscious during battle, he awakens in another place, time, and seemingly in another man’s body. Was it all a dream? Convincing the bonnie lass, Skye, that he is Cailin, the Highland warrior, is a daunting task.Can an extraordinary man from another world prove he is who he claims to be? Will their attraction be enough, or is Cailin just a cover model in a kilt?",
