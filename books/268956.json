  "description": "11:11 Inspiring Conversations is not your typical day-day self-help book. It contains magical elements. If one steps in with an open heart and mind these conversations have the fairylike ability to revolutionize your perspective which in-turn leads to measurable life-changing results. This book was born out of the 11:11 podcast series. It’s written in everyday language but contains powerful ancient spiritual laws that are equally as applicable in the times we live in today. The conversations ahead are here to serve you on your divine journey. To provide you with practical steps that will equip and guide you to become your highest version today. All that is enclosed in this book has a deep-seated place in the comforts of our hearts, and we hope you will allow it to take root in yours. The foundation of these conversations is found within the boundless power of community. The book is built on all the brilliant women and men who’ve generously shared their wisdom and traditions over the years. Now it’s our turn to share. 11:11 Inspiring Conversations is the result of two inquisitive students of life deciding to collect all they’ve learned in a small, powerful and easy to digest book. We look forward to having you join us in these life-changing 11:11 conversations.",
