  "description": "Think that spiritual journeys are all glitter and sparkles? Think again...  After the love of her life left her for another woman, Londoner, Tina, is spurred on by heartbreak to embark upon an epic spiritual quest, which takes her from England to the Middle East. Inspired by her love for nature, the Divine feminine and a mysterious book (A Course in Miracles) that seems to arise when she needs it most, Tina must find herself before she loses who she is forever.  Join her on her journey from marrying herself in a Glastonbury sacred ceremony to dancing amongst Egyptian ruins, eventually settling down to live in the oldest continually inhabited city in the world: Damascus, Syria. It is there that she is forced to confront the answers to the greatest questions people have ever asked God about the nature of love, sex and relationships. Is sex really spiritual? Is it possible to love only one person at a time in an exclusive relationship? How does God view our interpretation of love?  Tina lives the answers to these questions and many more as she ends up falling in love with a Syrian man who is from a society that disapproves of her as a single woman, an adventurer and a sexual being. Just when she thought she was at peace, her desire to fit in and be accepted sees her on the verge of a breakdown, until a series of events forces her to stare love, life, war and death in the face.  This is the true story of what happens when we love with everything we have, to the point of self-destruction and learn that it is only when we are broken that we are most open to hearing the truth of how to put ourselves back together.",
