  "title": "This Book's Not Perfect: But Neither Are We",
  "description": "This is one Man’s unique view on Life, told in a collection of short stories. Dealing with the death of a best friend, storytelling became a tool in recovering a love for the simple things he had once enjoyed. The words in this book are not the answer to all of Life’s questions or bring about World Peace, but they do recall different tales that can bring about mixed emotions, an easy read for those who simply enjoy reading. A book that you’ll pick-up from time to time and refocus on things of real importance, like your family and friends. As is the case in any person’s life, the sad parts may make you cry. The happy parts may make you laugh. For the sake of Mother, the immoral parts have been polished-up a bit.",
