  "description": "Veterinary student Adrian Ferrer can't find the right man for a lasting relationship, let alone to share his life with. Between classes, his part-time job at an animal hospital and volunteering at a no-kill shelter, he's not making time to try either. Just as he's ready to leave love for the birds, Adrian comes across a new guest at the shelter who turns out to be much more than the cute, black & white cat he first appears to be. The cat shifts form, becoming a gorgeous, naked man named Lal, and the sexual attraction between the two men is pure animal magnetism.Before Adrian knows it, he's falling for Lal faster than he can catch his breath. Never mind that his apartment doesn't allow pets, Lal is one cat he's not letting go of. But Adrian's new love is on the run from a former life that's about to catch up with them both.",
