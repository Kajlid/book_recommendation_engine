  "description": "Perfect Timing explores the mind of a man on a riotous adventure through heaven, hell, and Myrtle Beach.Ford Clayton is a music professor at a small conservatory in Asheville, North Carolina, facing a thinning hairline, a crumbling marriage, and the failure of his dreams of symphonic genius. Worn out from wrestling with the triple burden of marriage, music, and maturity, and in need of some resolution in his life, he is startled to recognize his first love, a formerly gifted pianist, in a television documentary on the homeless. Accompanied by his recently paroled, born-again, hilariously insane cousin, Ford sets out on a mission to rescue Camille Malone from the ranks of the homeless, to confront his past and define his future, and to finally finish something he's started.Alternately comic and tragic, Perfect Timing is a off-beat, delayed-coming-of-age tale and a laugh-filled journey to the heart of a man who hasn't seen his heart in years.",
