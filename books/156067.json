  "description": "Åsa Larsson’s first novel, The Savage Altar, was awarded the Swedish Crime Writers' Association prize for best debut. Its sequel, The Blood Spilt, was chosen as Best Swedish Crime Novel. “Among the current batch of Nordic writers, the new Larsson is one to be followed with the most minute attention,” said the Independent.   In The Second Deadly Sin, dawn breaks in a forest in northern Sweden. Villagers gather to dispatch a rampaging bear. When the beast is brought to ground they are horrified to find the remains of a human hand inside its stomach. In nearby Kiruna, a woman is found murdered in her bed, her body a patchwork of vicious wounds, the word WHORE scrawled across the wall. Her grandson Marcus, already an orphan, is nowhere to be seen. Grasping for clues, Rebecka Martinsson begins to delve into the victim’s tragic family history. But with doubts over her mental health still lingering, she is ousted from the case by an arrogant and ambitious young prosecutor. Before long a chance lead draws Martinsson back into the thick of the action and her legendary courage is put to the test once more. From the Hardcover edition.",
