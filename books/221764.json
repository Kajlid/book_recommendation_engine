  "title": "The Phoenician Origin of Britons Scots and Anglo-Saxons",
  "description": "The long-lost origin and early history of our ancestors, the Britons, Scots and Anglo-Saxons, in the \"Prehistoric\" and Pre-Roman periods, back to about 3000 b.c., are now recovered to a great extent in this present work, by means of newly discovered historical evidence.' This book contains Waddell's historic interpretation of the inscription of the Newton Stone found in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Laurence Austine Waddell was born in Scotland on 29 May 1854. He became a well known explorer and archaeologist, but his reputation as a Sumerologist gained no recognition and his various works on the history of civilization have caused much controversy.",
