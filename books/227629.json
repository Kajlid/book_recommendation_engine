  "description": "Freedom. Annabelle De Luca craved it. On the heels of her beloved father’s murder, betrayed by those closest to her, Annabelle had a choice to accept the man responsible and fall in line, or suffer the consequences. Never one to back down, she rejected her new stepfather—then spent years ignoring his best efforts to crush her spirit. Atonement. Liam Hunt never needed it. Some people deny the darkest sides of themselves; Liam’s made a career out of his. Never once has he hesitated to pull the trigger, but an unexpected encounter with Annabelle leads to feelings he hasn’t experienced before—and doubts about his current assignment. Liam knows he should leave her alone, keep his head down, and do what he’s being paid to do, but he can’t bring himself to stay away. He’s the last person anyone would classify a hero, but he can’t shake the doomed desire to be hers. He shouldn’t want her. She shouldn’t trust him. On a course set for utter devastation, can these forbidden lovers find their way to happily ever after? Inspired by the classic tale Snow White, The Last Boss' Daughter is a modernized, darker re-imagining.",
