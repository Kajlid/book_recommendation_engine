  "description": "Connor \"Constance\" Christensen is far from your ordinary private detective. For one, her partner is a 1940's fedora-wearing ghost named Phil. And then there are the a regular day on the job could see the pair facing anything from fairies to vampires, werewolves to aliens. Some of these paranormal beings move on willingly. Others need a little...coaxing. Hunting down forlorn spirits in the local flea market on the weekend is one thing, but when Connor and Phil stumble into murder-soaked mystery, it quickly spirals out of control. Connor and Phil find themselves caught up in a case that may be a little too big for them. Between portal-hopping to Japan, pseudo-suave thugs, a library of knowledge past and present, and human possession, they will travel to places darker than they have ever been before. The question is will they make it back? The Prodigy is a genre-melding whirlwind that whips together equal parts macabre horror and tongue-in-cheek humor.",
