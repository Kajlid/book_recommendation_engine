  "description": "Hilarious, shocking and hugely entertaining, Reheated Cabbage has all the classic Irvine Welsh ingredients.In these pages you can enjoy Christmas dinner with Begbie, and see how warmly Franco greets his sister's boyfriend and the news of their engagement. You will discover, in 'The Rosewell Incident', how aliens addicted to Embassy Regal have Midlothian under surveillance, and plan to install the local casuals as the new governors of Planet Earth. You will not be surprised to read that a televised Hibs vs. Hearts game might matter more to one character than the life of his wife, or that two guys fighting over a beautiful girl might agree -- on reflection, and after a few pills and many pints of lager -- that their friendship is actually more important. And you will be delighted to welcome back 'Juice' Terry Lawson, and to watch what happens when he meets his old nemesis, retired schoolmaster Albert Black, under the strobe-lights of a Miami Beach nightclub.",
