  "title": "A Royal Obsession",
  "description": "This side novel of love and one-sided love is a standalone that can be read at any time during the Jack’s Reign series. It’s set in 1689. When Ari meets Jack, the King is like a god to her, but he only has eyes for his wife. What if the problem is removed? What are a few lives if it means she can have the man of her dreams? Nobody can love Jack the way Ari can, and she’ll have him no matter what her stupid brother, Timmy, says about it. To Jack, Ari is another courtier and nothing more. He hires her little brother as a guard at the Castle even though Timmy seems to think little of himself. Jack knows Timmy can grow as a person, and maybe he’ll be lord material one day. Timmy, being treated with real respect for the first time in his life, admires the King. Jack is the type of man Timmy wants to be: a good Father, a good husband, and solid in his morals, values, bravery, and strength. Once Timmy falls in love with a court lady who thinks the world of him, he starts to realize that maybe he isn’t just a stupid farm boy after all. Ari’s obsession reaches new heights, leaving Timmy with difficult choices. He wants to be like Jack and do the right thing, but if he tells the King what Ari is willing to do, it could lead to her death for the crimes she’s committed. He has no family left besides his sister, and she was the only one who protected him during their rough childhood. If Timmy remains silent, the Royal Family will be fractured. He might even lose his life and everything he wants with his future wife. If he finds the strength to do the unthinkable, can he still grow into the type of man he wants to be?",
