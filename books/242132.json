  "description": "“Why I Sued Taylor Swift” tells the heartwarming story of a disabled man and his celebrity crush, Taylor Swift. After working on a musical gift for her, Taylor and this man collaborated on music, produced Taylor’s highest selling song and then they lived happily ever after — or so it should have been....  No, this story tells the inspiring true tale of a disabled songwriter who dreams of writing music for Taylor Swift, only to get stonewalled by her agents. Trying all available options, he soon decides to sue Taylor under the doctrine of “vicarious liability” in a desperate attempt to bring her attention to the unfair situation. Little does this man know that his entire world is about to be turned upside down.  Read my book about why I sued Taylor Swift and how I became falsely known as frivolous, litigious and crazy. It’s bound to inspire some. And it probably will make others cry or upset.",
