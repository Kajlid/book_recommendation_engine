So she impulsively decides to move to the island to pursue her dream of becoming a professional artist.   As Abbey settles in and makes new friends, she’s challenged by her fifty-five-year-old neighbor Josie. While Abbey is determined to break past Josie’s disagreeable attitude, friendships come easily for her at her job at a web design and graphics firm. Especially with a wonderful, handsome man named Zach Isler, who is definitely interested in Abbey as more than a friend.
