  "description": "Written as part of the 'choose your own m/m story' challenge hosted by Goodreads' own M/M Romance Group. The story prompts for the author were: 1. the setting ~ a gay romance retreat for publishers, authors and readers in a broken-down hotel in the middle of nowhere 2. some background to one of the main protags ~ one has an interfering sister who repacked his suitcase with a bunch 'sexy' 'gay' clothes for his 'coming out of the closet' holiday 3. another character/s ~ a post-it hoarder 4. a conflict ~ a potato 5. an object/phrase/theme/whatever to be mentioned in the story somewhere ~ the last line of the story is 'I love it when a plan comes together.'",
