  "description": "Core Expressions..... Our lives secrete such an essence, Of energy to flow, Existing just in our presence, Emitting will to grow, Should we take time to seek them out, To wake them from our core, Meditate or wonder about, What they exist for? In depths of quietude alone, Within levels of peace, Centered minds and souls can tone, A path for their release, It could simply be an answer, Or improved clarity, Yet taking time, peace and thought there, Our core has set it free. Brenda Jessup Core Expressions is exactly that...a collection of poetry written over a season of winter 2019 . I took time to reflect, release, meditate, and express daily for improved clarity in my life. I am hoping you the reader will enjoy this short collection of poetry at your leisure . If you meditate I hope it will inspire your inner thought flow from the core also. This book is aimed to inspire your core intuition . My writing can be deep and concise . I find great flow in the art of poetry in rhyme. Perhaps you will too. I grew up in Lakehurst, ON. Canada on Sandy Lake. Here I had a great deal of time to think...and overthink. At age 14 I began toying with poetry inspired by my English teacher's at L.D.S.S high school. In grade 12 I entered my first poetry contest encouraged by Mr. Buchanan and won first prize for my poem \"Spring Forest\". With that came the opportunity to help publish a book entitled \"Mine\" where Spring Forest is published. Poetry has been a gift throughout my life growing up with undiagnosed Episepsy throughout childhood.",
