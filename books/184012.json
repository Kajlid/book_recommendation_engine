  "description": "Aden \"Drip\" Tameron has his hands full. His life is a delicate balance between school, taking care of his three older sisters, and taking care of his tricks. That's right; Aden works as a rent boy to help his sisters pay the bills. Ever since their mom died, things have been pretty tough--if one would consider living scrunched in a trailer and selling sex to eat dinner every night tough. Just when he starts to think that he has things under control--including a pesky John that wants more than just one night together--Aden is struck with all the symptoms of an oncoming supernatural ability. One that just happens to be that of a werewolf shifter. His whole life, Aden's thought there was nothing special about him, but when he runs into his mate at a party, he learns that there's so much more to find out about himself. And as if he doesn't have enough on his plate, he's also got to deal with the incredibly sexy, bossy, and slightly abusive nature of Wyatt Woodall--the man of his dreams that seems to want nothing to do with him.",
