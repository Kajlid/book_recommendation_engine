  "title": "The Snow Flower: A story of friendship, rivalry and survival in the High Sierras",
  "description": "Awkward middle-schoolers Renee and her friend Abby have signed up for a summer backpacking trip in Californiaâ€™s Sierra Mountains, looking for adventure and the chance to make new friends. Renee, trying to make over her nerdy self, wants to be cool and belong, but is soon clashing with her fellow hiker, bubbly fashion-diva Stephanie. When the rivals get assigned to find a snow flower on a scavenger hunt, they end up lost and dependent on each other for survival during the freezing nights. Like co-dependent snow flowers, the girls need each other to survive. Humorous and engaging, The Snow Flower is about friendship, growing up, and respect for the wilderness. It promises to capture the imagination of not only middle-grade readers but their parents. Crawford sums it up: No violence, no dystopia, just pure fun! This humorous adventure captures the pains and awkwardness of California middle-schoolers growing up and trying to fit in, all the while enticing us to get outside and enjoy the mountains. Brings back great memories!",
