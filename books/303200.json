  "description": "Many young people nowadays are so cut-off from the real world we live in. They do not know, or need to know, what war looks like. Moreover, since we had to work from a very young age and still found time for adventures, we created our own amusement with no money or transport: just our two hands and feet, and our humour! I wrote this book because I lived through a time, where you lived every day to the fullest. Sitting indoors was never considered to be a possibility. In this book, you will see what it was like for me to live during World War II. Even during those grim times, you will see how I made the most of every moment. I balanced my life to the best of my abilities. How I was serious when I needed to be, and let loose and had a good time when I could. Life is about doing that. Working hard to achieve your goals in life, then doing your best to have fun without the fear of judgement. I not only hope this book tells you how you can have fun using your own imagination, but I also hope that it inspires you to seek out and enjoy.",
