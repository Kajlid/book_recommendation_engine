  "description": "Heartfelt personal accounts from Asian-American women on their experiences with skin color bias, from being labeled \"too dark\" to becoming empowered to challenge beauty standards\"I have a vivid memory of standing in my grandmother's kitchen, where, by the table, she closely watched me as I played. When I finally looked up to ask why she was staring, her expression changed from that of intent observer to one of guilt and shame. . . . 'My anak (dear child), ' she began, 'you are so beautiful. It is a shame that you are so dark. No Filipino man will ever want to marry you.'\"-\"Shade of Brown,\" Noelle Marie FalcisHow does skin color impact the lives of Asian-American women?
