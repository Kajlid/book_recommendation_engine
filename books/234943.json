  "description": "I didn’t know she was a detective, the only daughter of the Chief of Police. I didn’t know he was a mafia Prince, heir to the Tyrell’s bloody empire.  It was only supposed to be one night. God help me, I can’t stop thinking about that night.  So when she walked into the interrogation room, my heart almost stopped. I can’t believe he might have tortured and killed someone.  I have to avoid her at all costs. I will be his downfall.  So begins a deadly game of cat and mouse, of blood and lust, of love and duty, and of an attraction so fierce the consequences are inevitable… Inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, this is a retelling for mature audiences. Don’t enter the Underworld if you’re scared of the dark.",
