  "description": "Vanity Baker loves a good, clean match, but she's not above playing a little dirty. She's wanted Stack \"The Wolf\" Hannigan from day one. Seems as though the best way to corral the famously commitment-phobic fighter is to insist on keeping it casual. And her plan works--deliciously well--until Stack's past steps out of the shadows.Stack learned early to stay free of attachments. But with sexy, forthright Vanity, he's the one always left wanting more. Then his troublemaking family comes back into the picture, threatening everything Stack cares about--Vanity included. Suddenly he realizes they're much more than friends with benefits. He's ready to go to the mat for herâ€¦but will it be in time to protect the woman who's tamed him for good?",
