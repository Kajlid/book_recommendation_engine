  "description": "Regency England has no idea the Wilde family possesses a bit of the old, wild blood--blood from the Shenti, Dennene, Pelldari, and other such folk. This makes them a little special, gifted in different ways, drawing to them people like themselves. The former Major Trevor Wilde, now the Earl of Ardmoor, takes a keen interest in connecting those couples who belong together. ON THE WILD SIDE is a Regency anthology of six stories, telling the tale of love and romance and hopefully, a happy ever after.",
