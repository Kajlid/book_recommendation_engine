  "description": "Told from numerous and at times oblique perspectives, while employing various literary forms and styles, ANIMAL MAGNET probes the notion of humanness, human identity, and humanity.Spanning centuries and continents, the story jumps generationally if erratically down the family tree, beginning in 18th century Hungary with the forbidden love affair of manor tutor PÃ©ter Montgolfier and lunatic scullery maid Theresa Seyfert, and ending more than two centuries years later in a futuristic L.A. with controversial performance artist Vic Ray.ANIMAL MAGNET can be purchased directly from Emmerson Street Press at the link below or from Amazon.ca.",
