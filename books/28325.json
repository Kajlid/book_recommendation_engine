I love you too much to deny you this opportunity. A fresh new start, away from Lintorff and all the others. Frustrated and disgusted with his life as Lord Consort of one of the most terrifying secret societies known to mankind, a new world opened for artist Guntram de Lisle, away from the man he loved but had hurt him like no one else before. Would he take the opportunity to raise a family on his own? Would Konrad von Lintorff let him go? Would Alexander Kuragin keep his word?",
