  "description": "TrentHow do you go home when home is gone?I’ve paid my dues for protecting someone I love.In return my family, my life, and my freedom—all taken from me.When a friend calls in a favor, I go from nothing…to having a job and a place to live.A fresh start brings something more; a woman who brings out my protective instincts.She's been hurt—it's written all over her.There's one thing for sure, I want her.And I vow that nothing will ever harm her again.MichelleI've hit rock bottom, and I've slowly climbed my way back up.Now, I keep myself locked away. It's easier than letting people in and telling them about that night.I live my life in the shadows because happiness is something that I can't have.I keep my pain where it belongs, in the past. I keep my secrets buried deep down.Now my past is colliding with my future, and I'm not sure how I'm going to survive.But in the midst of the darkness is a shining light: Trent.Sometimes you find home in the place you least expect it.",
