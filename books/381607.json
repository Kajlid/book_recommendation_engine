  "description": "Rancher Dee MacLeod needs a man in the worst way. Trouble is, since Jake Reynolds left her ten years ago, she can't find a man who scratches that itch like Jake did. She's hot and horny, but she hides her blazing passion beneath a cool, distant exterior. Her ranch hands call her \"Ice Queen.\" Ha. If they only knewâ€¦ Jake Reynolds, the one man who knows just how fiery Dee can be, thought he'd gotten the sexy redhead out of his system. But when he moves back to Arizona, he learns the truth...he's still in love with her. He's realized what an idiot he was to leave, and now Jake will stop at nothing to get Dee's hot body back in his bed. He intends to do whatever it takes to win her heart again, this time for keeps.",
