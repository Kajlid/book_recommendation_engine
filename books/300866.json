Something wildly irresistible. Even if his wicked smile and needful gaze could just be a ploy to win her trust and escape his cell.She shouldn't think of him like that. He is an alien after all. And possibly their enemy.For Xerus claims he is on a mission. A mission to destroy. And he cannot afford to fail. If he dares let Lana get close, dares open his cold heart to her, she could compromise everything.Heart's Prisoner is a complete standalone novel in the Dark World Mates series, a universe teeming with ferocious aliens and brave heroines.
