  "description": "Ajax I’m a mess, a literal hot mess. I keep telling myself I'll get through this, I'll figure it out, but I never do. Push comes to shove when I'm about to be homeless because I can't seem to take care of myself. I need a Daddy to call the shots, push me to be the functional adult I know I can be, and handle me when I'm in middle space. When my older friend agrees to take on that role for me, we agree it's just temporary. Falling in love was not part of the deal Ren made with me. When I'm back on my feet, will Daddy let me go or call me his own? TAGS: crime lords, Ajax is a mess, Ajax can't handle adulting, Renzo just wants to take care of his sweet boy, Ajax has no idea that Daddy loves him, so much pining, seriously this is all pining, There is a Russian mobster too, but he's not all that important yet, Ajax is adorkable, Daddy Ren is so swoony-sweet, crime lords aren't THAT bad, are they?, I've decided they aren't, author says so, mobster might kidnap the sweet boy, for like five seconds, Ajax has ptsd really bad, Daddy makes it better",
