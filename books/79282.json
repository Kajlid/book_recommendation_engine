  "title": "A Murder of Wolves",
  "description": "Seconded to a federal anti-terrorist unit, undercover sheriff's deputies Joe Big Snake Person (Joe Big) and James Longstreet Lambier (Barney) are viciously assaulted by a group seeking to buy computer chips used in the weapons and guidance systems of drone aircraft. The two men sense forces at work reminiscent of the cold-blooded manipulation they experienced as special warefare operatives in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places around the globe. Motivated by a desire for revenge, Joe Big and Barney set out to discover the reasons for the assault (and to solve the riddle of pack mules killed high on a mountain trail, apparently by a new and extremely lethan nerve agent). The former Force Recon Marine and Green Beret eventually come to understand that they have been recruited as pawns in a callous power struggle that includes factions with the will and means to take on the government itself.",
