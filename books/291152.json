  "description": "My mate lies in a rotting cage at the bottom of the sea, and I'll do anything to get him back. Maybe he's the devil himself, but he made the ultimate sacrifice for me. When my plan backfires, I'm left with a lethal hex surging in my veins. Now, I only have a few days to live. And Salem? He's wrestling with a dark curse of his own, one that he says makes him burn.. He keeps saying this ends with one of us dead, that our story is a tragedy. But I'm determined to rewrite the tale fate has penned for us. If I can't, he warns I could die at his hands.",
