  "title": "Yorkshire Transvestite Found Dead on Everest",
  "description": "For a number of years now, writer, photographer, stand-up comic and folk musician Mike Harding has written a monthly column for 'The Great Outdoors'. Britain's premier backpacking and trekking magazine. Witty, acidic and sometimes frothing over with barely concealed grump, these articles have plumbed the heights and soared to the depths of travel writing. Here is a selection of some of the best of those literary burblings. Meet the Yorkshire Transvestite and hero Maurice Wilson, climb the Devil's Bollocks, and hear the story of Akala and the Monk's Ghost. May you read them in health.",
