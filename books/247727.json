Solving a riddle led me on an adventure I never could have imagined, only to be left in handcuffs next to the last person I ever expected to see. Prince Sage Stevinson.I’m considered one of the lucky ones. One of only four women who are in line to marry the Prince of Canterbury due to some antiquated law that should have been updated five hundred years ago. Every stand-up-straight, hold your chin up, place your hand in your lap while you eat, and suck in your stomach directive, was all to bring me to this moment. Even my name, Everly, represents my happily ever after.But my happily ever after does not include marrying the Prince. I want to make a difference in this world and living the fake, pretentious life of the royal family is far from my dream. If Prince Sage wants me to be his Queen, he’ll have to prove he’s more than just one outrageous night.",
