  "description": "Sometimes a good girl needs to be bad.  I only had one shot. One chance to impress Clint Terrance, the baddest billionaire playboy in the NYC music scene. One song to make all my dreams come true.  So I did what I had to - I tugged on a sexy red dress, slipped on the highest heels I could stand in, and sung my heart out.  I never expected it to work.  Now he’s after me. The fake me. And I’m starting to realize that one song was only the beginning, and a billionaire’s desire is more dangerous than even I can handle.  I’ve always been a good girl. All I’ve ever cared about was my family, my music, and the farm I grew up on. I’ve built my whole life around that,and I’m in a good place. A stable place.  So why does one man’s touch make me want to throw it all away?",
