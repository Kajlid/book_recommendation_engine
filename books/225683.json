  "description": "Cora Anne Halloway has a history degree and a plan: avoid her own past despite being wait-listed for graduate school. Then her beloved grandmother requests -- and her dispassionate mother insists -- that she spend the summer at Still Waters, the family cottage on Edisto Beach, South Carolina.Despite its picturesque setting, Still Waters haunts Cora Anne with loss. At Still Waters her grandfather died, her parents' marriage disintegrated, and as a child, she caused a tragic drowning. But lingering among the oak canopies and gentle tides, this place also tempts her with forgiveness -- especially since Nan hired Tennessee Watson to oversee cottage repairs. A local contractor, but dedicated to the island's preservation from development, Tennessee offers her friendship and more, if she can move beyond her guilt.When a family reunion reveals Nan's failing health, Cora Anne discovers how far Tennessee will go to protect her and --Edisto -- from more desolation. Will Cora Anne choose between a life driven by guilt, or one washed clean by the tides of grace?",
