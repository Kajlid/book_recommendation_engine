  "title": "The American Dream",
  "description": "The American Dream, one-act drama by Edward Albee, published in 1959 (with The Zoo Story) and first produced in 1961. This brief absurdist drama established the playwright as an astute, acerbic critic of American values.The American Dream addresses issues of childlessness and adoption. The playâ€™s central figures, Mommy and Daddy, represent banal American life. Clubwoman Mrs. Barker visits, and Grandma reminds her of an earlier visit, when she brought an infant. This child did not turn out as Mommy and Daddy expected and so was abused by them until it died. When a handsome but emotionless young man -the American Dream- later arrives, Grandma suggests that Mommy and Daddy adopt him, since his emptiness seems to be what they desire.",
