  "description": "***NOTE: This is a serialised story and each part is approximately 1,600 - 2,500 words long***So what is Zombie Apocalypse Now! I hear you ask? Only the most awesome zombie serial to hit the shelves recently! There is blood and guts and more brains than you can poke a gun at. This serial is based around four female characters who find themselves sucked into the zombie apocalypse. Yep, women! For once we get to experience the apocalypse from a female point of view. But don't worry, these women are no shy and retiring wallflowers (except maybe for Rosalyn), they are ready and eager to jump right in to the thick of it - camo stilettos and all!In this first part we meet...RosalynThe least outgoing of the bunch, Rosalyn has recently lost her husband and we discover her in the opening scenes, having to defend her house against a zombie child. She has spent the first part of the zombie apocalypse holed up in the roof cavity of her house with a stockpile of food and nothing but diverted rainwater to drink. She may be quiet, but she sure is resilient!",
