  "description": "CREATION KIDS is designed to empower children in a playful manner, clad in a storyline that encourages children to consciously create a happy, self-determined life for themselves. This children’s book series is based on Marilyn Holzmann’s Clarity, Release and Connection series for adults on CREATION FORMULA, an easy-to-use and clearly understandable technique to shift your life to heretofore unheard of levels. My Superpowers! is the first book in the CREATION KIDS series. The story begins with the two girls Marilyn and Tirza, who are sad because they cannot seem to be good at anything. But when they meet an old soldier in the park, things step into high-gear as the children experience new adventures and create a different life for themselves! For this series, the author Marilyn Holzmann drew on decades of her experience in working with children, as well as her spiritual writing for adults.",
