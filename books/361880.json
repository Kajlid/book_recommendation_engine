  "title": "As I Lay Dying",
  "description": "As I Lay Dying\n is Faulkner’s harrowing account of the Bundren family’s odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury Addie, their wife and mother. Narrated in turn by each of the family members -- including Addie herself -- as well as others; the novel ranges in mood, from dark comedy to the deepest pathos. Considered one of the most influential novels in American fiction in structure, style, and drama, \nAs I Lay Dying\n is a true 20th-century classic. This edition reproduces the corrected text of \nAs I Lay Dying\n as established in 1985 by Noel Polk.",
