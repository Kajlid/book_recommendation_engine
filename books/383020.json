  "description": "An ordinary Thursday night at Bryan’s Bar in downtown Atlanta, Georgia—home to a staff made up entirely of ex-cons of one stripe or another—turns into something quite different when riled-up police detective Patrick Graves walks in. Bartender Jay Hinshaw recognizes Patrick’s leashed ferocity and offers him exactly what he thinks Patrick an outlet for his pent-up frustration. But Patrick’s a complicated guy, and getting what he wants only scratches the surface of what he needs.",
