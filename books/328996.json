With his people rapidly entering blood rage, and the looming threat of war, he needs a queen to stand by his side as he strives to save his people, not a delicate flower. But he soon discovers that behind her fragile appearance, his little female hides a fierce and dauntless soul, with a sassy attitude that stirs him in unexpected ways.With time running out, will Rihanna be the blessing he needs to achieve the peace his people desperately desire, or will they self-destruct?",
