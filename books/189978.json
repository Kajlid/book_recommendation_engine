  "description": "\"A handbook for parents and children about celebrating the African-American harvest festival. The first two chapters define the holiday: its principles, vocabulary, etc. The third chapter takes readers through the seven days, describing what to do and sometimes how to do it. There is also a chapter with crafts....Another chapter offers ideas for gifts and recipes. Walter uses the tone of a personal reminiscence to great effect here....A worthwhile purchase.\"--School Library Journal.",
