  "description": "Circlet Press brings you seven erotic stories of dominance and submission that will return you to the moment when a master, mistress, or slave first stepped out of a story and made you theirs.The submissives, slaves, and bottoms you will meet here are tough and competent. No passive orifices, they are beautifully-realized individuals with the spark that makes them recognizably human. In \"KATT,\" the slave is a beautiful android who fights to hold on to the precious scrap of her life after a disaster. The servant in \"Lord of Misrule\" knows that his relationship with his master requires something other than obedience. The slave in \"Raiders from the Stars\" learns that much more is at stake than his personal gratification. In \"Personal Benefits,\" the highly-trained contract slave offers the pleasure of perfect obedience to the powerful woman who owns her.Nor are their tops the well-endowed ciphers who \"train\" Cindi. They have needs and aspirations. Pleasure may be an important part of their lives, even the most important part of their lives, but they are also seeking love, acceptance and a future for themselves and their slaves in a hard world. The master in \"Raiders from the Stars\" knows that the safety that humanity takes for granted is rooted in obedience. In \"Romans,\" the master forges a new sort of domestic tranquility for his new slaves. The bureaucrat of a repressive government in \"Exceptional Acts\" discovers that pleasure is the most powerful form of rebellion.Table of Lord of Misrule by Kannan FengKATT by SmotpRomans by Joe NobelRaiders from the Stars by Jay StarreExceptional Acts by Argus MarksPersonal Benefits by Elizabeth ThorneScenes in a Beijing Hotel by Jason Rubis",
