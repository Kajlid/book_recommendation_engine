  "title": "Temptation and Denial",
  "description": "To be unwanted and unloved can cause such pain that our search for salvation can lead us to the most unlikely places - and into the arms of the strangest people. In Tibetan Buddhism the Tulpa is a being envisioned by the imagination and which then becomes an entity capable of independent life, but what happens to such a being after he who imagined it dies?Lord Byron once wrote that the mind can make substance and give breath to a form that can outlive all flesh. Was he right? Temptation and Denial is a story of just such a journey. Set in the mountains and valleys of Georgian-era Wales, Temptation and Denial is a ghostly tale of an immortal love - a love that transcends physical death.Following on from the cult success of his Grim Fairy Tales, Adam Nicke again explores the tortured Gothic world of Dark Romanticism.",
