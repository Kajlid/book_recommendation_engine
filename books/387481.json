  "title": "Telling Tales",
  "description": "Rarely have world writers of such variety and distinction appeared together in the same anthology. Their stories capture the range of emotions and situations of our human universe: tragedy, comedy, fantasy, satire, dramas of sexual love and of war in different continents and cultures. They are not about HIV / AIDS. But all twenty-one writers have given their stories--chosen by themselves as representing some of the best of their lifetime work as storytellers--without any fee or royalty.Telling Tales is being published in more than twelve countries. The publisher's profits from the sales of this book will go to HIV / AIDS preventive education and for medical treatment for people living with the suffering this pandemic infection brings to our contemporary world.ContentsAcknowledgementsIntroductionBulldog (Arthur Miller)The Centaur (José Saramago)Down the Quiet Street (Es´kia Mphahlele)The Firebird´s Nest (Salman Rushdie)Cell Phone (Ingo Schulze)Death Constant Beyond Love (Gabriel García Márquez)The Age of Lead (Margaret Atwood)Witnesses of an Era (Günter Grass)The Journey to the Dead (John Updike)Sugar Baby (Chinua Achebe)The Way of the Wind (Amos Oz)Warm Dogs (Paul Theroux)The Ass and the Ox (Michel Tournier)Death of a Son (Njabulo S.
