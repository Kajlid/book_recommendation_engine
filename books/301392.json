  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters comes an emotionally gripping romance.It’s been a long time since I’ve looked at a man and wanted something more.Even longer since one has looked at me with a gaze that I couldn’t tear my eyes from.No one is perfect, but that’s how it felt to be in his arms.I started to think everything was going to be alright. That life had finally put the pieces of my broken heart back together.Fate may have brought us together, it’s a pretty little thought my poetic mind had.But there’s no doubt that the sins of his past would tear us apart.-------This story was previously published as Imperfect in 2017. It has been revised, rewritten and elevated.",
