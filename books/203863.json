  "description": "Governor Candace Reid has been in office for just over a month and things have only begun to get interesting. While Candace traverses the state, her wife Jameson traverses the sometimes challenging ground of caring for their three-year-old grandson, Spencer. Life is anything but routine for Candace and Jameson. An unexpected crisis in New York City will force Candace to confront pieces of her past that she has long sought to bury. Candace attempts to juggle her responsibilities to her chosen position and to a growing family, constantly managing a myriad of personalities and conflicting ideas in every corner of her life. A visit to a women’s shelter introduces Candace to a little boy named, Cooper—an interaction that Candace cannot seem to put out of her mind. While Candace deals with the realities of being governor, Nana and Mom, Jameson finds that spending time with Spencer and Candace begins to shift her ideas about the future. Jameson will begin to travel an unexpected path herself, hoping to pave the way for her future with Candace. Through upheavals, questions, loss, disappointment, competing ideas and even arguments, the Fletcher-Reid family always seems to find its feet in a deep devotion to one another. A few nuggets of wisdom from Grandma Pearl, some colorful ideas from spirited children and grandchildren, and a fortune cookie or two will pave the way into the future for Candace and Jameson. At the end of every road, everyone wants to find a place they can call home. Sometimes, that requires just a few Renovations.",
