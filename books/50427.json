  "description": "Official Description: New Orleans Police Detective Sam Garrett can't believe his bad luck when he's assigned to investigate a string of gay-bashings turned deadly in the French Quarter. Especially when he realizes Travis Boudreaux, his new, hot, and most-likely-straight partner, plans to use him as bait. The worst part? They’ve got no back-up because the rest of the city is preoccupied by another series of killings — the victims drained of blood.Original Prompt: Dear Author,This son of a bitch has been underneath my skin ever since he transferred into the department. Word has it that he's one of the best damn homicide detectives in the city, but the fact of the matter is that he's a Grade A arrogant asshole. Pretty much every time he opens his mouth, I want to slug him – or stick my tongue down his throat, I'm not always really sure which, or even if I want to choose one. My libido doesn't seem to give a tinker's damn that I'm pretty sure he's straight, and while jerking off in the shower is starting to get pretty damn old, I foresee a lot more of it in my future – because the Chief just paired us up to work a new case…Photo Description: Handsome man, dressed in a suit, could be a business professional, with just a touch of a smirk as an expression.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event.
