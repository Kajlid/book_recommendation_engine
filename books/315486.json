  "description": "PROTECTING MY PACK COMES FIRST. ALWAYS.I learned the hard way what it's like to lose people you love.As an alpha, I vowed never to let that happen again.That means keeping my focus. Never letting my guard down.And, most of all, staying away from civilians - i.e. humans.But the feisty chocolatier has me breaking my own rules. The beautiful female tests my patience... and all my control. I should stay away. I can't protect the pack if I succumb to my desires.But what if this is more than desire?What if Fate matched me with this human, and she's my mate?If I don't claim her, I'll lose it all in the worst possible way.",
