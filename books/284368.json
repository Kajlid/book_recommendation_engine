  "description": "From the outside, being the heir to a million-dollar auto repair company, the girlfriend to the school’s quarterback, and admired by her peers, means Scarlet Tucker’s life seems perfect. But after the tragic death of her brother, every day is a struggle to keep up appearances―especially with her boyfriend, who cares more about his reputation than about Scarlet’s feelings.When Scarlet accidentally slams into her school’s resident bad-boy-slash-outcast, Elijah Black, in the hallway, he shakes up more than her notebooks. Scarlet’s heard rumors about Elijah, but she’s drawn to him because they share the same sorrow―they’ve both lost a brother. As they grow closer, Elijah lets Scarlet into his hidden life of underground fighting, where long-buried secrets that impact both of their lives unravel. Before long, Elijah and Scarlet are in too deep to turn back, and the only way they’ll survive is to stick together.",
