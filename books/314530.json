  "description": "An entertaining and informative guide to the rock and roll landmarks of Los Angeles, The L. A. Musical History Tour chronicles the clubs, hotels, studios, record company offices, residences and restaurants that have played vital roles in the lives of those who have made Los Angeles a musical mecca. The mystique and mythology of L. A. Rock and roll is preserved and presented in the photographs of these timeless (and sometimes time-ravaged) spots - not to mention Fein's commentaries on them. Want to know where Phil Spector and Bob Dylan first met, how love or the Go-Gos got going, the woods where the Rolling Stones rolled around for the cover of Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass), where The Doors had an actual office, or where Roy Orbison is buried? It's all part of Fein's pictorial safari of the not-so familiar and extremely iconic sites that influenced Los Angeles' rich rock and roll history.",
