  "title": "Smoking is Not Glamorous",
  "description": "Paul Khan is a strong advocate for smoke-free environments. With a background in computer graphics at Alias Research Inc., Khan has asked the design illustrators to let the reader realize how toxic smoking really is. Paul also worked as a news reporter so he believes he can deliver this message. Khan thinks a smoker in Canada has very few rights. Although this is in no way, shape or form to discriminate against smokers, especially since Paul Khan himself is a reformed smoker. Paul believes the simple holistic lessons in this book are a sure-win solution to squash the monster of smoking in society.",
