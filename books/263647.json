  "title": "Riley: Quarantined Anarchy",
  "description": "In the darkness of space there’s a planet whose name is synonymous with death. Tales from long ago speak of a plague that kills young and old, a killer of brutal efficiency. The planet Surrey may be the undoing of newly recruited Special Judiciary Agent Riley.  Just a few months after Vanessa’s betrayal, Riley is sent to a space station in orbit of Surrey. Someone has been dipping into the armory and making a killing on the black market. With an unwanted guest in tow Riley has to track down who on the station is the arms dealer, but an unscheduled trip down to the plague-ridden planet turns her investigation into a fight for survival.  Can Riley make it off the planet before contracting the plague? How does this all tie into the missing weapons? It’s a race against time to answer these questions and more in this action packed continuation of Riley’s saga to find herself.",
