  "description": "Emily lives only a few miles from Gettysburg, site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. Not long afterwards, a wounded Confederate soldier shows up at her farm, asking for food and shelter. She hides him in the treehouse she played in as a child. But Charles is more than what he claims to be. He spies for the Union, but cannot reveal the truth to his newfound friend because he is sworn to secrecy. He must find a way to get to Washington, D.C., even though he is injured. Emily and her family could be severely punished if found to be harboring a Confederate soldier. Charles must decide what is more important: duty or love.",
