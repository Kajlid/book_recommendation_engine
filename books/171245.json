  "description": "Ayda Hanagan’s life took a whole new road to hell when she agreed to lay down beside Babylon’s very own devil in disguise, Drew Tucker. With an evolving love and the world she once knew now gone forever, Ayda’s toes were no longer dancing on the edge of the flames. She’d jumped straight into the fire, dragging her younger brother, Tate, along for the ride. No matter which way they both turned, Harleys and leather were their new reality, and they had to get used to the fact that acts of war and bad blood were never far away. All that seemed so easy for Ayda to push aside when she was resting in the arms of the man she never expected to love, but when lust, need and sex became as important to her as the air she breathed, it was only going to be a matter of time before reality decided to slap her around the face harder than ever before. Lost in the screwed-up perfection of their new fairytale, Drew and Ayda thought they could handle anything life threw at them. For every cop, whore or enemy that tried to tear them apart, they found strength in each other and a new weapon to fight back with. Only not all assassins wore their patches on their chest, and before they could even see the eyes of the wolves in the shadows waiting to bring them to their knees, they were all out of places to run. With everything they'd ever believed in suddenly at risk, fear was no longer an option and Drew and Ayda soon found themselves in the middle of a war that looked impossible to get out of alive. In order to survive, they had to learn how to fight together. Without restriction. Without thought. Without mercy. Even if that meant sacrificing everything they’d worked for, including each other.",
