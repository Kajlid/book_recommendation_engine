From the smash hits to the forgotten obscurities, it’s a unique, factual yet comic look back at everything from “Only Fools and Horses” to the “Yogi Bear’s All-Star Comedy Christmas Caper”. It was a time before satellite TV or even a fourth channel. When the big film really was The Big Film and millions tuned in for the varied likes of “EastEnders”, “Cannon and Ball”, “Mr T’s Christmas Dream”, “Minder”, The Snowman”, “Russ Abbot’s Madhouse”, “Fraggle Rock”, “The Bells of Astercote”, “The Equalizer”, “Wogan in Pantoland”, “Palace Hill”, “Noel’s Christmas Presents”, \"ALF's Special Christmas\", “Spitting Image”, “The First Annual Stuntman Awards” and “Terry and June” among many others. With over 125 unique, all-new mini articles, it’s a fun, breezy read whether you’re barmy about the box or vicarious viewer. So tune in, chill out and let them know it’s Christmas Time. Even if its March.",
