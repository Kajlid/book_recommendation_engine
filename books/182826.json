Her thirtieth birthday is in a few days, and Brad has promised her a rather unique giftâ€”his best friend, cocky and irresistible Colin. When Brad comes to her with a confession and a suggestion, Becca gets a choice. She can stay with Brad, leave him, or give in to something that might make her happy beyond her wildest dreams.
