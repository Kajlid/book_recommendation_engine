  "description": "Sadie Matheson is a bad witch. Not like a cool bad witch, who kicks ass and takes names while being evil in the process. But like a crummy, stinky, inept witch who will never live up to the Matheson family name or the greatness of her mother or grandmother. When another great spell goes awry and she turns her dachshund into a parrot who still thinks he’s a dog, she decides maybe it’s better to leave Salem and give up witching altogether…until the O’Sullivan boys come along and turn her life upside down. An ancient prophecy? Check. Four, sexy warlock heroes with giant…egos and even bigger hearts? Check. A book you won’t want to put down? Ohhh yeah!",
