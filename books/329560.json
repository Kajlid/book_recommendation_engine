She collects a paycheck from the Consilium for fighting against the Faerie Court while also helping her friend Aubrie search for illicit magic. But when her partner’s true scheme pits her violently against her human colleagues on his behalf, the half-Faerie renegade finds herself taking the fall—literally.With enemies everywhere, Jude’s ready to cut and run to a warm beach somewhere in the vicinity of “The Hell Away from This Mess.” Before she can flee, a shady group of Faeries traps her. To win her freedom along with safe, anonymous passage to her chosen sandy paradise, she reluctantly dives back into the fray to steal a spellbook for them—the same book Aubrie wants.Winning means facing off with vicious pixies, sirens, and even a dragon in pursuit of a prize that could merge the worlds into a chaotic nightmare, but Jude’s got her heart set on umbrella drinks—and revenge.",
