  "title": "The Time Machine",
  "description": "“The Time Machine” is a science fiction novel originally published in 1895. H.G. Wells is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel. The novel follows the adventures of a hypothetical Time Traveller who journeys into the future to find that humanity has evolved into two races: the peaceful Eloi — vegetarians who tire easily — and the carnivorous, predatory Morlocks. After narrowly escaping from the Morlocks, the Time Traveller undertakes another journey even further into the future.  “The Time Machine” has been adapted into three feature films, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media.",
