  "description": "A BBW Valentine's RomanceSuckers. They’re sweet and sticky, and when I was a kid, my dad’s best friend would give me a cherry-flavored sucker, pat me on the head and call me, angel. He was one of my favorite people. But as I grew, the suckers stopped, and he stopped visiting too. I wasn’t allowed to say his name either, and it wasn’t until I turned eighteen that I learned the truth: he cheated my dad out of a lot of money.  Deciding to be the person who does something about it, I borrow a friend’s ID and infiltrate his firm as an intern.  I want to find proof of what he did. I want to find a way to make him pay. Instead, I find something I’m not expecting, not in a million years.  Landon James is all man. And he’s been watching over me. Why does that make me all warm inside?  And why do my knees shake when he calls me angel? One thing is for sure, everything I thought was right is now wrong. Does that mean my feelings are wrong too?  Warning: this quick read contains over-the-top declarations, insta-love and molten hot moments between a younger curvy girl and the older man who swore to protect her.",
