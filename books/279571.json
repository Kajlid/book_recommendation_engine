  "description": "It figures . . . I went my whole adult life with a crush on Cashel Morgan. Since we both graduated from Mudville High—Go, Hogs! But I never got out of the friend zone with him. Until now. More than a decade after graduation.And why is Cash interested in something more now when he never was before? That’s the most annoying, frustrating, exasperating, ridiculous part. It’s all because another guy asked me on a date.No doubt about it, Cash Morgan is going to drive me insane, if I’m not already there. Because in the middle of my personal drama in what was formerly a non-existent love life is the fact something wonky is happening at my store. Things going missing. Things being moved.My friend Harper thinks it’s a ghost. Our friend Bethany thinks I’m just forgetful. I’m not sure what I think—about any of it. The strange happenings in my shop. My date with the hot deputy investigating the oddities in my store. And especially not Cash.All I know is that with all the craziness that’s happened around Mudville over the past six months, starting with Harper moving to town and her discovery of all the town’s secrets stashed in Agnes’s attic, we’d all better start to expect the unexpected.Welcome back to Mudville!If you read KISSING BOOKS, you've already met Red, the sweet and sassy red headed Main Street shop owner and Mudville native who befriends Harper, the city girl misplaced in a small town upstate.If you want more of Red, Bethany and Harper, and especially Cashel Morgan, one of the three hot brothers from Morgan Farm you met in Kissing Books, don't miss this steamy standalone laugh-out-loud read!",
