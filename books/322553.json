  "title": "The Jumping Frog",
  "description": "Mark Twain's Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County is a story of the crusty Jim Smiley, a man who so loved to bet on animals - horses, dogs, etc. - that he trained a frog to be the strongest jumper in his county.Â Twain's broad yet graceful humor is beautifully complemented by the elegant woodcuts of Alan James Robinson. Finely reproduced, these illustrations bring Twain's great comic tale to life.Twain's classic tale of the Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County is in three the original tale published in 1865, the first French translation of the story, and Twain's tongue-in-cheek verbatim re-translation into English.",
