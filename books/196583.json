  "description": "Gabrielle had returned from the Convent. Though she was a beauty at eighteen, tawny-haired and sapphire-eyed, she must walk in the shadow of Sylvia, her cousin who was heiress to the Fleming estate. But the legacy was based on a lie, and before the fortune passed on, there were old mysteries to solve, old loves and hates to be settled, old ghosts to be laid to rest. Until then, like the mansion hanging over the sea, the curse of Wastewater hung above the head of Gabrielle.(original title: The Black Flemings)",
