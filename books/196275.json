Connor loves their music, but he’s had it with Carson’s antics and life on the road. He’s ready to call it quits when their beloved Papa falls ill and they are called home to their family ranch on Falcon Ridge. Occupational Therapist Breezy Youngblood once loved Connor and Carson to the moon and back. She was a mere girl when her world was shattered and she was forced to leave Grassland with only her broken heart. When she’s asked to return to help the McLendon patriarch recover, she’s forced to face the tragedy that destroyed her dreams of ever calling Falcon Ridge her home. When Connor reunites with Breezy, it’s love at first sight. He believes she’s the one who can bridge the canyon between him and his twin. Carson? He wants her gone. Despite his unexpected attraction to Breezy, he knows what happened that ill-fated night and he’s not about to let her charm her way into his family’s good graces.
