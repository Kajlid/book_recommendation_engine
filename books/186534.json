  "description": "The most that June expected for her 21st birthday was a night of fun with her friends, and maybe some flowers and a CD from her fianc√©. She certainly didn t expect to come home to what should have been a dark, empty apartment, to find her destiny waiting for her...wearing bright purple pirate pants. Kidnapped by a sinister stranger and whisked off to a far corner of the galaxy, June discovers that her life on Earth has been a two-decade long lie, and that her true home is the troubled kingdom of Prendawr, on the planet Thallafrith. As if that wasn t enough to chase her back under the covers, June is informed that her duty, as princess and sole surviving member of the royal family, is to use her newly discovered magical abilities to save the planet from impending doom. Accompanied by Halryan, a sorcerer with a questionable agenda, and Koen, Minogan, Errigal, and Feoras, members of a vanishing race of blue warriors, June has no idea that she is about to embark on the journey of a thousand lifetimes, one that will surpass both her wildest dreams and her most terrifying nightmares.",
