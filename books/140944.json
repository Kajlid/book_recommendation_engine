  "description": "Upon arriving in Ilulissat, Greenland, Gannon and Wyatt prepare for the adventure of a lifetime--a dogsled expedition in the Arctic! But before the explorers even crack a whip, they receive a desperate mayday call from an Inuit family that is stranded in the far north. Suddenly, Gannon and Wyatt's expedition to study climate change and Greenlandic culture turns into something far more dangerous--a mission to save lives. As they rush north to rescue the family, led by Inuit guides, the brothers must steer clear of deadly hidden crevasses, hungry polar bears, and bitter cold as they race into an Arctic super-storm, putting even more lives in jeopardy--their own. In the tradition of the historic journals kept by explorers such as Lewis and Clark, Dr. David Livingstone, and Captain James Cook comes the adventure series Travels with Gannon and Wyatt . From Africa to the South Pacific, these twin brothers have traveled the world. You never know what they will encounter as they venture into the wild, but one thing is certain wherever Gannon and Wyatt go, adventure is their constant companion. You can find Gannon and Wyatt's blog, photographs, and video footage from their real-life expeditions at travelswithgannonandwyatt.com.",
