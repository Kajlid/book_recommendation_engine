  "title": "Prophets Unarmed: Chinese Trotskyists in Revolution, War, Jail, and the Return from Limbo",
  "description": "Prophets Unarmed is an authoritative sourcebook on the Chinese Communist Party’s main early opposition, the Chinese Trotskyists. Opposed from Moscow by Stalin, and by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in China, the Trotskyists were China’s most persecuted political party. Though harassed nearly out of existence their standpoints and proposals—reproduced here—are not without relevance to China’s present political moment. Drawing on dozens of oral history interviews with survivors, this study of Chinese Trotskyism is exhaustive and groundbreaking.",
