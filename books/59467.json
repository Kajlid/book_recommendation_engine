Then the notoriously not-so-sharp Herbie Fisher walks in, and the pleasant atmosphere turns to ice. Herbie convinces Bill Eggers, managing partner of Woodman & Weld, to sign him as a client - with the goal of taking down infamous mafia boss Carmine Datilla. And even though Stone doesn't want to have anything to do with Herbie, or the mafia for that matter, he is soon coerced into the job by Eggers. With the help of ex-partner Dino, Stone investigates \"Datilla the Hun\" and the rest of the family - encountering intrigue and danger at every turn.
