  "description": "The young elven prince. His surly knight. Eryx is at the end of his rope. He has to deal with a mouthy princeling who pisses him off to new ends, all the while dodging rumors of his alleged romantic entanglement with the prince. But when sparks fly between the two of them, Eryx must decide if he will follow his attraction for the infuriating man or his loyalty to the crown. Kestriel can't help his attraction to the older knight. He is rough all over and looks like he would have no problem telling Kestriel exactly what he should be doing. Will he pursue Eryx or let the knight go on avoiding him? Sometimes, what is right isn't always what we choose...Note: This book contains explicit MM content and an overly possessive knight, as well as some mild BDSM elements.",
