  "description": "Finding yourself right back at square one is never easy. For Lena Maye, it’s downright devastating. Even with the one person who could lead her to her father presumed dead, and a power-hungry empress holding half of her teammates captive, her only wish has been to return to a normal life one day and see her father again. However, with the Bane once again free and tension building not only between their two countries, but amongst her own teammates, it’s becoming clear that no one else is willing to sit around and wait for a leader who might never show. Instead, with a risky plan in place and secret threats made, they plot to travel to her home country, both to rescue their friends and to search out the one thing that may possibly stop the Bane. But they’re not the only ones who are after these ancient powers. And the Empress is closer to her goals than even she realizes. The race for the world is on.",
