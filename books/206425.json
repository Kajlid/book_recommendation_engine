  "title": "Poses for Artists Volume 2 - Standing Poses: An essential reference for figure drawing and the human form",
  "description": "This book was created by an artist who understands that sometimes, you just need a creative nudge to help get the pencil moving and break that pesky block. By simplifying the human form, we hope to remove the inevitable anxiety that comes with drawing a person, and speed-up your art, over time, increasing your own understanding of human anatomy, proportions and movement.",
