  "description": "Aubrey Rines is a professional singer who has built her career on worship. But in her real life she feels very far from God. If she’s honest, she’s not even sure she believes anymore and her choices reflect her heart. Suddenly and tragically, Aubrey loses her whole world in a single afternoon and is left distraught, humiliated and abandoned. In an effort to rebuild her life, she tries to maintain a relationship with her husband Ethan and her children Luke and Lily. At the prodding of her mother, pastor and therapist, she reluctantly begins work at her mother’s church where she meets Mark whose gritty, tough nature forces her to face her demons head on. With everyone else at the reins of her life, Aubrey stumbles and fails to find a connection anywhere. It isn't until things are disrupted again that she finally stands up and takes control.Through song she is able to confront God about her issues and He revels to her the life she so desperately needs. The Healing Song isn't a story about finding the right person to complete Aubrey; it's about finding herself in God and letting the rest of the pieces fall into place.",
