An unexpected turn of events can leave even the toughest ones lost without hope... Hope of ever recovering, of ever wanting to see tomorrow, of ever feeling true happiness again.With the help of Cassandra Tyce, Jaxon will learn that sometimes, lying to oneself can be the sole reason a person stays torn.*This book contains adult situations and some explicit language.*",
