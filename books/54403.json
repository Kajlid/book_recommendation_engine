  "description": "Never give up. Never say die.  That's the most important advice his hard-as-nails instructor, Scott Syracuse, gives hover car racing phenomenon Jason Chaser. Combined with Jason's guts, determination, and talent, that advice brings Jason within a hairsbreadth of victory over his archrival, Xavier Xonora, at the international Racing School's Sponsors' Tournament. Even more amazing, Jason finds himself with a sponsor for the Italian Run, a prestigious professional race.  Nothing in Jason's tumultuous first year at the International Racing School prepares him for the culture shock of race fever in Italy. Luxury hotels, glamorous parties, media frenzy, hundreds of thousands of screaming fans lining the streets...and more intrigue and dirty dealing than Jason's ever faced. Can Jason stay focused and keep Syracuse's advice in mind? And at what cost?  How did Jason Chaser make it to the Sponsors' Tournament? Read the first book in the Hover Car Racer trilogy, Crash Course.",
