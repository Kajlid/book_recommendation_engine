  "title": "Through the Eyes of a Child Before, During and After WWII in Poland",
  "description": "Sitting down with her childhood diaries and notes scribbled during the war years, Martyna Parsons wanted to write a book to honour the memory of her father and the woman who brought her up whom she called “Mother”.This is a different story of the war years in Poland. A compelling account of what happened to ordinary Poles at that time and particularly to a young Catholic girl and her family, as seen through her eyes and told in her “voice”. It is beautifully descriptive, sometimes magical and at the same time a well-documented tale of historical importance. It is Martyna’s story. How will the girl and her family survive? Will she be reunited with her father? Will he still know the girl who is no longer a child and how will she be affected by what she has experienced?This is the story of a young girl whose childhood and early adolescence are interrupted by the trauma of World War 2, yet it is a story of hope, spirit and optimism for life yet to come.",
