  "description": "When sexy Dom Sebastian sees Ashley, he can’t seem to take his eyes off her. She will become his love. His pet. His slave. He’s cared for her since high school but he was different then. He was scrawny and geeky and unpopular. The only times Ashley knew he existed were the times when she was making fun of him. Ashley had been in control her entire life but things were about to change. Sebastian has been reunited with Ashley and is now intent on training her to become the obedient, submissive woman who will please his every need, his every whim. Careful to conceal his identity, Sebastian hides behind a mask, hoping she doesn’t recognize him. Only there is something strangely familiar about his piercing baby blues. He doesn’t reveal his name to her, instructing Ashley to address him only as Sir. He often refers to her as Wildcat, the screen name she used to meet men online. Sebastian spends months training Ashley to submit, but his feelings for her often get in the way. He tries to remain tough because he has vowed to never love again, never let another woman hurt him, but there’s something different about Ashley. She makes him want to be a better man. There has always been a soft spot in his heart for Ashley. Can Sebastian learn how to truly love someone and can Ashley love a man she’s never really known?",
