  "description": "“Truth or die” is the name of the game when a killer with a hidden agenda hijacks a murder-mystery weekend for writers. When it comes to murder at a business function, Jezebel Jinx has been there, done that, and barely made it out alive—but this time the stakes are much higher. One by one, her fellow writers are being poisoned, and the only way to get the antidote in time is to discover the secrets that link them all together as victims…as well as potential murderers. For as the game progresses, Jezebel realizes that while everyone has skeletons in their closet, some people have an entire cemetery—and nearly all the guests have a motive for murder. As the suspects begin to outnumber the innocent, the object of the game ceases to be unmasking a killer, but how to survive the night.",
