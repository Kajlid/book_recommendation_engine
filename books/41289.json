  "description": "Keep your friends close. Keep your nemesis closer.After nearly five years of avoiding him, Briggs Goswick may have appeared at my feet on horseback like a handsome white knight but, in fact, he is a certified man-child.Briggs may be many things―a society darling (annoying), attractive (so unfair), and heir to an elite family (helpful)―but after humiliating me at a ball several years ago, he is primarily my archnemesis.His presence has made this summer go from bad to…complicated. I have the weight of saving my family’s name and finances solely on my shoulders, while I endure an endless parade of dreary balls and insufferable suitors to make a favorable match. But I have another idea―a business venture―to save my family. All I need are investors.And as for Briggs? He’s hiding a secret as well: he’s flat broke.Now the person I loathe the most in this world is just as trapped as I am―both penniless and our households depending on us to save them. And I think I know how. All I have to do is play nice with the very devil I’ve sworn to hate…His society connections can boost me from near obscurity to help me win over investors for my business. And perhaps I can help him woo an aloof heiress with deep pockets. It’s a long shot. It might even work…but do I want it to?",
