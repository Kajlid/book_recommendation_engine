  "description": "After accidentally possessing a young man's body, Nathaniel finds himself in the arms of the beautiful girl he's supposed to be guarding. Though he didn't intend breaking God's rules, his wings are burnt off and he's dumped naked in the freezing ocean, not just for kissing Eloise, but for wanting more. Cold, injured and bleeding, Nathaniel has only one thing on his mind as he drags himself out of the swirling surf, and that's to see if Eloise has any romantic feelings for him. As he runs naked along the shore, Lucifer approaches Nathaniel, offering him a happy life with Eloise if he sells him his soul. When Nathaniel refuses, Lucifer gives him twenty-four hours before giving the deal to Devlin, Nathaniel's nemesis.",
