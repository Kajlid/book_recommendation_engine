  "description": "In Australia s 1930s, the Sinclair name is respectable and influential, yet the youngest son Rowland - an artist - has a talent for scandal. Even with the unemployed lining the streets, Rowland lives in a sheltered world... of wealth, culture & impeccable tailoring with the family fortune indulging his artistic passions & friends... a poet, a painter & a brazen sculptress. Mounting political tensions fuelled by the Great Depression take Australia to the brink of revolution. Rowland Sinclair is indifferent to the politics... until a brutal murder exposes an extraordinary & treasonous conspiracy. The real enemy is Labor s Jack Lang and the Communist hordes into whose hands he plays... What say I introduce you to some chaps? What chaps? Right thinking men. Loyalists who love this country... Rowland, I think you could be moving with the wrong crowd.",
