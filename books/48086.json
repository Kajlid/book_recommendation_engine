  "description": "On the edge of our perception lie the \"worlds unseen,\" the quantum planes of existence that comprise our realm. While the beings of these worlds are invisible to us, we are well within their sights. This plane has become a battleground and the lives of all who swell here are at stake. A new threat has emerged, a being born into our plane in the form of an innocent, but with the ability to trap mankind in a new reality, a chaotic existence of pain and torment. The key to our future is held by a man with no past. Jack Monterey is hiding from memories he can't fully recall. A social outcast living in the slums of South Florida, he is plagued by internal demons and haunted by frightening dreams. Still, an unexplained sense of urgency pulls at him, refusing to let him rest. When his disjointed nightmares begin to intrude on his waking hours, they incite the emergence of disturbing abilities and fractured memories that can no longer be ignored. With the future of this plane at stake, Jack finds himself in a desperate race to uncover the truth before it's too late. Yet, within the twisted web of betrayal and deceit spun around him, the line between reality and deception may prove as elusive and as terrifying as his past.",
