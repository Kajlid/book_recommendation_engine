  "description": "To give is a virtue. But to give your very self, the ultimate bequest. Offered in love, it can be wondrous. Offered in desperation, it can be deadly.In Book Two of this three-part epic, young and tempting Kate Simmons at last seemed to have reached a safe haven of happiness when she moved in with Neil, ambitious and persevering, both in his legal practice and his love life. Taking great care to protect his trophy and the surprise he had in mind for Kate, Neil hired security to accompany his soon-to-be fiancée on a scavenger hunt of a lifetime. As Book Three continues their saga, it is life itself that is in the balance when Kate becomes the hunted as the jilted Roger snatches his prey.The obsessed minds of Neil and Roger now take aim squarely at each other — with a bare and exposed Kate directly in the crossfire. Knowing her very life will be the winner’s spoil, Kate stares agony in its ghastly face as it approaches for the death dance. There is no time, no place, no safety in a war of fixation. A war in which the winner will be either the last one standing, or the last one to die.",
