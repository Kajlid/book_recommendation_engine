  "title": "The Green Poodles",
  "description": "Here is a good yarn complete with dogs, a newcomer in the family, a mystery - and a happy ending. There are mixed feelings when the Greens of Pond Farm learn that an orphan cousin from England, Fern, is coming to them in Texas. Twelve year old Allan is pleased; he will have a playmate. Fern brings with her a champion silver poodle, Juliet, and - strange baggage - her half of a one time valuable portrait of an ancestor, Nathaniel Green. As the season advances, the youngsters are absorbed in training Juliet's puppies, and in planning for a dream kennel. Then comes their chance, when they help catch a thief set on stealing Fern's picture. The eventual disposal of the painting to a museum nets enough money to provide the start of the hoped-for kennel.",
