  "description": "What is it like to be \"out\" in high school today? Is homophobia still rampant, or have things changed? How do the reactions of students, teachers, administrators, and families affect the out gay student? A Vigil for Joe Rose is a collection of stories told with empathy and humour about the experience of being out in high school. As a unified collection, these eight short stories and a novella chart the journey of the main characters from first coming out to their growth into confident young gay men, and the challenges, triumphs, and losses along the way. A unique \"insider's look\" told from the point-of-view of teens in high school. Includes the hit novella The Last Coming Out Story What readers are saying about A Vigil for Joe Rose . . . \"Original and very compelling.\" \"An intelligent and elegant strike against prejudice that doesn't sacrifice readability in the name of issues.\" \"Written from the soul with great dignity, charm and wit.\" \"The characters are engaging and I still find myself thinking about them long after finishing.\" \"This definitely rises above the pack of recent coming out stories and adds interesting new dimensions.\" \"It should help to break down barriers in the struggle for acceptance, no matter how disillusioning it is to see that the battle still has to be fought. This is a great work.\"",
