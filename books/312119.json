  "description": "The recitations of the Koran, known in Arabic as the Qira'at, are conducted according to the rules of Tajwid. This method is attributed to Imam Warsh who himself obtained it from his teacher Nafi ‘al-Madani who was one of the transmitters of the seven recitations. The recitation of Warsh 'an Naafi' is one of the two major traditions of recitation. The second is that of Hafs 'an' Asim. Imam Warsh (110-197AE), whose real name is Uthman Ibn Sa‘id al-Qutbi, was born in Egypt. His nickname Warsh, a substance in milk, comes from his teacher Naafi 'because of his fair complexion. He studied his recitation according to Naafi 'in Medina. After completing his studies, he returned to Egypt where he became the senior reciter of the Koran. In the tenth century, the Muslim scholar Ibn Mujāhid canonized the seven readings of the Quran, including Warsh 'an Naafi'. However, only the transmission of Asim and Warsh remains influential. Although having emerged in Egypt, the recitation of Warsh 'an Naafi' has become widespread in North Africa. In medieval times, it was the main Koranic recitation in Al-Andalus. The transmission of Warsh 'an Naafi' represents the reciting tradition of Medina. It is, alongside the Hafs 'an' Asim tradition which represents the recitative tradition of Kufa, one of the two main oral transmissions of the Koran in the Muslim world. The influential Cairo Standard Qur'an which was published in 1924 is based on the recitation of Hafs' an ʻAsim.",
