This is Mara's story.Mara is finally going to escape. She is in love. And even her harsh, controlling, volatile father cannot keep her from running off with the boy who makes her feel beautiful. But on the day she and Julio plan to leave their desert village, the enemy sorcerers attack, burning it to the ground. The only survivors are a handful of children, and seventeen-year-old Mara has no choice but to lead them. She must make it through the mountains to the rumored rebel camp and protect the children following her. She might lose everything--and everyone--she's ever loved, but what she finds will lead her down a path that will change the world. Told from Mara's point-of-view, The Shattered Mountain is an alternate perspective of the beginning of the acclaimed The Girl of Fire and Thorns.",
