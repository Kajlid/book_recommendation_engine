  "title": "Through the Window: Seventeen Essays",
  "description": "From the Man Booker Prize-winning author of The Sense of an Ending and one of Britain’s greatest a brilliant collection of essays on the books and authors that have meant the most to him throughout his illustrious career. In these seventeen essays (plus a short story and a special preface, “A Life with Books”), Julian Barnes examines the British, French and American writers who have shaped his writing, as well as the cross-currents and overlappings of their different cultures. From the deceptiveness of Penelope Fitzgerald to the directness of Hemingway, from Kipling’s view of France to the French view of Kipling, from the many translations of Madame Bovary to the fabulations of Ford Madox Ford, from the National Treasure status of George Orwell to the despair of Michel Houellebecq, Julian Barnes considers what fiction is, and what it can do. As he writes, “Novels tell us the most truth about what it is, how we live it, what it might be for, how we enjoy and value it, and how we lose it.”",
