  "description": "Drugs, bikers and a prison riot provide surprising plot twists in this rough-and-tumble romance novel when a troubled college student and an ex-con try to undo the past. Karen Black's story \"From the Chrysalis\" is based on the most deadly prison uprising in Canadian history, the Kingston Penitentiary Riot of April 1971. Recommended for over 18. Some readers may be disturbed by the violence in the prison and/or the first cousin romance.\"From the Chrysalis\" is the twisted and winding tale of Liza and her dashing and dangerous older cousin Dace Devereux. Set in Canada, it is the tale of a relationship blighted by uncomprehending relatives, social conventions, a harrowing stint in Maitland Penitentiary (complete with riots and semi-totalitarian \"people's committees\"), the well-intentioned galumph Mel, and a conundrum Liza has to bear calling for an ever more inevitable decision. The prison scenes, with their occasionally stark violence but underlying ethical probity are especially fascinating, but there's also lots of romantic tension, a kind of yearning whose fulfilment seems always out of reach, even when its physical manifestation is realized.
