  "description": "My name is Ria. Like Leah, but with an R? My life is pretty normal, I guess. I’m a waitress at the one and only Mexican restaurant in my tiny little no-Starbuck’s town, I live in a fairly typical studio apartment, and I people watch at the local bar in my spare time.  Well, I guess normal isn’t quite the right word. After all, normal people can’t control other people’s emotions with just a touch. Tantalizing pleasure, exhilarating joy, even paralyzing fear—I can make you feel it all, or I can take it all away. Drain you of every single emotion.  I try really hard not to, though. Normal, remember?  But things start to go from almost normal to straight-up bizarre when not one, but four insanely gorgeous men stumble into my life. And if you thought I wasn’t normal, these guys have me beat any day.  They aren’t even human.  A slow burn reverse harem fantasy romance.",
