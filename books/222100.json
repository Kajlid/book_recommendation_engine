The search to learn more about her birth family drives Natalie to renovate the dilapidated chateau into a stylish bed-and-breakfast complete with \"First Crush\" wine tastings amongst the estate's lush vineyards. Nick Hardaway never recovered from his sister’s death—a victim of the mysterious Lakeview Slayer. Determined to push past the crushing guilt he feels, Nick joins Natalie in her renovations of the chateau. But a killer lurks among the tendrils and branches of the vineyards. And he has his sights set on Natalie.\"This was a good clean book, very suspenseful, couldn't put it down. I don't usually do reviews but this one deserves it.\"\"I really enjoy a good mystery set in an unusual location. The plot and character development was excellent. Did not want to put the book down.\"\"A very good well written book. This is not about a person's first crush with another. Honestly, I almost did not get this book because I thought it would be a juvenile romance - first crush. Even though a romance does occur, it's a mystery with danger, destruction, joy, love & so much more.\"Written for the General Market (G) (I) : Contains little or no; sexual dialogue or situations or strong language. May also contain content of an inspirational nature.",
