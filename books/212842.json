  "title": "Exchanging Van Goghs",
  "description": "The story of a correspondence between a recluse and a young artist that touches on their shared fascination with painters, music and the nature of light. They send each other postcards with reproductions of art by Van Gogh, Monet, Morisot, Manet, Rothko and others, as their lives slowly intertwine.\"Last year a lone sunflower started growing in the south garden. Maybe a seed blew in from a neighbor's yard. Maybe it was a touch of Vincent's spirit. I started noticing the flower would turn itself toward the sun in the morning, waking up. I thought that was magical. This year the sunflower did not return. So its magic was fleeting. I should probably plant some sunflower seeds, but I'm sure they would just flop over. Or the peonies would be jealous.\" -Rezzie in Exchanging Van Goghs",
