  "title": "Wisdom of the Marx Brothers: Life Lessons from Groucho, Chico, and Harpo",
  "description": "The Marx Brothers were one of a kind. Their comedic style blends zany slapstick with wit and sarcasm. Their films date back nearly a century, but the comedy is timeless. The humor stems from keen observations and commentary on human nature—which never gets old. Humor is unvarnished truth—if it weren’t true, it wouldn’t be funny. The films of the Marx Brothers offer many funny moments, many truths, many life lessons. Within these pages you will find a dozen life lessons gleaned from the films and lives of Groucho, Chico and Harpo. May your life by enriched by the Wisdom of the Marx Brothers.",
