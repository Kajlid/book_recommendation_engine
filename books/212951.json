  "title": "GOOD FRIEND Volume 1: Neighborly",
  "description": "“What’s the nicest thing you’ve ever done for a friend?” When Sally stumbles upon a website with the single purpose of asking people to share answers to this question, she quickly grows bored with the innocent tales posted there. Mischievous by nature, she submits one of her racier stories with the hope of inspiring future posters to turn up the heat. She describes the events of helping out her neighbors after overhearing marital problems from the bedroom next door. She lures husband Bob astray with some carefully curated voyeurism and the flame she stokes burns out of control one Sunday morning while the wife and kids are away. But Sally isn’t your garden variety, home-wrecker whore. There’s a method to her minxy madness. Does Bob believe she’s doing this as a favor for him? He might want to think again. THIS STORY IS INTENDED STRICTLY FOR ADULTS. Meaning be 18 if you want to read it. It contains potentially controversial adult themes and all the crude language one would expect to describe them in glorious detail. 6000+ words.",
