  "description": "Oedipus the King - Antigone - Electra - AjaxTrachinian Women - Philoctetes - Oedipus at ColonusThe greatest of the Greek tragedians, Sophocles wrote over 120 plays, surpassing his older contemporary Aeschylus and the younger Euripides in literary output as well as in the number of prizes awarded his works. Only the seven plays in this volume have survived intact. From the complex drama of Antigone, the heroine willing to sacrifice life and love for a principle, to the mythic doom embodied by Oedipus, the uncommonly good man brought down by the gods, Sophocles possessed a tragic vision that, in Matthew Arnold's phrase, \"saw life steadily and saw it whole.\"This one-volume paperback edition of Sophocles' complete works is a revised and modernized version of the famous Jebb translation, which has been called \"the most carefully wrought prose version of Sophocles in English.\"**Moses Hadas",
