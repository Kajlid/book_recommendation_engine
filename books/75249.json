  "description": "In 1848 women can expect a few bumps along the Oregon Trail. Corinne Temple, age seventeen, has a few ridiculous challenges to face outside the river crossings, snakes, Indians, accidental gunshots and finding enough privacy to be clean along the grimy trail. When Corinne’s marriage of convenience gets less convenient she turns to some new friends in the wagon train who help her see the hope for the future. They teach her to take the time to dance and celebrate the small victories, to have faith and determination through the hardest things a person can face. Corinne’s journey takes her from the cobblestone streets of fashionable Boston to the rugged mountains of the west, across rivers and deserts, from sea to shining sea. A faithful heart gets this young woman through the hardest days on the trail, her skills and resolve show her and others how a woman can rise from circumstances and survive. Join her as she discovers her own strength and resilience in … Seeing the Elephant.(Previously released as Seeing The Elephant, revised, rewritten and professionally edited.)",
