  "title": "Boys Will Be Toys",
  "description": "There is probably something in the water in Greendale, Illinois, or perhaps it’s just in the water at the drinking fountains at Central High School, but there is an unusually large percentage of very handsome, very well-hung and very horny boys in Central High. And, there is certainly something in the air: It’s gay sex, and the boys and men in Boys Will be Toys are masters of the art.Take Andy Dowd, for example. He’s not only handsome, hung and horny, but also he’s the very model of the fabled “boy next door.” And, the boy living next door to him is Brig Day, also exemplifying the three H’s of Greendale, and very much in love with Andy.When Brig’s sister goes off to college, he inherits her bedroom, which has an excellent view of Andy’s bedroom – and the things he sees happening there are eye-awakening and erection-inspiring. It’s not long before Brig begins to live the life he has been only dreaming of and with the golden object of his love.Years later, when Brig is serving as Guidance Counselor at his alma mater, Greendale Central High School, Danny Thacker, one of the school’s two male cheerleaders, shares a seat with the achingly handsome and sexy star quarterback on a bus returning from an away game., and he intercepts the kind of pass he thought he might get from the quarterback only “when pigs fly.” The extremely passionate affair between quarterback and cheerleader hits some very rocky patches and finds final resolution in an especially high-class hustler bar in Chicago.Written in the characteristically frank and sex-driven style of John Butler’s many STARbooks novels, Boys Will be Toys will not disappoint gay readers looking to share sex vicariously with Butler’s seemingly tireless young studs.",
