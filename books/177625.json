  "description": "Anika's life has finally fallen into place. She has a career she loves, an apartment that, while small, meets her needs, and a best friend that is helping her find someone to spend the rest of her life with, or at the very least someone to have a good time with.  Zeke is only on Earth long enough to make repairs to some salvaged equipment and relax with the local natives. Just a few, short weeks and then he, and his shipmates are on their way back to their home world. Then he catches Anika's scent and his wolf is gone.  Unable, and unwilling, to fight the instant attraction Zeke soon finds himself head over heels, but will the secret he's keeping cause him to lose his mate? Meanwhile, Anika has a secret of her own that could end up having a huge impact on the coupleâ€™s future.  Disclaimer- This story has several graphic sex scenes and some mild language.",
