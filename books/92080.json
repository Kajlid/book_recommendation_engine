  "description": "This novella set in the world of The Lux Guardians introduces friends Melody Fylan and Tyr Dahl, residents of the contained world of Underground London Zone in 2033. Melody and Tyr, like all civilians of Forgotten London, are forced to remain obedient in order to avoid the Officials’ wrath—but they are allied with The Guardians. They risk their lives by leaking information in the hopes that one day they will be freed of their underground existence. Melody’s life is stable and ordinary but when something is exposed about her nature—a secret the Officials are both responsible for creating and hiding—it threatens to tear apart not only her friendship with Tyr and her carefully constructed life, but the entire Underground London Zone. (Can be read as stand alone)",
