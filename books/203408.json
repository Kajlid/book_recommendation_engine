  "description": "Position available: Wife, full-time, live-in. Alex Woodward - thirty-five years old, intelligent, successful, devilishly handsome. Why would a man with those qualifications want to hire a personnel company to find him a wife? Not any personnel company, mind you, but his friend Caitlin's company. For some reason that Caitlin couldn't fathom, Alec was counting on her to find him a wife! Well, there were some things a man had to do for himself, and Caitlin wanted no part of Alec's crazy scheme. But the question still rankled - why hadn't Alec thought to ask Caitlin if she was interested in the position?",
