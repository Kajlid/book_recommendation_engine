  "description": "Abra has her life in order. Selling vibrant oil-pastel angels that she paints makes her a comfortable living. At noon a handsome stranger strides onto her property to mess with all her plans. Val sparks a passionate flame of desire with his shifting eyes and cocky remarks. His presence causes her to question the faith she's always held in herself. She can't get him out of her mind no matter how hard she tries. His regular noonday visits leave her wanting, and she soon realizes he's more than he appears to be. It's only a matter of time before she sins.",
