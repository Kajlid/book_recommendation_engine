  "description": "Tomie dePaola serves as \"biographer\" to his delightful Italian sorceress, Strega Nona, in this beautifully drawn prequel. The tale begins with little Nona's birth on a dark and stormy night, and ends where the original Strega Nona picks up-with Strega Nona taking on the bumbling, knock-kneed Big Anthony as an apprentice. This winsome story is illustrated throughout with Tomie dePaola's warm and sunny watercolors! \"dePaola does a splendid job of working this sparkling tale into the Strega Nona canon.\" - Publishers Weekly",
