  "title": "They Called Her Reckless: A True Story of War, Love And One Extraordinary Horse",
  "description": "A small Korean pony, Reckless was acquired by some U.S. Marines during the Korean War to haul ammunition to the front lines -- and, in short order, became the real-life warhorse of the Marine Fifth Regiment. It is an incredible story of a Jeju pony and her buddies, forging a bond that enabled her to give so much more than anyone ever expected, and her Marines to return a love that continues to this day. The memories of many of those who knew her in wartime and thereafter, and 14 pages of photos, will underscore why Sergeant Reckless is honored still.",
