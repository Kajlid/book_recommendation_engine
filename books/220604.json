  "description": "What Lord Worsley really wants is a wife who can excite him, but what he ended up with was an engagement borne of necessity to his sister’s friend. So when Miss Damara Onslow intercepts his carriage on his way to his country estate, he’s immediately drawn to both her bold spirit and her beauty. Even more exciting is the offer she money in exchange for marriage. More than happy to get out of the marriage he was dreading, he agrees, and soon they are husband and wife. From the moment they exchange vows, it appears as if he's found the perfect lady, and his marriage is the love match he's always wanted. But not everyone is happy about it. To make matters worse, he never thought to ask Damara why she was so eager to get married, and the truth might be the undoing of them both.
