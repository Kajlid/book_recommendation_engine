  "description": "Cambridge, 1921  When amateur sleuth Jonty Stewart comes home with a new case to investigate, his partner Orlando Coppersmith always feels his day has been made. Although, can there be anything to solve in the apparent mercy killing of a disabled man by a doctor who then kills himself, especially when everything takes place in a locked room?  But things are never straightforward where the Cambridge fellows are concerned, so when they discover that more than one person has a motive to kill the dead men — motives linked to another double death — their wits get stretched to the breaking point.  And when the case disinters long buried memories for Jonty, memories about a promise he made and hasn’t kept, their emotions get pulled apart as well. This time, Jonty and Orlando will have to separate fact from fiction — and truth from emotion — to get to the bottom of things.  Word 64,500; page 240",
