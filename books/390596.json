  "description": "Gussie Fink-Nottle has locked himself away in the country studying newts ever since he came into his estate. So it is a surprise when Bertie hears that Gussie is not only in London, but he is there to woo Madeline Bassett! At odds with Jeeves over the decorum of a white jacket, Bertie decides to take on Gussie's problem himself. Off to Brinkley Court, Bertie must deal with the prize-giving at Market Snodsbury Grammar School, the broken engagement of his cousin Angela, and the resignation of Anatole, his aunt's genius chef. Will Jeeves be able to sort out the mess?",
