  "description": "Dark secrets continue to gather in the once-perfect world of Elizabeth Lancaster. Lizzie’s memory has returned, but remembering doesn’t help her find the answers she’s been looking for. Rob is gone. Her friends have become distant. And now, she is finding herself tempted to walk away from Cain Atchley, who holds her heart. Hoping to put some of the previous year’s madness behind her, Lizzie travels to North Dakota to attend college. While there, she stays with old friends of her family—the Howards. She finds solace in her new relationships with most of the family, especially Nick. But she has history with one Howard in particular that she would soon rather forget.The annual Lancaster Harvest is being held in December this year, so Lizzie can remain involved. A masquerade Christmas ball will be the main event at the Lancaster manor. With guests dressed in Victorian attire and masks to hide identities, Lizzie will make acquaintances that will impact her future, and she will unknowingly come face to face with her past. While many changes occur in Lizzie’s life, some things refuse to be left behind. The darkness that has haunted her dreams has now become a reality. An apparition in the form of Rob Jacobs comes to her each night, causing Lizzie to question what is real. She even starts to wonder about the truth behind her daddy’s story of The Three Crowns. What will fate reveal to Elizabeth Lancaster? And will she be able to face what lies ahead of her, or will she become lost in the shadows once more?",
