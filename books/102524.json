  "description": "Knocked up and laid off. What else could possibly go wrong?Kate Martin is about to find out.Unexpectedly pregnant, facing a huge restructuring at her job and doomed to play bridesmaid for her perfect Barbie sister, Kate Martin's world is in turmoil.As a happily married, modestly ambitious editor of a you’ve-never-heard-of-it trade magazine, motherhood would seem to be coming at the perfect time for Katie. But she’s just not sure she’s ready for the Mommy-track. She has career aspirations beyond the crappy little magazine where she works, U.S. Water Works, and editing fun and informative articles like ‘When Sump Pumps Go Bad,’ and ‘Wastewater and You: Win-Win or No-No?’She’s not sure these goals will mesh with diapers and lullabies and the selfless, 24/7 world of being a mom. It’s not that she doesn't want to be a mom; she just doesn’t want to be one right now. Why can’t ovaries have ‘pause’ buttons? Like biological Tivo.Add to this the horror of the wearing a Barney-purple, Scarlett O-Hara-ready bridesmaid’s dress at perfect baby sister Melanie’s wedding. And the anniversary party for her parents Katie has been saddled with planning. Parents who, like a couple of sullen teenagers, seem most concerned about having an open bar.But the real question is, will she even have a job? In a time of downsizing and cutbacks, Katie fears that, the larger her belly grows, so does the target on her back.",
