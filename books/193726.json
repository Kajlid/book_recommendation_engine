  "description": "Ripe cheeks. A firm hand. When control edges toward obsession, will Gabrielle and Summer seek rescue or surrender to unfathomable forms of discipline?  In Nanny State, Summer expects her new landlady to treat her like an adult. Fat chance! Victoria exerts control over every aspect of Summer’s life. Landlady soon becomes Nanny, coaxing Summer into the big bed for suckling, discipline and, yes, even diapers. But when Summer wants to include a girl her own age in their play, will Nanny punish wayward Summer or accept another charge into their uncommon household?  In Seven Kisses, Gabrielle’s life changes drastically the day she stumbles upon a creepy Victorian hospital. When she finds out Loindici Manor is actually a rehab clinic, she figures the place must be packed with celebrities. Wouldn’t it be cool to spend a week spying on rock stars? Gabrielle has no clue what she’s getting herself into when she submits to the care of sadistic Madame de Villeneuve. Horrors quickly compound as her cruel psychoanalyst subjects her to reprehensible treatments, including therapy by beast. Little does Madame know that the young beauty’s beast might just be her ticket out of sinister Loindici Manor.  Two erotic novels by award-winning queer Canadian author Giselle Renarde.",
