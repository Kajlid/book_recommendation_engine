  "title": "Alice's Cabinet of Curiosities: “Alice's Adventures in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice found there”",
  "description": "\"Delightfully Gloomy\" Alice's Cabinet of Curiosities contains both original works \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice found there\" by Lewis Carrol, but with a twist! Everything is... dead. Artist Alice Von Gotha illustrated this edition of the stories and added some dark and eccentric aesthetics to it. All illustrations resemble exhibits that can be found in Cabinets of Curiosities around the world. From animal skeletons on displays, skulls and bones, to weird flowers, peculiar objects and majestic suits of armour! Get ready to plunge in a magical world of fantasy created by Lewis Carroll, and decorated with dismal, yet beautiful artwork.",
