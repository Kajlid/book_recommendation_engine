  "description": "The sequel to Eclipse, THe Girl Who Saved the World  Eclipse... World’s Greatest Tween Superhero! World’s Most Terrifying Tween Supervillain! Opinions differ.  Meet Eclipse. She's twelve. She’s hardworking, bright, self-reliant, good with tools, vigorously physically fit, tough as nails, still young enough to disguise herself as a boy. She’s a superhero—persona, they’re called on her time line: She flies, shrugs off bullets and artillery shells, and shatters fortifications with a glance. She had a bit of a problem with her mom. Her mom threw her out of the house. Then Mom blew up the house and disappeared.  Now Eclipse and her friends are on our Earth. They were sent here to beat the Two Dooms. If the Two Dooms win, we all die. Eclipse knows one certain fact. Whether she stops them or not, she probably gets to die trying.",
