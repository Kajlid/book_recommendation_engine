  "description": "Lady by day, Robin Hood by night...\n  Arabella Knightley is an earl’s granddaughter, but it’s common knowledge that she spent her early years in London’s gutters. What the ton doesn’t know is that while Arabella acts the perfect young lady by day, at night she plays Robin Hood, stealing from the wealthy to give to the poor.  Adam St Just is one of Society’s most sought after bachelors. He’s also the man responsible for Arabella Knightley’s nickname: Miss Smell o’ Gutters—a mistake he regrets, but can never erase.  Bored by polite society, Adam sets out to unmask the elusive thief ... but he’s not prepared for what he discovers.  A Regency romance featuring a tarnished heiress, an altruistic thief, a meddling marquis, and a gentleman who thinks very highly of his pedigree.",
