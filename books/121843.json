But is it Patrick’s job to save the day? Or is simply celebrating love enough to quell the family chaos?Gracing the page with his signature blend of humor and heart, Steven Rowley delivers the long-awaited sequel to a beloved story, all about the complicated bonds of family, love, and what it takes to rediscover yourself, even at the ripe age of fifty.",
