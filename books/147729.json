  "title": "Home for Christmas: Stories for Young and Old",
  "description": "For readers who are tired of Christmas commercialism, or who feel that Santa Claus and reindeer don't tell the whole story, these classic gems provide a winning alternative. Selected for their insightfulness, spiritual value, and literary quality (nothing moralistic here) they project the spirit of the season in a fresh, compelling manner that will resonate with readers of all ages - from children too young to read to themselves, to parents and grandparents who enjoy reading stories aloud.Home for Christmas includes time-tested favorites by some of the world's most beloved children's authors - Pearl Buck, Selma Lagerlof, Henry van Dyke, Madeleine L'Engle, Elizabeth Goudge, Rebecca Caudill, and Ruth Sawyer - as well as little-known European stories appearing in English for the first time.",
