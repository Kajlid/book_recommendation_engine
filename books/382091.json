  "title": "Darwin, His Daughter, and Human Evolution",
  "description": "In a chest of drawers bequeathed by his grandmother, author Randal Keynes discovered the writing case of Charles and Emma Darwin’s beloved daughter Annie Darwin, who died at the age of ten. He also found the notes Darwin kept throughout Annie's illness, the eulogy he delivered at her funeral—and provocative new insights into Darwin’s views on nature, evolution, and the human condition. In Darwin, His Daughter & Human Evolution , Keynes shows that Darwin was not \"a cold intellect with no place for love in his famous 'struggle for existence,' [but]...a man of uncommon warmth\" ( Scientific American ). The True Story of Charles Darwin is now a major motion picture and the movie tie-in paperback is also available from Riverhead Books.",
