  "description": "From the bestselling author of Night Prey and Winter Prey, Lucas Davenport is back in another great thriller. It was raining when psychiatrist Andi Manette left the parent-teacher conference with her two young daughters. She was distracted and barely noticed the red van parked beside her, barely noticed the van door slide open as they dashed up to their car. But she did notice the hand reaching out for her and the voice from out of the past. And then the Manette family was gone.Hours later, deputy chief Lucas Davenport stood in the parking lot, a blood-stained shoe in his hand, the ground stained pink around him, and knew that this would be one of the worst cases he'd ever been on. With an urgency born of dread, he presses the attack, while in an isolated farmhouse, Andi Manette does the same, summoning all her skills to battle an obsessed captor. She knows the man who has taken her and her daughters, knows there is a chink in his armor, if only she can find it. But for both her and Davenport, time is running out.John Sandford's novels have always been extraordinary for their harrowing twists, unforgettable characters, and crackling prose. Mind Prey tops them all. The work of a true master.",
