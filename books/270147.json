  "description": "They say that college is a time to make mistakes and be reckless because we’re protected from the real world. We’re living in a bubble with no real consequence. They say we should take advantage of it before that bubble pops and we’re on our own.So I did what any reasonable person would do, I took their advice. College for me meant parties, girls, fights, and football. I did it all and I did it too well. Until Amelia King came into my life and changed all my plans. I guess I changed her plans too.",
