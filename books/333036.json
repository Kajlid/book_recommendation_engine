  "title": "Things Worth Repeating?",
  "description": "Things Worth Repeating? is written to create three distinct but related poems, liberating both poet and reader with a free verse style and stanza flexibility. A reader may read each page in three first, in a zig-zag manner, scanning back and forth while moving down the page; second, from the top, but reading only the stanzas on the left side of the page; and third, from the top, but reading only the stanzas on the right. While this poetic form is different from Terrell's previous books, her emphasis on self-awareness as a means to social awareness is as present as ever. Readers are invited along as a poetic dialogue weaves and stretches through the book from beginning to end.",
