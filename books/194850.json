  "description": "Twelve-year-old Jack is going camping with his dad. It's been three summers since the accident that nearly killed his grandfather, and he hasn't been out in the bush since. This \"Guys' Get-Away\" was his parent's idea to help him overcome his fears. A little fishing, a little swimming. It all sounded pretty harmless. And it was. It was, that is, until Jack made a foolish choice. A decision that put him and his father in mortal danger. Now, not only does he have to overcome his past trauma, he has to rise above it to save his father. It will take all of Jack's know-how and determination, and more courage than he knew he had, to get his father and himself out of the forest alive.",
