  "title": "Feminist Felines",
  "description": "Feminist Felines is a must-have book for equal-rights advocates, cat lovers, and pun aficionados both young and old. It is a 34-page, full-color, hardback book with a pawsitive message and bright, hand-drawn illustrations. The story is based on my sister’s two cats and how they became fierce, feisty, feminist felines! Mischief and Tinker were both adopted from New York City animal shelters and their distinct and determined personalities are reflected in the tail. Equality for women—at school, in the workplace, and elsewhere—will be instrumental in eradicating many of humanity’s greatest problems. The story demonstrates how it’s in the best interest of all of us to support one another!",
