  "title": "Aristotle Detective",
  "description": "This is the first of three \"Aristotle Detective\" mysteries we’re publishing in Spring 2014.  Set in ancient Athens, it begins with a murder and ends with an exciting, public trial in which evidence–provided by Aristotle—clinches the case.  A student of Aristotle named Stephanos narrates, describing clues he doesn’t himself recognize, and marveling at his teacher's insights.  The action-packed story includes murderous attacks at night and a comical escape from the city in disguise. But all is informed by research about life in Athens,  332 BC: the architecture of homes, privileges of citizenship, the culture of olives, various qualities of pottery, the (lack of) rights of women, and the workings of the legal system in Athens.  Readers will enjoy the suspense of watching Aristotle teach Stephanos how to gather evidence and manage the case in order to save his family’s honor.",
