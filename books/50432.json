  "description": "Dear Author,\"How the fuck did I get into this predicament? And look at that fucker, standing behind me with that shit ass grin on his face. When I agreed to go to a party with him after the bar closed, I had no clue that this was the party.Jesus, he was so god damn sexy in the bar though. He had to be at least 5 years younger, perfect chiseled body. And when we kissed? Fuck! I couldn't keep my hands off of his tight ass. Damn I wanted that... well, look who's in the opposite position.Fuck! Oh well. Sigh. Fine. Suck me. Fuck me. Make me yours. I don't fucking care anymore. Hopefully, I can walk out of here in the morning without too many bruises. Shit, maybe I'll even ask him for his number when this is over, huh? I bet that will shock the shit out of him.\"Here's some more of what I'd like: The MC must be a rocker-like dude, long hair either shoulder length like in the pic or a little longer. Color doesn't matter. He can have tats, etc. But I'd like both guys to be men... no crying, whining -- unless MC is begging \"deeper, harder\". Some light BDSM, tying, spanking, pulling of hair. Names don't matter.Photo Description: Shirtless leather-clad blond rocker, bound on his knees in a black-padded room, in submissive position, leather thong laced around left upper arm.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice.
