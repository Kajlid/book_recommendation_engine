With the untimely death of her grandmother, she leaves the city and returns to the quiet town of New Haven, hoping emotions won't interfere while she mourns her loss. Gage Archer has also returned home to New Haven and to the pack he left behind. Luke Bainer views Gage as a threat to both his growing alpha position and his attraction to Rae. Developing feelings for a woman outside the pack can be dangerous. Where Gage will do anything to keep Rae safe, Luke has other ideas. As Rae struggles to control her special talent, no one is aware her gift is linked to a secret. A secret that could destroy Rae and the pack",
