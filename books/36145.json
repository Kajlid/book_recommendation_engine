  "title": "Letters from a Stoic",
  "description": "Like the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca’s Letters are a treasure of practical wisdom on how to live and enjoy life. The focus is on living a simple, stress-free life thorough the use of rationalism. The letters provide practical steps for people to deal with the human suffering that comes with life’s problems. Topics featured range from discussions on the shortness of life and anger to immortality and death. The Letters are part of the foundation of Stoic thought making Seneca one of the indispensable thinkers from Ancient Roman philosophy. Although Stoicism is not now as widely practiced as it once was, many people can still find wisdom and inspiration through Seneca's words and letters.  “In the last three years, I’ve begun to explore one philosophical system in particular: Stoicism. Through my preferred Stoic writer, Lucius Seneca, I’ve found it to be a simple and immensely practical set of rules for better results with less effort.”  Timothy Ferriss, author of Four Hour Workweek.  *Includes link to free audio recording of the Letters. *Image gallery. *Special low price.",
