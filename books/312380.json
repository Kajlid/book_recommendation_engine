He’s lived life as a bachelor and is at the peak of a rewarding career. Interested in the possibilities of another profitable venture, he views the town as a place to manage an extensive restaurant chain and finally settle down.Nora never expected to meet a man like Julian—all business, as well as a formidable opponent—or to be instantly attracted to his kind nature and faith in God.\nBut can Julian convince Nora he’s not the rival she fears?",
