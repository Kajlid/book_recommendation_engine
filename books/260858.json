  "description": "In Underlayes, another dimension where all sorts of nocturnal creatures reside, lies a school in which its main purpose is to teach the younger generations how to survive amongst humans.Like most teens, even those with supernatural powers and abilities, Elvira thinks that her days at Be Prepared High are a colossal waste of time. Especially Feeding 101, since she’s a cursed vampire that was born without fangs. She and her friends view most of the classes as useless since they never plan on venturing to the human realm. Why would they when Underlayes was made specifically for every factions’ safety, where they could roam free day or night with not a care in the worlds. But just like her parents always told her, sometimes you’re put into situations you can’t control. Elvira’s life takes an unexpected turn when a wizard hell bent on misplaced revenge kidnaps her and several of her friends. Not only does she send them with a one-way ticket to Detroit, Michigan, she sends them to a time when the tension amongst the races is at its highest. And having to deal with race issues is the one thing that has never even been so much as a thought to any of them and is the one course not on the roster.But will everything they’ve learned in school be enough to keep them alive? What will they all do when racism stares them in the face? Most importantly, how will they get back home?",
