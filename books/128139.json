  "description": "All were-mountain-lion Melody Marx ever wanted was to find her mate and start a family. After being rescued from her own people by two mountain lions, she knows that she’s found not just one mate, but two. She goes with them to their old home in Pennsylvania, but finds an even chillier reception than she found in Ashland.  Tristan and Micah Harrison would do anything to keep Melody safe, even if it means walking away from the Ashland Pride and their own family forever. When problems arise in their hometown of King, Pennsylvania, it turns out that the males aren’t the only ones who don’t approve of their mating.  Be prepared for two males with plans to hold onto their mate forever, a female searching for a place to call home, and an enemy who is always looking for new ways to wreak havoc in the males’ lives. This book contains sweet males, a feisty female, and m/f/m interaction.",
