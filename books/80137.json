  "title": "The Story of Ireland",
  "description": "Comic, colorful, and succinct, with short text-bytes, lots of pictures, and jokey captions, this is a brilliant introduction to the story of Ireland. From its pictorial endpaper maps to the panels of \"Irish Icons\" ranging from Brian Boru to the Abbey Theatre, it is packed with useful and fascinating information. A story that is often complicated and turbulent is told with sensitivity and clarity, from the first legends right up to the present day. The Story of Ireland is the follow-up to Richard Brassey and Stewart Ross's The Story of Scotland, which won the Saltire Society/TES Award for Educational Publications and the Scottish Arts Council Children's Book Award.",
