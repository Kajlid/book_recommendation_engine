They thought they’d escaped notice, until the Nhia-Samri mercenary nation starts sending death squads after them. What they uncover shatters everyone’s understanding of reality.To survive Ticca and Lebuin must piece together the clues left by a dead time traveling mage and find a way to stop the shadowy Nhia-Samri mercenaries from destroying the alliance kingdoms. Events spiral out of control as they discover shocking truths about their attackers, themselves, and how time itself has been manipulated. Joined by unexpected allies, they must play the deadly games in a race for forbidden knowledge hoping to prevent the coming war.With legendary powers awakening, manipulated histories discovered, advanced technology escaping government efforts to suppress it, wizards magically altering reality, and gods annoyingly pushing people around without explaining a thing, Thread Strands is the exciting continuation of the Golden Threads Trilogy. Thread Strands is a 135,900-word epic fantasy/speculative sci-fi novel and the second book of a trilogy set in a distant future consisting of both high technology and magic.",
