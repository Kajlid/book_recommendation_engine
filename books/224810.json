  "title": "The Dog Lover Unit: Lessons in Courage from the World's K9 Cops",
  "description": "An acclaimed poet, Rachel Rose never expected to spend her nights careening along the roads in high-speed chases or searching the woods for armed suspects. Yet once she decided to meet the people who devoted their lives to police K9 units, she found herself signing up for the ride-alongs, training runs, and other challenges that these courageous people-and canines-face on a daily basis.In The Dog Lover Unit, Rose introduces readers to police dogs and their handlers in the United States, Canada, Britain, and France (where their group's official name translates as \"the dog lover unit\"). She's there to catch a criminal with Constable Matt Noel and Blackie; to patrol with Sheriff Gene Davis and Gunner; and to witness the tragic funeral of Constable Dave Ross, where K9 Danny follows the coffin, looking for his master.With insight, humor, and awe, this book reveals the feats that these human and canine teams accomplish and the emotional and physical risks that they take for one another, and for us.",
