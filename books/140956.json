Rowling's bestselling books. From the invisibility cloak to house passwords to Fred and George Weasley's Extendable Ears, \"Harry Potter & the Art of Spying\" is full of spy lessons for the secret-agent-in-training in the Muggle realm. Learn how to break secret codes, gather intelligence, read character's motives, and why Severus Snape is the best double agent ever.",
