  "description": "Rule number 123: Once upon a time is for fairy tales, not for broken ex dancers who live at home with Daddy and a textbook evil stepmother, and who only manage to get through life by counting every single step.  Amy knows her rules inside out…who to spend time with, what to eat, what to drink and what to do—until danger shows up in a leather jacket on a shiny chrome motorbike. Suddenly, breaking the rules, or making up new ones, seems to be all she can manage no matter how hard she tries, and her rigid control starts to slip.  Peder’s violent past has shaped him into the man he is, much the way he has learned to shape dolls with the help of his grandfather. He used to have only one rule in his life, courtesy of his absent brother and their shared gang past. When Peder becomes trapped in a fresh web of lies and family ties. He must decide if he should start breaking the rules he didn’t know he lived by to take a chance on a future with Amy.",
