  "description": "Micah Kennedy has lived with PTSD for years. He is an expert at hiding his struggles behind the quick wit and snark that is very much a part of his makeup. His need to keep a promise to a dying comrade feeds his nightmares and invades his dreams—until that promise brings him military K-9 Delta.  Hawk McKinnon has spent most of his life kicking trouble’s ass in every hotspot around the globe. Now his sniper hasn’t returned from a CIA sanctioned mission in Pakistan and all bets are off. When Hawk comes calling looking for help, Micah doesn’t hesitate and jumps at the chance to repay a debt. A mission that will set him on a path to the one thing he never knew he was looking for: love!  Creed Erikson cursed the betrayal that caused his capture and vowed vengeance on those responsible. He knew Hawk was coming for him—he never doubted it for a second—but Micah Kennedy and Delta? They threw him for a loop.  Can Micah embrace his destiny, believe in the strengths of the bond of the triad that the fates have created or will he refuse to believe that he too deserves a happily ever after?  Micah's Promise is part of the Delta Force - Team Panther Series. While it can be read as a standalone... to ensure maximum enjoyment, it is best read in series order.",
