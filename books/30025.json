He meets Billy Trosclair, a deputy and a werewolf, and discovers the town’s secret -- the Rougaroux wolf pack. They have a gay man as their alpha who is mated to a gay man.

Can Billy keep his mate safe until he claims Peter in front of the pack?Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find male/male sexual practices, sex in shifted form, violence (date rape, beating).",
