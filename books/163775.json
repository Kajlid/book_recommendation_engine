  "title": "Still Out of Time",
  "description": "From the authors of OUT OF TIME come six more fantastic time travel short stories: - Upon his stepfather’s death, a boy returns home to find that his adoption wasn’t just from another country, but from another millennia. - A World War I fighter pilot enters a strange cloud to escape a dogfight, and exits into an entirely different war. - A time travel agent retires from service, only to begin slipping through time without the machine’s help, to a destiny he could never imagine. - A cancelled particle research project leads one scientist to discover time travel, and a dark spiraling path across years. These and two more tales will keep you up late, and then you too will be STILL OUT OF TIME. As with their previous time travel collection, all royalties from the sale of this book go directly to Doctors Without Borders.",
