  "description": "Starting from the fundamental principle of forensics that \"every contact leaves a trace\", Dr Erzinclioglu presents a fascinating study of the techniques that we have all heard about in countless trials and on television dramas and crime reconstructions, but until now had remained mysteries to the outsider. In this gripping analysis of the science of detection, recent and earlier cases will be covered in detail, including those in which Dr Erzinclioglu was himself was an expert witness. If you've ever wondered how the pattern of blood spatters can reveal so many clues, why \"the gloves didn't fit\" OJ Simpson, whether Rasputin was really poisoned or why it is so difficult to establish the time of death you will find the answers here.",
