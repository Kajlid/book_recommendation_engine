And when she loses her baby in the forest, her whole world turns upside down. Sheâ€™s even more distraught upon discovering she has an inexplicable power that makes her both beautiful and terrifyingâ€”and something of a local legend.Meanwhile, migrant workers Vern and Paul discover a violet-eyed baby and take it upon themselves to care for her. The men soon pair up with a widow and her two children, and the misfit family finds its way in fits and starts toward taking care of each other.As survival brings one family together, a young boy finds himself with nary a friend to his name as the dust storms rage across Kansas. Fourteen-year-old Coot, a child preacher with a prodigyâ€™s memory, is on the run with thousands of stolen dollarsâ€”and the only thing heâ€™s sure of is that Mobile, Alabama, is his destination.As the years pass and a world war looms, these stories intertwine in surprising ways, reminding us that when the dust clears, we can still see the stars.",
