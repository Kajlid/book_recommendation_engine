  "description": "My mother died of broken promises and a broken heart. I can't bring her back, but I can make them pay. The Bible says sons won't bear the punishment for their father's iniquity. But unfortunately for me it says nothing about daughters. \n\"FIVE STARS--A globe-jumping story arc, a multi-generational conflict, and sex scenes that everyone wants to read but no one can quite describe.\"\nBenedict, the son of a Roma father and an Italian mother, is left alone in the world when his mother, a CIA informant, is inadvertently killed by the carelessness of her handler at the 1986 Russian Olympics. Over the course of the next two decades, he builds a name for himself in the global criminal underworld. No longer a child, Behemoth (as he's now called) makes his way to the United States, determined to collect two debts that have been accumulating since the tragedy of his childhood: a debt of blood from his criminal uncles, whose orders killed his mother, and a debt of honor from Lu, the daughter of the agent whose carelessness led to her death. Kidnap her, use her body, and become bored with her--all while dealing with his uncles--is how he expects this to play out (and for a man like Behemoth, boredom comes fast!) but little does he know that the sins of the past are about to catch up with everyone, not just his victims. BE WARNED, this is a  dark  romance with non-consensual sexual situations, a little bit of blasphemy, and a lot of dirty bits. A lot of shit will be been blown up and even more bodies will be buried. If you are looking for a  happy story  , this is not it. Look elsewhere.",
