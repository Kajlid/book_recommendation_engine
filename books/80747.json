  "description": "In an industrial neighborhood of San Diego there is a lonely, forgotten lot guarded by nothing more than a chain-link fence. Little remains of the establishment that reigned here, or of the painted ladies who graced its stage.Stiletto heels protrude from the seared earth like tawdry tombstones. Sunlight glints off a garden of broken mirrors and scattered rhinestones. Sparkling apparitions flit about in the breeze. They are specters of the dancers who have been scattered like some lost tribe of Babylon.Amid the rubble one thing remains intact: a blue sequined mask.Blue Rivers, the offspring of rape and revenge, dreams of starting her life over. She meets Kevin, a man with a twisted idea of the perfect woman. When he takes an interest in her, she vows to become his dream girl. She becomes an exotic dancer at the Pink Palace, a rundown strip joint in an industrial neighborhood of San Diego. Kevin, however, isn't satisfied. When his demands become increasingly hardcore, Blue is forced to choose between his love and her own limits.",
