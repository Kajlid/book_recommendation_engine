  "title": "The MindBody Code: How to Change the Beliefs that Limit Your Health, Longevity, and Success",
  "description": "Why is it so difficult to change our beliefs and behaviors even when we know they no longer serve us? How can certain individuals reverse incurable disease while others suffer the effects of childhood wounds despite years of therapy? These are the questions readers will explore in the much-anticipated new book from clinical neuropsychologist and biocognitive science founder Dr. Mario Martinez.In The MindBody Code, Dr. Martinez challenges us to embrace a radically new paradigm for health and well-being. Readers will not only learn the basics of this fascinating cutting-edge science, but they will also learn to communicate with the body in its own biosymbolic language for results that until this point may have been elusive at best. Martinez reveals the way our cultural beliefs impact our immune system, the pathway to healing the archetypal wounds of shame, abandonment, and betrayal, and much more.",
