  "description": "Defying the cycle of the moon that binds all shape shifters, Lexi transforms into her alter ego in an attempt to flee from her sorrow and anguish. Little does she know that no matter how far or fast she runs, she can’t escape from her grief at being abandoned by her mate. Locked in her werewolf form, it takes a catastrophe to force her to become human again. Stepping back into her normal life isn’t easy, but Lexi must set aside her personal problems when one of her friends goes missing during their next mission. The team needs her to step up and become an alpha in deed rather than just in name.Even during her prolonged time spent as a werewolf, the vampirism has been insidiously spreading through her. The time is coming when Lexi will reach the point of no return. Soon, she will become the very thing that the Shifter Squad hunts down and destroys.",
