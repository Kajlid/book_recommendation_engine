  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07BC59X38Magic and MayhemBoth go together in my opinion because if you have one the other is always present. Ciar is the epitome of both and in some ways my furry arch-nemesis. He’s been with me since I was a child. Now he’s followed me to the Menagerie. Except he’s no longer in his canine form, Ciar is now 100% Fae male.Which I’m not prepared for. Not that I'm prepared for this place at all either. I don’t want to be here. This school is a hen-house for the rich and powerful to reach in and pluck the special people out like fat hens while the rest are fed to the wolves.Well, except this time there’s one of the big bad ones IN the hen-house. Ciar.He's the bane of my existence and theirs. Yet in a roundabout way he's also my best friend, and even though he looks at me like I'm dinner--I'm not afraid.I'm pretty sure I look at him exactly the same way.",
