  "description": "One week. No strings. Sexy stranger. What could go wrong?My name is Julia McDowell. I’m not the pretty girl next door, I’m the boss at work who solves all your problems. I’m an awkward genius with the worst taste in boyfriends; the last one left me with a 6-figure debt to prove it.So, when the most swoon-worthy man alive saves me from a psychotic tree, who am I to say no to a drink? He’s sweet yet powerful with a darkness I can’t place. I should be terrified of him, but I find myself drawn to him in ways I’ve never experienced. He says I’m his guiding light, that our hearts beat to the same melody. But I’m not looking for forever, and he has his own demons to slay.We agreed to one week, no strings. It will have to be enough. It’s definitely enough, more than enough, until it’s not.I’m ready to throw our one-week rules out the window when tragedy pulls us apart. It would take a miracle to find our way back to each other, and life is no fairytale. With no happily ever after in sight, will our hearts learn a new rhythm? Or will heartache become our new theme song?",
