  "description": "I am bonded to a monster...\n\n\n\nLucy...\n\nI know what I am in for the first time he growls his intention. The brooding, tattooed, alphahole who demands my submission!\nHe won't stop until he's ravaged every part of my body. Sucked on every piece of my flesh. Until he's teased me and drawn out my need. Until he's ripped me apart and ruined me. And when he's done? He's going to claim me all over again!\n\n\nDid I mention that he mated me...?\n\n\nEvery inch of me has been mauled by the alpha. Every part possessed. He's knotted me and broken me. He's absorbed me into himself, until I am no longer sure who I am!\nThe woman I’d been, is fast drowning. I am losing myself in him. All that’s left is the echoes of my climax. The high of our coupling, that lingers in my blood...\nMaybe submitting to him isn't the worst. What if I ask for more...? What if I insist that he is MINE? What if he's the only one who can save my life?",
