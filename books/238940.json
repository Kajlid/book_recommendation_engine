  "description": "Feeling trapped in a place where everything is ok but not amazing? In a place where you think more about the future because it seems much better than your present? A place where you call yourself \"realistic\" because it's a better word than mediocre? Are you wishing to change your reality but don't know how? Improving our lifestyle is much more than visualization and formal education. To change our life we need willing and commitment to find the right balance between our inner state and the skills to build the right vehicle that will take us to a place where we can stop worrying about money and start worrying about helping others. Christian has created a guide that covers both sides of the coin. It's not only about mindset but it is also not only about having a master in business or finances. It's about finding the balance and knowing where you want to go. Flight Of Fancy Life Formula is a proven, step-by-step process that will guide us, in a very comprehensible way, through the process of growing ourselves internally, reprogramming our mindset, helping us to realize that we deserve success and providing the right information and resources to build a business based on our passion, what we love to do; but most important, to turn it into something stable and great enough to become financially free and live life on our own terms.",
