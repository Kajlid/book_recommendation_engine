  "description": "Something to Believe In is a modern-day fairytale set in Ireland featuring Seamus and Glenna, two upwardly-mobile fairy sprites with only one matchmaking mission standing between them and a major promotion. So when the stars align (and the stars NEVER lie), marking two disillusioned, disinclined, and downright uncooperative human candidates as soul mates, they know they have their work cut out for them. The Bailey O’Brien, of San Francisco, studies Irish folklore and is quite familiar with the more fanciful and romantic elements of her work, but she doesn’t actually believe in magical creatures, enchantments, or true love. She snubs the idea of fate or destiny having anything to do with her arrival on the Emerald Isle where she intends to keep her skeptic heart closed and her capable head clearly focused on a new teaching position. The Nick Reardon, of Dublin Town, is still grieving the death of his younger brother and has spent the past year trying to temper his anger and aggression on the Gaelic football field. Now he’s ready to return to his quiet life as an English professor – and start writing again. He lacks the interest or inclination to care for much else, choosing to direct what’s left in his emotional reservoir on his widowed sister-in-law and nephew. They are the only blips on his relationship radar, and he is determined to keep it that way. The Connecting two reluctant soul mates requires some fanciful maneuvering, which means Seamus and Glenna are not above enlisting the help of a few well-meaning friends, capitalizing on a harmless wager, throwing in a pint or two of Guinness, and resorting to wee amounts of blackmail and sabotage to accomplish their goal. But will this zealous push lead to desire or backfire into disaster?",
