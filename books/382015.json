  "description": "Oliver Ryan, a Seattle court reporter working in Victoria, BC is mysteriously drawn to the local cemetery one stormy night in 1916. He is shocked to see several apparitions arising from their graves and with no time to consider what is happening, he suddenly discovers he is flying. Already freaked out, he now notices that he is accompanied by a top-hatted gentleman who takes him through the wall of his hotel and into his room. Before the apparition leaves, he shocks Oliver by telling him he is now a mortal angel and has been chosen for an important assignment which he will explain soon. After the gentleman leaves, Oliver notices his suit and shoes are dry despite the rain but he's so tired he lays down and goes to sleep. What follows is a delightfully entertaining story utilizing historical locations around the Pacific Northwest through time travelling to various centuries in Victoria, BC, Seattle and Everett, WA. One day at the Empress Hotel in Victoria, a young woman take a photo of him believing this oddly-dressed man is an actor but the image on the camera mysteriously lacks his image. Taking her into his confidence, an unusual friendship begins. Winner of an Independent Publisher Gold Medal (IPPY) in the Canada West category.",
