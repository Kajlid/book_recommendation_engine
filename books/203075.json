  "description": "Wallace Avery, bookworm extraordinaire, is not out at work in either sense, as a gay man or as a fox shifter. He likes his privacy, and he's quite content in records management, thank you: filing papers and spending his off hours quietly.  When the opportunity he never wanted is thrust into his lap, he has to decide what to do about it.

Whatever he chooses, he definitely doesn't want to fall for someone from his workplace. Especially not that cop . . .  63,000 words A Shifters and Partners Novel",
