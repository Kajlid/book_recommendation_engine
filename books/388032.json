  "description": "Hard to imagine that no one counts,that only things endure.Unlike the seasons, our shirts don't shed,Whatever we see does not see us,however hard we look,The rain in its silver earrings against the oak trunks,The rain in its second skin.--from \"Scar Tissue II\"In his new collection, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Charles Wright investigates the tenuous relationship between description and actuality--\"thing is not an image\"--but also reaffirms the project of attempting to describe, to capture the natural world and the beings in it, although he reminds us that landscape is not his subject matter but his technique: that language was always his subject--language and \"the ghost of god.\" And in the dolomites, the clouds, stars, wind, and water that populate these poems, \"something un-ordinary persists.\"Scar Tissue is a groundbreaking work from a poet who \"illuminates and exalts the entire astonishing spectrum of existence\" (Booklist).",
