  "description": "“Elise the Freak,” that’s what people called me when I was just a child in that small Kansas town. It was hurtful and scarred me, but I finally escaped, no longer allowing that name to identify me. Now, I’m Elise Crawford. I live in a different place, a bigger city. I have a college degree and live on my own. It’s what I’ve always dreamed of but, with one exception. I still see dead people. I never could escape them. Suddenly, a new man has entered my life. A mysterious man I’m reluctantly attracted to, yet can’t quite figure out. But, I plan to change that too, just like I changed everything else in my life.",
