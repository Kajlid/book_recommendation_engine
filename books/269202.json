With Ay and Horemheb watching her every move, there is only one person she can trust to save her and her line - a girl, a slave - Ida.----------------------------------------------Amarna is a ridiculously, historically accurate drama set in Ancient Egypt, Hattusa & Syria that is centered around the strange but true events surrounding the battle for the throne of Egypt following Pharaoh Tutankhamun's death and the interconnected events that took place in the Hittite empire.It includes an end matter feature that details what did and didn't really happen (at least as far as historians believe).",
