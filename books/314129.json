  "description": "Billionaire. Philanthropist. Playboy.And my brother’s best friend.Oh, and Carter Fields is gorgeous too, but never mind that...After his latest public mishap, Manhattan’s favorite CEO needs a place to hide until the media latches onto a new scandal.My brother offers Carter our family’s cabin for refuge without telling me—the same cabin where I was supposed to spend a relaxing week for my birthday.Instead, I’m stuck babysitting the arrogant man-child.This cabin is not big enough to contain Carter’s ego… or my sanity. All we do is argue. And right when I’m certain I’ll strangle him, he surprises me by calling a truce.Even more shocking? His kind gestures. His sweet words. His vulnerable side.That near-kiss while we’re out on a hike.I can’t stop imagining it. If he kisses the same way he wears those expensive suits—like he’s doing them a favor—then I’m in trouble.Then again, a little trouble never hurt anyone… right?",
