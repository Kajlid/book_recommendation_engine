  "description": "From the author of Special A, a oneshot about a girl named Hatsune with a \"bad mouth\", for lack of a better description. She's kind-hearted and all, but her mouth spews the total opposite of what she means (which is probably due to the fact that she grew up with five brothers, a father, and no mom). And so she is seen as an arrogant, mean girl at her school, and that is why she hasn't had a boyfriend for the past fifteen years of her life. Well, that is, until she gets accepted at this Maidens' Club, where she meets a guy called Kirie with a somewhat unique habit (it happens when a girl comes within six inches of him). How will these two fare? Will Hatsune finally have a boyfriend at last? Will she be more than just a \"girl\" friend?",
