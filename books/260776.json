  "description": "In 1941 a secret German mission came to a bloody end in Egyptâ€™s Western Desert. A doomsday weapon was lost under its shifting sands, buried, but never destroyed.  A brazen attempt to assassinate a British archaeologist in Cairo sends former Military Intelligence Officer Roan Mercer and his team of private security contractors on a mission to track down the would-be killers.  It soon becomes clear to Mercer that the attack is no random crime, but merely one part of a much more nefarious plot involving an old diary, a fanatical warlord, and a plot to launch the world into an all-consuming war. And behind it all, a shadowy organisation whose only interest is securing wealth and power at all costs.  Desert is the first Roan Mercer adventure.",
