  "description": "\"What is your biggest pet peeve?\"This simple Twitter question posed by John Cleese inspired bookseller Jen Campbell to start a blog collecting all the ridiculous conversations overheard in her bookstore, everything from \"Did Beatrix Potter ever write a book about dinosaurs?\" to \"Did Charles Dickens ever write anything fun?\" Anyone who has ever worked in retail will nod knowingly at requests like \"Iâ€™ve forgotten my glasses, can you read me the first chapter?\" Or the absurdity of questions like \"Excuse me . . . is this book edible?\"Filled with fun and quirky illustrations by the award-winning Brothers McLeod and featuring contributions from booksellers across the United States and Canada, as well as the author's native UK, Weird Things Customers Say in Bookstores is a celebration of bookstores, large and small, and of the brilliant booksellers who toil in those literary fields, as well as the myriad of colorful characters that walk through the doors everyday. This irresistible collection is proof positive that booksellers everywhere are heroes.",
