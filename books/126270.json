  "description": "Rikka Brendan accepts a teaching position in small town Arroyo, Texas, hoping the new location will help her fight her attraction to men in uniforms. Her logic? She’ll get to know the guys as people and the fetish will lessen. But accidents keep occurring that require calling in the fire department, and then she just has to watch those buff men in action. Enter newly installed Captain Conor Malloy to investigate three rescue calls in less than eight weeks. He observes Rikka as being a bit klutzy, but is there more? The captain’s starched shirt and stern expression excite Rikka into action and, acting on pure impulse, she seduces him and comic interruptions intervene. After another interaction ends similarly, Conor makes plans to explore their feelings. But can he convince Rikka the sparks between them are more than her fetish?",
