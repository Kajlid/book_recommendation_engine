  "description": "Finalist for the 2012 Wonderland Book Award for Best Novel Poor Dennis. He's a regular sort of guy who's recently been dealt a shitty hand by he lost his job, his wife hates him and wants a divorce, and it turns out she was also cheating on him as well. Now he's living on his brother's couch. Holy fuck, that sucks. Dennis can't imagine things could get much worse, and that's why he jumped at the opportunity to take part in a new reality game a \"sexcathlon\" where the first person to achieve 10 increasingly difficult and perverted sexual challenges wins a million dollars and is crowned King of the Perverts. Dennis doesn't care about the title, he just wants the money, but now he's not sure he can make it to the end. Enduring a golden shower and following through with an Abe Lincoln are hard enough, but he's losing his nerve and fears what act of perversion will come next. He'd like to drop out, but his Russian bear of a cameraman, Mongo, has other plans for him and that million dollar prize, and Dennis has to decide which is winning the King of the Perverts, or losing it.",
