Recently widowed, she wants desperately to create a haven for herself and her young daughter. But the community, including Rachel’s family, is anything but welcoming. The only person happy to see her is her teenaged brother, Benjamin, and he’s protecting a dark secret that endangers them all. Determined to keep Benjamin safe from a suspected killer, Rachel has no choice but to turn to the one man she wanted to get as far away from as possible. Colin McDonald was her late husband’s friend, and the man who came between them. He’s never forgotten her and would do anything to keep her and her family safe. Rachel doesn’t know if she can trust Colin, or her growing feelings for him. But as they hunt for the killer, the tension between them builds and soon both their lives, and their hearts, are on the line. “While love is a powerful entity in this story, danger is never too far behind.
