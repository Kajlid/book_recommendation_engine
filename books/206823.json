  "title": "Birdwoman: Memoirs of a Lovesick Siren (Diaries of a Siren)",
  "description": "\"Empowering...sexy...imaginative...\" Marcy Birdwell, Marcy's MusingsModern love and the paranormals-among-us are brewed together in this romantic coming-of-age saga about a 23-year-old siren-in-human-form. Destiny Dragoman (the word “dragoman” means interpreter or guide) possesses gifts of eidetic memory, mind-reading, and musical genius -- not to mention vestigial wings hidden under her shoulder blades. She flies like a migratory bird between Pinnacle, Wyoming, and Key West, Florida, two small towns where extremes in sex and religion are the norm. Along the way she trails a flock of sirens from antiquity. Are they friend or foe? When not consulting the stars or Match.com in her quest for love, Destiny writes a popular syndicated advice column. Everything from computer dating to sexual fantasy is explored in Destiny’s columns and blogs. Although Destiny’s predatory powers outmatch any human’s, she experiences heartbreak over and over again. She lives under the shadow of a family curse -- the women can have any man they like, so long as they like him dead. In these memoirs she refers to herself as a “damned creature.” Is she a force for evil or good? If for good, how will she defeat the curse and find true love?ISBN 9781530608935",
