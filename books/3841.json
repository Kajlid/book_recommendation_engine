As Napoleon struggles for power on the battlefields of Europe, so Hortense charts her way through the French court -- a chessboard world where the motives are jealousy and greed and the prizes are thrones of conquered countries.

Unwilling to cross her stepfather, Hortense must wait and see if time will take her to her lover.",
