  "description": "‘Dating, Diapers and Denial’ is a novel with a comical view of life from a woman’s perspective – of those years that race past from the age of twenty through to forty. It traverses milestones related to meeting, falling in love, marriage, babies, and growing old. In her debut novel, Rachna Singh is on course to make you smile, chuckle and say, ‘That’s so true!’ ‘Dating, Diapers, and Denial’ is a novel you’d want to read over and over again, to double up at the funny anecdotal passages and the witty observations. Tongue-in-cheek, with self-aimed pot shots, the innuendoes are clever, and witty. The book moves at a brisk pace, with story-telling that enthrals. As the humour tickles the readers, the sense of ‘relating’ to the instances keeps them riveted to the book. Grab your copy and have a good laugh!\"Excerpt:As we were settling, a photographer from a news daily clicked a snap and said it would be on Page 3 of the Goa Times. For that he needed our names and where we were from.I said ‘Bangalore’ and Alok said ‘Uttar Pradesh’, simultaneously.‘Uttar Pradesh?’ I looked at him incredulously. What kind of answer is that? That too, at a Goa club? Might as well give the zila name, and gram panchayat registration code too?! I was livid, my lampshade beads clanging excitedly, as if on caffeine, as I berated him.The next day, I looked, fearfully for our picture on Page 3, worried it would be captioned ‘Chacha from Uttar Pradesh Does The Cha Cha’ but, thankfully, it was not there.",
