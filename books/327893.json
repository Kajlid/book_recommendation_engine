  "description": "I really should’ve known better than to play around with that old book of spells…How was I supposed to know that the incantations scrawled inside of it worked? That the first one I read would open a portal into a demon plane — or that the next one was an unbreakable vow to the seven foot tall shadow monster I unwittingly summoned into my bedroom?He says his name is Malphas, that he’s something called a Sombra demon, and I’m his mate.Monster, demon… whatever he is, his muscles are bigger than my head, and that club between his legs… I don’t know if mate means the same thing to him as it does me, but he’s gotta be kidding.Spoiler alert: he’s not.Mal has been waiting for more than a thousand years for the one woman meant for him. He’s convinced that’s me, and he’s willing to do anything to prove it. And maybe there’s something really wrong with me because, before long, I find myself eager to let him try…* Mated to the Monster is the first in a series about the Sombra demons, a race of shadow-based monsters who will do anything to claim their females. Mal and Shannon might come from different worlds, but when it comes to fate, lust, and forever… they might just be a perfect match.",
