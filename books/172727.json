  "description": "I've been running for four years, trapped in a past I can't forget. I'm unable to move forward and refuse to go back. The only way to dissolve the shadows is to begin again. So I try.Tonight will be different, it has to be. Coaxed into a tight dress that's guaranteed to hit the floor after I find the right guy, I head out. My flatmate takes me to this new London pub that looks more like the New York clubs I'm used to, but it works. I can find someone to ease the pain for a little bit, even if itâ€™s only one night.When Hot British Guy spots me, there's an instant attraction. There's something about him besides the dark hair and beautiful body. He's pure eye-candy, but it's his sharp tongue and sad eyes makes me wonder. Something happened to him, I can tell. He's lived through Hell and showed up here tonight to forget. But I'm not supposed to ask. This is a one time thing, a hot night filled with lust that erases everything.I can do this. I'm tired of crying, of feeling numb. This out-of-character conquest feels weird, but I go with it--until he throws me out. Shocked, I leave and cement my former hypothesis--guys suck.The next day, he's there looking all sexy. Brilliant blue eyes blazing, his dark hair falls in his eyes and a wicked grin twists his perfect lips. God help me.Standalone Novel360 pagesNew Adult Romance",
