  "description": "Do second chances exist? Storm has been in love with Colin “Pope” O’Brien since she was thirteen but it wasn’t meant to be. Years later, the opportunity to be together presents itself—but it's stolen away in the blink of an eye. After a near-death experience, Pope decides to bear his heart to Storm and finally claim the woman he loves. But it just doesn’t seem in to be in the cards for them. Patience isn’t his strong suit, but forcing his way in will only push Storm further away. Secrets, lies, and an outside threat could keep them apart. Is the timing any better this time around? Is love enough or will there always be something keeping them apart?",
