  "description": "The war might be over, but for Derran, one of the Imperial's most celebrated soldier, no retirement is in the cards. He watched as droids had cut his platoon down, then battled through robospiders and humanoids to bring the enemy down.Now he is offered a job to train the next generation of special imperial units, dragging him into a dangerous game where enemies are hidden and can be lurking in the friendliest of face. His life is on the line again. And that might be all right, as long as that does not come at the cost of endangering those closest to him.",
