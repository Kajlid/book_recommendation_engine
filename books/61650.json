  "title": "Four is a little, Four is a LOT",
  "description": "(You can read our book for free at www.fourlosophy.com) \"Mama... Is four a little, or a lot?\" That simple question from her not quite four-year-old son, Jacob, inspired Cheska Komissar to write Four is a little, Four is a LOT. It features four boys and four girls who each experience the number four as both a little and a lot, delighting young readers while teaching number sense and age-appropriate vocabulary. Adopting the theme as a \"four-losophy,\" the book was illustrated by four different artists, and the publisher “pays it four-ward” by donating four percent of book profits to each of four charities (16% total)!",
