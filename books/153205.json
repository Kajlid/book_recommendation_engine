  "description": "A decade ago, if you'd walked into a bookstore looking for a zombie novel, you would have found only two: Brian Keene's The Rising and Joe McKinney's Dead City. Long recognized as one of the driving voices that launched the world's fascination with the living dead, Joe McKinney's Dead World novels have emerged as seminal works in the Horror genre.Now, collected for the first time in Dead World Resurrection, are all of Joe McKinney's zombie short stories. Here you'll not only find tales that provide invaluable links between the various Dead World novels, such as \"Ethical Solution,\" \"Dating in Dead World,\" and the award-winning story \"Survivors,\" but also nightmare glimpses into other post-apocalyptic worlds told in the inimitable Joe McKinney fashion. From the bleak political satire of \"State of the Union\" to the historical vignettes of \"Starvation Army\" and \"Paradise of the Living Dead,\" this collection features the full range of McKinney's horrific mastery of the living dead.The zombie has grown up since Joe McKinney first penned Dead City, yet he has continued to stand out among the throng of voices telling tales of the undead. Dead World Resurrection shows why.",
