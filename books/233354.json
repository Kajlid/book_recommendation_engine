  "description": "I had plans, all right.  The 3 G's: Grad school. Great job. Good, ORDERLY life.   Do you see a side helping of private investigating anywhere on that menu? I don't think so.   So how in the world did I find myself plunging, head first, into the dark depths of an underhanded, manipulative corporate scandal—risking life and career alike—when I SHOULD have been focused on my impending graduation and precisely planned future?   Only one answer could explain it, really: Sloan. McKenzie.   Impulse Spy is an exciting mystery adventure driven by a beautiful, mysterious stranger who might be nothing but trouble. Perfect for long-time cozy readers as well as YA and new adult readers looking for a little amateur sleuth intrigue in their lives.   The super-hot sidekicks are just an added bonus;)",
