  "description": "When the weather outside is frightful, what better way to warm up than with four magnificent new tales of love and adventure from your favorite romance authors? Slip into a bubble bath or curl up in front of a roaring fireâ€”and let Jude Deveraux. Judith McNaught, Arnette Lamb & Jill Barnett whisk you away... to New York in the late 1800s, where a beautiful but clumsy angel turns a lonely man's life around... to medieval Scotland, where intrigues surrounding a Christmas Mass imperil two Highland lovers... to Regency London, where a world-weary lord receives an outrageous proposal... to modern-day Colorado, where a daring and clever twelve-year-old plays matchmaker for his bighearted, impractical mother... to a world where love always reigns supreme!",
