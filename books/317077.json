  "description": "“Bernd Heinrich is one of our greatest living naturalists in the tradition of Gerald Durrell….A national treasure.”—Los Angeles Times Summer World is an intimate, accessible, and eloquent illumination of animal survival in the Summer months from Bernd Heinrich, bestselling author of Winter World and “our latter-day Thoreau” (Publishers Weekly). Pulitzer Prize-winner Edmond O. Wilson (On Human Nature) calls Heinrich’s fascinating exploration and appreciation of the natural order a, “lovely book, meticulously etched and based on impassioned but exacting scientific research,” while the New York Times Book Review raves, “Animals come to life in gripping detail...and so does Heinrich…. The man is irrepressible.”",
