  "description": "Everybody loves Pixie. Everybody wants Pixie. But Pixie needs a Daddy, and his heart is set on me.  I’m determined to resist him, for more reasons than I can count.  He’s too young for me. He’s my employee. And he’s everything I’ve been avoiding for half my life.  He’s vibrant. He’s sweet. He’s absolutely perfect, no matter how much I don’t want him to be.  I want nothing more than to take care of him, to protect him and pamper him…but how can I start something with him when I know I’ll eventually break his heart? Can I really be the Daddy Pixie needs?  **Pixie is the fifth and last book in the Ballsy Boys Production series. It can be read as a stand-alone, but it’s more fun reading the series in order.",
