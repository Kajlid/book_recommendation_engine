  "description": "Kitchen servant Yoli is one of only three men who know a carefully guarded secret about High Commander Koehen, the brilliant general who united their lands against a common invader. The enemy wants that secret, and they are willing to use either kindness or cruelty to obtain it.Yoli will have to decide if his loyalties lie with the commander, who has shown him more affection than anyone in Yoli's life, or with his own best interests. Commander Koehen's attention is capricious at best; he summons Yoli only when it is convenient for him. Will it be enough to hold Yoli's devotion when Yoli is offered his fondest dream to betray it?CONTENT This title contains a HFN ending.",
