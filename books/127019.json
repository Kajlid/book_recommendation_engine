  "title": "Soul Stealer",
  "description": "By crawling into a crack in the wall, Barney and his older sister Eve, unwittingly volunteer to save the Universe. According to Eve, Barney is like every other twelve year old boy, “Irritating by nature.” He’s impulsive, frequently gross and has the uncanny ability to wind her up with just one word. She isn’t sure what’s worse; to be told they have to save the universe before it implodes, or the knowledge that Barney will be her constant companion. How many farts can one girl endure before she loses her sense of smell?  Barney loves adventure, but he never imagined he’d get to be the hero, or that his fantasy would include his uptight sister. He soon learns that if they accept their mission, they could die. If they don’t, they’ll definitely die. To top if off, he discovers they volunteered for the job.  In order to save the Universe, Barney and Eve must hunt and capture a magical band of thieves, before they steal the Souls of any more worlds. On their amazing adventure Barney nearly soils his underpants on a wild ride on a giant eel, and Eve narrowly avoids death by giant flying scorpions. Both must endure a feast of eyeballs and other gelatinous delicacies, escape the clutches of an undead child, and still stay on the trail of the evil thieves.",
