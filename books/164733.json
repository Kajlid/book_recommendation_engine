  "title": "Nebulous",
  "description": "Three years after losing his father in a fire, thirteen year old Jethro Black (his friends call him Jet) finds himself embarking upon a mysterious adventure when, while attending his grandfather's funeral, a strange man walks up and gives him an envelope, and a key. As a mystery begins to unfold, Jet and his best friend Travis are about to discover that there is more to the world than meets the eye, and they just may have a crucial role to play in the outcome of humanity's future. Nebulous is the first release in the young adult science fiction book series, Jet Black.Warning. This book series will take you on an adventurous ride through the world of Jet Black. Here you will inevitably find various religious and spiritual undertones woven into the story. Some of these are subtle, and some are not. Others are hidden as clues to a larger picture. While some readers may consider these as hidden treasures, others may choose to see them differently. If you are the type that chooses to be offended by religious and/or spiritual content, I suggest you turn back now.",
