  "description": "A deadly storm is brewing over the sleepy little town of Wattsville, Maine. Mystery and intrigue creep into the village like a fetid fog blown by an ill wind. The untimely deaths of two young men shake the quiet peace of the small community, and threaten to destroy the life of a revered religious leader. The spirits of those slain cry out for justice from their graves, while restless ghosts walk the hallways and grounds of the old monastery; silent victims of the horrors that took place by the pond.Faith, forensics, and falsehood mix together to thicken the plot of this elaborate murder mystery. John Smith, the ambitious district attorney, along with his fianc√©e, Katy Warsaw, team up with forensic pathologist Dr. Peter Balkan and Sheriff Carl Johnson as they seek to solve the shocking murders. The twists and turns of the case will lead the team into the darkest heart of evil, and the mind of a serial killer.",
