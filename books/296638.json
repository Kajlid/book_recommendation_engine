By all that is right, you ought be seated where Vortigern sits...You ought to be King.\" Here lies the truth of the Lord of the Summer Land. This is the tale of Arthur flesh and bone. Of the shaping of the man, both courageous and flawed, into the celebrated ruler who inspired armies, who captured Gwenhyfar's heart, and who emerged as the hero of the Dark Ages and the most enduring hero of all time. This is the unexpected story of the making of a king ― the legend who united all of Britain. Praise for The Kingmaking : \"If only all historical fiction could be this good.\" ―Historical Novels Review \"Helen Hollick has it all. She tells a great story…\"― Bernard Cornwell \"Hollick's interpretation is bold, affecting, and well worth fighting to defend.\" ― Publishers Weekly",
