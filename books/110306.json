  "title": "Advent and Christmas Wisdom from G.K. Chesterton",
  "description": "As one of the few relatively recent Christian writers who are admired and quoted by Christians at all ends of the spectrum, G.K Chesterton was known as a remarkable and diverse but extremely influential English writer. His inexhaustible and wide ranging portfolio of works includes journalistic writing, poetry, biography, Christian, fantasy and detective genres. His style is distinctive and always marked by humility, consistency, irony, wit and wonder. Some of his most enduring books include \"The Everlasting Man,\" which led C.S. Lewis to become a Christian and \"The Napoleon of Notting Hill\" which inspired Michael Collins to lead a movement for Irish independence. G.K. Chesterton is sometimes referred to as the most unjustly neglected writer of our time. One reason might be his versatility and the inability for modern thinkers, theologians, and commentators to pigeonhole him. We challenge you to enjoy his remarkable style, eloquence, and faith-based writing at this joyous time of the year. In this edition of \"Advent and Christmas Wisdom,\" each day's reflection includes a selection from one of Chesterton's finest works, a suitable Scripture verse, an appropriate prayer, and an exercise. This addition to one of Liguori's best-selling series is truly a refreshing, prayerful preparation for the coming of Christ at Christmas. \"Paperback\"PDF SamplesIntroductionTable of ContentsPages 2-3Available for the Amazon Kindle:",
