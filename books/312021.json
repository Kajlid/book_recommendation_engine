  "description": "Whelp, I didn’t see that coming.No pun intended—well, maybe a little pun with special sauce.Somehow I’ve landed in a weird space where I’m not quite dead but not quite alive either, standing on the edge of something incredible—if only I take the chance and dive into the unknown. My mates taught me to jump on in without hesitation.I hope the water is warm.Taking a leap of faith isn’t necessarily the issue, it’s kicking my legs hard enough to break the surface for that first breath of fresh air. Oh, and also avoiding those who would rather see me drown.Dying was easy, but it’s living that may prove difficult, especially when a certain god wants to rip the bonds of fate from my soul.Unfortunately for him, I’ve already claimed my place with my mates and I’m ready to fight like hell to keep them.No matter what.**Reverse Harem/Why Choose Romance**Book 4 of 4**All the Burn**MM/Polyamory**Language 18+**HEA… Finally.",
