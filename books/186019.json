  "title": "Voices Are Not for Yelling",
  "description": "The toddler years are full of growth and smiles and sweetness—but also tantrums. With toddlers, yelling, screaming, wailing, and flailing are a normal part of life. Very young children don’t yet have the words to express strong feelings, and they’re still learning social skills. This board book helps little ones understand why it’s better to use an indoor voice—“so people hear the words and not the yelling”—and how to calm down and ask for help so they can get what they need. Also includes tips for parents and caregivers. The Best Behavior series uses simple words and delightful full-color illustrations to guide children to choose peaceful, positive behaviors. Select titles are available in two versions: a durable board book for ages baby–preschool, and a longer, more in-depth paperback for ages 4–7. Kids, parents, and teachers love these award-winning books. All include helpful tips and ideas for parents and caregivers.",
