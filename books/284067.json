  "description": "Her life is far too serious to date a hunky superstar that plays a game for a living.Sam might have a reasonable excuse to take things easy, but that’s not who she is. Her grieving process started the minute Gram became ill. After three heartbreaking months of being a full-time caregiver, she’s all cried out. To appease her brother, she agrees to a one-week reprieve in their childhood haven of Promise Lake before taking back her role in the company they built together. When her car slips from the bridge and makes a terrifying plunge into the water, she’s paralyzed with the deep-rooted fears of her past. The strong, capable hands that pull her from danger belong to none other than the famous major-leaguer, Jake Jaeger.Sam can’t deny that Jake makes everything better, and the chemistry is off the charts. She’s dated his type before. She dated Jake’s best friend who proved emotionally useless. And, then there’s the fact that Jake’s a newly signed client in her firm. If those aren’t reason enough, there’s her past. Her life is far too serious to date a man who plays a game for a living.Jake, on break after his third Major League season, needs to tell Sam the truth. But when he pulls her from her sinking car, he knows now is not the time to tell her that he’s the reason she and Mitch broke up. Oh, and he’s not sorry. Spending time in a secluded cabin only grows the attraction he’s never been able to ignore. He knows when a woman is into him, and he knows she’s guarded about her past. So what? He can handle it. He hits curveballs for a living. Even being at the top of his game, it’s impossible to see this one coming.",
