  "description": "The true and eventful History of my Life of Liberty and Adventure as a Gentleman of Fortune and Enemy to Mankind. What ever happened to Long John Silver, the enigmatic, treacherous and yet attractively subversive pirate whose exploits made him the anti-hero of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island? He lived out his twilight years on Madagascar, rich, one-legged and attended by a handful of devoted slaves whose freedom he had purchased in teh West Indies by inciting them to rebellion. That he had a price on his head and the Navy out looking to bring him to justice bothered him less than the thought of posthumous obscurity. So he set down these memoirs to give his side of the story.",
