  "description": "This is the story of a boy who follows his father's instructions and goes on a journey that takes him far from his home. To his astonishment, the boy becomes a king of a strange island—only to lose his crown for reasons he does not understand. Not until the end of the story does the boy—or the reader—understand the father's purpose in permitting his son to wander. Children will want to read about the boy king time and time again. Each reading will bring renewed understanding that goodness and humility are the only real keys that will open the golden box that is \"oh so splendid to behold.\"Paul Marguiles is an award winning writer at an important New York advertising agency. This book was written for his own children, who thrilled to it as all young readers will. J.K. Lambert is a book designer of distinction who now turns his unusual talents to illustration. This is his first book for children.",
