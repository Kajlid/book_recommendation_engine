But, with his mental and physical health in decline, living where he doesn’t speak the language and relying on his partner for everything, he feels trapped.Just the way Max likes it, of course.When Crane is presented with an opportunity to clear his name once and for all, he’s compelled to take it… But, it means betraying the young man who thoroughly intoxicates him in ways he had never imagined possible.Can Crane break his addiction or is he too far down the rabbit hole to escape?",
