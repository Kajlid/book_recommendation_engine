  "description": "Five months after her mother’s death, 15-year-old Lisa Marino struggles to adapt to her strange, new life with her Aunt Gloria. She longs to get away from her aunt’s ever-watchful, accusing glare to go in search of her father, a gambling addict whom she has not seen in over a decade. Lisa schemes to make her way to Atlantic City, where she hopes to improve her odds of finding him. When she gets there, she realizes Atlantic City is not the glamorous city of dreams she’d imagined it to be. Lisa’s encounters with the people she meets on the streets of Atlantic City will change her life forever. Set in Brooklyn and Atlantic City in the 1980s, Paper Daisies brings back to life a time before teens were glued to their cell phones, when big hair ruled, alternative music filled the airwaves, and Greenwich Village was the place to be. Paper Daisies presents another voice in the discussion of what it means to be part of a family. This charming, heartfelt story of a young woman’s quest to find her place in this world will leave an impression on readers both old and young alike.",
