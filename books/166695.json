And so she was both elated and saddened when, at twelve, she joined her parents and younger brothers in New York City. As Edwidge adjusted to life in a new country, she and her family continued to fear for the safety of those still in Haiti as the political situation deteriorated.In 2004, they entered into a terrifying tale of good people caught up in events beyond their control. Their story made headlines around the world. Brother I'm Dying is an astonishing true-life epic, told on an intimate scale by one of our finest writers.",
