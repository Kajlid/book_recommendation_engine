  "description": "There’s LOVE at first sight ~ Second chance LOVE And sometimes Fate and Destiny combine to make an eternal LOVE  Parker Sullivan Lawyer Part-time rebel, musician Alex’s oldest friend  Angelina Marquez Event Planner for lack of a better description Full-time piece of work Alex’s little sister   Home in Arizona after an extended absence, Angie Marquez lands smack in the middle of Family Justice. Crossing continents to take on the planning for Meghan and Alex’s upcoming wedding, her happy return to the home of her youth also has a hidden reason…to either scratch an old itch or put it to rest once and for all. And the name of that itch? Parker Sullivan.  What’s one more Alpha at this point? Self-styled badass with a guitar and plenty of brawn artfully disguised as a successful lawyer, Parker Sullivan comes to Family Justice as Alex’s boyhood friend and the keeper of quite a few tall tales from their youth. He’s also been secretly in love with Angelina Marquez since he could remember. The problem? She refuses to speak to him…and for good reason.  Angie’s unexpected return to Sedona brings her and Parker face-to-face for the first time since their clandestine relationship crashed and burned years earlier. Older, wiser and still deeply attracted to the powerful lawyer, she hoped that they could be friends again. But they had a lot to resolve, it wasn’t that easy and their messy relationship was affecting everyone.",
