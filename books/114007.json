  "title": "Plus One: Finding God on the Yoga Mat",
  "description": "A beautiful and relatable debut memoir of a woman who-while vehemently avoiding the idea of God under all circumstances-finds herself passionately inspired by the higher power she discovers on a yoga mat. As she keeps digging- through marriage, new motherhood, business ownership, plus practicing and teaching yoga herself-she is surprised to find a deep affection and experience of God...as a thread that gracefully connects all aspects of her life and allows her to trust in its unfolding. In beautiful prose, Plus One explores the possibility we all have of finding connection and peace in the lives we are living.",
