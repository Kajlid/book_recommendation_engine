She finds a new start in the most unlikely place—a picturesque Colorado farm, owned by her estranged friend, Trevor Whitney.Trevor promised his dying father he’d take care of the farm. He has his hands full trying to make good on that promise. The last thing he needs is Evelyn living in his guest house, unearthing old feelings and long-kept secrets.Trevor’s unexpected kindness pushes Evelyn to reclaim her dreams, but it also leaves her with many questions, and he’s never been one for sharing. If the truth is finally revealed, will it only drive them apart again, or is a change of heart too much to hope for?",
