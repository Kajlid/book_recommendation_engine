But then the devil meets his match in a fiery little bartender.... A flyboy--even a wickedly hot one!--is the last thing Cassie O'Brien needs. Between the bar and grad school, she is stretched to her limit. Yet the scorch and sizzle between them proves to be too much temptation, and Cassie gives in to sweet, sweet sin.
