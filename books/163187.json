For 17-year-old Elena Watkins, the world of Paegeia is not finished revealing all its secrets.During a summer break intended for relaxation, she discovers that her harrowing adventure to retrieve the King of Lion sword wasn't the destiny foretold by the cryptic Viden, a dragon with the ability to see a person's true fate. The words inked onto the page of the mysterious Book of Shadows remains black, and Elena must return to Dragonia Academy to discover their true meaning.Upon her return to the magnificent academy, she has to face a challenge of a different kind - keeping her boyfriend, Lucian McKenzie, the Prince of Tith and love of her life, away from the dangerous new student, Paul Sutton.As a Wyvern, Paul has made it his mission to claim Elena as his rider, but he is proving to be more perilous than at first glance.Everyone knew that Wyverns were bad news and just as evil as the darkness lurking inside Blake Leaf, the Rubicon, who is forced to fight against his inner nature every day. But Elena can see a small light in the darkness, a destiny still unfulfilled, to prove that Wyverns can be claimed.",
