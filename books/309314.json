  "description": "Continuous drought season takes a heavy toll on Subodh’s life. As the bank debt piles up, it leaves him with no choice. During one such suicide attempt, Subodh happens to meet Vanhi, a schoolgirl near a railway track. Their initial conversation enlightens him and the grief disappears in no time, because of her innocence and simplicity. All those intentions of committing suicide are metamorphosed by her audacity and the magical tiffin box that she carries. Subodh's incredible journey begins with the little one's brilliance and under the lights of Stephen Noronha. Every obstacle towards his journey creates an opportunity for himself and for the villagers at large. On achieving his ambitious dream, Stephen helps Subodh to deliver a powerful message to all the debt-ridden farmers.\"Committing suicide is not the ultimate solution. A person hardly needs a few seconds to commit suicide and be relieved of it. The problem expands multifold, which later one’s family has to bear, lifelong. There exists a thin line between life and death while killing self. The thin lifeline is often neglected and crossed because of the huge burden of loans and poverty. If we remain calm and composed, we can see that thin lifeline, through our savior. The savior can be in any form, a living thing, or any object, close to us. The living thing can be any of our near and dear ones. If we look around patiently, our cattle too can be a rescuer, with their simple touch.”",
