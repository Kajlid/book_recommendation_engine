Thrown back on her own resources, Sara displays the nobility of a real princess until, as if by magic, her fortunes change again.Sara was the adored only child of a rich, indulgent father. She arrived at Miss Minchin’s Seminary for Young Ladies in a flurry of silks and satins. The envy of the pupils, who spitefully call her “the little princess,” she lives a life of luxury―until her father dies and the unscrupulous and spiteful Miss Minchin relegates the poor girl to the seminary’s attic.Frances Hodgson Burnett was a British-American novelist and author of The Secret Garden . This novel, A Little Princess , shares the same sense of drama and charm as well as an understanding that nothing is more important than the friends we make in this life. The U.S. National Education Association named the book one of its “Teachers’ Top Books for Children.”",
