Be careful what you wish for? Well that's a motto Reese should have tattooed across her forehead. Because Loki, the Norse god of mischief, has just the remedy for the boring life of this woman who denounces his existence.His recipe for disaster?Take a 30 year-old woman and send her back in time as a pawn for revenge. Couple her with Eirik Sigurdsson, a Viking Warlord, too arrogant and baggage-laden to be of any use for anything, but battle and bed.

Bake at high until a white-hot love is unleashed and then forever frozen in time.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find Anal play/intercourse, dubious consent, menage (m/f/m).",
