  "description": "The man everybody wants. The woman he can't resist. The dom who masters both.  Women can’t keep their hands off billionaire Damien Call. The mysterious mogul has it fast cars, killer looks, and a brain that just might be his best asset.  Mia Beck loves her job at a PI firm. Her coworker Jake stars in most of her daydreams, so seeing him everyday is no hardship.  Jake hasn’t believed in human goodness since he worked black ops for the CIA. Romancing innocent Mia is unthinkable, no matter how enticingly submissive she seems to be. Then a case of corporate espionage forces them to pose as a dom/sub duo, to catch the eye of accused wrongdoer Damien. No fantasy is off limits for this voyeur—until the attraction the pair exerts lures him to go hands on . . .",
