  "description": "When Katie finds a cat hiding in her mother’s garden, she has no idea what kind of adventures awaits her. A new kid appears in school at the same time Katie’s friends and family begin having nightmares, and she begins to have amazingly vivid dreams. In her dreams, this new cat speaks to her, telling of darkness that has invaded the dream realm and encouraging her to begin a journey to help save not only the dream realm but the real world as well. Max, the new kid in school, has a dog that seemed to adopt him, just as the cat had claimed Katie. Max’s mom recently died in a car accident and his father had a very difficult time dealing with her death. That left Max alone and without any friends other than this new dog. Katie, her family and her friends learn that a simple caring gesture is sometimes all it takes to change the course of the world. Join Katie and Max as they learn the true power of our dreams and the importance of our friendships.",
