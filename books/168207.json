  "description": "It’s always easy to say what one should have or could have done to change the events in their life, but what happens when it's too late? When the damage is already done? Do I just give up? It’s hard to see a way out when I am lost in a sea of pain and have to face the realization that a chain of bad choices put me in my present state.  I’ve always believed I was a fighter, but somewhere along the line I forgot that, I gave up, I broke down. But here’s the thing, I wanted to be better, I wanted another chance to do better.  Don’t you think I knew all along that Dylan was my light, my love? I did. But like I said love is twisted.  When someone falls victim to their worst nightmare do you catch them when they fall or do you turn your back on them? I know I shouldn’t question this, but Luc understood my inner turmoil. Two broken souls, our bond almost seemed unbreakable. Almost.  I’ve met obstacle after obstacle. It’s laughable that I thought the threat would end with Luc. The threat is real, the fear I feel when I look over my shoulder is all real.  I’m Alexis White and I’ve learned from my mistakes, the question is: will I be brave enough to give away my heart forever?",
