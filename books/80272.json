She is tired of being smothered and told what to do in regards to her life. She’s opened a sweet shop and moved forward with her life. However, the love of her teen years is back in town and her family is trying to rein her in again.Someone in this small town is so set in their beliefs that they can’t see how love is sometimes simply love.
