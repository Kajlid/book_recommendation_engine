  "description": "A contemporary romance and an historic romance in one book! Helen McFadden – Hel for short – is a successful writer of Historic Romance for the eBook market. But one day she decides that she needs to get out and experience a bit of real life. She is soon clubbing, partying and generally having a good time – and men are springing up in her life from all directions. There’s Jason, the actor, Paddy the happy-go-lucky businessman, Jordie the footballer, Markie the pop star, even Pete, her old friend. But do any of them measure up to the heroes she writes about – especially Jack, the highwayman in her current book? Will Hel ever learn to relate to a real man and stop expecting to meet a clone of one of her heroes? From the best-selling author of Belfast Girls",
