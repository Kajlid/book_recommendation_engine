  "description": "This is a picture of Jesus on the wall.l believe Mother Mary is on His right and St.Theresa is on His left. I discovered this a few years ago and it appeared at a place directly across from the church that I had frequently used to sit to hear His voice...this had gone on long before this find!In this book 1 of 2 spiritual photographs I've taken I also have a face of what I think is Him and a woman in the bathtub with what looks like the Holy Spirit coming out of His mouth. There are a few other pictures that I believe are Him one on our kitchen rug and one on a basement rug after a flood...I believe there is also a picture of St.Joseph holding a lantern and some others that are intriguing...There are pictures of Hockey players that appeared on this rug right when the hockey began being played this summer, I swear to God.One of the hockey players is Adam Brown who I recognized through a beehive picture and who'd Brother was my Fathers best friend.There's a picture on a wood floor of my Mother and the name Ace written on a bath mat, which is what my Dad referred to me as at times...There is a picture of a cross that I took on the way home from the cemetary on Thanksgiving, I didn't realize what it was just felt guided to take it, then I witnessed my Mother's spirit elbows on our kitchen table pointed at the phone as I turned the turkey. I opened it and saw it was a cross!Book two Mother Mary is Here to follow shortly.",
