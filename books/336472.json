Then big trouble and a gorgeous package delivery driver fall into his world at the same time. Are they somehow connected? Jeff, a special agent for Homeland Security, is working undercover to help bust a contraband and drug operation. Tracks lead to the small town of Cameron Creek, California. Who is the crime ring’s contact at this end? As a delivery driver, Jeff is scoping things out. When he meets Monte, he is smitten at once, but evidence begins to link this new friend to the case. Jeff has every reason not to pursue a relationship, but can he stop himself? Genres: Gay / Contemporary / Mystery / Detective",
