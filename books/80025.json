  "description": "Young Adult, 9-13 crossover fiction. Two extraordinarily gifted 12-year-olds meet in an international school in Uzbekistan, and begin to disappear into their own world while exploring some of the mysteries of life. She's epileptic, formerly educated at (kicked out of) a school for the gifted in New York. He was formerly home schooled on a \"farm\" in New Mexico. There's a supernatural element, (no vampires) but the story is primarily about how a boy and girl can be friends in an environment that conspires to separate them. Lots of humor and enjoyable insight into the inner world of the young and gifted.http://www.amazon.com/Nicholas-and-Kr...",
