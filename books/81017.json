And there is nothing I wouldn’t do to keep Chase from harm. He might drive me up a freaking wall, but he was my pain in the ass. I wasn’t about to sit back and let some hunter fire an arrow through his heart. Not if I could help it.Then there is the one question that is on everyone’s mind: Will the hunter kill us or save us…",
