  "title": "The History of the Countryside",
  "description": "Fields, highways, hedgerows, fens, marshes, rivers, heaths, coasts, woods, and wood pastures: this tribute to the endlessly changing character of Britain's countryside illustrates how it developed over the centuries. Going right up to the present day, and including both natural and man-made features, it demonstrates the sometimes subtle, sometimes radical ways in which people, flora, fauna, climate, soils, and other physical conditions have played a role in shaping the landscape. \"...quirky and rewarding...full of answers to questions that others have not had the wit to ask.\"--Economist. \"One thing is certain: no one would be wise to write further on our natural history...without thinking very hard about what is contained in these authoritative pages.\"--Country Life.",
