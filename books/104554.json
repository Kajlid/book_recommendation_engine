  "title": "World War 1 - An Unkept Promise",
  "description": "This is a very important book, containing a historical document which throws a new light on the events of 1914 and 1915. Essentially it has three parts: a grandfather’s WW1 journal, an explanation of the events taking place as the journal was written and a quest to complete his grandfather’s unfulfilled promise.The journal is important for two reasons. It details the work of Royal Field Artillery signallers who maintained communications to direct bombardments when the war was still mobile, before trench warfare. This is unusual if not unique.",
