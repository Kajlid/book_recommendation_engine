  "description": "For Faith Cromwell, trompe l'oeil artist, it is the commission of a lifetime: painting the famed ballroom of an opulent Long Island estate. But her new patron has a macabre fixation on a daughter brutally murdered in the house a decade earlier one so intense that it jeopardizes Faith's own sense of mind. And as she pieces together the details of the grisly crime scene that shadows the house, Faith slowly discovers that she herself plays the starring role in a bizarre and dangerous charade. Sophisticated and exquisitely frightening, Trick of the Eye explores a world where evil tarnishes privilege, and nothing is what it appears to be.",
