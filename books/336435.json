  "title": "Cerebral Stimulation: The Page and Stage Poetry of Ritallin",
  "description": "Poetry meant for the page uses imagery and metaphor to speak its universal truths, while spoken word uses performance to captivate, animate and teach. Cerebral Stimulation showcases the gritty realities and emotional tableaux of that rarest of poets - one that shines as brightly on the page as on the stage. This premiere collection of works from one of Canada's emerging poetic talents is destined to become a hallmark of the next generation of African-Canadian literature. \"Frankson's first book will stimulate more that just your mind; his poetry and rhymes ultimately reveal a passionate man seeking love of others and love of self. A successful debut.\" John Akpata, 2005 Ottawa Capital Slam champion \"By the time you finish this book, you will find yourself in need of more Ritallin. One of the newest and freshest voices on Canada's spoken word landscape.\" Dwayne Morgan, winner of the Canadian Urban Music Award for Best Spoken Word Recording",
