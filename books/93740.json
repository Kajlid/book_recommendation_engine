  "description": "Mountain Dead takes a look at the dark side of Appalachia, where the Undead walk, driven by old magic and worse, their hunger for us. Almost Heavenâ€¦or is it? The mountain's enduring beauty holds something dark. Something dreadful. Something hungry for our flesh, our brains. Something dead yet not quite dead, driven by magic as old as the coal seams and the hills. This chapbook is supplemental material from the anthology Appalachian Undead edited by Eugene Johnson and Jason Sizemore. For more great stories like the four below, check out Appalachian Undead.
