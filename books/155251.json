  "description": "The desert planet Gandara is a world where glow rocks fill the night with captured sunlight and crystals flood the mind with potent dreams. Its idyllic peace is shattered when its power-hungry ruler discovers how to manipulate the vibrational energies of dream crystals to force his subjects’ loyalty. Determined to stop his father’s treachery, heir apparent Zanoah joins forces with the wanted leader of a rebel faction only to discover a freedom far more frightening than a manipulated reality. Caught in the chaos is the woman who loves them both. Unknown to them all, the altering of the crystals has unleashed errant vibrational energies that threaten the entire planet. Can Zanoah overcome betrayal, horrifying prescient visions, and a forbidden love to save Gandarans from a dangerous entanglement of corrupted natural and metaphysical powers? The Dream Crystals of Gandara is a pulse-racing story melding sci-fi adventure with the hypnotic lyricism of fantasy. Authors Charlotte McGary and Sharon Faiola-Petersen weave elements of quantum physics, sacred geometry, and spirituality into a multilayered saga that takes an unlikely band of freedom fighters from the twisting caverns of the subterranean Inualans to the ancient cliff-side monastery of mysterious Tahlik monks. Anyone who craves a page-turner with a deeply moving undercurrent will resonate with this transcendent tale of honor, love, and the unseen web of destiny.",
