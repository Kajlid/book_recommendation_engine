  "description": "Nerd Having to choose between life and death would seem easier if I wasn't dealing with the situation I've found myself in. I was asked a favor by a good friend to help them find someone, so of course I agreed without hesitation. It's what I do best-- locating missing persons. I never knew the person I was looking for would be the only one who's been capable of bringing me to my knees. With danger on her heels, it's up to me to persuade her into choosing me. Actually, even more than that. She needs to trust me too, because if she does the club will protect her. I already know I'd die for her, but will it be enough? With every turn truth and betrayal comes to light. Before we even realize it, the trigger is pulled. I only hope it's one of them, and not anyone we hold dear.",
