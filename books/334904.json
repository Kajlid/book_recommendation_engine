After all, Scott Huxley is a major Hollywood star, and one drunken picture two nights before his wedding could be a huge embarrassment. The two men have nothing in common except an intense attraction. An attraction neither want to acknowledge. Andy doesn't want to betray his own sister, and Scott's secret runs so deep he can't even be honest with himself. But it doesn't take Andy long to learn that he doesn't have to acknowledge an attraction to be completely overwhelmed by it...  Gay / Contemporary / The Arts",
