  "description": "A beating heart results in a life. My purpose is to give life to a part of our history as a ward of the state of New South Wales. It seemed to us that we were insignificant, it seemed to us it did not matter if we lived or died. I had a beating heart and I was not invisible and we had feelings that were ignored. In life’s energy we mattered and on a universal plain every child should.It’s my journey it’s in my heartWith every beat right from the startMy road travelled, the rugged truthHappy times raised from abuseYou will feel as I tell my taleI had the strength to just not failSo my book is something dearI shared my life so in it fearTake what you will from what I shareTo another this story does not compareIt’s my journey, it’s in my heartWith every beatWith no repeat",
