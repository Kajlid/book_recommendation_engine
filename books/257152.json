  "description": "A troubled woman faces a gripping moral dilemma after rescuing two abandoned children from a hurricane in this intense and intimate family portrait that moves at a thriller's pace.On the outskirts of North Carolina's Outer Banks sits The Paradise, an apartment complex where renters never stay long enough to call the place \"home\"--and neighbors are seldom neighborly. It's ideal for Sara Lennox, who moved there to escape a complicated past--and even her name--and rebuild a new life for herself under the radar. But Sara cannot help but notice the family next door, especially twelve-year-old Cassie and five-year-old Boon. She hears rumors and whispers of a recent tragedy slowly tearing them apart. When a raging storm threatens then slams the coastal community, Sara makes a quick, bold decision: Rescue Cassie and Boon from the storm and their broken home--without telling a soul. But the seemingly noble act is not without consequences. Some lethal. Bestselling author Carla Buckley crafts a richly rewarding psychological portrait, combining a heart-wrenching family drama with high-stakes suspense, as the lives of three characters intertwine in an unforgettable story of fury, fate--and redemption.",
