When she was a child, her fantasy Texas Ranger rescued her from the nightmare vampires who murdered her parents.

When Val finds herself abducted by her handsome dream man, she’s appalled to discover he’s one of the vampires she fears. Now, caught in a web of fear and passion, she and Cade must learn to trust each other, even as an immortal monster stalks their every move. Their only hope of survival is . . . THE FOREVER KISS.",
