  "title": "The Adventures of Buster Bear",
  "description": "When Buster Bear comes to live in the Green Forest, the amiable bully stirs up quite a commotion, for bears haven't lived in the forest for years. And sure enough, before long Buster has a series of run-ins with Little Joe Otter, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Farmer Brown's Boy, and even a stubborn metal pail!These and other entertaining escapades are delightfully recounted in this engaging tale. Set in a timeless world of bubbling brooks, blue skies, and green groves, the story also teaches valuable lessons on the dangers of greed, pride, and insensitivity. The text, printed in large, easy-to-read type, is enhanced by six charming illustrations, based on the originals by Harrison Cady.",
