  "description": "Meeting an important client at the airport should have been simple. Except I accidentally picked the WRONG man. Yeah. You read that right.Ryan Price is the definition of tall, dark, and handsome.He’s a grumpy and arrogant billionaire CEO in custom-tailored suits who acts like he owns the world. He’s also the hottest man I’ve ever met, but I won’t go that road. Mostly because he pisses me off all the time. And because I lost my job because of him.Love is the last thing I’m looking for right now. My life is complicated enough without borrowing some trouble.Plus Ryan says he isn’t interested in me romantically. That we are friends.And he’s offering me a job I can’t refuse, knowing the money will help pay my granny’s medical bills.Now he is my new boss.The problem is I like him. A lot. Even the way his neck disappears beneath the collar of his shirt drives me insane. And no matter how I much I try, I can’t stop thinking about our kiss.As the days pass and we get to know each other, Ryan starts showing me pieces of himself that draw me to him even more. In our quiet moments together he softens, he takes care of me when I need it most, he helps me start healing from my parents’ death. Beneath his arrogant, controlling façade lies a heart of gold.And I fall for Ryan Price. Hopelessly.But we shouldn’t act on it. We’re both haunted by inner demons. We live on different continents.Our lives weren’t meant to collide.**This title was previously published as Flawed and Damaged. It has been extensively re-edited, rewritten, and has a new cover.",
