  "title": "My Journey To Appalachia: A Year At The Folk School",
  "description": "In 1941, three months after graduating from Vassar College, Ellie Lambert arrived in Brasstown, NC, to join the staff at the John C. Campbell Folk School, an experiment in adult education modeled on Scandinavian folk schools. Na√Øve and idealistic, she decided to see the world by working in whatever different environments were open to a liberal arts major of the Great Depression years. Lambert's one-year commitment grew into a lifetime. After World War II, she married a local boy and returned to Brasstown to farm and raise a family. She watched the folk school grow into a thriving arts-and-crafts institution attended by people from all over the world. Her memoir is a slice of North Carolina history.",
