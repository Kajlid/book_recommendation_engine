  "description": "A small town, romantic comedy about love, letting go, and little green men with a choose your own adventure ending. My father was abducted by aliens. Or so I believed for the last eighteen years. After my mother's death, I moved to Roswell, capital of all things alien. I’m going to find out the truth and nothing will stop me . . . except Boone Santos. Compared to the intergalactic tinfoil hat brigade, he's a god amongst mere mortals. Too handsome for his own good (and mine), with a grumpy arrogance, and the most beautiful smile ever—he smashes my plan to pieces like a UFO crashing into the desert. I need a tinfoil hat for my heart. Do I believe in aliens? I’m not sure. What do I believe? I’m not going to fall in love with Boone. Definitely not . . .",
