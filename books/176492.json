  "description": "\"I'm not the hero in this story, girl. You'd do best to remember that.\"At eighteen years old, I was murdered. I wish my tale ended there. However, my killer resuscitated me and sold me to the highest bidder, sentencing me to a world worse than Hell.For the past two years, I've lived a life of torment as a man's property. I suffer in silence and wish for freedom, but I never break.I can't.I won't.But then he arrives.The first stranger since I was killed.Elder Prest, a thief with a heart as black as his soul, arrives as a guest in our twisted home. He has business with my owner, but his interest lies in me. He pretends not to notice my bruises and hides his knowledge of what I am, but the way he watches me makes me feel more human than possession.As his eyes tear through my walls and his voice demands answers, he challenges my owner for one night with me. I've survived two years of torment because I no longer believe in hope, but Elder is the only man who promises me pleasure instead of pain.Trusting him is dangerous, wanting him is deadly.Is he my ticket to safety or my ultimate end?Whoever he is, whatever he wants...I can't say no.",
