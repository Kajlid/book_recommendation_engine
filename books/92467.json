  "description": "Months after Tanner’s unexplained betrayal, Addy is finally able to put what was between them in the past and move on. Really she has no choice—he sent her back to Greystone alone and stayed in Tremain. He even deactivated the gate they worked so hard to repair to keep her away—if that doesn’t say extreme break up nothing does. When a strange condition begins killing its way through Greystone, Addy is forced to leave the Palace where she’d been holed up to try to help find the cause. No one seems to have any answers and everyone is afraid they’ll be next to burn from the inside out. The illness makes the rift between Ravensbog and Greystone widen when the Akori from the bog decide being around the people of Greystone could be hazardous. Addy is forced to pull her people together while struggling to find a way to stop the deaths.Even after breaking his heart, Gage is still by her side no matter what. Friendship like that can’t be ignored. A night alone together changes everything and Addy’s left wondering if maybe she made the wrong choice.
