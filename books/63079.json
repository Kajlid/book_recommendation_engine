  "description": "You will be entering a place where everything known about fantasy and science fiction have collided, creating a whole new reality …… where there is life throughout the universe … and on our Moon. They are hidden from view, observing, protecting, and influencing us. Those who have watched over us have raised one of ours, as one of theirs. He lives amongst us. Formidable is an understatement. He will lead us from the path of destruction and teach us how to fight those that hunt us. They have created our Savior and he will unify us.You’ve heard of him. You might even know him. He was carefully selected for this. His name is Chris Gates and he is the Savior Project. Now there is a book that explains how this was kept a secret for 50 years and how it all began. The first book about the Savior Project, The Chosen One, charts the covertly trained life of Chris Gates from his birth in 1966 to adulthood. See his life unfold on Earth as it is guided, shaped, and rescued by ‘those who have watched over us.’",
