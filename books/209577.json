  "description": "Learn the seasons with Babar and his familyThis reissue of a 1989 Babar classic introduces young readers to Babar's family and to the pleasures of the changing seasons with charming illustration and simple, brief text. In the chill and tingly air of autumn, Isabelle watches the leaves change color and Alexander carves a pumpkin for Halloween. Winter finds the family on a skiing trip, but before they know it the cherry trees are in bloom and Flora and Pom are helping their father plant a flower garden. Summer brings picnics by the lake and long days Arthur hopes will last forever. Not She's looking forward to the cool of fall again and getting back to school! AUTHOR Laurent de Brunhoff followed in his father's footsteps illustrating the Babar books starting in 1946. Since then, he has created more than 30 of the titles. He lives with his wife, writer Phyllis Rose, in Connecticut.",
