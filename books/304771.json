  "title": "The Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race In America",
  "description": "In this controversial essay collection, award-winning writer Shelby Stelle illuminates the origins of the current conflict in race relations--the increase in anger, mistrust, and even violence between black and whites. With candor and persuasive argument, he shows us how both black and white Americans have become trapped into seeing color before character, and how social policies designed to lessen racial inequities have instead increased them. The Content of Our Character is neither \"liberal\" nor \"conservative,\" but an honest, courageous look at America's most enduring and wrenching social dilemma.",
