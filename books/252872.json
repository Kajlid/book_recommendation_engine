  "description": "Ever since humans have dwelt on Earth, they have been stuck in this mainstream ideology of life is hard, things don't work as they should, and the reason everything is happening is because that's how everything should be happening, and we have little to no control over any of it. In his book Untitled The Mystery Unfolds, the author contradicts the above statements by declaring that change is important for the growth of humanity as a species; not just change in general. Through this book he aims to change the way humans think about and perceive situations. The book has many co-relative events and theories which are still mysterious to humans, with few or no explanations for why these things happen or have happened. This book sails through various genres of content; from storytelling to insightful theorizing to fictional writing. Instead of giving some pieces a climax, the author leaves an essence of mystery to encourage a flow of thought. The content tends to bring out a good mix of perspectives from different characters in the stories themselves. Only two chapters have names, Deja Vu & The Little Boy, other chapters, documents, or manuscripts have been kept unnamed for the readers to keep an open mind while reading. The general flow of content is not interconnected, but there may possibly be links.",
