  "description": "***BEWARE***If you don’t like pixies, then don’t read this diary. And if you don’t like feisty pixies who become queen while cherishing their so-called attitude problems? Definitely turn away right now. I’m a pixie who rules as Queen of the Summer Fae and yet, I’m also the proud owner of a very cheeky personality. What can I say? It works for me. Or it does until an evil sorcerer plans to destroy all of Faerie. The Usurper.To defeat this deadly mage, I team up with my elf crush, Dare. He’s a Prince of the Winter Realm and just awesome in general. Together, we face this threat like two pointy-eared bosses. Sure, it's a dangerous quest, but things get way worse when the unthinkable happens...Dare is kidnapped. Will I give up? Hell, no. But I will crash an ice polo pony tournament in a bikini. Then I’ll kick some sparkly fairy butt and save the day. Because that’s how we saucy pixie queens get stuff done. ***A 40,000-word diary written by Calla*** Pixieland Diaries Series1.
