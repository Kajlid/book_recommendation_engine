  "title": "Grumpy Bird",
  "description": "The debut book of Jeremy Tankard's high-flying Bird series! Bird wakes up feeling grumpy. Too grumpy to eat or play -- too grumpy even to fly. \"Looks like I'm walking today,\" says Bird. He walks past Sheep, who offers to keep him company. He walks past Rabbit, who also could use a walk. Raccoon, Beaver, and Fox join in, too. Before he knows it, a little exercise and companionship help Bird shake his bad mood. Praised by the Wall Street Journal as \"comic perfection,\" this winsome, refreshingly original picture book is sure to help kids (and grown-ups) giggle away their grumpies, too! Bird's im peck ably crafted, hilarious melodramas continue in the Grumpy Bird board book, Boo Hoo Bird , Hungry Bird , and coming in 2018, Sleepy Bird .",
