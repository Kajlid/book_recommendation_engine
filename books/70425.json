As mothers do … sometimes.Savanna arrives in Jessop, Texas with memories of her mother throbbing in her chest and a grumpy rescue dog trailing behind. Her father has made it clear: it’s time to stop avoiding her grief and face it head-on. So together, they are renovating her mother’s childhood home.But when Savanna runs into Blake – the boy with the scar running down his face like a teardrop – he looks at her with blame in his eyes.Drummond looks at her differently. His smile takes up his whole face. And he doesn’t fault her. He’s comfortable and selfish and simple.But after uncovering secrets from her mother’s past, Savanna is forced to reconcile the vibrant, strong mother she knew with the girl who lived in this small town long ago – the one who changed Blake and Drummond’s lives forever.In the middle of her healing process, Savanna is suddenly faced with more devastation: a wild, unforgiving fire that tears through town, burning homes, threatening lives and leaving families stranded. Savanna will have to heal and forgive quickly, to put the ashes of her own life aside and unite with the others to face the destruction … if she wants to make it out alive.",
