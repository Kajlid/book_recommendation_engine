  "title": "Vengeance of the Swallows: Memoir of a Polish Family's Ordeal Under Soviet Aggression, Ukrainian Ethnic Cleansing and Nazi Enslavement, and Their Em",
  "description": "Forced to endure occupation by both the Soviets and the Nazis, the author's family also faced the terror of Ukrainian \"ethnic cleansing\" by nationalist forces. The horror of the Nazi forced-labor camps wherein millions of Europeans were enslaved by the Third Reich is vividly recounted, as is the family's time in displaced person's (DP) camps. The author's family along with hundreds of thousands of refugees, unable or unwilling to return to their countries of origin, waited for their opportunity to emigrate in these camps under the American Occupation Forces. Piotrowski also details their subsequent immigration to America. The author based his research on family memories and recorded accounts; U.S. interviews and European published oral histories; informal discussions; published English, Polish, Ukrainian, German and Russian sources; U.N. documents and Nuremberg testimonies; and recent information from Warsaw.",
