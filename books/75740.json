  "title": "Sojourner's Flight",
  "description": "It was the end of an era. Out of the ruins of a broken empire, a semblance of peaceful normalcy has blossomed across the breadth of the Human lands, even those on the edge of the wilderness. To one such village, a young Dennarist, a follower of the Way of Discipline, arrives on her Sojourn of Service. It is her first experience of life outside the abbey in which she was raised. Despite the villagersâ€™ discouraging reception, she sets aside her disdain for the simplicity of their lives and ministers to them with patient endurance. Her Sojourn stretches from one year into two -- then her communication with home falls silent.And then from the silence, a grey robed man, energized by some dark, vengeful power, comes for her. Fleeing for her life into the wilderness, she is forced to place herself in the hands of an outcast elf with an unsettling nebulous past. Together, they forge their way back across the Human lands, in an effort to reach sanctuary among the Dwarves. While the outcast is forced to confront the haunted past he has tried so hard to outrun, the Sojourn begins in earnest for the young Dennarist, as she is forced to question all the unspoken truths she was born into as a follower of a now forgotten god.",
