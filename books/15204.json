As one of the few who can travel between the two worlds, it’s up to Morgan to find out who’s behind the attacks and thwart their evil scheme.Morgan is helped in her quest by the fey creatures Tilson and Askel, who guide her search for the culprit as they travel from a volcanic dragon’s lair to the bone-chilling arctic and a partially excavated ancient Egyptian pyramid.
