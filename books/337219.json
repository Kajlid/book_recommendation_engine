As punishment for his impudence and betrayal, his clan condemned him to human form and charged him with the task of earning the trust of a single mortal. Given less than a year to achieve his goal, poor Frisque finds himself banished to the present day. From the age of early myth to our modern era, Fairies have inhabited a magical niche in the human imagination.
