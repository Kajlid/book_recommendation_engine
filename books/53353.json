  "title": "Jewels of French History Books - The Lauragais Story",
  "description": "This is the story of the Lauragais region in the South of France. Spanning some 5000 years, it starts a considerable time 'Before Christ' and ends in modern times. Targeted mostly at expats or tourists to the region that have never had a chance to explore its history or realise the significant part the Lauragais played in the history of France. The Lauragais was central to the existence of Catharism and is also home to the World Heritage Site that is the 'Canal Du Midi'. The examination of the life of its creator, Peter Paul Riquet, and how the canal was conceived and funded is just one part of this book. Also examined is the history of the Albigensian Crusade, the German occupation and the reunion of the southern territories with the rest of France. There is more, much more, but if this hasn't wetted your appetite it may not be for you.",
