  "description": "Brooke is a guilt-stricken, battered woman who finds out she is pregnant. For the sake of her unborn child, she tries to change her outlook on life, but she is murdered before she gets the chance. The angel planet, Mahlai, is a place where certain children who die on Earth are taken to be trained as guardian angels, since new angels are no longer being created. Unbeknownst to Brooke, her unborn child, Grace, will be a very special child. Grace's daily agenda consists primarily of guardian training with her fellow trainee and best friend, Max. However, during off hours, Grace and Max explore the planet and often find themselves in forbidden areas. It is on one of these adventures that Grace discovers the power of the Well, which is a portal that the angels of Mahlai use to watch after the people of Earth. Through the Well's power, Grace falls in love with a boy on Earth named Sam. She becomes obsessed with discovering a way to leave Mahlai to be with her Earthly crush. Torn between the obligation of the world she lives in and the longing to be in the world where Sam lives, everything Grace has worked for will be put to the test as she chooses between what she was trained to do and what her heart tells her she must do if she wants to achieve the happiness she is destined to attain.",
