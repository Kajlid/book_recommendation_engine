  "description": "Sometimes secrets are meant to protect those we love the most… Sheriff Teague Castro made a mistake ten years ago that cost him the love of his life. But a recent brush with online dating has made him realize Jenny Northcutt always has been and always will be his one perfect fit. He’s ready to do whatever it takes to win her back. Jenny Northcutt is a divorcee with an eight-year-old son, and no time or energy for romance. But when her mom moves to the small Georgia community where Teague is sheriff, she’s forced to come face-to-face with the man who first stole her heart. Unfortunately, he’s also the man who destroyed her belief in happily ever after when he married another woman. Ten years later, Jenny still can’t deny the spark between them, but this time more than her heart is at risk. Teague cooks up a plan to woo Jenny, but a local theft could cast doubt that Summer Shoals is a great place to live. He and Jenny join forces to solve the mystery that could ruin the Christmas holiday for everyone in town. Now Teague must once again keep a secret from Jenny. This time, will the past repeat itself, or will they find true happiness?",
