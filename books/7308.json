  "description": "ROARING TWENTIES is a collection of poems that encapsulate the entropy of young adulthood. The nostalgia and peace of growing older. The loneliness and solace of solitude. The hopes that differ from expectations. All those paradoxical feelings, all those golden hours, evening walks, starless nights, unread books, late night thoughts, fantasies about the future, and new beginnings. The untold stories. The mad decade. The lost generation. The new era. The roaring twenties.",
