Along with the whole Jewish community, her life changes inexplicably with the Nazi occupation. From her point of view, her “crime” is that she is Jewish and she will make her voice heard to her captors, knowing her chances of survival are slim.With candid urgency, she recounts the war years, her encounter with the commander of the camp where she is interned, and her miraculous survival against all odds.",
