  "description": "Stephen R. Donaldson's unique talents have placed his work alongside that of J.R.R. Tolkien and established him as a writer with the rare ability to expand readers' imaginations. Now he presents a magnificent new collection of eight stories and novellas--three of which have never before been published.This outstanding volume commences with the fablelike title story, \"Reave the Just,\" which highlights one of Donaldson's favorite the individual's power to overcome adversity. This collection also introduces the morbid, soul-taking hero of \"Penance,\" the mysterious beggar woman in the dark fairy tale \"The Woman Who Loved Pigs,\" and the pampered antihero forced to make a choice between virtue and vice in \"The Djinn Who Watches Over the Accursed.\"Boasting exotic settings and suspense fueled by sudden plot twists, Reave the Just and Other Tales is a testament to Stephen R. Donaldson's talent to spin unforgettably spellbinding stories, and the astonishing scope of his mastery of magic and myth.",
