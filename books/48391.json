Though she's confident in her head snakes' ability to defend her against attackers, Seremela is still a bit nervous about braving this modern-day Wild West by herself.Vampyre Duncan Turner is not about to let his new co-worker go into that chaos alone.

And pray they make it out of Devil's Gate alive. Contains mother effin' snakes in planes, cars, tents, and beds. Luckily, our hot Vampyre hero doesn't mind them one bit...",
