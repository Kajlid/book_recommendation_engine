No one sees beyond the slave's body - no one bothers to look - until the sheikh of a desert tribe discovers the once-free, educated man could be an asset to his business. Noori's life is turned upside down as the sheikh takes him to his new home, where he will discover new challenges, new people, the possibility of freedom, and the irresistible lure of love.",
