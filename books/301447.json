  "description": "It happened one night not long after that holiday. I think they had been out but I’m not sure. I remember I was sleeping in my bed when the noises of my mum and him getting home awoke me. Suddenly, my bedroom door opened but it wasn’t my mum. I didn’t know where she was. It was him. I pretended to be asleep. He came to the side of the bed and I didn’t know what was happening but my mind told me to stay still. He pulled the covers back, I didn’t move. I kept my eyes closed. My heart felt like it was jumping out of my chest. He lifted my legs apart and I let them move. He pulled up my nightdress and pulled my pants down. I didn’t even try to open my eyes. Imagine being an innocent 7-year-old girl with a broke, single mum. Now imagine your mum meets a man that can give her a nice house and a better life in exchange for you. That’s what happened to me. For years I suffered neglect and psychological and sexual abuse from him, with my mum being a silent witness. I had No One to Save Me, yet I survived.",
