  "description": "GLENN BECK, award winning radio and TV host has been talking about \"The 5000 Year Leap!\" Have you ever read a book which literally changed the course of your thinking and your life? The founder's success formula, as presented in 5000 Year Leap would solve nearly every problem we have in American today if followed. This book will give you a feeling of confidence in today's confused world. Once an individual has a working knowledge of the only correct and proven principles for freedom, prosperity, and peace, then other history can be taught from a whole different perspective. American History becomes a study of how the United States throughout its 200 plus years has either supported the principles of liberty and prospered, or violated these principles and suffered. Can any other knowledge be more helpful to the rising generation in America today? America desperately needs better and stronger leaders. We need leaders who know correct answers and will step forward and make a positive diference in this world.",
