  "description": "A smart and sassy novel about the inevitable changes that come with divorce, remarriage, and step-parents.\"One of the worst things about Roland Butter is his name. I thought at first it was just one of his dorky jokes, \"Where do pigs leave their cars? At porking meters.\" Ha ha ha -- I don't think so. . . . I am certainly not going to change my last name to Butter, which is what Mom would like me to do. Cherry Butter! How could you get anywhere with a name like that?\"Cherry Waterton wants a dog. She wants to keep a diary (which she does), and she wants to someday become a pop singer--or even a judge. Cherry Waterton knows what she wants. What she most decidedly does not want is a step-father. Especially if he's goofball Roland Butter, who pushes silly coded messages under her bedroom door. She especially does not want him. Or does she?In a fresh format that switches between Cherry's diary, her mother's letters, and Roland Butter's rebus notes, this clever and funny novel relates a young girl's struggle with her mother's divorce and remarriage, and of course, the everyday quirks of adolescence.",
