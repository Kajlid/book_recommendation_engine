  "description": "FCX is a series of books taking place in the fictional universe of Anea, in which a race called the Lumarians live, along with their sister race, the Vamorians. While the universe is on the whole peaceful, there are still eminent threats that an active navy is assigned to deal with. The FCX books star the FCX Team, who are part of the army, and thus are often placed in the middle of the action. The books themselves are a series of episodes, with each episode chronicling a different mission given either to the FCX or WCX.This is the first book in the series.",
