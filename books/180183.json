A stalker hell-bent on keeping them apart.  Selene Michaels is determined to never let anyone make her feel inferior again. After a painful divorce, she finds herself in Paris on a working holiday, hopeful that this will be the opportunity she has been waiting for. She intends to have fun and maybe find someone to flirt with; someone who will show her a good time, treat her right. What she does not expect to find is Remington St. Germain and his adorable son, Adrien. Remington is intense, devastatingly hot and a Prince Charming on the outside, but a dirty talking, insatiable devil behind closed doors and not the type to give up on something that he wants. Adrien makes her loss almost bearable. Selene soon realizes that life with Remington is not only interesting, but adventurous and dangerous. Someone is eager to keep Remington and her apart, and will go into great lengths to make sure that happens.  Remington is at a crossroads. He can either let Selene go, forget about her. Or pursue her with determination, just like he does everything else. Otherwise he will be right back where he was before she came into his life. The clock is ticking, and danger looms closer. He will do anything to save the woman who is fast becoming a part of his soul.  Sometimes life gives you a second chance. But what happens when danger threatens that chance?  ***Due to sexual situations and explicit language, this book is recommended for readers 18+***",
