Every woman wants him, every guy...either wants to be like him or wants him too. I decide to play devil’s advocate, and hire Beacon to teach me the dating ropes. Maybe if we work together, we can find me a guy we both approve of.Except, moving to Baker’s Creek to work on this experiment isn’t working the way I planned. Seems like he’s doing everything to convince me that I don’t need a man.

If you like strong heroines & alpha males, steamy romances, and witty love stories, this series is for you!",
