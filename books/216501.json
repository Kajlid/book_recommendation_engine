  "description": "For Jo Mayweather, genie life is far from perfect, but it was finally beginning to settle down after the incident where she accidentally glassed over part of the Florida Panhandle. Her enemies have been quiet. The Djinn Council has left her alone. Her traitorous ex-lover has disappeared. Finally, she has time to figure out who’s behind the conspiracy to ruin her life. But setting her feet on that trail means discovering things from her past she’d rather not know, facing her parents in their newest incarnations, and getting a mission from the gods that she’s not sure she can complete. All in a day’s work, right? Sometimes Jo wishes she had a different occupation. Too bad wishes don’t work that way.",
