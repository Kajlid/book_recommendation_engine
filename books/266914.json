  "description": "They call us ruthless, and cruel. Filthy rich beyond belief, dominant beyond compare, and we run our company with iron fists.It’s the night before Christmas, but all is not calm. And all sure as h*ll ain’t right or bright. See, someone’s been skimming from the company piggy-bank, and selling secrets to our rivals.Not just anyone though. Her .Noelle Healy. The new hire. The innocently tempting, forbidden little tease who’s been driving us insane in our need to have her.…and we will have her.Dark hair, wild, fierce eyes, and just enough sass in those pouty lips and curvy hips to drive a man wild. Or two of them.But someone’s been a bad, bad girl this year, and she’s about to find her stocking stuffed with two somethings much harder than coal. We’ve got some heavy bells for her to jingle, and enough mistletoe to last all night.Christmas might come but once a year, but the two of us are far more frequent than that. And Noelle’s about to unwrap a bah-humbugging she’ll never forget.The \"nice\" list? Psssh. Please. We both know the naughty list is much more fun ;). So double-down, get a little wild, and get ready to indulge yourself in some seriously over-the-top, totally unrealistic fantasy at it's finest. Light a fire, grab a candy cane (or two), and let's put a little extra jingle in your bells this holiday season ;). This mfm romance is ALL about her - no m/m. As with all my books, this standalone novella has no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.",
