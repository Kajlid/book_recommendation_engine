  "description": "UK title: Lord Emsworth and Others.This book includes a collection of stories in which familiar characters and places are reintroduced in unfamiliar circumstances, reminding us - if we need reminding - of their author's limitless powers of comic invention. In the title story - one of Wodehouse's longest and best shorter fictions - Lord Emsworth takes his revenge on his ghastly secretary, the Efficient Baxter, setting off a wave of similar reprisals at Blandings Castle with amazing results. In other tales we meet several members of the Drones Club, while the final three reunite us with the ineffable Ukridge, more of whose ever-optimistic schemes for making easy money come to grief. A delightful meeting with old friends for some readers, a superb introduction to the world of Wodehouse for others.",
