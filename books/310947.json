Nothing like trauma to fuel personal growth!Nasty creatures Artorian thought were gone forever have begun appearing in the dark corners of the world, smiling at him with too many teeth. Between constant battles, Cal’s newfound love for math and pylons, the early stages of a world-spanning game system, and grumpy supervisors who refuse their bedtime…the sunny administrator has his now-tiny hands full.Exactly how he likes it.",
