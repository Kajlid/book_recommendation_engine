Meckenzie Desmond’s life took that turn as she and her triplet brother and sister find out that their mother, who disappeared when they were ten, is the fairy queen and they are meant to rule the world of Aquanis. Like every fairy tale, there is an evil lurking in the shadows to make sure there is no happily ever after.",
