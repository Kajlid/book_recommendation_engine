Despite his caution, he meets and befriends a local rock musician, Tommy Sear, who despairs of ever having his band make it. Quickly smitten by the dark-haired, shy Asian male that is Philip, Tommy seeks to make the young man his, but Philip doesn't believe in love; besides, he has a very real problem. He can't seem to get the victim of his last burglary, a green-eyed, virile Italian male... out of his mind. With Philip's encouragement, Tommy renews his efforts to get his band, Sear, a record deal. He makes a demo and shortly after a scout contacts him, from Italy no less.
