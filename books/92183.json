After years of Jack ruining one perfectly conceived plot after the next, a dark underground syndicate believes itâ€™s time he made a career change.When a mysterious job, too good to resist, turns from a simple retrieval to a high stakes game of lost and found, Jack finds himself racing against the clock to save those he loves.With a supporting cast of humorous sidekicks, the one-liners fly as fast as the bullets whizzing by their heads. The Finder tells the tale of what one man will do to save his way of life.",
