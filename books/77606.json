He locates numerous listings of births and marriages in the family, but not one instance of a death! Dexter begins to wonder if he's done the right thing in taking up residence in the house. What happened to his uncle, whose body is missing from the family crypt--and what's going to happen to him? Five tales of horrific curses and unspeakable monsters from beyond the grave!",
