  "title": "The Last Shieldmaiden",
  "description": "Four elite shieldmaidens and a young twenty-year-old ship trader embark upon a dire quest for the sake of many. Along this quest will be heartbreak and growth, for good or bad. As an advantage to the three-hundred-strong shield-maiden-order, all shieldmaidens of the light train from a young age and are chosen for their fair looks and above-average height. In addition, they have spelt eyes as bright as light to disarm their battlefield opponents.Vampires make a small curtain call and corrupt some of the celibate maidens; chaos ensues as heroic warriors of old arise from their graves. They are outnumbered; the witch of Winter Wood is their only option. A visitor to the White Isles may hold the key to help with an orderly retreat, however, make no mistake, there is no quick fix, we run, or we die.Unrequited love is the underlining theme, with two twins that our male protagonist has a double dilemma over. Along with the black shield maiden as well, yet she is by far the fiercest and bravest. Therefore, to ask her out on a date might have one’s nose bent out of shape from henceforth. The youngest maiden is probably the best match. Decisions, decisions, what is a gentleman to do? Besides, being well pleased, that he is at least in their company on any typical day; however, he is alive and well in these apocalyptic times.Zombies? Well, think; Jason and the Argonauts, and what those dragon's teeth did? It made capable skeletons climb out of the ground. The ones in this long old tale have armour and battlefield tactics. Although they don’t eat you, they are fare fat in comparison to the Argonaut’s skeletons.",
