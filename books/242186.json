Now he's got a second chance at a happily-ever-after if he's brave enough to take what he wants.  OUT FOR BLOOD  White sand beaches, fresh tropical drinks...and three exsanguinated bodies. So much for Marshal Ayer's transfer to the island of St. Kitts being a vacation.  DOG DAYS OF SUMMER  When a fae boy goes missing, all evidence points to a warg being responsible for the crime. Thierry is called to lead the hunt for the rogue, but the closer she gets to locating the boy, the further she gets from the truth.  A STONE'S THROW CHRISTMAS  Cam has a present for Cord, but once he unwraps her gift, their lives will never be the same.",
