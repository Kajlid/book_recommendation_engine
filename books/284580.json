  "description": "She's my last chance.   Those four words echo in Violet Spencer’s mind, tugging at her curiosity even as rage builds within her.  Arbon Academy was supposed to be a bright new start. An opportunity for greatness, and something an orphan girl could only dream of. For a while there, it seemed to be exactly that.   But Violet's bright future is suddenly looking dim. Arbon Academy and Prince Alex are nothing but a facade. A trap.  In a sinister world of ballgowns and backstabbing, of perfumes and politics, of indulgent parties and illegal sword fights, Violet now faces the biggest challenge of all. Recovering her shattered heart from the prince who crushed it.   Supported by her new friends, Violet wants to make Alex feel the pain of his betrayal. Prince Rafe wants nothing more than to help make that happen, but things aren't always so straightforward.   Don't break tradition. Don't let them know you know.  Don't lose your heart... again.  These rules will keep Violet alive. But at what cost?",
