  "description": "She thought she'd sworn off military men for good...\" Sam Kercher is every inch a wickedly hot Marine. Tall. Sexy. Lethal. When his best friends call in a favor, Sam is forced to face an entirely new line of duty-playing nanny for their newly divorced sister and her squirming seven-month-old twin boys. If Sam can dissemble an M16 in his sleep, diaper duty should be a cakewalk...right? Unfortunately, Operation Nanny isn't quite that simple. Sheridan has sworn off overbearing military men, so Sam must protect her from her dirtbag ex without revealing just how much he has in common with her brothers. Or that he's been ordered not to touch her. Ever. Problem is, Sheri's one hell of a gorgeous woman, and Sam wants herbad. Protect the girl. Care for the babies. Hide his identity. And keep his handsoff. But even the most disciplined Marine has weaknesses...and Sheridan is one Sam might not be able to resist.",
