  "description": "The True Life of Jesus of Nazareth First published in 1899--- His parentage, his youth, his original doctrines and works, his career as a teacher and physician of the people-the nature of the great conspiracy against him-all the incidents of his tragic death are given on Spiritual Authority from spirits who were contemporary mortals with Jesus while on Earth. Slashing through 2,000 years of Christian fanaticism, this book presents the true biography-before and after the crucifixion of Jesus. It exposes, for all time, the great hypocrisy of the Christian religion as the culmination of a villainous plot, contrived by the archvillain, Saul of Tarsus, and his cohort, Judas Iscariot-a plot that changed the world's history for thousands of years! Contained in a long-hidden book, this amazing revelation is delineated by no less than Saul himself. This true-life story of Jesus tells who his mother and father were, of his truly espoused, and of his life teachings! An Eye-Witness Account, taken from the actual parchment, is the true account of the crucifixion and the life of Jesus after this tragic event in Jerusalem, 2000 years ago.",
