  "description": "He’s only a friend. Those words had haunted him from the moment Jessie James had heard them muttered from the one girl, above all others, that he thought had his back. Sixteen years later, he still feels those words like a brand on his soul. Lucky for him he has a son to take care of, a full-time job that demands every single second of the day, and not a single moment to spare for the likes of a woman that won’t stand up for him when he needs her the most. He’s only a friend. The words had slipped out of Ellen’s mouth, and before she could recall them or better yet, explain, Jesse is gone from her life for good, taking her heart with him. She tries to find her way out of the pit of despair, but not one single person, no matter how much she tries, can fill the void that he left in his wake. Time heals all wounds. Or at least that is how the saying goes. It’s a crock of crap, though.Sixteen years pass when Jessie and Ellen see each other again without the influence of the town and bad memories surrounding them, and it’s as if not a single day has passed. Ellen knows the instant that her eyes see her old love that she’s still just as much in love with him today as she was all those years ago. The problem is that Jesse wants nothing to do with her. Or at least that’s what he keeps telling himself.",
