I was given a second chance, but I want a third. A fresh start—out from under my parents’ control. I was on my way to building my new life when my neighbor crashed into it, wrecking all my plans.Heir to his family fortune, Henry Ward III, returned to Texas with a plan of his own. With burdens as heavy as my own secrets, he needed a distraction.And with a man like him—who could own the boardroom and my body with one gruff gaze from his intense dark eyes—I was down for a distraction too.Little did we know, his burdens and my secrets are so heavily entwined, there’s no way to untangle them. I’m a Montgomery. He’s a Ward.We might as well be the Capulets and Montagues. Our connection is that rife with drama. That forbidden. That dangerous. When the past repeats itself, a distraction is the last thing we need. We need a lifeline as much as we need each other. The vicious cycle has to stop.It’s life and death.",
