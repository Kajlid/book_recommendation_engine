  "description": "The Clash Of The AlphasIn one corner we have Copper Yanez. Goddess? Monster? World Killer? Other? Hiding out five hundred years in the past, where she is a danger to no one. In the other corner is Hunter Mage, Elijah Bright, Head of the Southern Sanctuary Enforcers. Or as Copper prefers to call him, the arrogant bonehead who kidnapped and returned her to the future… supposedly for her own good. Elijah thought juggling the demands of his eccentric magical family was complicated enough. Now add a potentially unstable Goddess who has taken a vendetta out on his ass and is treating it like a pin cushion. Don’t forget the declaration of war issued by the local cats. Throw in a gang of vicious hybrid jaguars, determined to resurrect their human-sacrificing High Priest. And finally, there’s the Mayan God of the Dead, who wants to raise the Underworld in order to rule everyone. Whether they like it or not.Working together to defeat all their common enemies is the only option open to Copper and Elijah. Despite constantly butting heads a surprising but irresistible attraction explodes. Love is the last thing either of these two Alphas is looking for. But it might just be the only thing that can save them. Can Elijah goad a Goddess… to take a chance on love?",
