  "description": "When Courtney Taylor, a 23-year-old clothing store manager and single mother, is mugged at gunpoint by a man who resembles a rodent, she loses self-esteem, an uncashed paycheck and her driver’s license. Shortly thereafter, Reno Walch, a custodian and drug user, discovers Courtney’s license on a bus ride to work and seeks to return the wayward object. Meanwhile Reno’s cohorts, a trio of pharmaceutical addicts, are making a fortune on ill-gotten prescription OxyContin while consuming as many pills as possible in-between. Fixated on their own personal goals, nobody notices the major media outlets reporting the acts of a killer running rampant through the nighttime streets of Tacoma.The Tacoma Pill Junkies by Joshua Swainston follows the lives of working class twenty-something pill addicts as they find out what trouble success can bring. Behind it all, there is a series of murders involving a particular subsection of an under-appreciated work force.",
