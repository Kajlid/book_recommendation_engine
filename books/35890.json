  "description": "Sarah is an intelligent person; an architect. A difficult situation made her get a job as a cook in the government. She was happy to have a job, and a paycheck in a heavily unemployed country. She noticed the injustice, the violence and the hunger around her, but closed her eyes, lulled into security of her job. A friendly conversation in which she revealed she was not blind to the unfair system in which she lived, will show her that there is no safety for anyone who thinks. The codes on people’s hands serve as identification, the bank account, the credit card, the key to housing, the medical insurance. Everything! The code is life, without the code you don’t exist. Brutal humiliation by the police, her code erased, the elimination from life, shows just how deceptive her safety was. The system that tracks you, that owns you through your code, in one single day brutally takes it all away.You don’t exist; you were erased, alive but as good as dead.",
