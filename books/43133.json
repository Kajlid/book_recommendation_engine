  "description": "At first glance, the small mountain settlement of Mount Big Town, or ‘Little Town’ as the locals call it, seems to be a pleasant and peaceful rural haven. Senior Constable Tess Fuller and Sergeant Finn Maguire know better though, kept fully occupied trying to maintain some law and order in a town dominated by the huge feral Bycraft family. Can they recapture fugitive Red Bycraft before he makes good on his threat to hunt down Tess? And what is it exactly that those bikies are up to at their secret retreat and can Tess convince the Sarge that the only way to find out is to throw away the rule book?",
