  "description": "From the first moment they met, Tanner McCreary and Fitz Walker have always had a love-hate relationship. One that bordered more on the latter, much to the chagrin of Tanner—who knew from first glance that Fitz was his alpha. For some reason, Fitz acted like he wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. Even with the scent masking drug, Scentex, keeping them free, an omega’s alphas always seemed to sense something in the air when close.  But that wasn’t the case with Fitz.  So Tanner backed off, licked his wounds, and figured fate would lead them back together someday. Maybe then things would be different.  Someday came, but only made the situation worse. Tanner learned they shared a close friend in common—another omega—one Fitz eventually bedded. Brokenhearted, Tanner was sure the gods, fate, or whoever was in charge of binding an alpha and an omega together had gotten it very, very wrong.  His mate wasn’t the one apparently. Tanner lied to himself, saying he didn’t care, and kept his secret close. When the truth finally emerges, Fitz knows he has mountains to climb to make things right, and even that might not be enough. _____  This book is part of Kelex's Omegaverse... there are two series based in the same world...
