But the storm that holds California in its grip also provides the perfect cover for an even greater threat; an ancient and terrible evil that stalks the city's residents, mercilessly hunting them within their homes and on the flooded streets. Together, the survivors must fight to escape their drowning city and the creatures that now roam freely under the cover of perpetual darkness.",
