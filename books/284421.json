The book is an outcome of 5 years journey of the author in finding himself, he has curiosity about life and all those questions lead him to seek about the happening of outside and within. The book brought out thoughts, emotions and philosophy of life very clearly. It has been the shortest book on life which will spark the reader with curiosity of life, which is beyond those eyes.There is no bigger truth then this moment...Peace and contentment only come when we accept what is in reality. Maybe most of the people don’t like reality, that’s why they skip to the past or future and stay in thoughts; maybe it’s a tough time, maybe it's building them for future, maybe that’s how life is and we can’t skip it so let’s live with it and show our commitment to life irrespective of how it goes. Accept the truth and when we do that we make two choices either to continue happily with current life or we work hard to change our reality. With that acceptance and understanding comes the vision and courage to change reality. That’s how we achieve goals and grow as a person. The current moment of life is truth whether we invest it in thoughts or in actions, it’s our choice. – Message from Dhi life",
