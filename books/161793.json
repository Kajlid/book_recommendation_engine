  "title": "Story of the Niger",
  "description": "This story of the Niger is a rapid summary of facts. The material upon which the narrative is based is founds scattered over many bulky volumes, such as few readers would have either the leisure or the inclination to attack. But it has been thought that from the intrinsic interest of the story, a brief continuous narrative might prove acceptable to all who love a tale of adventure. The story told in these pages is essentially told by the actors in the drama themselves, and is such as demanded no decoration at second hand. What has been aimed at was simply to collect all that was most striking and interesting, most pathetic and humorous, and to weld the whole together in a consecutive and trustworthy narrative.Attention must be called especially to the Sketch Map of the Basin of the Senegal and Niger, showing Mungo Park's intended route on his second expedition to Central Africa, which is here reproduced from the original drawing made by the traveller, and presented by him to his niece, Miss Jane Park.",
