  "title": "Vandenberg: A Novel",
  "description": "Fantastic. A well-paced and compelling novel. On top of that, a gut-punch of a concept. A frighteningly realistic scenario of the U.S.'s demise. Going out with a whimper is indeed more chilling than a bang. Lange does a great job keeping every part interesting by frequently changing perspectives from characters to journals to enemy notes to government reports. Consistently engaging, real and flawed characters and the perfect length and depth. How this wasn't made into an amazing movie in the 70s is a mystery to me. Highly recommended.",
