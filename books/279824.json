  "description": "At the University of Paranormal Studies, class is about to start.\n\nClaire just received her letter of acceptance despite the fact that she didn’t apply. Why does the university want her?\nBecause ghosts, vampires, werewolves, leprechauns, elves, dragons…\n\nThey all exist – and more. They’re crossing over into our world on a daily basis – but not all of them are ‘friendly’.\nClaire is from a small town where her future prospects consisted of flipping chicken at the local fast food joint. Now she’s traveling to Boston, where she’ll learn how to fight this ‘mythological invasion’. She never thought she’d be in a class called Vampires 101 but…Claire’s a soldier in this new war – she will be humanity’s most dangerous asset.\nAnd if Claire and her classmates fail? If they don’t learn fast enough and fight hard enough?\n\n\nWell, graduation won’t matter too much when the world is reduced to ashes.\n\n\n\nFor fans of Leia Stone, Jaymin Eve, and Avery Song!
