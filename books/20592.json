She’s always looking for a good story, so when she’s invited to the most anticipated Halloween event of the year, she’s definitely going...even if she is a bit bummed at her lackluster life at the age of twenty-six. What she doesn’t expect is her fiery attraction to the sexy, dark haired, grey-eyed god at the event.Thanatos does not believe in the “uniting mates” theme of the Ball, and he’s there for one reason to speak to the god of all gods about the reinstatement of his powers. His attraction to Simone comes as a surprise—be it welcome—as she is not his usual type.Will Simone be his salvation or will his attraction to this human prove more dangerous than he anticipates?",
