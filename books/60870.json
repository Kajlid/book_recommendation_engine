  "description": "When a film producer arrives at the California Heritage Gallery to view Hack's paintings, he's accompanied by the artist's childhood sweetheart, a woman he hasn't seen in twenty years except in dreams, where she appears almost nightly, a heavenly image of beauty and light. Now Hack is overwhelmed with desire and despair, for she's the trophy wife of a rich man. What could she possibly see in a downtrodden, besotted artist? So, in a state of love struck dementia, he hatches an outlandish scheme to win her back: fake his own death, thereby driving up the value of his portfolio, and then under cover, continue to produce \"undiscovered\" work, get rich, to one day return and claim his true love, when they'll ride \"Fat Boys\" together into the sunset to live happily ever after. Even a loser can get lucky sometimes.",
