  "description": "Luna's coven thinks she is cursed, but that's the least of her problems. She only has three days to cure a curse nobody's seen before or have her powers taken away forever. All she could find was a magical disease book that lists her symptoms, but it mentions no cure. The author is dead, but there's hope. He had a family. In the dark of night, she gets a plane ticket, looking for the only people who can help her.",
