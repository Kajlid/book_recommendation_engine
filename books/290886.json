  "description": "This is a dark tale of loneliness and self-worth, and how the love of a woman can change a man.  My world was dark and filled with pain. Loneliness gnawed at my soul. I found solace in a bottle. Music was my only refuge . . . until I met her. She was a dark Gothic goddess in thigh-high leather boots. She brought light into my life and showed me what it was like to be loved. But could she handle the demons that haunted me . . . and the vices that kept them at bay? This is the one everyone’s been waiting for. This is Damien and Alyssa’s story.  Delve into the mind of Immortal Angel’s brooding, hardcore bassist with a troubled past.  Life wasn’t always good to Damien Diamond. An alcoholic, abusive mother left him to fend for himself and with little self-esteem. He turned to drugs and alcohol to mask his inner pain. If it weren’t for Angel Garcia, he would have perished on the streets of New York City, but it was a dark gothic goddess who gave Damien a reason to live. She wouldn’t put up with his self-destructive behavior, and he needed to turn his life around in order to win back the only woman he ever loved.  Alyssa never took an ounce of crap from anyone. The last thing she needed was a tattooed punk rocker with a boatload of baggage, but once Damien Diamond walked into her life, she couldn’t stop thinking about the sweet and sensitive guy that hid behind the tough-as-nails exterior.  Follow Damien Diamond as he prepares for the third leg of his successful World Tour with Immortal Angel, and as he reflects on his bitter past and the road that led him to be part of one of the most popular and radical punk rock bands in the nation.
