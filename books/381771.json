  "description": "She wanted to save the world-They wanted to save theirs. When the High Guardian of the Watchmen, Simon, is ordered to put a stop to the terrorists determined to wipe out the 'non humans', he zeros in on the daughter of the man believed to be the leader-Dr. Anna Blake. Miles Cavendish might be as slippery as they come, but Anna is all too easy for them to lay their hands on. The problem immediately rises that they want to lay a lot more on her than their hands, and Anna certainly isn't protesting too vigorously, but she's clearly against genetically mutating humans herself. She seems eager to cooperate, but how can she be trusted? Rating: Spicy/Carnal.",
