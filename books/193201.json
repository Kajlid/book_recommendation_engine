  "description": "A hilarious debut novel about a perfectly imperfect love story.Even the smartest people can be stupid at love. When Stacey Lane writes a feminist take on  Frankenstein , she never imagines it will catch the eye of unbelievably sexy Hollywood star Tommy DeMarco. Tommy’s passion for her book—and for her, a recently widowed poet, mom, and certified mess—threatens to turn her life upside down, or maybe right-side up. From their first poolside meeting the two are set on a collision course as they go about making the book into a movie, making each other crazy, and making love, if only in secret. Fueled by desire, love, grief, expertly poured cocktails, and crackling dialogue, A Love Story  is a witty portrait of a relationship gone off the rails and two people who are made for each other—even if they’re not so sure they see it that way. **A Summer Beach Read Pick for  Harper’s Bazaar , the Associated Press,  Purewow , and  Refinery29** “This fast-paced novel will have readers immersed in the heady feeling of an alcohol-fueled affair with one of the sexiest men alive.” —“An addictive page-turner, ripe with seduction and charm, that drops insights into this messy, crazy, wonderful thing called love.” — Washington Independent Review of Books“Entertainingly dyspeptic.” — Vogue“A perfectly imperfect love story.”— Bookpage",
