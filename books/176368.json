  "title": "Otherwise: New and Selected Poems",
  "description": "Otherwise collects a lifetime's work by one of contemporary poetry's most cherished talents. Opening with twenty new poems and including generous selections from Jane Kenyon's four previous books― From Room to Room , The Boat of Quiet Hours , Let Evening Come , and Constance ―this collection was selected and arranged by Kenyon herself―alongside her husband, the esteemed poet Donald Hall―shortly before her death in April 1995. This extensive gathering reveals a scrupulously crafted body of work in which poem after poem achieves a rare and somber grace. Light and shade are never far apart in these telling narratives of life and love and work at the poet's rural New Hampshire home. The shadow of depression in Kenyon's verse, which grew much darker and longer at certain intervals, has the force and heft of a spiritual presence―a god, demon, angel. Yet her work emphasizes the constant effort of her imagination to confront and even find redemption in suffering. However quiet or domesticated or subtle in her moods and methods, Kenyon was a poet who sought to discover the extraordinary within the ordinary, and her poems continue to make this discovery. As Hall writes in the afterword to Otherwise , we share \"her joy in the body and the creation, in flowers, music, and paintings, in hayfields and a dog.\"",
