  "description": "The little witch was only a hundred and twenty-seven years old. That´s not at all old for a witch. She spent about six hours a day doing exercises in witchcraft, but she couldn´t get her spells right. Then she got into deep disgrace at the Walpurgis Night party. She was given a year to make herself into a good witch or be expelled. So many strange and funny things happened to her that year, she began to wonder if she would ever pass the final test.",
