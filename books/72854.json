  "description": "What would you do if you found out you weren't entirely human and specially trained hunters were trying to kill you? For Tyranna, a young orphan, it means moving to Rosehaven: a hidden city filled with sword-fighting squirrels, goblin assassins, and a dangerous criminal organization run by an emotionally imbalanced fairy. It might not be the safest place in the world, but when you're Retic it's the only place left.",
