  "title": "Gun Shot Witness: The Tim Remington Story",
  "description": "A true story. On March 6, 2016, Pastor Tim Remington was shot six times at close range with .45 hollow points by a man who thought he was stopping an alien from Mars. Five bullets sheered through Tim's torso, nicking one lung and just missing his colon, his kidneys, his liver. First responders found a flattened bullet in Tim's pocket, where it landed after piercing Tim's jacket on course for his heart. The sixth bullet blew through his arm and slammed into his head, halting right at the lining of his brain. His blood poured over the pavement as though he were a pitcher that had tipped, but Tim survived. The love and mercy of God had long been evident in Tim's life - and his church full of 'misfits' - but Tim's remarkable survival shouted that love to the world in an obvious, visible way. The shooting of Pastor Tim Remington raised a question that required investigation. Why this particular pastor? What about Tim made him a prime target? Why did Satan so badly want him dead?",
