  "title": "Kuk Sool Goong: Korean Martial Art Archery",
  "description": "Korean traditional archery known as “Kukgung” (국궁) (alternate spelling “Kuk Goong”) is practiced throughout Korea and in many parts of the world. I will be using the alternate spelling “Kuk Goong” throughout this book. Kuk Goong is a beautiful and compelling art. There is a copious amount of information about Kuk Goong (Kukgung국궁) published and available on the internet so I will not say much about it except as it applies to our World Kuk Sool Association® (WKSA®) martial art archery.This book is meant to introduce readers to the training and practice of “Kuk Sool Goong” (국술궁). Kuk Sool (국술) is a Korean traditional martial art that includes the training and practice of Korean martial art archery.The World Kuk Sool Association® (WKSA®) martial art archery uses the same fundamental equipment as “Kuk Goong” and the first posture is the same. After that WKSA® teaches many different postures and distances for shooting and that makes it (or us) different from “Traditional Kuk Goong”.I will introduce the archery requirements and rules for World Kuk Sool Association® (WKSA®) competition as well as the fundamental, intermediate and advanced postures for training in “Kuk Sool Goong” (Kuk Sool archery). I will also introduce Kuk Sool Goong Shi Juhn “Arrow Shooting Battle.” Sometimes it’s also called “Archery Sparring.”This book is meant to introduce the reader to traditional Korean martial art archery as taught and practiced by the World Kuk Sool Association®.",
