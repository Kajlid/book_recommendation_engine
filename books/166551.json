  "description": "In this darkly comic, quite immoral masterwork, Edward is an effete, poor young man who has something in store for his only relative, his wealthy aunt. First published in 1934, this classic mystery is considered a masterpiece of the inverted detective story, in which it is known \"whodunit.\" The question is \"how will they catch 'em?\" Highly unpredictable, it contains one of the most surprising denouements in all of detective fiction.",
