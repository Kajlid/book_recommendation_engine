  "description": "What kind of secrets do you bury deep, vowing never to reveal to a soul?  No one realized Nadi's troublesome behavior had a cause behind it. A secret, deep and dark that she hid from the outside world. She would have never guessed that one bad decision would challenge that vow, changing her life forever; he would change her life forever.  “I’ve spent years building walls, trying to deal with what I’ve been dealt in life. I’ve had to learn to be strong.” – Nadi  Nadi gets herself into trouble and is sent to a 'last chance' bootcamp, half way across the country. She is determined to keep everyone at arms length, but when she gets there, it proves to be more difficult than she ever expected, and her past will come back to haunt her.  Aerick is good at his job. Others don't like him much, but he doesn't care. In fact, he prefers it that way.

Life is good, that is until she shows up, and turns his world upside down. She is hiding something and it becomes his mission to unveil her past.",
