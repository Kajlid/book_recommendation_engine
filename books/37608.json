  "description": "Author's Preface: \"The title says what it is, and what it’s about. My every narration is centered around my main character, and my books are about love, carnal love and love for fine arts. The Silver Thread is the only theme of my creative works, m/m love, and it’s a silver thread from the Silver Age of Russian literature, besides the book contains the winter tale and the book has come out in the season of winter holydays, 2011-2012, being self-published on Smashwords.com, therefore it’s both history and the winter season. My main character is a storyteller too. Reading one of his stories is like opening a box of delicious candy, each piece exquisite, unique, and a pure delight. His story Beyond Silver Threads is no exception. Embracing each other, two lovers create one shadow for two, and they can create something more, being creative-minded persons like those whose works they enjoy seeing or reading. Like the previous book, Silver Thread Spinner has two or three female characters, and again it must be said that my all female personages are me or my images, more or less, partly or completely, and not anybody else.\"",
