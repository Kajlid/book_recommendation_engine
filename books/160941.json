  "description": "Bonfire Heart by Devon Rhodes   \nSometimes fires burn and destroy, but from the ashes, new growth can heal and  cleanse.\n  Thierry Alexander is the deputy mayor of Chicago, a city he loves but can’t save on his own from  the corrupt political system. His assistant and lover, Eduardo, is also known as Cesar, the head of the  underground resistance movement. He has been working behind the scenes for years and finally  gets what he needs—enough information to get the US government involved and take down  the criminal elements strangling the city he loves.  But they need to act fast because legislation is about to be enacted that will give rise to social  and ethnic purging in Chicago. Not knowing who they can trust, they will have to put their faith in  one another and risk everything to save a city.   About Devon Rhodes   Devon started reading and writing at an early age and never looked back. At 39 and holding,  Devon finally figured out the best way to channel her midlife crisis was to morph from mild-  mannered stay-at-home mom to erotic romance writer. She lives in Oregon with her family, who are  (mostly) understanding of all the time she spends on her laptop, aka the black hole.",
