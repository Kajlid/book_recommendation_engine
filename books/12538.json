  "description": "Washington TV host John O. Banion is arguably the most powerful man in Washington. He has it wealth, political influence, and the power to mock the president on live television. But his privileged life is thrown into upheaval when he is abducted by aliens - twice. Little does he know it was the work of a top secret government agency which aims to increase extraterrestrial belief through cattle mutilations, abductions and 'probing'. As Banion disregards his credibility and throws all his energy into becoming the impassioned leader of American alien abductees, the government becomes increasingly threatened, and strange events begin to unfold in Buckley's hilarious satirical novel on Washington politics.",
