  "description": "From the dark mind of Rhyll Biest comes a story about a Teutonic god, a guarded recluse, some dirty pictures, and the spark of curiosity that leads to a dangerous attraction.When the reclusive Holly Unthanks finds some very naughty photos, both the star — a muscular Teutonic god with some serious ink and a knack for knots — and the way he’s tied his lady friend to his four-poster bed, make her more than a little curious. But to get to know the big, built stonemason better, she’ll have to overcome his vengeful ex and her own inhibitions — and pray that the walls she’s built around her guarded heart and dark secret remain safe from a man who has a way with stone.",
