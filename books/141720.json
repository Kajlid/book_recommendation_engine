  "title": "Old Friends: Great Dogs on the Good Life",
  "description": "Old dogs know plenty of tricks for staying young at heart - and here they are! This humorous and loving collection of duotone portraits captures the golden years of humanity's best friends and most faithful companions. Sage and tender moments are caught on film and are paired with captions that reveal each dog's age and their secrets for a long and happy life, such as Tonto (12): \"Lift and pee, lift and pee, lift and pee on every tree,\" and Kelsey (11): \"Never let little dogs with bows in their hair get the best of you.\" These are dogs who know how to live life fully and recognize its priorities (like bacon). Old Friends is the perfect gift for dog owners and everyone who hopes to age gracefully in the canine spirit.",
