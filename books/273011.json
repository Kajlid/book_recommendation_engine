  "description": "How did I end up in this random small town in Pennsylvania with three hot guys? Well, it’s a long story involving a mechanical bull, my old middle school crush, and a marmot with an engagement ring…. When my awful ex decides that the grand gesture I need is a surprise proposal at a high school football game, I run off and accidentally crash-land right into the arms of my first love, Ben. I haven’t seen him since we were kids. We pick up right where we left off...until Ben finds the engagement ring and flips out. I explain everything, but it’s not enough. Ben is dealing with his own failed relationship and he shuts me out. But Ben has two roommates. Two brand new hot guys I’ve never met before. First there’s Nathan, the personal trainer who has rock hard abs instead of baggage, who takes care of me and makes me laugh. And then there’s Avery, the teacher, who gets me like no one else has, who makes me feel safe and happy. I like them both. And they both like me. They said they’re willing to share, but that’s ridiculous, right? And why can’t I stop thinking about Ben? Carlyn and the Three Roommates is a standalone reverse harem romance with a guaranteed HEA.",
