  "description": "History, Mystery, and Romance in the Carolina Lowcountry!A haunted necklace, a trickster rabbit, an ingenious slave, a shrieking droll, and a fianc√© returned from the dead all come to life in Lynn Michelsohn's new collection of Carolina Lowcountry ghost stories and folklore from the four historic rice plantations making up Brookgreen Gardens - South Carolina's popular tourist attraction near Myrtle Beach. These enchanting folktales, tied to specific plantation locations and historical events, enrich the enjoyment of any visit to the Lowcountry for tourists, armchair travelers, or devotees of ghost stories and folklore. Lynn Michelsohn, a tenth generation Carolinian, is clearly drawn to history, mystery, and romance wherever she finds it, as her previous book, \"Roswell, Your Travel Guide to the UFO Capital of the World!\" explores intrigues of a different kind. Now, in \"Tales from Brookgreen\" her charming retelling of these sometimes-eerie, sometimes-sad, sometimes-humorous tales engages readers in characters and folkways unique to the Carolina Lowcountry.",
