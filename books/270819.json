  "description": "There are moments when you think life is going one way and a major curveball sends you the complete opposite direction. That’s me, standing in the rain, wondering how things went so terribly wrong. What do I need? To hide at my brother’s house to lick my wounds.What do I get? My brother’s roommate, sexy-as-sin best friend, Carter Kennedy.The cute, adventurous boy who was my teenage crush. The inspiring, irresistible man who will never be mine. But then things get complicated with fun-filled days and pleasure-filled nights. If Carter wasn’t the most commitment-phobic person I know, I could consider the cliché of dating my brother’s best friend. But he will never fit the husband checklist I made to find the man who will be my world, and I’m not willing to compromise on that. At least, that's the plan.",
