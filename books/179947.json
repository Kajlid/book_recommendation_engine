  "description": "“And when it falls into silence again the void it echoes fills me wonder. Wonder only because I no longer remember if this small entity isn’t real or if it whispers the truth.”-MoonlightC. Streetlight’s memoir, Tea & Madness, is a collection of prose and poetry separated into the seasons of her life. Each season is inspired by her experiences: grieving a lost baby, understanding depression, anger, betrayal, surviving rape and the acceptance that she cannot forgive. Balanced somehow within the darkness is the wonder in motherhood and empathetic relationships. As her seasons change, she continues trying to find the balance of existing between normalcy and madness.",
