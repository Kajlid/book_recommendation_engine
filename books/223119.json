Stardust Child was inspired by the words of renowned astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson . We are biologically connected to everything in the world. We are all, not figuratively, but literally, made of stardust.   The story of Stardust Child celebrates that we all share the same essence despite limiting labels and cultural differences. Picture by picture, the story instills the concept of our oneness, our ecological interdependence, and the unique light that each of us brings to the world.  Keep asking questions!",
