  "description": "The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper, West brilliantly recasts the Jack the Ripper story, drawing on up-to-date research and his own dazzling imagination to plumb the lower depths of Victorian England. Paul West has made a reputation for himself by attempting to penetrate the darker sides of humanity. In THE WOMEN OF WHITECHAPEL AND JACK THE RIPPER, West ventures into Victorian England and presents a society that is in decay. In his preface, he acknowledges the various sources that have given rise this novel. Westâ€™s premise is that Jack the Ripper was not a lone madman bent on random mass murder, but that the murders were carried out by a trio of individuals who were silencing specific victims in order to cover up a royal scandal.",
