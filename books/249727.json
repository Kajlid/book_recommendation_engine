  "description": "Who said coming out was easy? But for Freya, that was the understatement of her life. Her future was all planned out; graduate medical school, become a doctor and at some point get married. If she's to travel, it has to be now and so, together with Gabe, her long-term boyfriend, they take a camper to the continent for three months of bliss. One promise was made - That this would be the greatest summer of their lives. However, their plans are cast into disarray when Gabe receives an unexpected call from an old friend. He's loud, he's rude, he's close by, and he wants to join them. How will Freya cope now that her one chance for an intimate adventure's been hijacked by the most obnoxious man she's ever met and his slender, blonde and mystifying travelling companion? Freya had not bargained on meeting Arwen, a beautiful dancer from Australia and gradually, her orderly world turns to confusion as this exceptionally casual free spirit throws her entire life plan into doubt. Could this rigid Scottish trainee doctor seriously be attracted to a braided hippie woman who meditates? It was preposterous, yet... Suddenly, the relaxing European adventure sheâ€™d once craved is now life changing as Freya risks everything to discover who she really is. You'll adore this holiday romance because everyone loves a tale of sun and self-discovery. Get it now.",
