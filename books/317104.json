  "title": "New Year at the Pier: A Rosh Hashanah Story",
  "description": "Izzy’s favorite part of Rosh Hashanah is Tashlich, a joyous ceremony in which people apologize for the mistakes they made in the previous year and thus clean the slate as the new year begins. But there is one mistake on Izzy’s “I’m sorry” list that he’s finding especially hard to say out loud. Humor, touching moments between family and friends, and lots of information about the Jewish New Year are all combined in this lovely picture book for holiday sharing.Winner of the Sydney Taylor Gold Medal for best Jewish picture book of the year!",
