  "description": "When Sherry slept with Glenn, she had a career and a future. Little did she know she′d leave them all behind in a motel bedroom. What was she thinking? In this blistering tale of two self-centred, headstrong high-achievers, Michelle Holman continues the story she began in her bestselling first novel, Bonkers. The brother- and sister-in-law — who famously met when she nearly arrested him for breaching bio-security with a banana — have three things in common. They′re uncommonly tall, neither is anything like their married siblings, and they fancy each other something rotten. Trouble is, Sherry can′t stand the arrogant former American NBA star, while Glenn can′t stand the aloof ′don′t mess with me′ policewoman. Ending up in bed together is a great surprise. Neither wanting to admit it was a nice surprise is a complicating factor. And then the fun begins. With Michelle′s trademark talent for sizzling sex and the best one-liners you′ve heard in a long time, readers and characters alike are in for a treat.",
