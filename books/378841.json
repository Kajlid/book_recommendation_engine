  "description": "A Season of ChangeAlong the Virginia shoreline where their families have lived for generations, Buck and Tunes Smith defy tradition. Raised together like brother and sister, they are bound by surname, but not by skin color. And just as Buck has come to rely on Tunes, Tunes has come to trust that even in a place where race can mean so much, their friendship will remain as dependable as the tides.But then the horrifying events of one spring afternoon tear them apart—and change their world forever. Desperate to hang on to the thing that he values most, Buck struggles to uphold their friendship—without realizing that his efforts are pushing Tunes farther and farther away.From a Newbury Honor-winning author, this is a powerfully moving story of friendship in the face of racism, and betrayal in the name of loyalty. Dangerous Skies is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
