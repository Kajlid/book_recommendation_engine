  "title": "Change the World for Ten Bucks: small actions x lots of people = big change",
  "description": "In 2004, a London-based community organization called We Are What We Do launched with the publication of a little book with a big 50 simple actions to make the world a better place. Since then, Change the World for Ten Bucks has spawned a movement, multiple editions, and sales of over one million copies internationally. At last, here's the U.S. edition. Change the World for Ten Bucks delights and engages at every turn. It includes a postcard to send to someone who inspires you, two pages stuck together (don't throw your gum in the street!), tear-out tabs to make introductions to the neighbors, and dozens of other creative prompts for positive change.",
