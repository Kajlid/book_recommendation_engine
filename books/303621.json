Through each “object,” Randall uncovers another part of herself, starting in amuseum in Amman, Jordan, and ending in the Latin American Studies Association inBoston. Interwoven throughout are her most precious relationships, her growth as anartist, and her brave, revolutionary spirit.As Randall’s adventures often coincide with important moments in history, many of herobjects provide a transcontinental glimpse into social upheavals and transitions. Sheshares memories from her years in Cuba (1969 to 1980) and Nicaragua (1980 to 1984), aswell as briefer periods in North Vietnam (immediately preceding the end of the war in1975), and Peru (during the government of Velasco Alvarado).In her introduction, Randall states, “objects and places have always been alive to me.”Her history too is alive, as much of a means to consider our own present as it is toglimpse her vibrant past.",
