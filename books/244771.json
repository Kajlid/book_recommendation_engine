  "title": "The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories",
  "description": "From the author of the award-winning, internationally bestselling Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, an enchanting collection of stories. Set in versions of England that bear an uncanny resemblance to the world of Strange and Norrell, these stories are brimming with all the ingredients of good fairy tales: petulant princesses, vengeful owls, ladies who pass their time in embroidering terrible fates, endless paths in deep, dark woods, and houses that never appear the same way twice. Their heroines and heroes include the Duke of Wellington, a conceited Regency clergyman, an eighteenth-century Jewish doctor, Mary, Queen of Scots, Jonathan Strange, and the Raven King himself. The Ladies of Grace Adieu is the perfect introduction to a world where charm is always tempered by eeriness, and picaresque comedy is always darkened by the disturbing shadow of Faerie.Contents:Introduction by Professor James Sutherland, Director of Sidhe Studies , University of Aberdeen (2006)The Ladies of Grace Adieu (1996)On Lickerish Hill (1997)Mrs Mabb (1998)The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse (1999)Mr. Simonelli or the Fairy Widower (2000)Tom Brightwind, or, How the Fairy Bridge Was Built at Thoresby (2001)Antickes and Frets (2004)John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner (2006)",
