Morgan Jordan is everything Ally doesn’t want—he’s a playboy from a blue-collar background, and Ally’s looking for upper-class stability. Though their relationship starts off as a one-night stand, once Ally learns Morgan is her best friend’s brother, there’s no escaping him…or the growing fire between them.As Ally and Morgan become closer, they confront bitter enemies, his sister’s disapproval, and paths taking them in different directions at summer’s end. When their greatest test arises, it’s one that threatens to destroy them both.This second audiobook in the bestselling Someone to Love series proves that in love and passion, sometimes two wrongs do make a right.Intended for mature audiences ages 17+",
