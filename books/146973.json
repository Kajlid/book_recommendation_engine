Pat loses something precious and his future takes an unexpected turn.What part do the new characters play, and what relevance does the greater global conflict, which has been going on for eons, play in the life of the protagonists?The Dragons and Visions series presents an exciting adventure in Visionary-Metaphysical fiction where the Inside, the inner realm of the sub-conscience, and the In Between, a mysterious realm of the dead, are explored by the characters. Could this be the true source of wisdom?Although Dragon Song can be read on its own, it is highly recommended to read Book 1, Pursuit, in the series first.",
