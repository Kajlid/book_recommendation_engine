  "title": "Bodysnatcher",
  "description": "Bodysnatcher is based on the shocking serial killings of 16 individuals in the West Port of Edinburgh in the late 1820s by William Burke and William Hare, two Irish immigrants who sold the bodies to Dr. Robert Knox for anatomical dissection. While Burke was publicly hanged and dissected after their arrest when Hare turned King's Evidence, the role of their two female partners, who claimed to be ignorant of the crimes, remained the subject of debate.  Structured by way of dovetailing, narrative confessions by Nelly (Helen McDougal) and her partner Billy (William Burke), Bodysnatcher is a he-said, she-said Gothic historical romance novel with a few diabolical twists. It offers the compelling inside story of their complex dysfunctional relationship shadowed by dark mysteries of its own. Central to the tale is the unravelling of the mystery of the 17 curious dolls in small, ornately decorated wooden coffins discovered in the north-east range of Arthurâ€™s Seat seven years after the murders, dolls that are currently on display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  Weaving together actual historical figures and accounts with speculations about a dark, increasingly violent relationship, Bodysnatcher is a powerful and sophisticated Gothic tale of poverty, desperation, love, and loss set against the backdrop of nineteenth-century Scotland, a country in the throes of rebellion and transition. In its exposure of the dark side of nations, institutions, and individuals, Bodysnatcher prompts us to reconsider the nature of crime and who the real criminals are. Sometimes, our greatest crimes go unpunished.",
