  "description": "A Reverse Harem Shifter RomanceAn unclaimed female wolf shifter is a rarity, kind of like a unicorn. Highly-sought after, even fought for. But if Maia has her way, she’ll stay unclaimed. Maybe it’s a human way of thinking, but she should get to decide who to be with. It isn’t asking for the world.  On the run from her old pack due to a  slight  misunderstanding with her intended mate—meaning a claw to his throat—Maia stumbles upon a quaint town in the middle of nowhere. What she does not expect is the trifecta of misfit wolves who’ve made the town their home.  Alarick, the understanding, calm and collected alpha. Farkas, the sarcastic and witty beta. Grimm, the tall, dark and handsome loner. All ridiculously sexy, and they instantly make her question her beliefs.  Maybe being claimed wouldn’t be such a bad thing…   Her Pack is a steamy, reverse harem standalone.",
