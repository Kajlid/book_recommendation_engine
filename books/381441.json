  "description": "Hidden deep within the darkest recesses of your mind lie dormant seeds - beliefs - that spring to life when you set a goal, make a wish or aspire to something greater. Alive, they become barrier energy that sabotage, literally repel, your hopes and dreams. Good news is that they serve a purpose – your soul’s greater good. Better news, now in 10 simple Steps contained in this book, The Belief Change Exercise (BCE) surfaces those beliefs that limit or hold you back in some negative way and enables you to reconcile and align them with your wants and needs.",
