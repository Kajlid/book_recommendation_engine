  "description": "Annika:She canceled her wedding, longing to explore the wide open West. But nothing could prepare her Bostonian gentility for an adventure that thrust her into the arms of a wild mountain man...Buck:Hardened by heartache, he sent for a bride by mail—and mistakenly claimed Annika from the Cheyenne-bound train. Knowing he was wrong didn't change his hungry heart—which told him this was the woman he'd waited for...Snowbound in Buck's cabin, Annika vowed to keep her heart as cold as the winter nights that engulfed them. But slowly, the fires of passion warmed her soul as she discovered the beauty of true love—of a love that grows as sure as the seasons change.",
