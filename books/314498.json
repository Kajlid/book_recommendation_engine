  "description": "If you have or teach a child that seems overly anxious or overwhelmed when it comes to sensory inputs (like sounds, visual stimuli, textures or physical touch, etc.)... there's a pretty good chance they have Sensory Processing Disorder. I wrote Alexander the Avoider to explain SPD from a child's perspective... to validate and empower them... to give them words to explain their needs... and to help adults better understand and support the children in their lives who struggle because of their SPD.",
