  "description": "Little hope is left for Alderek, a planet endangered. Cruel King Haggin's henchmen are given orders to destroy villages at a rapid rate. Citizens are captured and placed into work camps, knowing there is no other choice if they wish to survive. Only the Dragon Watchers can put an end to Haggin's rule, free the people, and save the planet, but they have all been imprisoned. All but one...Sixteen year old Astrid Noble is more than your average teenage orphan. She is the unofficial protector of the other much younger orphans living in the abandoned factory in London. Unbeknownst to her, she is grooming herself for a much larger task, a duty she was born into that will change her life forever. The prophecy surrounding Astrid's destiny unfolds as she is unwittingly transported to Alderek by those seeking her help. She is the last Dragon Watcher, the girl believed to have the gift of communicating with dragons. With the help of the dragons, she may be the only hope to free Alderek from ultimate destruction. Astrid is strong willed, but is she ready to take on the task, especially if it means risking her life for a strange, new world? Along the way, secrets and lies are revealed, friends and enemies are made, and her life as she knows it will never be the same.",
