Never mind that bulldozer stands outside, ready to move in and level the place for a modern hotel. Never mind that summer's over and Owen's family is hurrying to catch the last ferry -- or that school is starting -- or that \"nobody\" sees it his way. Alone, fourteen-year-old Owen is going to stay and save the beautiful place others call ugly.",
