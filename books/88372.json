It looks like the victim of a zombie apocalypse, the \"camp director\" is a psycho drill sergeant, and Henry's sure he saw a sign written in blood...Wilderness Survival Tip #2 In case of an avalanche, don't despair. You're doomed, but that's a wicked cool death.Wilderness Survival Tip #3 If you're relying on this book for actual survival tips, you're dead already.Praise for Jeff Strand's A Bad Day For Voodoo: \"A delightfully ludicrous read.\"--School Library Journal\"Just the thing for teen wiseacres.\"--Booklist\"[A] free-wheeling dark comedy that starts off running and doesn't stop until all plausibility is exhausted.
