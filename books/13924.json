  "title": "The Story of Beowulf",
  "description": "If you ever just wanted to know the story of Beowulf without having to plough through the 3182 lines of the epic poem, then this book is for you. This is the story of Beowulf as retold by Strafford Riggs. Beowulf was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia. It has variously been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries. It is an epic poem told in historical perspective; a story of epic events and of great people of a heroic past. This was the time when men were knighted for achieving great feats, and great the feats of Beowulf were. Dismissed by the King's Earls as clumsy, lazy and a sluggard, he was also shunned by his peers for his strength and prowess with the sword and spear. On hearing of the monster, Grendell, he announced his intention to sail for the Daneland to prove his worth and prove his accusers wrong. And this he did, killing not only the monster Grendell but also it's evil moster-mother. On his return home he was proclaimed the greatest hero of the North by the very same who condemned him (sic). In time he becomes king of Geatsland and an extended period of prosperity follows, ended only by a flame-breathing, steam belching dragon. Once again our hero sallies forth. The dragon is defeated but this time so is our hero. In a time when the young servicemen of the western nations are heroically laying down their lives in the seemingly endless battle against terror in order that we may live safely in our homes, Â£1.30 from the sale of this book will be donated to Help for Heroes a UK charity providing practical and direct support for the UK's wounded servicemen.",
