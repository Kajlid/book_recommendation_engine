  "title": "Swish: My Quest to Become the Gayest Person Ever and What Ended Up Happening Instead",
  "description": "A hilarious and deeply moving account of one man€™s journey from stereotype to truth.Joel Derfner is a knitter, an aerobics instructor, a cheerleader, a go-go dancer, and a musical theater composer, but when he realizes one day that he€™s a walking gay cliché he embarks on a quest for deeper meaning. A very, very funny quest for deeper meaning. And whether he€™s confronting the demons of his past at a GLBT summer camp, using the Internet to €œmeet€ men€“many, many men€“or going undercover to a conference of ex-gays, he discovers that what he€™s looking for€“and sometimes even finds, hidden underneath the surface of everyday life€“is his own identity. In the tradition of David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs, yet with its own particular flair, Swish is a story told with not just wit but humor; not just candor but honesty; and not just compassion but humanity.",
