If Riley can't rescue Clay before he breaks, the result will be a disaster of epic proportions.With time running out, Riley and her family must rely on two people more likely to stab them in the back than actually help. And, even if Riley manages the rescue, she's still got to deal with two kidnappings and the return of her dad from the dead--the same dad who'd been willing to see her dead to protect his secrets.What's a girl to do? Kick ass, take names, and protect those she cares about at all costs.",
