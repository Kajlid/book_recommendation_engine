  "title": "Warriors: British Fighting Heroes",
  "description": "Ross Kemp has encountered conflict and warfare all over the world, broadcasting from some of the most volatile military hot–zones. From meeting the world's deadliest gangsters, to perhaps his hardest assignment of all embedded with the British Army in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, where he witnessed some of the fiercest fighting and was trained in the tactics they use to stay alive. Stationed with British forces for his award–winning television documentaries, Ross Kemp has not only experienced the terror and exhilaration of life on the frontline, but also the courage and leadership of today’s servicemen and women. The plight of armed forces is one especially close to his heart, and here for the first time Kemp tells the breathtaking stories of commandos, medics, submariners, fighter pilots, infantrymen, sailors, and engineers in daring raids, stirring last stands, and acts of extreme valor. Warriors is Ross Kemp’s personal tribute to some of the most remarkable men and women to have served in the British Armed Forces during the two World Wars, many of them unsung or forgotten. Each account is an extraordinary tale of courage, adventure, and patriotic sacrifice.",
