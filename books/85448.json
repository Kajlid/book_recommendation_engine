  "description": "Jane Carter's life has never been easy. Leaving her parents behind only to be abandoned pregnant by the one man she thought she could depend on, she had a sense that things just weren't going to be easy for her or her precious daughter Jolene. She's so skeptical about life that she thinks she's dreaming when she catches the eye of handsome, successful architect, Jay Anderson. Will Jay be willing to accept her and her child or will she be forced to return to a past that just won't go away. Falling in love is easy. Life is hard. Has life finally designed the happy ending she's always dreamed of?",
