  "description": "He’s her weapon of choicePsychologist Mia Richards wants revenge. Her new client, tattooed Cole “Shank” Shepherd, provides the perfect means. She just has to manipulate the felon-turned-informant into eliminating her husband’s killers—members of Cole’s rival motorcycle club. The first step, seducing Cole, is simple. As for walking away before she falls hard—it’s already too late...Dirty Eleven practically raised Cole, and he plans to double-cross the cops rather than sell the club out. But smart, sexy Mia is an irresistible distraction. While she’s evaluating his mind, all he can think about is her body...until he discovers her true intentions. Walking a fine line between desire and betrayal, they’ll have to outrun her past, his enemies and the law for a love that’s dangerously real.Book one of the Dirty Eleven MC series79,020 words",
