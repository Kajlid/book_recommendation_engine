She wasn’t supposed to be his Fated Mate. Everyone’s twenty-first birthday is supposed to be something to remember. A milestone, a step into real adulthood. My birthday was when everything changed. That’s the day the men showed up. Everywhere I went, they watched me, creeping closer, trying to find a second when I was alone. They all wanted the same thing; to capture me and bring me back to their world. One was different. Dark, mysterious, and sexy, he stood out from the rest. He had come for my blood.  King of the Fae is the first novella in the Blood Court series, which features a paranormal romance between one human girl and one strong, protective fae king. Each book also has a full arc and then a cliffhanger ending, with each novella building on the other to complete a full series arc.",
