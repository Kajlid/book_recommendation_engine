  "description": "What if there was a pill that could suppress the libido? What if you were required to take it? What would you do?  In the near future, the world is much like today, only just a bit more bleak, a bit more oppressed and a bit more... crowded.  Izzy dreams of finishing her studies, finding a good job and having an easy, controlled life. That makes sense. Jonathan, however, keeps getting in her way. And he is quite annoying, pretentious and arrogant. He just can’t help showing up, raising questions.  She gets mad, and he gets stubborn; for this is a story about a strange love, in a world that doesn’t quite allow it. Not only that; it unleashes all its fury against love and sex. This is also a story about a pill, the Zoller Treatment, set to abolish attraction and sexuality, to declare war against libido. And this pill, well… it’s obligatory.  That last bit shouldn’t make much sense.  Also, this is a story about killer whales, nudists, asexual cats, unicorns and a bunch of other irrelevant stuff.",
