  "description": "\"What is an Indigo Child? The Indigo Child is a child who displays a new and unusual set of psychological attributes that reveal a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before. This pattern has common yet unique factors that demand that parents and teachers change their treatment and upbringing of them in order to achieve balance. To ignore these new patterns is to potentially create great frustration in the minds of these precious new lives. Can we really be seeing human evolution in the kids today? Are they smarter? Why do so many of our children today seem to be \"system busters\"? Why are they committing suicide and killing each other? Why are so many of our best children being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder( ADD)? Are all of them really ADD kids...in need of being drugged, or is there more to this story?Join international authors and lecturers Lee Carroll and Jan Tober as they bring together some very fine minds to discuss and expose this exciting premise. Many alternate methods of treating ADD are presented, and you won't believe some of the spiritual aspects of this study! These children are very different, and represent a great percentage of all the children being born today...worldwide. They come in \"knowing\" who they are, and must be recognized and celebrated with the correct guidance.This book is a must for parents!\"",
