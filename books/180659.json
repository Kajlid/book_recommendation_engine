Then everything goes to hell. Nicole thinks we're done. We are not. She's mine.  ***** Love makes the strong weak. Will loving Nicole bring Dragon to his knees? When dark secrets from the past surface, will it be the end of the Savage Brothers MC?  Author's Note: This is Book 3 of the Savage Brothers MC Series.
