  "description": "The $500 billion-a-year illegal-drug-trafficking business has a secret relationship with seemingly legitimate bankers and mainstream financial markets which is exposed by a story in the press that reverberates on front pages around the world.The question that even legitimate investigators seem not to be asking \"Where's the Money?\"Unlikely partners Jon Reynolds, PhD (computer-encryption wunderkind who has a personal, vested interest in the outcome), and Katie Ruiz, a talented investigative reporter with a checkered past, devise a dangerous and clandestine plan to expose the business and the players in it — as well as to reveal to the general public the staggering proportions of the scheme. Implementing it means Jon and Katie will face cartels, violence, corruption, and an inept DEA — in addition to their own fears and demons.This is a story grounded in real facts that exist in the real world — our world. It is also a telling statement about the impact that ordinary citizens can have on world events — an unlikely \"Power of One\" tale.",
