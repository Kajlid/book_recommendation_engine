  "description": "\"All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.\"\nA Dream Within a Dream is a poem written by Edgar Allan Poe, and a fine example of his contribution to Dark Romanticism. It was first published in the March 31, 1849, edition of the Boston-based story paper The Flag of Our Union.The poem questions the way one can distinguish between reality and fantasy, asking, \"Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?\"\nEdgar Allan Poe\n (1809â€“1849) was a master of tales of the mysterious and macabre. From the eerie incantations found in \n'The Raven' (1845)\n to the persistent fright of 'The Tell-Tale Heart' (1843), his stories and poems are unforgettable explorations of the darker side of life that still offer lessons and insight into human behavior today, making them an integral component of any modern reader's repertoire.",
