  "description": "I was born Lady Glynis Wright, the daughter of English aristocrats. When traveling in the Carpathian Mountains, my family met a tragic end. I was transformed into a creature of the night, and I suffered great horrors at the hands of my evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula. I vowed to one day escape him, and live a life free of his brutality. Since those early days of my captivity in the castle, I have learned to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as I set into motion plans to seek revenge against those who betrayed my family to Dracula and to reunite with the man I love. Despite my ambitions, itâ€™s increasingly apparent that my life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula.",
