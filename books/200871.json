  "description": "Kate Elliott isn't going to take falling in love lying down.   Kate's life is good by any measure. At 28, she has an incredibly successful company that affords her the couture lifestyle any Manhattan power player would expect. Being surrounded by luxury is almost enough to make the lack of romance in her life bearable. Almost.   When she meets Nicholas Bryant, she’s consumed by desire despite discovering he's her new, savvy, and therefore dangerous, competitor. After a series of hot and cold meetings—where the two compete over who is more hotheaded rather than market share—they succumb to passion in one perfect, electric weekend. But as soon as they resurface, trouble begins brewing that may cost Kate her empire, or worse, her long walled off heart.  Strictly Business is a steamy romance with content suitable for mature audiences.",
