  "title": "Magid Fasts for Ramadan",
  "description": "It is the first day of Ramadan, the month when good Muslims eat nothing and drink nothing all day, every day, from sunrise to sunset. Mama and Baba have told Magid he isn't old enough to fast, but even Magid's sister, Aisha, is fasting, and Magid doesn't want to wait. Set in present-day Egypt, Magid Fasts for Ramadan satisfyingly recounts Magid's struggle and its surprising and happy resolution, and offers an illuminating introduction to the beliefs and practices of Islam.",
