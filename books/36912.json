  "description": "In Two Legged, one gets a glimpse at the world as is imagined, as if it is through the eyes of a partiallydomesticated, wild deer, or the four legged, who dares approach a human being, or two legged, after apublic gathering of two legged which has mostly dispersed. The doe decides to simply walk up to atwo legged, who is sucking on one of those fire sticks, the way two legged do, and stand there with himtalking to her. The four legged allows the two legged to pet her, and when more of them come outside,from inside one of their strange boxes they come and go from, she trusts them all to be gentle and kind,in contrast to the four legged's untamed nature. Will the four legged be safe in the company of the twolegged she chooses for herself, or are all the two legged too dangerous to be trusted?",
