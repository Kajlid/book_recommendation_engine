  "description": "I’m the Seattle Sharks’ power forward. The rising star. The sniper. The skater. On the ice, I’m invincible. Off the ice, there’s room in my heart for only one girl: my five-year-old niece.  When my addict sister leaves Hannah on my doorstep with nothing but a backpack and a note full of excuses, my entire life shifts. Playoffs or not, keeping my niece out of foster care is my first priority.  I need help...from anyone but her.  Ivy Harris. Coach’s other daughter. Gorgeous, smart-mouthed, reckless. Hannah’s new BFF and favorite babysitter. Ivy’s been under my skin since she clicked into my life on four-inch heels. The same heels I just caught Hannah playing dress-up in.  But Ivy’s never been able to color inside the lines, and with Hannah’s future hanging in the balance, I can’t chance stepping outside them—no matter how badly I want to. Ivy and I fight like pros until our mouths are too busy kissing.  The line between enemy and lover is blurry, and if we can’t figure out what we mean to each other, it will cost us everything in the end...including Hannah.",
