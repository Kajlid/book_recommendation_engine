  "description": "Four friends. Four college grads. Four people figuring out that life doesn’t always turn out the way you expected.Gavin McCall is used to being the emotional support his best friends so frequently need, but after graduation, he has a game plan that’ll help him start to focus more on his own life: intern at the hottest new marketing firm in Chicago over the summer and walk away with a paying job before the leaves turn orange, even if it means crashing on his friends’ couch and watching his bank account dwindle from zilch to negative nothing while he works his way up. Dating? Who has time for it? Between his best friends’ crises, a lack of support from home, and an unyielding, cantankerous boss, even Gavin’s career plans may go to waste.One of the most up-and-coming CEOs under thirty, a marketing genius who seems to do no wrong, Gabriel Grant is laser-focused on the success of his business. Men and women fall by the wayside in the path of never-goes-on-a-second-date Mr. Grant. With the arrival of the overly enthusiastic new intern at his firm, Gabriel is both irritated by the man’s unfounded optimism and infuriatingly attracted to the hottest guy he’s ever met. If he’s going to make sure his business remains a success, he’s going to have to push aside the distraction—but his insatiable desire is going to be hard to disregard.Gavin needs a place to belong, someone to provide the comfort he so readily offers others himself—and Gabriel doesn’t have time for emotional connections. But the heart wants what the heart wants and it won’t be ignored.",
