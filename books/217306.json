He’s served his country in the Marines in Afghanistan and now it’s his time to have fun and enjoy life, unencumbered. He finally has the chance to show his dad that he can design award-winning bikes, and he’s determined to win the big showdown in Sturgis.  Kayden Leathers is a tough little gal with an entrepreneurial spirit and a zest for life, even though life hasn’t always been her friend. Raising her little girl on her own and keeping her dad’s bar running has become daily routine. Deciding to take her life in a different direction, she began developing her dream business; now all she needed was a little luck and a lot of help.

JT wants to help Kayden, but in doing so finds out things aren’t always what they seem. As JT and Kayden get to know each other, they realize they have more in common than either dreamed. But trouble lurks around every corner. Can love conquer all?",
