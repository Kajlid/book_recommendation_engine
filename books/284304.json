  "description": "Few children's book series can match the runaway success of the American Girls Short Stories. In one year we've sold nearly 2 million copies of these perfectly pocket-sized (4 1/2\" x 6\") hardcover books featuring the adventures of the American Girls. Full-color illustrations, a historical picture essay, and directions for a craft project in every book make these an incredible value at just $3.95 each.Molly's class chooses her to give their War Bond money to a famous movie star. But her big idea for presenting it is almost a disaster.",
