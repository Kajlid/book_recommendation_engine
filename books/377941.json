The house is fairy-tale quaint, and the key is hidden right where her dad said it would be, so she’s shocked to fi nd someone already living there -- Jay, a young musician, who is equally startled to meet Mimi and immediately accuses her of leaving strange and threatening tokens a dead bird, a snakeskin, a cricket sound track embedded in his latest composition.
