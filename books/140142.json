  "description": "Hope Richards has always kept to herself, and as a teenager suffered from an eating disorder. She no longer starves herself, but she still struggles with self-image issues. Now in her twenties, she's ready to start her life. But during her first night in Steel Corner, violence erupts all around her, and one very intense bear-shifting MC member protects her. Dallas lost his son and ex-wife in a car accident months ago. He allows his anger to build inside of him until it consumes every inch of his soul. But then Hope comes into his life and she is the first real thing he has wanted in a long time. She eases him and his bear, but they canâ€™t move forward until their pasts are put behind them, and sometimes that is easier said than done.",
