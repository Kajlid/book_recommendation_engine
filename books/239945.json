  "description": "“I want to be upfront with you. No surprises, no secrets. I want you, Eva. And I think you might be it for me.”\n  Eva is a hot mess running from her past and doesn’t mind telling a fib or two to protect her secrets. It’s too bad that she moved to the nosiest small town in the world with Sheriff Sexy—the tall, built human lie detector. He’s suddenly showing interest and treating every conversation like it’s an interrogation.  Donovan loves his nice, quiet hippie town, and he’s got some pretty strong feelings when it comes to a certain klutzy redhead, too. But she’s hiding something. Just when he starts to peel back those layers to get to the naked truth, the entire town loses its collective mind—and inhibitions—in what town elders identify as an astrological apocalypse.  Can he save the girl from her past and the town from itself?",
