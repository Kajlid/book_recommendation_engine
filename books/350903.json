  "description": "Meet the water bears that can live in suspension for hundreds of years, the parasite carried by your cat that makes men grumpy and women promiscuous, and the woodlouse that drinks through its bottom. Marvel at elephants that walk on tiptoe, the pigs that shine in the dark, and the woodpeckers that have ears on the end of their tongues. From the team that brought ignorance to millions, a Christmas bestseller - full of illuminating illustrations, maps and diagrams - shrunk down to a pocket-friendly, easily-searchable, portability-considerate size.",
