  "description": "There is no such thing as coincidence - at least, not according to Skye. It wasn't a coincidence that her father died seven hours after she broke a mirror, and it isn't a coincidence that her imaginary friend is reappearing now that she meets Drew - the mysterious boy with a dark past, one that is somehow connected to her.Then there's Pool - Drew's estranged ex-roommate from Hopewood Sanatorium. Blinded by the Steppenwolf theory, Pool sees only Them and Us, Man and Beast. And he will stop at nothing to make sure no one takes the Wolf out of Drew, least of all Skye. Haunted by suppressed memories and scarred by disturbing pasts, Drew and Skye each have to battle their old demons, or risk losing their precarious future with each other.",
