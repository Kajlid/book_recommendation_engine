  "description": "THE CONTENTED EXPAT is Alan Laycock’s long-awaited follow-up to The Reluctant Expat. Although essentially a sequel, a detailed recap renders it not altogether essential to have read those books in order to enjoy the tale of his action-packed sabbatical in the Asturian seaside town of Lastres. Here Alan’s wife Inma attempts to contain his insatiable curiosity and burning desire to integrate, no matter how much of a fool he makes of himself. Initially he wishes to sail off into the Bay of Biscay with the local fishermen, but as usual things don’t quite work out as he anticipated…Part Two is now also available.",
