  "title": "Owning His Bride",
  "description": "After enduring the first two years of a life sentence for a crime she didn’t commit, there is one thing Becca fears more than spending the rest of her days behind bars. When their five-year terms of service on the frozen prison planet of Kemmius are up, guards are allowed to choose a bride from among the prisoners, and the warden himself has set his sights on her. Hunter has hated the warden from the moment he met him, and he’ll be damned if he is going to let the vile man have a sweet, beautiful girl like Becca. Not when his own term as a guard is almost up and he’ll have the chance to claim her first and make her his own. Following a thorough, humiliating medical exam—standard procedure to ensure a potential bride’s suitability as a mate—Becca finds herself bound to Hunter forever as both his wife and his property. While her new husband quickly proves to be nothing like the cruel warden, he is still a man who expects to be obeyed, and she soon learns that defiance will be dealt with firmly. Though she is left blushing each time Hunter bares her bottom for a sound spanking—and sometimes for other, more intimate punishments—what truly shames Becca is the way her body responds to his dominance. But even as her feelings for Hunter grow stronger and her future seems brighter than it has in many years, Becca cannot help wondering if she will ever truly be free of the chains of the past. Publisher’s Owning His Bride includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.",
