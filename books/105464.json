  "description": "The work that started it all. Three years at the top of Literotica's Mind Control category, the tongue-in-cheek trilogy of Jake and Robbi has been rebooted for e-book publication.Jake McBride is your typical Cal Berkeley student in many ways: he's brilliant, burns the candle at both ends in order to maintain grades, and as poor as a church mouse. But he does have one thing that sets him apart from his fellow students - a fembot! Roberta 'Robbi' Stark is beautiful, built, and programmed for love, the unexpected result of an ESP experiment gone awry. Completely unaware of her newly-gained robotic nature, she believes the changes taking place in her body and mind are natural, and that her feelings for Jake are genuine. Little does she know that her love for her creator, her martial arts prowess, and her skill and enthusiasm between the sheets are nothing more than a few lines of code.But as Jake explores the wonders of his fembotic girlfriend, he realizes too late that there's more to Robbi than on-demand lap dances. She's also a killer app!A NOTE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS:This ebook has been tested on the Kindle Fire, and on Amazon's emulation software for the Touch, the Kindle, the DX, and the iPad. They all look fine, though the Touch looks a touch weird; maybe it always looks like that.",
