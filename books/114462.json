  "description": "Rilex, orphaned as a child in the horrific incident that left him cursed by a dragon, has been growing up with his battle instructor, Mortis, training to be a dragon slayer. His village was small, and his life was simple, but he was happy.Everything came crashing down around him when Mortis was tragically murdered by a dragon. Overwhelmed with rage, he blacked out, waking up to find himself cared for by a strange girl, Darkain, with only the foggy memory of the dragon’s severed head lying on the field in front of him and the state of his own limbs to fill in the blanks. With nothing left to go back to, he sets out with Darkain and the other friends he meets along the way to find the truth about what’s happening to him.",
