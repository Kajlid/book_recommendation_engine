He’s the one thing standing in the way of my dream: to own the talent agency I’ve devoted my career to. Because he just bought it.I don’t care how hot he looks in a suit. Or how many times he wants to remind me about that stupid kiss when we were teenagers.(So what if I kissed him back? He started it!)He’s the bosshole from hell, and now I’m stuck with him—unless he decides to fire me.I loathe that he has the power here, and he knows it.Well, I am not going down without a fight.But instead of firing me from the job I love, he does something even more evil: he asks me to help him—to save his reputation and his fortune.I might be willing to make a deal with the devil—if it means I get my agency.I might even be able to pretend I can stand the man who has the power to ruin me.It’s a diabolical plan. But my hatred of him will protect me.My heart isn’t part of this bargain.So why does it pick up speed every time we fight?Why is that ice-cold look in his eyes starting to thaw… and getting hotter than hell?And when I discover someone’s out to ruin him, why do I want to fight for him so bad?If I put everything on the line, including my heart, will Dane finally win this war between us?Or could the devil from my past really be my Prince Charming?",
