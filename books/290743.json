  "description": "In the Viking village of Greytree, Astrid Mace is different. She is unaware of her roots, her troubled entry into the world and the powers she possesses. Powers she will need if her village is to survive The Elder Trials. All 13 of the Neophytes (children turning 13) in the village must compete and complete in 13 trials. Can the three Lords who rule over Greytree be trusted? What are the Druid’s true motives? Will she uncover the reason behind Erik’s anger and animosity? During an annual trade with another village, Astrid uncovers some dirty dealings. Will she make the right decision? When Greytree is attacked by the Skollreaver Clan will Astrid find her powers, and will they be enough to save those she loves?",
