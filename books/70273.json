  "description": "When love takes off, there’s no use digging in your heels. You’re goin’ down.  Burned by Nikki Duncan Vic wants a ring on her perfectly manicured finger, but only if it comes from the perfect man. Except he only sees her as a friend.   Hauk is secretly relieved that his pub and daughter keep him too busy to look for love again. When a Fall Festival project throws him and Vic together, though, he must decide if he’s ready to take another chance.  Bold by Mackenzie McKade For years, Tabatha has chipped away at Reese’s cool resistance. Now that she’s been paired with him for the Fall Festival, though, she’s ready to use all the assets God gave her to crack it for good.   Reese isn’t sure crossing that boundary with Tabby is worth the price. But they find themselves inching closer to that line. And closer…  Brazen by Cathryn Fox Josie, the perpetual good girl, decides some no-strings playtime with the town bad boy will do until the real thing comes along. Their first kiss touches off an unexpected explosion of passion.   Adam thinks Josie deserves more than a man with “failed relationships” written all over him. When their bond grows, though, he dares to hope. Until a secret makes him question what’s real…and what isn’t.  Warning: No meddling grandfathers were harmed, disinherited, or run out of town during the course of some serious matchmaking they had going on. Any resulting happy-ever-afters are entirely their fault.",
