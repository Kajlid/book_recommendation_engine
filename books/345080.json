  "title": "DogTown: Tales of Rescue, Rehabilitation, and Redemption",
  "description": "Now in paperback, this companion to the hit National Geographic Channel show, DogTown, tells the moving stories of homeless dogs and their caretakers at the Best Friends Animal Society, evoking both the joy and the occasional, but inevitable, heartbreak that accompanies the important work of saving homeless dogs.Focusing both on the relationships between dogs and people and on the latest discoveries in animal health and behavior, the book features 12 of DogTown's most memorable cases. Each chapter follows one dog â often considered unadoptable by other shelters â from the first days at DogTown, through assessment and treatment, to the whether the dog finds a \"forever home\" outside the shelter. Photographs of each dog trace its entire journey and chart its progress from beginning to end. DogTown's veterinarians, trainers, and experts who are featured on the show contribute essays on their most meaningful moments in working with animals.",
