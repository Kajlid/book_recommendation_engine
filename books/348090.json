  "title": "The Adoration of Jenna Fox",
  "description": "This is a chilling, page-turning psychological thriller set in a clinical future that may be closer than we think. A seventeen-year-old girl wakes from a year-long coma and is told her name is Jenna Fox. She doesn't remember the accident; she doesn't remember her life; she doesn't remember herself. Her parents show her home movies of her past, but is she really the same girl she sees on the screen? When the memories start to come, they come with questions - questions no one wants to answer. How did the accident happen? Why does her own grandmother hate her so? And why does she feel her parents are hiding her away? Who is Jenna Fox? Feature-film rights of this title are sold to Fox 2000 and translation rights sold around the world. This is the holder of a Golden Kite Honor Award, nominated for the 2009 Nebula Andre Norton Award. 'Expert plotting and complex questions raised about ethics and the nature of the soul' - \"Publishers Weekly\", Starred Review. 'This novel is truly unlike any other I have read and is a breath of fresh air in the often predictable world of teen literature' - \"ELLEgirl\".",
