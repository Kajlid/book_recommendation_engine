  "description": "Lola Smith has had more than a little trouble growing up. At 23 she's never had a boyfriend, doesn't have a place of her own, can't find a job, and is generally unhappy with her life. When she meets Tobias White while speed dating, he promises to help with all of her problems. At least, if she agrees to his terms. Lola doesn't know what to expect, but it soon becomes clear what Tobias wants. He'll help her navigate this difficult grown up world, but in exchange he'll mold Lola into his own perfect little girl. She blushes as she's stripped naked, bathed, and dressed in little girl clothes. At first, Lola's not sure how to react to Tobias' demands. When she rebells, Lola quickly learns that a bare bottom spanking isn't the only kind of punishment she'll get for being naughty. Soon Lola and Tobias' relationship deepens, not just sexually but emotionally. Every day, Lola comes closer to being Tobias' perfect girl. But will this arrangement last? Can they form a bond that will last forever? Explicit: This age play novella is an erotic romance containing explicit scenes of spanking, sex between consenting adults, BDSM, and more. It is of adult nature and meant for readers over 18 years of age. All characters depicted are over 18 years old.",
