  "description": "College student Reese Prentice always knew she'd return to Tremont Lodge. She just didn't know how--until she saw the notice at the university center advertising jobs at the northern Michigan ski resort turned summer playland. Yet, recalling the details of her abandonment by her parents at the lodge sixteen years earlier proves harder than anticipated with work, roommates, and love interest Finn biding for her time. Then the boss's bad boy nephew Lawson makes her a deal too tempting to pass up that might get her closer to the answers hidden in her past. However, her path to discovery is cluttered when Lawson's own secrets threaten to interfere with her right to know the truth and to remain safe.",
