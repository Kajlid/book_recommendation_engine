  "description": "The Celestial War has arrived.  Captain Hughes and his team of rebels have created a shaky alliance with the same government that sought to end them, but even that might not be enough.  In order to combat the Celestial threat, Jace will need to convince the Sarkonian Emperor to not only join his cause but lend him the resources he needs to overpower the enemy.  The battle for tomorrow will take more than any single empire can manage.  Each side will have to learn to work together if they ever hope to overcome their shared enemy, but allies are not easily made from enemies, and not everyone will be as eager to stand side-by-side.  With allies like the Union and the Sarkonians, who needs enemies?  Experience the continuation of this sprawling galactic tale in the eleventh entry in the Renegade Star series.  If you’re a fan of Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, or Indiana Jones, you’ll love this space opera epic.",
