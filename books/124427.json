  "description": "I'm an omega left behind.I’m damaged, forced to hide my nature, with a scent that can turn alphas violent. I was told there would be no normal, no friends, or dream pack waiting in the distance.But I have one last chance at love.Tomorrow, at the academy ball, my scent blockers will fade. My mates—the ones I was told I would never have—will see me.But with one night to go, everything falls apart, and I find myself blackmailed by ruthless alphas. They are set on keeping my scent for themselves.Dusk, Umbra, and Ransom are the only alphas in the school more prestigious than my mates. Arrogant, beautiful, and deadly, they’re an enigma, shunning all omega attention.Until now.Too late, I learn that their pack lead, Dusk Varis, is as obsessed as he is unhinged. He doesn't care about my dreams or scent-matched mates. He claims what he wants without asking.And what he wants is me.This book has dark themes between love interests unlike other PoisonVerse books. This is part one of what has now become a trilogy that exists in the larger PoisonVerse Universe!",
