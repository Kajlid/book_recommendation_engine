  "description": "Princess Emilia Vertius has spent most of her life in a secluded cottage hidden deep in the Kingswood. Despite a curse looming over her, she spends her days exploring the forest and painting everything nature has to offer. When Mia finds herself hopelessly trapped in a poacher’s snare during a rainstorm, a handsome stranger stumbles upon her in her predicament. After cutting her free, he insists on helping her home, and in doing so, threatens all the secrets she’s spent her life trying to keep. Left with debts after his mother’s death, Luc Stone works hard as a huntsman for the palace, counting down the days until he can afford to buy land of his own. After he rescues a mysterious young woman in the forest, she offers to teach him how to read, changing his life forever. Everything about her is perplexing, from her beautiful pet owl to her contempt of wearing shoes. The more time he spends with her, the more Luc realizes that his plans for the future are missing one crucial element—someone to share it with. As the spring and summer pass, a friendship blossoms. Mia soon discovers that while she is teaching Luc to read, he is teaching her just as much about life and the outside world. As her feelings for him grow, Mia worries that the longer she keeps her true identity from him, the harder it will be to tell him who she really is. When the king shows up at the cottage and insists she marry a foreign prince, Mia must challenge her father, court tradition, and the curse if she wants to be with the man she has come to love.Author’s note: This book contains descriptive adult scenes. This is a standalone story with no cliffhangers and a happily ever after.",
