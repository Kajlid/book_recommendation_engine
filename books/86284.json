Unable to let go of the guilt that she is harboring from her past, she punishes herself by running from all potential relationships.Her patience is put to the test when Dailan O’Maley the obnoxious but very sexy uncle of one of her students enters her life. She slowly cracks away at Dailan’s crude, crass exterior when they are forced to work together for the sake of his nephew. The two of them learn a lesson in love that neither had planned as they discover that the guilt they are hiding deep inside isn’t the only thing they have in common. Unbeknownst to her, he holds more than just the key to her heart.*Sequel ~ \"An Unplanned Life\" ~ coming Late 2013/early 2014http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18...",
