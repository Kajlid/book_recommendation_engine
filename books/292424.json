Stackhouse comes a new Contemporary Why Choose Mafia Suspense Romance Series that is sure to leave you questioning everything…  You either hide from the Monsters or you become Them.  Once upon a time, there lived a pure girl, who abided behind her safe sheltered walls. But catastrophe descends on those unaware.  Once upon a time, there lived a girl who fled, fled from her school, fled from her home, fled from the only life she had ever known.  But for while this broken Little Bird was left all alone, she stumbled upon a pack of sick vicious wolves, who played with Death and had destruction in their gaze.  But Instead of devouring her whole the second she fell the wolves decided rather to corrupt the last remaining sheds of her stained and tattered soul.  But why did this girl try to run from her scars? Now isn’t that the question we all want to find.  See the problem with running, is, that the only way to find freedom is to take on the Darkness, and Win.",
