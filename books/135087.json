But for Jack, it was a kiss unlike any other.Years later, hiding incognito far from London --- as a teacher at Miss Emery's Establishment for the Education of Genteel Young Ladies --- Miranda has made a respectable life for herself, away from the ton and the dangerous men who inhabit it. When a penniless, much humbled, though still damnably attractive Jack arrives at the school to escort a rebellious young niece home, Miranda does her best to avoid the rogue, only to end up tumbling into his arms --- and reawakening a desire that is anything but proper.She might want to deny her heart, but Miranda's resolve is no challenge for three schoolgirl matchmakers who know true passion when they spy it. Now they won't rest until their all-too-proper teacher and the reprobate lord discover the love that is their destiny.",
