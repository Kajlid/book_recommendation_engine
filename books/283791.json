Babysitting my Grandma's apartment means Sabrina's here to stay. But we'd agreed my room was off limits.It’s bad enough my nightmares are getting worse, but having her around makes holding it together a little easier. Her smell, smart mouth and sexy a--anyway. I can’t let her get under my skin although it might be too late. In her sloppy bun and pajamas curled up on the couch, she’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. But a relationship isn’t what I need right now.It’s hard to remember that when she’s glowering at me when I’m being an ass. We’re forced to live together for only a few more months, I can hold out until I can’t.She’s in my bathtub and she’s not telling me to leave. So I ask the question, “do you want me to go?”And I’m shocked as hell when her answer isn’t ‘yes’.",
