  "description": "Imagine a wardrobe malfunction at the gym. In front of the most handsome man ever.Dumped by his longtime boyfriend because of his weight, Ulric O'Neil moves to the quiet town of Meadowfall, hoping to start afresh. He's tired of being chubby, and he's tired of being lonely. He's tired of being attracted to the wrong sort of person, too. Which alpha only likes other alphas?The bigger question: Which man would fall for a chubby, nerdy guy who loves his sweet snacks more than he loves to exercise?Definitely not Gage Frost, a personal trainer at Ulric's gymâ€”he's got the most beautiful face and a stomach-dropping smile, and Ulric knows he'll fall for Gage sooner rather than later. Especially when Gage hugs him and kisses him and tells Ulric they can be best friends. But that's where the line is.Ulric promises Gage that he won't fall in love. Thing is, with how often Gage tells him he's cute, he isn't so sure he can keep his word.Weight of Everything is a 74,000-word standalone non-shifter MPreg romance with an eventual double-alpha-preg, lots of hurt/comfort, as well as the sweetest alpha who convinces his not-boyfriend that your looks aren't the only thing that matters.",
