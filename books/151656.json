  "description": "One hundred years. Two love triangles. A timeless passion. Maddox McLeod has always enjoyed the ladies. But a long history of casual lovers masks a cutting betrayal which still wounds him. When Maddox is called back to his hometown of Contention City to tend to his dying father, he must briefly leave his true brothers, the Defiant MC, and confront the agonies of the past. Maddox has spent a decade trying to forget that once there was a girl who held his heart in her hand. And once he had a brother who committed the ultimate treachery. Contention City itself endures among the ghosts and ruins of the old west. In 1888, young schoolteacher Annika Larson traveled to the Arizona Territory and found herself caught between the passions of two fiery brothers. One a gunslinger, the other a lawman, their differences were irreconcilable. The scars of the shattering chain of events which followed reverberate into the present as Maddox finds himself faced with impossible choices, and a timeless loveâ€¦ Part contemporary romance, part historical western, this intertwined tale of love and redemption is a stand alone novel with no cliffhanger. Newly edited! Contains explicit language and sexual situations not recommended for readers under the age of 18.",
