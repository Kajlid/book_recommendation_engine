  "description": "In the near future, the United Nations have become the enforcement arm of the New World Order. What was once the United States of America has been absorbed into the North American Superstate that includes Canada and Central America. Against unspeakable odds, freedom loving people have gathered and built up Zion Cities. Dozens of Zion Cities located strategically throughout the Western Hemisphere have taken decades to erect. Most are still under construction, facing continual opposition from external forces. Small, self governing bands of Christians have migrated, mostly on foot, seeking refuge in these cities. Young wife, Gracie yearns for renewed innocence. Abiathar wants to secure it for her. Their trek has been anything but blissful. Stomach their journey, and let your faith be strengthened through their experience. Glimpse tribulations and miracles future pioneers may expect as you live vicariously through this young family.",
