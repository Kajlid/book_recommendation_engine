  "description": "Big trouble can come in little packages.  Former FBI agent Garrison Kopp suspected his teenage son was in trouble, but a midnight summons to the ER after an overdose reveals the problem is more serious than he thought. Desperate to get his son away from negative influences, he asks a friend who owns rental properties for a place to stay. This isn’t how he’d planned to reconnect with the beautiful woman he’d met a few months ago, yet spending time with Samantha makes a hard time more bearable.  Vacation homeowner Samantha Messenger is happy to provide Garrison and his son a lake cabin where they can regroup. She tells herself Garrison’s call had nothing to do with the chemistry they shared and everything to do with the fact that the other rentals were booked. She helps him search for a good rehab facility and tries not to hope for more than friendship. After what she’s been through, more isn’t an option, no matter what her heart wants.  Sparks fly between them as Sam and Garrison work together to help the resistant teen. But that becomes the least of their problems when a package planted in Garrison’s car lures enemies to the idyllic cabin on the lake. With their lives—and love—on the line, can they protect all they hold dear?",
