  "title": "The Turning",
  "description": "The author of Dirt Music and The Riders captures the urgency of memory and the way an entire life can be shaped by one event from the past in this capsule of connected stories set on the coast of Western Australia.Tim Winton's stunning collection of connected stories is about turnings of all kindsâ€”changes of heart, slow awakenings, nasty surprises and accidents, sudden detours, resolves made or broken.  Brothers cease speaking to each other, husbands abandon wives and children, grown men are haunted by childhood fears. People struggle against the weight of their own history and try to reconcile themselves to their place in the world. With extraordinary insight and tenderness, Winton explores the demons and frailties of ordinary people whose lives are not what they had hoped.",
