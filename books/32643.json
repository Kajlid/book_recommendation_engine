  "description": "Jason England never knew that his parents weren't his biological parents. Or that he wasn't even from Earth. Or that the magical tales of the Keash caves he and his best friend Kristine played in as children were actually true. All he knew was that one day, as they were playing, she disappeared and only he seemed to care or even remember her.When Jason learns the truth about his parents, he embarks on a journey to find Kristine. Starting in the cave where she disappeared, he discovers a tunnel that leads deeper underground than any other. Through a set of sudden and confusing circumstances, he finds himself chained in a cage in a completely unfamiliar world, and only an arm's length away from his long-lost friend.",
