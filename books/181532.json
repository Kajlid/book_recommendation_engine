Years have gone by, and she has now taken her temporary profession of vows out of necessity – a roof over her head – and she continues to struggle with her unrelenting libido between the smothering walls of the priory, as she finds herself face to face with both men and women of the holy cloth.Sister Maria is summoned by Reverend Mother Genevieve Martin, and is pushed to consider the acceptance of her solemn vows, to which she reluctantly accepts. The very thought of submitting her life to Christ forever triggers a deep, carnal stirring within her, and she finds herself spiraling into an unstoppable sexual frenzy with the most divine of her holy, God-fearing companions...For adults readers only! 18+",
