  "description": "Major League Baseball is slowly dying. With the Steroids Era still fresh on the minds of the fans, records set today are no longer celebrated—they’re questioned. Now more than ever, baseball needs to be rescued. It needs a hero. It needs the unexpected.Career minor league baseball player Josh Spencer once had unlimited potential until a tragic incident on the field, as well as injuries, impeded his path to stardom. Now healthy for the first time in his professional career, the forgotten savior has returned to the same Major League team that had drafted him twelve years ago. Josh knows this will be his last shot at achieving the expectations that have eluded him—but not even in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine an improbable run that would threaten one of the greatest sports records of all time: Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak. Josh’s sudden rush toward baseball immortality isn’t all majestic. As his hitting streak reaches sacred levels, he is confronted with hardships he would have never anticipated—declining health, internal conflict on his team, and a sudden lack of anything resembling privacy...or safety. His new celebrity status can’t even shield him from the terrifying reality that there are people who will do anything to make sure he never overtakes one of the last true legends the game has ever seen. DiMaggio's streak has a protector.",
