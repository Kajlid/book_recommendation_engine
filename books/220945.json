With The Story Cure, bibliotherapists Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin have put together the perfect manual for grown-ups who want to initiate young readers into one of life's greatest pleasures.There's a remedy for every hiccup and heartache, whether it's between the covers of a picture book, a pop-up book, or a YA novel.
