  "description": "Sloane Watson is an undercover cop who is more than capable of standing on her own two feet. So when notorious bad boy Tyler Sharp becomes the focus of her investigation, she’s determined to learn everything she can. Which is why she’s willing to pose as an exotic dancer at Destiny, the club Tyler co-owns with partners Cole August and Evan Black.But going head-to-head with Tyler proves to be more distracting than Sloane could have imagined, and as much as she tries to resist him, he has a knack for crashing through her defenses and taking her, both physically and emotionally, to places she’s never been.She’s playing a dangerous game in which there’s more than her duty to her profession on the line, but her heart.",
