To complicate his fears, his quiet life changes when a troubled colleague comes to the reservation to investigate the life of the perplexing, difficult, possibly false saint Sister Leopolda.

Or should he manufacture a protective history though he believes Leopolda's wonder-working is motivated by evil?",
