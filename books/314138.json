  "description": "A secret crush leads to not-so-secret romance in this delightful romantic comedy from Kris Ripper There are three things you need to know about Preston “PK” Kingsley:1) He’s a writer, toiling in obscurity as an editorial assistant at a New York City publishing house. 2) He is not a cliché. No, really. 3) He’s been secretly in love with his best friend, Art, since they once drunkenly kissed in college. When Art moves in with PK following a bad breakup, PK hopes this will be the moment when Art finally sees him as more than a friend. But Art seems to laugh off the very idea of them in a relationship, so PK returns to his writing roots—in fiction, he can say all the things he can’t say out loud. In his book, PK can be the perfect boyfriend. Before long, it seems like the whole world has a crush on the fictionalized version of him, including Art, who has no idea that the hot new book everyone's talking about is PK’s story. But when his brilliant plan to win Art over backfires, PK might lose not just his fantasy book boyfriend, but his best friend.",
