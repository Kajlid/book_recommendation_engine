  "description": "It's not easy being Nikki.Â  Ever since former tomboy Emerson Watts' accident at the SoHo Stark Megastore--and subsequent brain transplant into the body of teen supermodel Nikki Howard--her life has changed dramatically. Em's trying to handle the demands of school, modeling, fending off Nikki's creepy ex-boyfriends, and living with celebutante Lulu Collins.  Will this former tomboy be able to make it in the world of high fashion? What will happen if she can't?  How can Em balance all her new, crazy life demands of her with school, runway shows, and weekend jaunts to St. Johns--especially when she's got ex-boyfriends crawling out of the woodwork who want more than just a photo op; a sister who is headed to the high school cheerleading championships; a company she represents that seems to be turning to the dark side. . .  Not to mention trying to convince the love of her life that models aren't really airheads after all. . .especially one model in particular.  But then, nobody said it was going to be easy being Nikki.",
