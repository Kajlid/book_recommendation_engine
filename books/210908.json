  "title": "Not Equal: Civil Rights Gone Wrong",
  "description": "\"NOT EQUAL: Civil Rights Gone Wrong\" is Ryan Bomberger's first book and powerfully details how the civil rights movement has been hijacked. Over the years, Ryan's articles have been shared hundreds of thousands of times. This book is a journey through some of his most powerful published articles and creative graphic memes about the fundamental Right to Life, adoption, fatherlessness, #BlackLivesMatter, free speech, marriage, religious liberty, and the ludicrous war on gender identity. It's educational, revelational, and his hope is that it is transformational. His citizen journalism has even gotten him sued by the nation's once-great \"civil rights\" organization. Ryan and Radiance Foundation (the nonprofit organization he co-founded with his wife, Bethany), prevailed, in a stunning unanimous federal court victory. \"Not Equal\" is a tragic, yet hopeful, message that we can defeat those who have perverted justice and equality with truth and passionate persistence.",
