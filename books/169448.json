  "title": "The Country Butler",
  "description": "A proper lady, a rake in disguise - and a dangerous attraction. Rafe Atherton, the Duke of Devonshire, has managed to muck up his life, and rather grandly. A dalliance with the wrong woman has put him at the center of a scandal that could bring down the next Prime Minister of England. Desperate to remove the threat to his peer - and to himself by way of being skewered by said peer - he agrees to disappear from London life. Begrudgingly, he accepts his friend Alex's suggestion to act the part of a butler at the fellow's cousin's country estate. Lady Isabella Fitzhugh is nothing if not a practical, logical young woman. Having her lifelong butler just retire and being informed by her cousin Alex, in what she can only assume is an attempt to help, that he was providing her a butler-in-training, is beyond annoying. A small, self-contained estate needs no ripples to mar the carefully orchestrated smooth waters. But when the new butler, one Mr. Easton, arrives, her home and her emotions become one stormy mess. It soon becomes apparent Mr. Easton is not even remotely a member of the serving class, let alone an actual butler. And when the attraction between Mr. Easton and Isabella can no longer be denied, the proper mistress of her domain decides to take matters into her own hands to discover the truth of just who Mr. Easton really is. And if that means traveling to London for the first time, so be it!",
