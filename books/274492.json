  "description": "My only goal is to keep my club safe at all cost. I don’t let anyone in, and I never show weakness. All it takes is one vulnerable moment, and this world will chew you up and spit you out in bloody pieces. To survive, you need to be ruthless. Cruel. Fuelled by vengeance and hate alone. It’s the only way…it’s our way. Jade, AKA the Ice Queen, thinks she can go around and take down every MC she manages to infiltrate. But not ours. I will take her down to hell in order to protect the Devil’s Shadow, and if that means I have to burn alongside her…then so be it.",
