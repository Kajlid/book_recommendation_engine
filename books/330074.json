  "description": "BrooksOverhearing my cousin’s best friend confessing that she’s never been satisfied wasn’t my fault… but offering to help her change that definitely was. Her brother is a friend of mine, and while this has a bad idea written all over it, it doesn’t stop us from becoming friends… with benefits. Palmer is gorgeous, off-limits, and stubborn as hell. For the first time, I’m the one left wanting more. I’m tired of watching her walk away. I’m ready for her to stay. PalmerI never dreamed having my crush overhear my most embarrassing confession would land me in his bed… or that I would want to stay there. But our secret relationship has rules. No strings. No expectations. No feelings. What’s that saying about rules? Oh yeah, they’re meant to be broken. But when it comes to Brooks, I’m afraid if I’m not the one to walk away, it won’t be just the rules broken.",
