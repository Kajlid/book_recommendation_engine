  "description": "“I don’t dance.” Ailee’s sitting on the sidelines at her sister’s wedding until the best man swoops in with talk of cocktails named after sex stuff, 80s music, and dancing. Her ex was hyper-critical and Ailee’s scared she won’t be able to get his voice out of her head, but Mark seems to know exactly what she needs. It might be a cliché for the maid of honour and best man to hook up, but that doesn’t stop it from being hot! DANCE FOR ME 3 is the third in a series of romance short stories, suitable for 18+.",
