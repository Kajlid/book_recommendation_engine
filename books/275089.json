Ten years after her father left and witnessing her mom killed, it seems she is finally getting her wish.One strange day filled with dreams and visions, while trying to help someone she doesn’t even know, Hope was nearly killed. Coming to her rescue was the mysterious cafe customer, who right in front of her transformed into a being with black and white wings like that of an angel. His name? Ashbel Saunders. He says he’s an ELIOUD, a descendant of the Nephilim — meaning he’s part angel and part human. And according to him, SHE IS, TOO!In order to protect Hope, Ash keeps her in his care, until they find out who is behind the attack. But the longer she stays with him, not only does she meet more eliouds like her along the way, she also gets more entangled in the web of strange events unfolding, the more she discovers her abilities, the more dangerous things become, and the more they realize it’s not just their lives at stake but others’ as well. Will they be able to save those people while they too are on the run? Will this be her chance of becoming a superhero? Or will she be the one who needs saving this time?",
