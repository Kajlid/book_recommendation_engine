  "title": "The Silk Tether",
  "description": "Ayla is a 16-year-old girl brought up in a pre-eminent, elite family in modern-day Karachi. Through her eyes we witness the unpleasant, hidden realities of the lives of those belonging to the upper class. We see Shahaan, a boy with a certain 'Godliness' and a penchant for drugs; Ayla's friend Alia, oppressed by her wealthy but overly conservative parents; and Tanzeela,a teenager seemingly trapped in an abusive marriage.These are the stories that are swept under the flourish of silk saris at get-togethers, stories that are tucked neatly into Kenneth Cole Wallets at extravagant dinner parties. These stories are only spoken about in hushed whispers...or never at all.*****Minal Khan is currently studying pre-law at Cornell University. Written during her junior year in high school, The Silk Tether was her first foray into authordom and published by Paramount Publishing Enterprise in Karachi, Pakistan. She is also the recipient of the Presidential Award for English Literature in Pakistan in 2005 and the Presidential Award for World Achiever in English Literature in 2007.You can download the manuscript here: http://minalkhan.weebly.com/index.htmlOr purchase the physical copy here: http://www.paramountbooks.com.pk/logi...",
