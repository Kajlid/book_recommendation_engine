  "title": "Celluloid Ceiling: Women Film Directors Breaking Through",
  "description": "Highlighting rising women directors alongside ground-breaking pioneers, this is a one-stop guide to the leading women film directors in the 21st century, and those who inspired them. This collection of essays, by an impressive array of international writers, examines the progress of women film directors around the world, and arrives at some surprising conclusions.From the blockbusters of the Hollywood studios to emerging voices from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Laos, we learn of women making films in traditionally male-dominated areas such as action, fantasy and horror. With wide-ranging contributions from countries with mature and nascent film industries, Celluloid Ceiling demonstrates that economic and technological changes are creating new opportunities for women film directors everywhere.With contributions from Africa, Latin America, Europe, USA, Asia and India, chapters on new voices in Japanese and Middle Eastern cinema, the book also covers women directors working in TV, and reminds us of the first woman director, Frenchwoman, Alice Guy Blaché. Exploring the rise of the independent film sector including the horror aficionados the Soska Sisters, Celluloid Ceiling asks whether economic and technological change will work to the advantage of women in film.Celluloid Ceiling follows in the footsteps of Supernova’s Women Make Noise, which lifted the lid on the widespread and destructive misogyny that still plagues the rock music world.",
