  "description": "Yeshu: A Novel for the Open-Hearted is a lyrical, Quaker retelling of the New Testament saga known by some as “the greatest story ever told.” The book invites its readers in to join a storytelling carpenter called Yeshu, his young neighbors Daavi and Shoshana, and a band of fellow seekers on a journey brimming with lessons, laughter, and beauty, that forever alters their lives, and still impacts ours. On the way, Shoshana goes missing and Daavi searches for her, but also for his own soul. The novel explores love, community, and the powerful connection between nature and the spirit.The tale Daavi shares was written for readers of all ages and spiritual backgrounds—by Charles David Kleymeyer, an award-winning writer, culture and development sociologist, performing storyteller, and Quaker activist. For five decades he has worked and often lived with ethnic peoples of the Americas, joining their struggles to improve their lives, revitalize their cultures, and restore the earth. Most of that time, he was also imagining Yeshu.",
