  "description": "One broken heart, one drink too many, one steamy night in the sand...No one warns you about the dangers of drinking with a broken heart. At least no one warned me. I never imagined I'd fall for a musician, especially not one like Chase, but then again I never expected to have my heart broken into a million pieces by the frat guy I thought was the love of my life.Sometimes it's the rash decisions, like hooking up in the sand, that lead you to the best placesâ€”the kinds of places where it's possible to let yourself fall in love again.",
