  "description": "When Balum stumbles across a pouch containing two pounds of gold in Hell Country, he figures his worries are over. He'll head to the nearest town and live lavishly, with unlimited whisky and women. But no sooner does he arrive in town than the trouble starts. A crooked sheriff and his thieving daughter allow no chance for peace, and a trigger happy deputy has Balum on edge. They suspect Balum has possession of their stolen gold. They're determined to get that gold back, and to see him hung before his story gets out. To further complicate his situation, Balum's focus is distracted by the women of the town. The hotel proprietress, the sheriff's own daughter and more, manage to give him pleasure and grief all at once. With no opportunity to spend the gold and the pressure mounting, only one thing can save him; a trip back to Hell Country.",
