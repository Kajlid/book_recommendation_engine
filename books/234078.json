Ancient and deadly beasts straight out of the underworld are targeting Nick “Cujo” Jones and his daughter. There doesn’t seem to be a connection to Ace, until a mysterious and familiar box turns up. A box marked with the snake-headed jackal. And it’s open. This time, the gods crossed a line. Ace is done with their puppet-mastery. He’s fighting back. But as hidden secrets come to light and Ace’s friendships crumble around him, will he have the strength to fight for what’s right, or will he allow the darkness inside to consume him?
