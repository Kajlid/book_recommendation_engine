  "description": "I can’t believe the trouble I get myself into. First I am kidnapped by fae warriors and turned into a fae hybrid, now I am kidnapped by Rippers! AKA vampires. My life sucks. And if I am not careful, that will be a literal suck, with a capital S-U-C-K. The ripper master has me and wants information from me, but I can’t give him that info or my fae friends will die.  I also have a secret to keep from him, as well as my fae friends. When I was changed into a hybrid I developed more than just the standard gifts of speed, strength and stamina. I also have the ability to read minds. Now if I can only use that to get me out of the sewer the master is keeping me in.  Then there is the kiss. WOW is all I can say. When he kissed me my whole body was on fire. But I think he only did it to distract me from another guy who keeps flirting with me. Men are so confusing. Why can’t I figure them out?",
