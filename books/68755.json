But he longs to possess more than just her image…When Sherona Legion suddenly discovers that she’s being watched at her most vulnerable she’s surprised at her reaction. It’s not embarrassment or anger. It’s pure, unabashed arousal. She likes it—enough so that she’s willing to take an unprecedented risk with the sexy photographer.Thrilled at having the exhibitionist in her awakened, she agrees to Chance’s offer to pose for a series of nude photographs—stimulating tableaus of bondage. It leads Chance and Sherona to intimate and unparalleled experimentation. But how much is Sherona really ready to give to a complete stranger? And how much more can Chance take?",
