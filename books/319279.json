  "description": "Every woman in the world hates me. No seriously, it’s true. When I decided to break up with my girlfriend, she went on to write a chart-topping album about how I broke her heart. And everyone’s on her side. I get hate mail. Death threats. Now, I’m hiding out until the filming of my next SharkQuake movie is underway.I head to Alaska, to keep my head down until the buzz of Trinity’s new album dies down. No interaction except for a housekeeper, Rachel, that shows up twice a week to clean. When she shows up, I quickly learn she’s Team Trinity and probably wants me dead, too. But there’s something about her I can’t quite ignore. To top it off, she’s a major shark movie junkie-- apparently it’s a thing. Spending time with her makes me forget about the world. And for someone like me that can be a dangerous thing. This is only temporary, soon I’ll be heading back to Hollywood and leaving this holiday hideout behind.",
