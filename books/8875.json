I have had the good fortune of becoming the town’s schoolmistress. Young Janie Steele is as precious as I imagined from her letters. As for her father, Garret Steele... Oh, I feel like such a fool! I’ve run halfway around the world to escape a man I loathed, only to discover I’m losing my heart to a man still in love with the wife he buried. The mayor, kind man, has been most attentive. But I wish he were someone else. I wish he were Garret.With affection,Your friend Beth WellingtonIn the big-sky country of Montana, the past doesn’t always stay buried.
