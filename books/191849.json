  "description": "Kat and Tanka J are starting over. The New Frontier is nothing like war-stricken City Fiveâ€”no battle scars, no memories of their parents. It's a perfect society, where everyone lives in harmony. Or so they say. There's me, the ghost in the glass, and there's everyone else on the warm side of the windows. If you're really quiet, you'll hear me creeping in the shadows. Someone else is starting over, too, running on a path perilously close to Kat and Tanka. Can the two girls and their friends uncover the dark secrets of the New Frontier before the unthinkable happens? The last birthday i ever had, years ago, was the one where I got shot instead of presents. i wasn't killed before and i won't get dead now. run, run as fast as i can, can't catch me 'cause i got a Plan! Don't anyone get in my way.",
