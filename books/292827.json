  "description": "Wyatt Price is my boss.As one of the top sports agents in the industry, heâ€™s arrogant, egotistical, and stubborn.My favorite pastime is to see just how far I can push him with my quick wit and sarcastic attitude before he breaks. Don't get me wrong, I'm a damn fine employee. However, pushing him gives me just enough delight to not set the whole place on fire and run screaming.Cameron Hayes is my assistant.My ridiculous, sarcastic, pain in my side assistant.If she wasn't so good at her job, I would've fired her years ago... then I would have taken her home and shown her how much I actually liked it. And her. But... I can't cross that line. Crossing it could mean losing her. And I'd rather suffer in silence then see her walk away.Previously published as:SHIFT : A DRIVEN WORLDS NOVELASIN: B08DHGVK1H",
