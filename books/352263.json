  "title": "The Journal of Hélène Berr",
  "description": "From April 1942 to February 1944, Hélène Berr, a recent graduate of the Sorbonne, kept a journal of her life in Nazi-occupied Paris, seeking refuge from the harsh realities of being a Jew under the Vichy regime. Hélène writes of literature, music, love, and the beauty of her city, striving to remain calm and rational even as tragedy closes in. In 1944, Hélène and her parents were arrested and sent to Drancy. On her twenty-third birthday they were taken to Auschwitz, where her parents died within six months. Hélène was forced to march to Bergen-Belsen, where she died in April 1945, just days before British troops arrived to liberate the camp.The Journal of Hélène Berr is both an intensely moving, intimate document, and a significant contribution to the history of the Holocaust.",
