Surprise Bestseller!As president and then CEO of cloud provider Rackspace, Lanham Napier grew the company from $5 million to over $1 billion in revenues and $5 billion in market value while creating thousands of jobs. Under his leadership, especially growing its trademarked, high-quality customer service, Fanatical Support, Rackspace gained thousands of customers and industry dominance. A lifelong Texan, Lanham grew the company in his home state, overseeing the development of phenomenal new headquarters (a converted mall) in San Antonio and leading the company’s IPO. Further, he obsessed over how to increase employee engagement, and he exuberantly succeeded in his goal. But, when Microsoft, Amazon, and Google entered the industry in force, everything changed . . . including Lanham’s relationship with Rackspace executives and the company’s board of directors. Lanham believed he had three options for leading the Rackspace response to the intense competition. But in fact, the board showed him that there was a fourth option (a very difficult one), which he had never even considered.Readers love the authenticity of this book and made it a bestseller for coaching and mentoring and for business management.",
