What he does not disclose holds the answers to so much of the secrecy of this world and the past. But the journey nevertheless is all the more important. Crow doesn’t reveal much, but Ofeline is not just an innocent little girl, and her origins cause her to have secrets of her own. Secrets she can’t explain. While Crow and his comrades don’t reveal their motives, getting Ofeline to an undisclosed location seems to be their dying wish. And even though he is sworn to protect her, dying is the only way to live.An 'Endless' Story",
