  "description": "\"Seriously Mum, Where’s that Donkey?\" is Alan Parks’ follow-up book to \"Seriously Mum, What’s an Alpaca?\" This book continues the story of Alan and Lorna’s induction into Andalucian life and fills in some of the blanks. In this book, Alan and Lorna discover that their local town is not quite as sleepy as they had first imagined and that the local ladies will stand by you once their friendship is won. Alan and Lorna make some great new friends and have a few more unexpected adventures along the way. Add an appearance on Canadian TV into the mix, plus the trials and tribulations of alpaca farming, and this sequel will bring you bang up to date with the lives of two British expats in rural Spain.",
