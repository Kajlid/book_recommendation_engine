  "description": "The sound of everything combined is one long exhilarated scream. San Antonio, Ibiza. A non-stop carnival for the young, where excess reigns and rules are made to be broken. But this summer, something else has joined the party. Something cruel and dark-hearted. An evil that moves through the night with an appetite for sin. Toby Matthews has come to San Antonio to recover from a broken heart, and it seems that beautiful Cass Tait may be the cure. But as their relationship begins to bloom, they stumble upon an unspeakable darkness. They stare evil in the eye, they see its true heart, and know that only they can stop it. Before the sun goes down, they must decide whether to run … or whether to stand like heroes and fight. This is the hunting ground. The live wire. Where hearts were made to beat harder. This is San Antonio … one long exhilarated scream. Rio Youers is one of the most vital, most exciting young talents to come along in this decade … Peter Straub",
