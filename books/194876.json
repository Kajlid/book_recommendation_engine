  "description": "Johnny is eleven years old and in despair since he believes himself to be the cause of his father's departure with another woman. His mother knows better, but, with the bank account also gone with her husband, she is destitute and gladly accepts a job offer on the other side of the country. Together with his mother and his twin sister Jennifer, Johnny finds himself thrust into a new life.Before Johnny awakes on his first day in an empty new house, he strangely dreams of being a beautiful princess. When he wakes, however, he can't escape his enduring guilt over his father. He volunteers to escort his sister, who loves baseball, to a local park where she had noticed a baseball game in progress. Bored by the game, Johnny instead sees the most beautiful girl in the world sitting only feet away.At first, Johnny's biggest obstacle to meeting the beautiful girl is the skilled baseball player she adores. But then the nice neighbor next door donates a box of second-hand girl's clothes for Jennifer, and the yellow dress she pulls out in front of her brother is the spark that releases the dream princess within him. Jennifer rejects the clothes as too 'girly' and instead disguises herself as a boy to sneak onto the 'boys only' baseball teams. Meanwhile, the princess within Johnny emerges as a beautiful girl. Soon everyone around them knows them as Jenny, the sweetheart girl, and Jack, the macho athlete, everyone, that is, except for their mother.Jenny faces new problems as a transgender youngster, including the lingering personality of Johnny with whom she shares her mind. But whether it's getting along with new friends, keeping Johnny's old friends at bay, dodging enemies, or falling in love, Jenny is continually inspired by the princess within.",
