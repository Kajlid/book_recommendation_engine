  "description": "When a freak storm engulfs a mill, the workers learn quickly that there is much more to fear than just heavy rain.Something else arrives with the storm â€“macabre creatures that alter their shapes and features with every attack. In order to survive the night, the employees will have to rely on a man whose sanity is questionable. For he claims to have faced the same attacks before, over ages of time. He calls it an Aberration. A doorway that opens to a realm of nameless evils. What lies beyond wants to smother our world in darkness and perverse terror. It grows stronger with every passing moment, and all that stands between it and our world are the workers trapped in the building.Horror evolves. Reality distorts. And all must be sacrificed if the Aberration is to be stopped.",
