  "description": "Love, death, fish, and the American Renaissance. The gloves are off, the stakes are high, and the global elite will stop at nothing in this thrilling sequel to “Virtually Yours, Jonathan Newman.” It’s been two years since the Newman family abandoned the US mainland to settle on tiny Civitas Island, a peaceful sanctuary off the Pacific coast. There Jonathan, his wife Jen, and daughter Rachel, together with their young friend Marco Prima, rebuild their fractured lives. The Island population keeps a low profile, avoiding unwanted attention from Freedom First, the libertarian political party that dominates Mainland USA. All that changes, however, when Marco and other Civitas leaders launch American Renaissance, a new political movement to challenge Freedom First’s iron grip over the nation. Powerful forces encircle the close-knit community. The island enclave’s self-sustaining fishing and farming industries are mysteriously beset by deadly algae blooms and toxic blight. Community leaders are hunted down by clandestine cartels mobilizing to crush any challenge to their economic and political dominance. Rachel and Marco find themselves at the center of this conflict. The young lovers are haunted by the most harrowing ordeals as they confront their personal demons as well as the corporate powers aligned against them. It’s a David versus Goliath battle with impossible odds, but no matter how dark things get, where there is love and loyalty, family and community, there is hope.",
