  "description": "I became the new girl at Montlake Prep, a school full of rich snobs. I was prepared for the insults, the taunts, and the endless bullying from day one. But nothing could prepare me for the kings of the school:  Jacob, Troy, and Lucas.  The three of them ruled the halls of Montlake Prep with an iron fist. Arrogant and privileged doesn’t even start to describe them. Oh, did I forget to also mention that they’re drop dead gorgeous?  They don’t understand the meaning of the word “No.” Whatever they wanted, they got. And from my first day here, they made it clear what they wanted from me:  They want me to know my place. They want me to fall on my knees.  They’re determined to do whatever it takes to make my life a living nightmare. But I won’t play by their rules.  I’m not afraid of these bully boys. But maybe, just maybe, I should be.  Warning: Not for the faint of heart. This slow-burn reverse harem novel of three arrogant bad boys and the girl who stood her ground contains dark themes, high school drama, teenage angst, swoon-worthy sex, and and some potential triggers.",
