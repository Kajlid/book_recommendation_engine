  "description": "Due to popular demand, Other Criteria has reprinted Damien Hirst's extraordinary book project, I Want to Spend the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now , in a smaller format. This dynamic and provocative collection of Hirst's ideas and obsessions is a powerful combination of text and visuals. Each piece is set against a visual narrative of drawings, words, photography, typography, pop-ups and other special effects that make this book unique. It includes an essay by novelist Gordon Burn that looks at Hirst's work and the breadth of its impact. This is a landmark publication that has redefined the fine-art monograph.",
