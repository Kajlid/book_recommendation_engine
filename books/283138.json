  "title": "Arcadia Borealis: Selected Poems of Erik Axel Karlfeldt",
  "description": "Arcadia Borealis was first published in 1938. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.\n The specimens of Karlfeldt's lyrics here presented are from the six volumes published during his lifetime, dating from 1895 to 1927 and from a posthumous collection of 1934. The grouping is under the various moods of the poems rather than under their dates or subjects. All the narrative pieces have been included, together with a disproportionately large number of the \"Dalecarlian Frescoes in Rhyme.\" For the rest, an attempt has been made to represent every aspect of Karlfeldt's interest and thought.",
