  "description": "A son's story of living in his father's shadow of genius tainted by depressionHarry Abley was a nightmare of a depressive, self-absorbed, unpredictable, emotionally unstable. He was also a dream of a gentle, courageous, artistically gifted. Mark Abley, his only child, grew up in the shadow of music and mental illness. How he came to terms with this divided legacy, and how he learned to be a man in the absence of a traditional masculine role model, are central to this beautifully written memoir. This extraordinary story will speak to all those who love music, who struggle with depression, or who wrestle with the difficult bonds of love between a parent and a child.",
