He has no time for a relationship and most definitely is not interested in the new emergency room nurse, Matt Walton. Matt is exactly what Calvin doesn't wantâ€”an eyeliner-wearing bad boy who rides a motorcycle.Matt, however, is intrigued by the stuffy, too-beautiful-for-words doctor, but the man is as cold as ice. Yet Matt's fellow nurses bet him he can't melt Dr. Lassiter and get him into bed.Too fascinated by Calvin not to try, Matt succeeds in breaking the doctor's hard exterior. But as their relationship turns serious, the possibility hangs over Matt's head that his co-workers will tell his sexy lover the truth and end his dreams of winning Calvin's heart forever.
