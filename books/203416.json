  "description": "The cattiness.The fights.The shaming.I don't generally watch reality television, but I definitely don't watch reality dating shows. Besides the fact that it's completely staged, it's a horrible depiction of people -- women especially.Women are pitted against each other to compete for the affection of a man they \"fall in love\" with after a week or two.I call B.S.It is complete crap.So when my best friend, Koko, was hired as a makeup artist o the set of the most popular reality dating show, The One, I teased her mercilessly.She told me that if I didn't stop teasing her, she would get me back.And she did...Which is how I ended up as a contestant on The One.",
