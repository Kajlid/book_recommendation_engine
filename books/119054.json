With unbearable pain eating away at her every day, she decides to take the law into her own hands, and kills the man responsible.  THE CASE OF A LIFETIME...  Brigham Theodore has just graduated law school and, with a legal market saturated with lawyers, accepts a position in a firm run by less than upstanding citizens. Though probably a criminal himself, his boss trusts him to handle criminal cases early on.  And Brigham is given a case he cannot refuse. The murder of a murderer. Amanda Pierce seems meek and frail, not at all like the picture Brigham has in his head of what a murderer should look like. He finds himself obsessed with her case and agrees to defend her.
