But when miracle-after-miracle pulled his family from the brink of death, Emmanuel devoted his life to God’s work, whatever that may be.Fifteen years after escaping the Congo, Emmanuel decided to leave the safe borders of America and trace his footsteps back to the life he left behind.

As Emmanuel started collecting gently used footwear to bring hope to his people, his work united thousands across the country.",
