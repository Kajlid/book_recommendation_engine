  "title": "\"Rich Georgian Strangely Shot\": Eugene Grace, \"Daisy of the Leopard Spots\" and the Great Atlanta Shooting of 1912",
  "description": "Read all about the madcap love affair of Gene Grace - an \"Adonis from a Georgia town\" - and his new wife, Daisy, a glamorous, wealthy Yankee widow. It was all fun and games until her money ran out. Gene was found shot in a locked bedroom inside his locked house. Paralysed, he was later carried into court on a stretcher. \"Surely, she shot him,\" they said. But Gene was blocked by Georgia law from testifying against his wife. Could the prosecutors prove their \"diabolical plot?\" The Atlanta newspapers--led by the Georgian, under the very new control of Mr. Hearst, that giant of \"yellow journalism\"--covered the case relentlessly. In 1912, a sweat soaked Atlanta jury had to decide a classic locked door mystery. This is the never-before-told story of a sensational crime and an extraordinary trial that gripped the nation in 1912.",
