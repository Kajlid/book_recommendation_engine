  "description": "PRAISE Laine Cunningham's latest marries mystery with the strong literary flavor for which she is known...The cultural richness of the Hindu panthion uses a lovely South-Asian FBI Agent protagonist to make a mark in Southern serial crime. SHORTLISTED FOR THE WILLIAM FAULKNER AWARDNeil Gaiman’s American Gods meets China Mieville’s Kraken in a haunting and atmospheric tale that pits an FBI profiler against monsters ancient and modern.When FBI agent Priya Conlin-Kumar tracks two different serial killers hunting in the same city, she begins to see visions of a demon king. After one of the killers falls, she hones in on the seemingly inhuman predator who continues slaughtering at whim. The closer she gets, the more intense their battle becomes until it touches the law enforcement officers--female and male--assisting with the case.As if called forth by powers too ancient to deny, the visions enter the material world. Inexplicable events soon make it clear that the gods and demons of mythology are moving through the city. Supernatural beings step into the battle between these two mortals, lending their immortal energies to a showdown between good and evil. Priya must access the dark, sensual power of the goddess Kali in order to face the demonic superpredator on his own terms.Showcasing the urban surrealism that marks weird fiction authors and the New Weird category, Beloved blends the shadows of H. P. Lovecraft with the literary sensibilities of Ursula Le Guin in a story that sparks fury and tears through suspense, sex, horror, and a spare prose style.",
