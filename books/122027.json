  "description": "Cole Stockton had a will of steel and a raw determination to go after what he wanted - including Kelsey Murdock. He'd invaded her life, assaulting her with his sensuality, tempting her to be reckless. She sensed something dangerous about the man - in the secrets he refused to share, the past that still haunted him, the coiled tension that denied intimacy. For Cole, the past was a closed door. For Kelsey, that meant too many questions and no answers.",
