  "title": "Goodnight Moon",
  "description": "In a great green room, tucked away in bed, is a little bunny. \"Goodnight room, goodnight moon.\" And to all the familiar things in the softly lit room--to the picture of the three little bears sitting in chairs, to the clocks and his socks, to the mittens and the kittens, to everything one by one--he says goodnight. In this classic of modern children's literature, beloved by generations of readers and listeners, the quiet poetry of the words and the gentle, lulling illustrations combine to make a perfect book for the end of the day.",
