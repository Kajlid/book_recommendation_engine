  "description": "When I first met Dex Wilder, I was wearing a bed sheet and body glitter and serving hors d'oeuvres to a who's-who of Nashville music royalty. I certainly didn't realize that my sexy country music bad boy would become such a delicious distraction, the one man who could bring out the passion in me on stage or off. All my life I'd only hungered after one thing.Then Dex sauntered into my life with his scuffed boots, warm chocolate voice and touch that set those cold dark places deep inside of me on fire. I knew there was only one way to have it all, and I was going to do whatever it took to get it.",
