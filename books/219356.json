  "title": "The Last Taboo: Women and Body Hair",
  "description": "This is the first academic book ever written on women and body hair, which has been seen until now as too trivial, ridiculous or revolting to write about. Even feminist writers or researchers on the body have found remarkably little to say about body hair, usually ignoring it completely. It would appear that the only texts to elaborate on body hair are guides on how to remove it, medical texts on 'hirsutism', or fetishistic pornography on 'hairy' women. The Last Taboo also questions how and why any particular issue can become defined as 'self-evidently' too silly or too mad to write about.",
