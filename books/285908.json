  "title": "I Hate You, Fuller James",
  "description": "I hate you, Fuller James.I hate your floppy hair and your lopsided grin and those laughing blue eyes that always seem to be laughing at me.I hate that you’re the most popular guy in school and I’m still the girl who sneezed and spit out her retainer on someone at a middle school dance. It’s just such a cliché.I hate that I’m being forced to tutor you in English and keep it a secret from everyone. Because otherwise it might put our basketball team’s chances at winning State in jeopardy, and even though I hate you, I love basketball.I hate that it seems like you’re keeping a secret from me…and that the more time we spend together, the less I feel like I’m on solid ground. Because I’m starting to realize there’s so much more to you than meets the eye. Underneath it all, you’re real.But what I hate most is that I really don’t hate you at all.",
