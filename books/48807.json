  "description": "All Ethan Palmer wants is wheels of his own, and he's finally saved enough money to buy his dream car... when he accidentally rams his dad's Volvo into their garage. It’s not like his lawyer/politician father can’t afford to pay for the damage, but of course his old man is going to turn this into another Big Life Lesson. With all his hard-earned cash going into repairs, Ethan won't be sliding behind the wheel of that Mustang Cobra anytime soon. Or will he? He thinks he's found a way to make some easy money, and suddenly nothing is more important. Not school, not the girl he loves, not even the secrets that divide his family. For Ethan, it's all about payback. But he has no idea what his choices will cost him.",
