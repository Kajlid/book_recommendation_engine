  "title": "Those Without Shadows",
  "description": "In this novel the author of \"Bonjour Tristesse\" and \"A Certain Smile\" employs the third person to paint a vivid picture of a group of artistic and intellectual Parisians. We are made painfully aware of the weakness of their individual identities and the lack of purpose in their lives. Even the 'positive' ambition of Beatrice is merely to mimic others as an actress. As the characters drift despairingly into random affairs with one another, an ugly pall of dissatisfaction appears to envelop Paris.",
