  "description": "Meredith Jensen has seen her share of ups and downs. She's found love twice already and lost it in spectacularly traumatic ways. Now? She just wants a peaceful life, free from love and drama. Meredith's plans for the future center around planning other people's weddings and her new online dating website. Just because she works to help other people find love doesn't mean she wants any part of it though. Unfortunately for Meredith's plans, Asher Murphy is determined to get her to give love another chance. But then again, so is Pule Matafeo. Meredith has never denied that she's stubborn and feisty so it might take the combined forces of all their friends in Fircrest to get her heart back on track in time for Valentine's Day.",
