Each chapter represents a different hat worn by Caren on any given day as a hair removal specialist. The Bikini Waxer -- The Love Doctor -- The Bearded Lady -- The Belle of the Balls- no subject is off limits. Not only funny but sincere and uplifting, this book will leave any female reader with a sense of womanly pride and dynamism. \"As a woman who knows women, I have found that no issue is too big or too small to discuss. We are passionate conversationalists regardless of the subject matter. Whatever the issue may be from finding a new wrinkle or a gray hair to buying a new outfit, dating a jerk, getting a divorce or not knowing what color to paint the damn powder room, it's all important to us - at least for the time it's on the table. Some women look to me for answers. I can only tell them what I would do in certain situations but it's important to tread lightly with some subjects. After all, despite what some may think, I don't have all the answers. Who on this planet does?\" ~ Caren A. Stein",
