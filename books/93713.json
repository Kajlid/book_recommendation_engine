  "description": "Vincenzo's balls burned like the embers of an all-night fire. My name is Dahlia and I write this sentence and know it to be true not because I held said balls in my hand, but because I wore their dangling warmth between my own legs. In a sense, I was Vincenzo, a soldier from 1797 Italy. It went like this: I watched his life like a movie when I slept, but sometimes, in the out-of-body way of dreams, I became him. How could my life still be connected to Vincenzo's fate? All I want is a neat package of answers... A young woman blazes into the unknown, living through an alternate reality tethered to a life hundreds of years ago.",
