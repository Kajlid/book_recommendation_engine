  "description": "What happens when you love someone to pieces, but the puzzle doesn’t fit together?Finn Owens, a bisexual graphic designer in a successful advertising firm, is bold, confident, and enjoying his single life. He’s busy making art, working out, puttering around his old yellow bungalow and dating...a lot. It’s fun and all, but he starts to think that maybe he’ll never find quite the right person. Until one day, Rory, nonbinary and beautiful, comes to work at his office. Petite, quiet, serene Rory is the opposite of big, muscly Finn in every way. But Finn is drawn to them, and, miraculously, Rory seems to feel the same way. One steamy kiss later at Finn’s Halloween party, they’ve fallen hard. The problem is, their lives don’t match—puzzle pieces that just won’t fit together. Finn is a messy painter, Rory is a tidy tech guru. Finn is estranged from his struggling family, and Rory sees theirs almost every weekend at large, elaborate gatherings. When Finn’s sister reaches out for help with her kids, Finn’s not sure he has what it takes. He can barely handle Rory’s big happy family, constantly together celebrating birthdays and holidays over champagne and chef-prepared dinners. Finn knows he doesn’t belong with them, and some people in Rory’s family agree. It’s clear that Finn and Rory just don’t fit. Can Finn snap their pieces together without losing his edges?",
