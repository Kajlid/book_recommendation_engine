  "title": "The Code Theory: Uncovering the hidden pattern of life",
  "description": "Most of us travel through life wondering what it all means, why we are here, and what our purpose is. Through television and other media, we are fed a constant stream of propaganda that true happiness lies in meeting some materialistic goal or becoming the perfect person. The truth is, there is no perfect person; we are all on different paths, experiencing life from our own unique perspectives. Finding the true self is a matter of understanding our own individual underlying codes which determines how our lives will unfold. The Code Uncovering the hidden pattern of life, explores these very questions, and shows how our seemingly unpredictable and chaotic existence is truly by design. Applying both objective reasoning and concepts derived from science, mathematics, and philosophy, The Code Theory reveals links between our everyday existence and the underlying code which governs us all. The book shows that scientific, mathematical, and philosophical concepts all point to the reality that our lives are already planned out and that we are living out our dynamic destinies. Does everything truly happen for a reason? Can order be found in the chaos of our lives? You decide, and learn whether the Code Theory may be closer to the underlying truth within your life.",
