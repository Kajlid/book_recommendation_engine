  "description": "...Ballistic Incantations...Maintaining a 2.0 in Black Magic school is hard, especially when you have a Blood Alcohol Level of .24. \"Vegas\" is determined to do it though. He only came to Absolution Academy--school for Black Magic--to find the one thing he craves the most...a way to bring his girlfriend Katherine back from the DEAD. Book 2: Dead til DeathSo Vegas managed to get an \"A\" for his Crypto-Biology class but it sure wasn't EASY. He's just a few more cut classes away from being kicked out of Absolution Academy and he's down to two options: Allow Seth Bynum to tutor him or get ready for magic school \"Special Ed.\"Somewhere in his drug induced stupor Vegas manages to get his hands on Kaye's Spell book. Unfortunately, the thing is enchanted, and not in a good way that brings a charming prince and a happy ending. It's cool, Vegas doesn't want a \"happy ending\" from some dude anyway, but the book is enchanted by EVIL and starts to twist and pervert Vegas' mind...not that anyone can really tell the difference...Meanwhile in Emo-Ville...Seth is trying his best to save Vegas, but how can you save someone who wants you DEAD? Vegas is going to have to get in line, because it seems like a lot of people want Seth Bynum dead, including Seth Bynum himself. If only Seth could get suicide right...just ONCE! Just ONCE and all this B.S. will be over. But mistakes Seth made in his past continue to haunt him and it doesn't seem like Seth can die dead enough to be forgiven...Also a pregnant teen, cyborgs and a budding interracial romance between a perky demon hunter and a suicidal black magic mage. 300+ pages of pure awesome! What are you waiting for? Book 1: Easy \"A\" in online stores now.",
