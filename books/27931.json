  "description": "Reid Davis lives a quiet life in a small, rural town on a simple street. But in his mind, he shares a life with people that don't exist outside of it. He visits his doctor once a week for therapy after an accident left his body nearly dead but his thoughts, though jagged, very much alive. He has no recollection of the car accident and in fact, has little memory of anything that happened before it. With his world in a gaining spin, he tries to piece his jigsaw life back together with nightly occurring dreams he believes hold clues. Soon, dream after confusing dream slowly reveal to him that there is much more at stake than just regaining his memory. As Reid's sessions with his doctor become more probative, he begins to realize there's no one he can trust.",
