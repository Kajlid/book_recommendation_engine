  "description": "How do you win back a love you threw away with a careless text message? How do you win back a girl who can't stand the sight of you?Instead of penning the perfect, heartfelt letter, or sending bouquets of roses to her doorstep, I followed Cassia from Arizona to New York City and moved in next door to her and her new boyfriend, Nick.Cassia claims her relationship with Nick is built on concrete, that I can't touch what they have, but I see the flash of desire in her eyes whenever she looks at me, feel the quickening of her breath on my face whenever I get close. I know better than to take her lies as truth. Their foundation is built on nothing more than crumbling bricks and I'm wielding the sledgehammer that will bring it down.",
