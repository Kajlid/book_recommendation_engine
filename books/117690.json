Sure, she has a cool job as a tour guide at a real Hollywood movie studio, but when it comes to her personal life, she can barely get her crush, Connor, to notice her.Then Tracy gets a brilliant idea: Why not win Connor's heart with some help from the big screen? Taking her cues from her favorite chick flicks, Tracy puts Operation Rom Com into action, and it actually seems to work!But Tracy soon realizes that getting the leading man isn't the same as keeping him. Maybe things never work out like they do in the movies--or do they?",
