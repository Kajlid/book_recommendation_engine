  "description": "There comes a day when our children are old enough to decide for themselves. A time when they understand that their decisions have consequences. And when that moment arrives, we must make sure that we've instilled in them the wisdom to know God's voice and the strength to withstand peer pressure. In this unique allegory Billy must choose between following his heart or his friends. The story presents a wonderful opportunity to share with your children the importance of listening to their hearts, especially when responding to God--for they won't always get a second chance.",
