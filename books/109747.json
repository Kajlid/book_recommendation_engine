  "description": "First crush, first love, first kiss—in this addition to the sweet and clean Flirt series, Chloe finds that there’s more than just horses waiting for her at the ranch this summer.Chloe can hardly believe it when she lands a summer job mucking stalls at one of the best dude ranches in Colorado. The summer only gets better when she meets Stephen. He’s funny, friendly, and hardworking—a welcome antidote to Chloe’s daily doses of Zach, the cocky, self-satisfied fellow ranch hand. When a trailer full of new colts arrives for training, Chloe is given the job of caring for them. She’s looking forward to seeing Stephen all the time, but then Zach is assigned to help with the training and Chloe’s plans for moonlight rides and watching sunsets are squashed. But as the summer continues and Chloe starts to see a different side of Zach as he works with the horses, she starts to wonder if maybe she judged him too harshly at first. Could there be something between them after all?",
