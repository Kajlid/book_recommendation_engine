  "description": "A sweeping medieval adventure! The castle-town of Dansford is poised on the edge of the Welsh frontier in 12th century England. During a daring night attack, a simple merchant inadvertently becomes a hero and is taken on a journey of self-discovery to find the courage within him that he never knew he possessed. With new friends and a mistaken identity he is thrust into a world of nobility and manners where one wrong slip of the tongue could be the death of him. Defender Of The Realm is an exciting and often humorous ride through England of old that breaks down the social barriers of class distinction by examining what truly makes one noble. It's the adventure of a lifetime!",
