  "description": "She’s the truth that divulges my secrets and the purity that sanitizes my soul. Loving her has never come with choice – it consumed and burned and before I knew it I was hers. DaceA man is defined by the secrets he keeps and the demons he carries. I never knew I longed for light until the rays burned me. Now, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to hold tightly to the light I’ve captured. She’s a good girl and she’s come from a good world. We’re as opposite as opposite can be, but she’s the other side of my coin – the day to my night. She’s the truth to my secrets and the redemption to my sins. Her heart is my salvation and her body is my obsession. But loving her comes with a risk I’m not sure I can take. Ella He’s become my safe place when everything I knew disintegrated around me. In his arms, I find solace and safety and laughter in a time where I’m suffocated by pain. He came into my world without any warning, conquering and claiming. They tell me he’s dark and dangerous. I’ve been warned and I know I should stay away, but I can’t seem to help myself. He’s a craving I can’t deny when the world keeps tossing us together. I know there are things I don’t know, but every layer I uncover reveals a man my soul seems to recognize. He’s chiseling away my heart, but I’m unsure if he’s invading the fractured pieces, or stealing them. Either way, I don’t think I have the strength to deny him. Even if I did, I don’t know if I would. Is it really up to me to decide if love prevails over darkness? Or, are some plans fated long before we come to be? I’m beginning to believe I was fated for him – crafted entirely to enrapture all that he is.",
