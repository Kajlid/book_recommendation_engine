  "description": "Welcome to Darklore Manor, where spirits of the dead do not rest easy, nor do they find release from their eternal suffering... This anthology contains thirteen tales of terror, covering a vast array of horror themes involving living gargoyles, creepy dolls, dark urban legends, secret societies, and murderous madmen. The main story is a novella based on Nox Arcana's nightmarish concept album, Darkloreâ€ˆManor. When a team of ghost hunters sets out to investigate a legendary haunted house, they encounter several spirits of the restless dead and awaken an ancient evil that hungers for human souls. Years later, they are plagued by nightmares and the survivors return to the house to confront their darkest fears. This eerie and horrific tale is reminiscent of classic ghost stories like The Legend of Hell House and The Haunting.",
