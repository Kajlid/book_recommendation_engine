  "description": "You've met the Morelli family, now delve into the love story of Mateo's callous brother, Dante Morelli...\nLoving Dante was my original sin. They warned me of the slippery slope, the moral corruption, the outright debasement of the Morelli family. They warned me not to get involved. Not to love him.I didnâ€™t listen. I thought I would be his saving grace. I was a fool.Once upon a time, Dante Morelli was the source of my happiness, the powerful embrace which would always keep me safe and loved.Now, Dante Morelli is the source of every moment of pain, every moment of grief, every heart-breaking moment of my young life.Once, his love was my lifeblood.Now, his love is my prison. Once, I thought it might kill me to leave him.Now, I know he will never let me go.Warnings: Dark romance. Bad guy hero. This is a comprehensive series, so you'll have a MUCH better time with Dante's story if you have read the entire Morelli family series first. The author does NOT recommend trying to read this book as a standalone if you have not read the previous Morelli family series books. The Morelli story begins in ACCIDENTAL WITNESS, not Dante's book.",
