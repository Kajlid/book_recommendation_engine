  "title": "The Lady of Castle Dunn",
  "description": "Amy's adventures continue. She made a deal with the CIA… They gain access to her extraordinary talents and she gets the chance to protect children…and avenge them. But in the world of high stakes covert operations, things are never so simple. In an Oklahoma mansion… A dying businessman makes a deal with the devil and opens a door to unimaginable evil. That evil will cross paths with the CIA’s newest and best-kept secret, Amy Lynn. Even avenging angels can love… A man she once detested proved his worth, and now Amy holds him firmly in her heart. Will her job, Southern tradition, and a painful secret from her past silence the wedding bells? Master American storyteller Jack July does it again with The Lady of Castle Dunn, at once a love story, a spy thriller and an emotional roller coaster. Follow Amy’s adventures as she rediscovers what is most important in her life—family. The Lady of Castle Dunn is the third book in the Amy Lynn Series. It will stand on it's own. However, to truly appreciate who Amy is and how she evolved from a simple 12-year-old back woods Alabama country girl, the author highly recommends the foundation novel, Amy Lynn followed by Amy Lynn Golden Angel.",
