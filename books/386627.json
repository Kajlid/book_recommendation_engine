  "description": "Jordan LaRousse and Samantha Sade, founders of the erotica website Oysters and Chocolate, have compiled this anthology of erotic literature that ranges from sweet to spicy. Divided into four distinct “flavors”—Vanilla, Dirty Martini, Licorice Whips, and Oysters—Nice Girls, Naughty Sex covers a wide range of sexualities and preferences. The Vanilla section (the “traditionalist” flavor) offers stories of straight sex between one man and one woman; Dirty Martini (sex with a twist) stories include stranger sex, fetishes, threesomes, foursomes, and more; Licorice Whips explores the bittersweet dance of domination and submission; and Oysters features bisexual and lesbian stories.With the wide range of erotic subgenres it envelopes, Nice Girls, Naughty Sex is a fun, sometimes edgy, collection of sexy encounters that appeals to every kind of reader—no matter what their taste.",
