  "description": "RioBryn Wallace had been the one bright spot in my life before my grandparents brought me to live with them. While living in the run-down trailer park my momma had moved us to the last few years of her life, Bryn had given me a reason to smile every day. After finding my mother’s dead body, my grandparents had picked me up and I started a new life in The Shores, Alabama. It had always bothered me that I never got a chance to tell Bryn goodbye.Now, seven years later, my memories of the beautiful girl who I considered my first love were destroyed by the disappointment she had become.BrynWhen life took another nosedive from bad to worse, which happened too often, I would tell myself that one day I’d find Rio March. It got me through my darkest times and gave me hope. When my sister had, once again, gotten us forced out of town, by sleeping with the local minister and turning everyone in the community against us, I took the money I had saved from working over-time and I made the decision on where we would move. However, fate was never on my side. Within two weeks of arriving in The Shores, Rio hated me and made sure everyone else in town did too. I couldn’t even take my nephew into the candy store.It didn’t seem to matter where we moved, this would always be our outcome. Hated, looked down upon, and judged for sins I hadn’t committed. But I was done moving. The trashy Wallace girls were in town to stay.",
