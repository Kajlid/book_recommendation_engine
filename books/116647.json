  "description": "Seeker of Stars is a fictional memoir of Melchior, one of the magi, whose story neither begins nor ends at the first Christmas.  As a small boy, Melchior is fascinated by stars, but lives in a world of rigid obligations where he must apprentice with his rug-making father. Through sandstorms and family upheaval, Melchior dares to dream of grasping those stars. Then his expected course radically alters, setting him on a new path, full of danger and glory, in pursuit of that one special star. The novella traces Melchiorâ€™s pilgrimage across the desert, sifting through years of memory, to a place of surprising wholeness and love. The journey leads Melchior to reflect on desire and pain, life and death, family and love, dreams and duty, and to find unusual reconciliation within his own family and with the God he never knew he sought. Seeker of Stars offers a fresh retelling of the story of the magi, and invites us to a new perspective and passion for our own spiritual journeys.",
