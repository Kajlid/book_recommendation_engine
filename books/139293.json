  "description": "alternate cover edition of ASIN: B00HYOU2A8 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days- and also afterward- when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were heroes of old, men of great renown. Genesis 6: 4 And to this day, they remain: the Nephilim. Half human, half angel. They hide in the light, eternal, chaste, and beautiful. They protect the children of men from the Succubae, daughters of Lilith. Dangerous demonesses who prey on men leaving them worse than dead. Until the day that one Nephil, Lucien, first encountered the Succubus Sarahi. That day a creature of darkness, sick of the shadows, dared lift her face towards heaven and discovered something she never dreamed she would find... love. But their love is overshadowed as the long-foretold war between angels and demons threatens to break over the land. For prophecy states that from the mingling of these races will come a warrior who holds the key to victory... or utter destruction.",
