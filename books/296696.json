  "description": "The Uplift, Empowerment and Progress of Black African American People has been sabotaged and interfered with by an Elite Secret Fraternity of Black African American Men for over 100 years. It's time that Black African American People knew who their Black Enemy is, where it is, how it operates and demand that it stop negatively interfering in the affairs of Black African American People. We must also demand and implement our own National Comprehensive Black Empowerment Plan without our enemyâ€™s sabotage it, if we are to survive in the 21st Century. The Art Of Black War Against A Black Enemy accomplishes this. Available at https://gum.co/vLEXB",
