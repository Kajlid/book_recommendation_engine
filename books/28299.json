  "description": "A hardcover, deluxe collection of Santa’s secret origins–brought together for the first time!Before he became a myth... Before he became a legend... The complete, deluxe hardcover collection of the man who would be Santa Claus, and who dared to challenge the dark forces of magic and malevolence! From the genre-colliding mind of comics icon Grant Morrison (All-Star Superman, Luda) and the dazzling artistic talents of superstar Dan Mora (World's Finest, Once & Future) comes a bold adventure into the lands of endless winter, where the sword-swinging adventurer known as Klaus and his wolven companion, Lilli, would begin a centuries-long journey to uphold his immortal mission… and make the world safe for everyone who holds the spirit of Christmas in their heart. Deftly threading traditional tales of Santa's roots in Viking folklore and Siberian shamanism together with the pulp-inspired prototype of the superhero and barbarian swashbuckler, witness the true secret origin of Santa Claus, long thought lost to history...and the rise of the malignant foes that have stood to oppose his sacred duty across the Krampus, the Witch of Winter, the Pola Cola corporation, and more. Collects Klaus #1-7, Klaus & the Witch of Winter, Klaus & the Crisis in Xmasville, Klaus & the Crying Snowman, Klaus & the Life and Times of Joe Christmas, and Pen & Ink Edition.",
