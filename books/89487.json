  "description": "The twins were marooned on a tropical paradise, and dark thoughts permeate their peaceful existence.How were they to resist one another, all alone in the middle of nowhere? They wore so little clothes, and it was impossible for Zach to hide his arousal from his twin sister Zahra.She’d always been too polite to mention it before, but when he confesses he loves her in a way no brother should, neither of them know what to expect.This shocking short erotica contains consensual brother/sister twincest, loss of virginity, and unprotected sex in a lost lagoon.~~Excerpt:Zach would’ve found this place hell despite the beauty and bounty, if not for her. The loss of their companions and family, the loss of hope of ever getting home. He’d have given up. Instead, he found so many moments of happiness, like now.Smiling broadly, his white teeth on display, he laughed at her as he approached. “You’ve taken care of everything,” he said affectionately. Zach tried not to stare over long at her. They’d lost a lot of shame since coming here, but he loved his sister deeply.“The ocean’s about carried off what’s left of the ship,” he remarked , brushing his hair back and looking her over again. “Amazing that stuff still holds on,” he remarked about her lacy underthings. His own shorts were worn and tattered, and a tight fit that cupped about his sizable package, especially when damp like it was then.“Yea, well, mom pitched a fit at the price, but look who's laughing now,” she teased as she made her way down to the water, bending down and washing off her hands. It was hard not to stare when her back was too him and she was posed so provocatively, even if she didn’t intend it. Maybe especially if she didn’t intend it.",
