  "description": "When a girl gets dumped, she can cry . . . or get even. Mia Sanchez is rocked when her partner of four years, Brenda Montalba, informs her that she has fallen out of love with her and plans to leave town for several months to give them time to “think about their future together.” Mia hadn’t thought words could be more painful until Brenda followed up hers with, “You’ve really let yourself go over the last few years.” Alone, hurt, and embarrassed, Mia decides to take the advice of friend Mathew “Goody” Good, the self crowned Queen of Getting Dumped when he tells her, “The best way to get over them is to get even.” A sexy, sometimes humorous, sometimes poignant, contemporary romance that exposes the importance of looking beneath the surface for what truly matters.",
