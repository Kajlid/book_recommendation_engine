However, waking up wearing nothing but two shiny, matching wedding rings is. For the girl who promised to never settle down, it's her worst nightmare. For me, it's a dream come true.I've wanted Raelynn Vos since she first propositioned me at a frat party. I, of course, turned her down, knowing I'd need more than a one night stand. Nothing less than forever would do. She's fierce and determined, but I'm more determined than she could ever be. When fate forces us to pretend our marriage is real, I use every second to prove I'm the perfect man to tame her wildness. In fact, by the end of our charade, I'll have her begging for it.",
