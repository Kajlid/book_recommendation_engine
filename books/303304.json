  "description": "I thought the scenery would be the highlight of my working trip to Scotland, then a dark-haired, kilted Highlander walks into the bar.That swoony Scottish accent.Dark eyes and a sexy smirk.Would anyone blame me for a quick holiday romance? Except if I want to keep my job, Ewan is off limits. I need to lock down my lust.For a former poor kid who's used to deprivation, this should be easier.But my cocky Scot doesn’t agree, and he’s hell bent on changing my mind.--Cocky Kilt is a cute and steamy romp between a New York lass and a determined Scot. Expect sexting after dark and a love-conquers-all happy ending.Written in the Cocky Hero Club world, Hailey, our heroine, is first featured in Park Avenue Player by Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward.",
