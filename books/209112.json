  "title": "Murderville USA: The Santa Cruz Serial Killers",
  "description": "The 1950's and 1960's were an era where some people still didn't feel the need to lock their doors. The Manson murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 seemed to change all that. They seemed to usher in a new era - that of the serial killer. Still, the city of Santa Cruz was 300 miles away and residents felt that the Manson murders were more of a Hollywood type of crime. They didn't feel threatened. That is until October 1970 when a mass murder shocked the city of 32,000. The killer was soon caught but he would soon be followed by two prolific serial killers who operated in the city at the same time. It was at that time that Santa Cruz was given the nickname of Murderville USA.",
