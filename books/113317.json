  "description": "Deirdre \"Foxtrot\" Lancaster is back. With trusted companions Whiskey and Tango, she’s on the prowl for a brand-new predator… Deirdre has her hands full, as usual. Working as as a Jill-of-all-trades for a zany billionaire like Zelda Zoransky means the daily grind is closer to a juggling act, and this week is no exception—especially when her side job is directing spiritual traffic in Zelda’s pet cemetery. With ZZ hosting a party for some of the world’s wealthiest animal collectors and a rare albino liger named Augustus in residence at the private zoo, Foxtrot is ready for trouble to take a big bite out of her schedule…\nTO DIE FUR \nShe doesn’t have to wait long. The half-ton big cat is dead, and there’s a houseful of colorful suspects, each one wackier than the next. But if they were all bidding to buy him, who would want Augustus dead? With the help of Tango’s feline telepathy and Whiskey the canine shapeshifter, Foxtrot learns that there’s much more to Augustus than meets the eye. Now they just have to sniff out a killer before any more fur flies… 　\"A delightful, funny [series] filled with eccentric and colorful characters, be they humans, animals or spirits. Dixie Lyle will entertain the reader page after page!\"—Leann Sweeney, New York Times bestselling author of the Cats in Trouble mysteries",
