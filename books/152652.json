  "description": "Long ago in Victorville, California lived a boy so dark and so evil that his classmates murdered him out of desperation to save themselves. It didn't work. Since then, strange children with solid black eyes have been knocking on doors, asking strangers for help. Some residents believe these are those classmates still trying to save themselves. Others believe it's really the boy seeking revenge on those that help his murderers. What no one realizes is they're both wrong. When they knock... don't let them in.",
