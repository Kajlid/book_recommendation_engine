  "title": "The 10 Dangerous Possessions",
  "description": "This book unfolds the burden of reassessing how the work should be done in the Lord's vineyard. We thank God that they that sit in darkness have gotten the opportunity to see a great light. This great light has revealed to us the avalanche of recycled errors that the Church has continued to peddle with relish within the last two decades. As a result of the continuous exposure to them, they have become the norm rather than the exception. These errors have become so entrenched that challenging them is like confronting a fast moving train headlong. Going through the book will provide us with hard facts why change is necessary at this time and why we need to watch out and not fall prey to the 10 dangerous possessions.",
