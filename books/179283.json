  "title": "50!: \"THE LIFE, LOVES & PSYCHE OF A MALE MID-LIFE CRISIS: Volume 1 - The Journey\"",
  "description": "This is the story of life. It is about love and relationships; about the importance of family; about how real life and human emotions invariably mess each of these up. It looks at death, divorce and dating; losing loved ones; family feuds and other intertwined issues; grief and stress and how we seek to cope (or spectacularly fail to do so) with all that fate and fortune throws at us on our journey through life. It is a series of personal anecdotes intertwined with the author’s view of the world, both then as it happened and especially now he is older and hopefully much wiser. It is written with the benefit of hindsight. If he had had such clarity and understanding at the time, much of it would never have happened. But he didn’t. As we all “To be old and wise, you must first be young and stupid”",
