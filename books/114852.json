  "description": "\"To the outside. In the Train. A quaint café. The numb bride. The old lady with the deepest of creases. A bustling city and its nightlife. A secret Crush. The dead mornings and bright sunflowers. All bundles into a book; but each of these being inspired from around that makes us look back into ourselves. The characters drawn in here are Us; within Us and from Us. It makes one reckon that we indeed lead vulnerable lives in the pace of the world. And we just have two choices; to embrace it or challenge it. It’s all up to you, to live it. Engage in visual treats churning your emotional quotients in copious amounts through the words in here. And the journey had just begun. \"",
