  "description": "A briefcase containing nothing but papers inexplicably starts to drip blood...A man is visited in the middle of the night by the Chairman of the Board of Insomnia...A young girl discovers that she can read minds, but only the minds of the dead. \"Herding Ravens\" brings together some two dozen of Christopher Conlon's \"bon-bons\"--tasty samples of flash fiction in which anything can happen, and usually does. Inspired by everything from Edgar Allan Poe to Franz Kafka, from Charles Addams to \"The Twilight Zone,\" these surreal fantasies operate with, as the author writes, \"no rules or logic, or with dream logic, or the logic of the grave.\" By turns haunting and hilarious, \"Herding Ravens\" is a walk on the weird side you won't soon forget.Christopher Conlon is best known as the editor of the Bram Stoker Award-winning \"He Is Legend: An Anthology Celebrating Richard Matheson.\" His novels \"Midnight on Mourn Street\" and \"A Matrix of Angels\" were Bram Stoker Award finalists. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.",
