Mercedes Carson has spent her entire life in the destructive wake of her irresponsible big sister. Just once, she longs to break free of the shackles of being a good girl... and she finds her chance with Levi Sinclair, the bad boy drummer of the hot band Three Little Words.  Levi needs something that most women aren't willing to give him. At first glance he's sure that pretty little ice princess named Mercedes will be the same...  He is so very wrong.  Please note: this story contains piercings (his), hidden fantasies (theirs), a whiny biker ex and a lot of naughty touching.  This story is a novella. It was previously published in the Riding Desire boxed set. It is part of the Three Little Words series.",
