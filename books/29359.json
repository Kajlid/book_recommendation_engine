But to faerie eyes, the trunk sitting in the corner of The Toybox Coffee Shop radiates an unmistakable Glamour that marks it as a magical treasure. It is the key to a powerful plan, which could destroy changeling society... forever.To Mortal Eyes...They were an unlikely group of companions: a waitress, a con-man, a street performer, a tramp and two children. Their only common ground was the sanctuary of The Toybox Coffee Shop, a haven where they could drop their mortal guise. But together, these changelings in disguise would form a band of heroes sworn to stop Malacar, former wizard of a faerie duke's kingdom, from obtaining the magical talisman and using it to wreak his vengeance.The Toybox, written by Jackie Cassada, is the first novel in the Immortal Eyes trilogy. It is a heroes' journey into the hidden world of the Dreaming, which lies just beyond the realm of our perceptions-a place where the changelings linger in perpetual exile on the fringes of the mundane world.",
