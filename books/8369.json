  "title": "The underclass Lover",
  "description": "These stories unravel the complex social and political developments taking place in the contemporary Nepal, which is trying to come to terms with a decade long Maoist war, which a tenuous ceasefire arrangement has put on hold presently; and a carnage which eliminated most of the immediate family of a ruling King. The characters often struggle to live with the dual psychology of the people around, and their own ambiguity--rendering most of the situations and contents of their life farcical. (Revised Edition)",
