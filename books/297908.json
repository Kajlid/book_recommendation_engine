  "description": "\"I'll ruin us,\" Jackson whispered to me in the dark. Monsters exist. I'd seen that firsthand. Beautiful faces could hide the most tainted souls, that much I knew for sure. I'd said goodbye to Jackson Parker, desperate to save myself once and for all, but old habits die hard. Every kiss, every touch, every word he'd given me felt imprinted on my skin. But when a monster from the past comes back, I'll have no choice but to reveal the secrets from our shared history. I need Jackson to be my hero, but he has his own scars, and I don't know if we can conquer the past. Heartbreak Prince or lover? There's a fine line between the two. I once said I would love him forever, but at what price does forever cost? Maybe my very soul...The Highly-Anticipated Conclusion to the Broken Hearts Academy Duet",
