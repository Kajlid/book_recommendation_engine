  "description": "Three years ago, I woke up in an abandoned cabin in the middle of the forest. I couldn’t even remember my own name. Since then, I’ve been doing my best to stay off the grid. But this week? Well, that’s proving to be a problem.It all began when I was riding my motorcycle down a quiet, one-lane road. From out of nowhere, a semi-truck started careening straight towards me. Just as it was about to kill me, a freak tornado appeared out of thin air and knocked all 50,000 tons of it to the ground, narrowly saving my life.Days later, my wood fireplace shot a massive plume of fire into the living room, nearly setting the couch – and me – on fire.As if all of that wasn’t strange enough, when I sat in the back of an enormous lecture hall for the first time, the assistant professor looked straight at me as though he knew me – and worse, wanted to kill me.The creepiest part? I’m being followed – and I have no idea why.",
