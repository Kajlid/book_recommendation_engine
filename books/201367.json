  "description": "Truvin Stone no longer remembered his victims...Or his enemies. As he fought for survival, the only person Truvin could trust was an outsider to his world, an innocent foolish enough to nurse him back to health....Truvin's past was one story Lucy Morgan couldn't stop chasing, even after she discovered he was a vampire. Drawn in by his dark side, Lucy was one bite away from feeling the true power of his embrace--and his eternal curse. Standing in the midst of a new war, Truvin was the key to tipping the balance between vampire and witch. Yet returning to his old, evil ways would destroy Lucy... and deliver to him a fate worse than death.",
