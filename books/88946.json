But her plans trap her in an illicit seduction, and Amelia must marry him herself.

Obedience is not one of Amelia’s virtues. But he’s too enthralled by her wit and passion to let her go–even if it means risking the political reputation he is building to save his clan.Their hearts can’t survive the scandal...Despite their intentions, every wicked embrace binds them together. But as their conflicting desires combust into insatiable hunger and unavoidable ruin, they must decide whether to pursue their personal destinies alone–or fight for the love that could destroy them both.",
