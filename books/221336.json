  "description": "Amara Jackson had been living the typical American dream. Until, that is, she found that her husband was cheating on her, every chance he got.  So, putting her 5-year marriage behind her, she heads to the Caribbean with her vivacious and fun-loving sister to try and rediscover the adventurous and carefree girl she used to be.  Not looking for much more than some relaxation in the sun, umbrella drinks and, maybe, one or two hot men, Amara was floored when she met seductive billionaire Grey Nichols, and was quickly swept up into his exciting world of 5-star luxury, private jets, and wild, wild sex. After her ex-husband’s neglect over the past few years, Grey’s passion, attentiveness, six-pack abs, and eagerness to treat her like a princess, was exactly what the doctor ordered.  Not that she’s complaining, in the back of her mind, Amara can’t stop wondering why Grey is spoiling her so much. Why, after only a few days together, is he suggesting they jet off together to his private island? Why does he seem so keen to introduce her to his parents?  Amara discovers, with a little digging, that this gorgeous man’s motives towards her might not be as honest as he makes out, and that he may have some more nefarious plans for her.  A standalone BWWM contemporary romance, Hot as Hell is an exotic adventure set in a rich man’s paradise, where the days are hot and the nights are scorching.",
