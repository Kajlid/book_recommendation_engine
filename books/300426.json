  "description": "A tale unfolds in late 9th century West Africa, back when priestess and prostitute meant the same thing…How could Kyphi have known at such a young age that her mother’s strange condition would lead to her initiation into the sacred and sexual path of ancient spirits nestled in a beautiful oasis hidden among the sand dune of the Sahara? And who is this gorgeous woman who leads the temple, maternal in all the ways her mother never was? Is this really where she is meant to be? Will the generational curse of loneliness be broken? Or will all the divine feminine spirits and the goddess that rules over them all eventually be the ones to destroy her?A novelette with the sensuous slow burn of holy incense. Short, sweet and intoxicating. Inhale Kyphi’s story while you burn your own.#Blackwritersmatter. Support a black writer.",
