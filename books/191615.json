How does he succeed in regaining hope after withstanding years of extreme hunger and cold, with the incessant fear of death ever present?

A decision is made that changes the course of his and his familyâ€™s lives, sealing their fates forever. Hiding deep in the foul swamps and murky forests of Belarus, Avramele endures abandonment and terrible loneliness. But with incredible courage for such a young child, with the help of a remarkable family and a little bit of luck, a strong willed and resilient boy emerges from his dark and painful past. Trekking across war-torn Europe, through refugee camps and an Alpine orphanage, crossing stormy seas and suffering imprisonment in Cyprus, Avramele (Abraham) reclaims his life on the shores of Israel.",
