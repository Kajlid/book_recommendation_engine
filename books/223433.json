He and his doctor boyfriend, Blake Colville, are working opposite shifts, leaving Aaron to go home to an empty house and the prospect of another shift the following day.

But who needs cake when you’re dating a dominant doctor?Note: Doctor’s Orders has been previously released as part of the Brit Boys: With Toys boxed set.",
