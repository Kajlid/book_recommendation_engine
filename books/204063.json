  "description": "Forbidden love is dangerous.And oh so tempting.I rejected my mate…permanently. And I’ve been shamed ever since. But as a Royal from the powerful Alexander pride, I’ve avoided paying the price for protecting myself. Until now.With a shifter war brewing, my freedom has run out. I’ve been designated as a breeder female, and if I don’t pick a new breeding partner, one will be chosen for me.The only problem is the man I love can’t get me pregnant. Josh is human. Even kissing him is wrong, but we can’t stay away from each other. He’s my beloved human. I marked him as a way to keep him safe from the dangers of my world. Basically, I own him–at least according to shifter law–and I'll do anything to protect him. And that…well, that complicates things.But Josh is convinced we’re fated mates. He’s not letting me go and doesn’t care about any rule saying he can’t keep me. And he’s not above playing dirty to get what he wants.Honestly, I’m not sure who owns who at this point, but breaking the Shifter Council’s ultimatum brings consequences I’m not sure either of us will survive.⚠ This book contains scenes that will make you blush (and re-read) but don’t expect a sweet fairy-tale romance. In the Shifter World, only the strong survive. Contains dark fantasy aspects.✓ A closed-door (clean) version of this book is available as Josh by Dana Archer",
