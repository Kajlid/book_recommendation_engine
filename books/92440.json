But when he meets a demon with big blue eyes and finds out that Zion has traded his freedom for the safe passage of the Demon Warriors, Kobe sees beyond his brutal upbringing. He sees a man who is affecting Kobe in ways he had never experienced before. Kobe has to not only gain Zion's trust, but figure out why his father has shown up in Serenity City. There could only be one reason and Kobe is determined to be the one who walks away from their deadly reunion. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
