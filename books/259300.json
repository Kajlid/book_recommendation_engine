  "description": "Detective Claire Goodnite is finally marrying her sexy SAIC, Wesley O’Connell, in this suspenseful conclusion to the series. The hall has been booked, the flowers have been ordered, and the invitations have been sent. Everything is finally falling into place for the happy couple, or so it seems. That is until a hunter the likes of the old DC Sniper has his sights set on New Jersey Law Enforcement and suddenly the thin blue line has a big, old target painted on their backs. It’s open season on police officers and federal agents alike. She might be the best damn detective in the state of New Jersey but even this case has Claire running for her life. Not to mention the loss of one of her inner circle seems to have shook something loose in her mind. Claire’s memories of that long ago day when she was taken from her home as a child are surfacing one after another. But will she remember before it’s too late? It’s like they always say, every story has its ending. Are you ready for this one? It’s gonna sting.",
