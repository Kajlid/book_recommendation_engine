  "description": "In this first book of “Of Grace and Sin” series, Misha finds his one true love — and fights to save both of their lives. Misha Sokolov (ex-soldier, successful banker, divorced, and lonely) meets Sayuri Saito, elegant, intelligent, driven, and recently separated from her husband. Infatuated, he invites her for a vacation in Hong Kong, where he woos her amidst the sights and smells of that island. Meanwhile, Misha uncovers a criminal scheme to defraud his bank. As he gets closer to the truth, his life is threatened, and soon Sayuri’s life as well. But is the enemy that Misha chases real? The book has some steamy situations and is intended for adults. Genre: Erotic Suspense.",
