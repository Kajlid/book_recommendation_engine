  "title": "The Killing Needle",
  "description": "Is this the book that inspired Sherlock Holmes?Appearing in 1871, sixteen years before the great British detective made his appearance, the Frenchman Maximilien Heller was a misanthropic, drug taking private detective with an extraordinary gift for observation and logical deduction, and fully conversant with the chemical science and forensic practices of the day. He was a master of disguise and his audacious exploits were chronicled by his friend and confidant, a doctor. Sound familiar?Be that as it may, The Killing Needle is a seminal work by any fast moving, well plotted and well written, it chronicles the adventures of a talented young detective determined to risk all to save an innocent man and bring a master criminal to justice.Published before The Big Bow Mystery and before The Mystery of the Yellow Room, it is also a locked room milestone, the first to use a technique cited in the Clayton Rawson/John Dickson Carr locked room lectures. For information about other locked room/impossible crime novels, including the works of Paul Halter, one of the contemporary masters of the genre, please",
