  "description": "Frank Kusy is a professional travel writer with nearly thirty years experience in the field. He has written guides to India, Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Of his first work, the travelogue Kevin and I in India (1986), the Mail on Sunday wrote: 'This book rings so true of India that most of us will be glad we don't have to go there.' Born in England (of Polish-Hungarian parents), Frank left Cardiff University for a career in journalism and worked for a while at the Financial Times. India is his first love, the only country he knows which improves on repeated viewings. He still visits for business and for pleasure at least once a year. He lives in Surrey, England, with his wife Madge and his little cat Sparky. Frank is also author of two cat books for children - Ginger the Gangster Cat and Ginger the Buddha Cat, both available on Amazon.",
