  "description": "For over a decade, Nicole Ridley has only been with Brad, her high school sweetheart and husband. Even though her dreams of being a journalist were put on hold so she could care for her four children while he worked his way through medical school, she knew there was a light at the end of this very long––and lonely––tunnel. They always found time for one another until it started to slowly fade away, and then her world was rocked to the core with four words she never thought she’d hear…“I want a divorce.”Untouched by another and feeling unloved and unattractive, Nicole sets out on a journey to rediscover the strong, desirable woman she once was and knows she can be again. New job. New house. New sexy as sin boss who has his eyes set on her. And a soon to be ex-husband who realizes he’s made a horrible mistake.Will Nicole give in to the temptation of another man, or will history and love win?",
