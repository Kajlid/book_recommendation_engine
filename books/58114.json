  "title": "The Zuni Cafe Cookbook: A Compendium of Recipes and Cooking Lessons from San Francisco's Beloved Restaurant",
  "description": "In The Zuni Café Cookbook, a book customers have been anticipating for years, chef and owner Judy Rodgers provides recipes for Zuni's most well-known dishes, ranging from the Zuni Roast Chicken to the Espresso Granita. But Zuni's appeal goes beyond recipes. Harold McGee concludes, \"What makes The Zuni Café Cookbook a real treasure is the voice of Zuni's Judy Rodgers,\" whose book \"repeatedly sheds a fresh and revealing light on ingredients and dishes, and even on the nature of cooking itself.\" Deborah Madison (Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone) says the introduction alone \"should be required reading for every person who might cook something someday.\"",
