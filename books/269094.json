But making that kind of connection with someone has been more of a dream than reality. Then a boy appears out of thin air, a boy from the past. As he helps Elias navigate a strange new world for him, introducing him to the wonders of espresso, binge-watching, and rock and roll, Tyler discovers Elias is exactly who he was missing.But their love has time limit. Elias's disappearance from the past has had devastating side effects, and now he must choose where he truly belongsâ€”in the Victorian era, or with the boy who took him on an adventure he never dreamed possible?",
