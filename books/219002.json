In New York City, Lillian Drooms struggles on her own while her husband, Charles, is away at sea. Her work at Rockwell Publishing grows ever more demanding; the behavior of her two sons is troubling and must be reined in; and in part to battle her increasing loneliness for Charles, Lillian volunteers with Artists for Victory at a hospital for wounded soldiers – but she soon begins to doubt her ability. Added to that, her friend Izzy Briggs is convinced that she has finally found true love, after overcoming her heartbreak years earlier – but Lillian fears that Izzy is setting herself up for disappointment. Meanwhile, on a farm in Illinois, 17 year old Ursula, a beauty who dreams of life beyond the farm, is torn between her sense of duty and the power of love. She finds the source of her deepest yearning and her deepest hatred in Friedrich, one of the German POWs recently hired to work on their farm. The Christmas season brings its charm and warmth – but can love survive in these turbulent, fragmented times?",
