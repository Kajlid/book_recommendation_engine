  "description": "A summer romance with the football hero she's always loved . . . but what happens when the summer fades?  From RITA & Christy award-winning novelist Susan May Warren comes the prequel novella to her best-selling Christiansen family series.  \nAbout the book . . .\n Just because handsome, small town football hero John Christiansen is in love with her big sister doesn't meant he isn't meant to marry Ingrid. At least that's the hope Ingrid is clinging to as the annual Deep Haven fisherman's picnic street dance arrives. Ingrid knows that eventually her sister will break his heart--and she'll be there to pick up the pieces.  John has no interest in the kid sister of one of the cutest annual tourists--and this year, he has big plans to impress, and woo, the girl he's thought about all year.  Except, life doesn't quite turn out as planned, and thus begins an odyssey of seven summers of unexpected summer romance. But what happens when the summer fades? Just how long should someone wait for the perfect love?",
