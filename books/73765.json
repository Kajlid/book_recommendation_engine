The next thing she knows she’s neck deep in a Vampire—Yes, Vampire!—family feud where one side is trying to kill her and the other, led by Virgil—Mr. tall, dark, and irresistible— wants to turn her! What’s a girl to do, other than have a panic attack and head for the hills?The connection was instant. From the moment her thoughts entered his mind and his eyes locked onto hers, Virgil Hart knew he would never be able to be rid of her. And he didn’t want to. Elizabeth’s presence had awakened within him unfamiliar feelings. Was it love? Was it lust? Or could loneliness finally driven him mad? Whatever the reason, Virgil won’t stand by and let Elizabeth be killed by his brother. Now, if she would just calm down long enough to let him protect her everything would go much smoother!",
