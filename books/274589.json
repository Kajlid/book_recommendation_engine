  "description": "When the Roman god of wine and frenzies claims you as his own, things get chaotic. Fast.  Ever since archaeology student Serafina Finch found an ancient Roman amulet on a dig in Italy, she's been having dreams. Strange dreams that leave her with an eerie sense of foreboding. But between a busy college schedule and a boyfriend she's hoping to marry, she doesn't have time for strange.  When a mysterious cult takes an obsessive interest in the artifact, Serafina finds her life in chaos. She's thrown into a supernatural world, where Immortals and witches alike claim ownership of the amulet. Her amulet.  As her connection to the amulet grows, she discovers a dark secret about her past. Serafina realizes she must protect the powerful relic at all costs--even if it means losing one of the people she loves most.  “Invisible. Powerful. Immortal. We are Bacchae.”  BIRTH OF THE BACCHAE is the first book in the IMMORTAL RELICS urban fantasy series. Fans of Deborah Harkness, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Roman mythology will love this blend of magic, mayhem, and wry humor.",
