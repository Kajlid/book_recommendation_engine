  "description": "Marguerite Yourcenar is one of the great figures of modern French letters. In 1980, she became the first woman ever to be elected to the French Academy. The appearance in English for the first time of Yourcenar's novel, A Coin in Nine Hands, reminds us once again of how brilliant French prose can be.The main story of A Coin in Nine Hands is the half-realistic, half-symbolic account of an attempt to assassinate Mussolini in the eleventh year of the Fascist dictatorship in Italy. Around this core, Yourcenar groups a series of secondary stories — portraits of Roman life out of commedia or rather tragedia dell'arte. The coin of the title is a link between the characters as it passes from one to the other.Yourcenar's Rome, brilliantly evoked, is both the Rome of Fascism and the great city of life and of the imagination. A Coin in Nine Hands was the first literary work from France and one of the first from anywhere to confront the reality of Fascism. Written originally in 1934 and revised completely in 1959, the book is one of Yourcenar's major works. It is a novel of heroism; it is, as always with Yourcenar, a meditation on love; it is a profound examination of political evil — a question perhaps even more relevant to our own time than to the period portrayed in A Coin in Nine Hands.",
