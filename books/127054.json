  "title": "The Jewish Neighbor",
  "description": "When Umayma Yaghshi accepts an arranged marriage to a Syrian exile in London to escape the horrors of the civil war ravaging her country, she had no idea what she was getting herself into. Shackled to a man who treats her like a slave and only gets off sexually when he rapes her, she finds kindness from the most unexpected person, Felix, her Jewish neighbor. But her hard-coded preconceived notions of Jews as the enemy makes it impossible for her to accept Felix's tenderness, even suspecting his very motives. Will Umayma break out of her mental and physical shackles to find love and freedom, or is she destined for a tragic end? The Jewish Neighbor is a moving, timely, and controversial tale of what happens when intolerance, hatred, and abuse face off against acceptance, love and emancipation.",
