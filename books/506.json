  "description": "Have you ever imagined what it would be like to think you were the last person alive on Earth? Or what you might face when you realised that you werenâ€™t? What would you do, in a world devoid of everyone and every convention you have known, but surrounded by more riches than you could ever have wanted? Then add in the bodies of all those who have died. Are you in a vast warehouse of free shopping, or the vilest mortuary in the universe? Could you survive? Would you want to? Read on for the story of some who decided to live. And imagine yourself there. There Falls No Shadow is the story of a group of survivors struggling to rebuild their lives after a terrorist released plague mutates and decimates the world's population. Although each novel is complete in its own right, TFNS is the first book of a trilogy which follows the main characters from the first days of the plague to a stunning conclusion some years later. Live with them as they fight fear, disease, hunger, feral animals and one another. Feel the elation and devastation as they find and lose friends and lovers, face storms and fire, see their crops grow and fail. There have been disaster novels before. There has never been one so believable, nor so timely.",
