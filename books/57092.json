  "description": "OUT OF PRINTMisanthropes and misfits. Society’s loners observing, and in some cases, changing the status quo. An agoraphobic woman is forced to face a ruined world after months of isolation. A father faces the death of a child in a world where genetic perfection has done away with such traumas. A lovelorn man searches for the perfect woman and, ultimately, finds himself. A nameless drifter absorbs people’s pain, the filth rotting their souls, until one day he can no longer bear this burden alone. In these and many more stories, Glen Krisch crosses genres, disrupts and disfigures them, until something entirely its own rises from this alchemical brew.",
