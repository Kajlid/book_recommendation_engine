  "title": "The Measure of Our Days: A Spiritual Exploration of Illness",
  "description": "With The Measure of Our Days, Dr. Jerome Groopman established himself as an eloquent new voice in the literature of medicine. In these eight moving portraits, he offers us a compelling look at what is to be learned when life itself can no longer be taken for granted. These stories are diverse--from Kirk, an aggressive venture capitalist determined to play the odds with controversial chemotherapy treatments; to Elizabeth, an imperious dowager humbled by a rare blood disease; to Elliott, who triumphs over leukemia and creates for himself a definition of success--but each, in the words of Maggie Scarf, \"transmute the misery of terrible suffering into a marvelous celebration of the sweetness of human life.\" Far from medical case studies, these are spiritual journeys of questioning and self-awareness, embarked on by the physician as well as the patient.",
