  "description": "From Mumbai and Lahore to the Highveld of the Transvaal and in his native Wales, Alan Wilkins is internationally known and admired as an accomplished sports broadcaster. Growing up as a talented young cricketer in 1970s Cardiff, Alan dreamt of a life in sport and yearned to travel the world but, as he reveals in Easier Said Than Done, he could never have imagined he would realise his dream via a microphone and camera rather than with a bat and a ball.With great humility and humour, Alan Wilkins tells the fascinating story of how he swapped the life of a sports teacher for a career as a professional cricketer with Glamorgan and Gloucestershire – taking over 370 wickets and playing in the 1977 Gillette Cup final – and how it was brought to a devastating end in 1983 by a debilitating shoulder injury.Determined that his Life in Sport would not end after his enforced retirement from cricket, Alan vividly describes how, with determination and enthusiasm, he embarked on a new and successful career in sports broadcasting which has seen him commentate on many of the world’s greatest sporting occasions – from Wimbledon to The Masters and from the Rugby World Cup to the Indian Premier League and Pakistan Super League – and how he has forged lifelong friendships with many legends of the sporting world.Millions of sports fans know Alan Wilkins the broadcaster but now, with Easier Said Than Done, they can get to know the man behind the microphone and the absorbing story of his Life in Sport.",
