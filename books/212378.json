  "description": "He'd lived a thousand years for this? It's enough to make a vampire want to rush outside to soak up some rays, order garlic mashed potatoes, or fall on a wooden stake. The council, in its infinite stupidity, has made Reinn Mackenzie the Guardian of the Blood for his vampire clan. Talk about crappy jobs. He's supposed to run around lopping off the head of any Mackenzie dumb enough to mate with someone not on the council's approved list. Gotta keep the Mackenzie blood pure. Giant whoop. He's nothing but a glorified Weedwacker for the clan. So he's stuck at the Woo Woo Inn, skulking undercover while he looks for the right moment to off the clueless Mackenzie about to marry a sneaky, manipulating werecat. Reinn doesn't get it. Who'd be stupid enough to die for a deceitful, whisker-twitching shifter? Kisa Evans has a boatload of problems. She's a virgin, someone is stalking her with the intent to keep her in cat form forever, she's a virgin, the deadly Guardian of the Blood is out to murder her sister's fianc√©, and she's a virgin. Werecat law says that she can't mate with any male weaker than herself. Hello? She's not your usual lap kitty. There IS no male stronger than Kisa. But minds were meant to be changed. When Reinn meets Kisa, he realizes that his sexy werecat is worth dying for. Kisa finally finds a male stronger than she is and admits that the enemy has become her love. Too bad that love can't erase the dangers surrounding them. A happily ever after doesn't seem likely for Reinn and Kisa, but not to worry. Strange things are the norm at the Woo Woo Inn.",
