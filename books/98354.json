  "description": "The old stories of the first dragon riders are forgotten and lost, but the excitement remains. Andra has waited her entire life for the moment when the orb would call her name, but that is only the beginning. Entering the Vetaunex is dangerous, even for the most courageous man. It’s a land where the wild dragons soar through the sky and the only way out is to become a rider—or die. Even when the Aquastrian leader wants her dead, she fights back. Andra is prepared, but can she overcome traveling hundreds of miles on foot, surviving hunger, assassins and wild carnivores?Between two countries, allies are hard to find, and enemies are everywhere. Liam takes the journey to the Vetaunex, leaving behind the only family he has left on a chance to change their way of life. Becoming a dragon rider is more than a title to him, it’s a way to stop the war and save lives. Meeting Andra along the way, he has to decide what must come first; his dragon, or helping the daughter of the rival country’s leader. In the end, Liam fights to help her and kills to protect her, but will it be enough to get them both to their dragons before it's too late?",
