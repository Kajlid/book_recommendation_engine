  "description": "McCullough's graduation speech \"You Are Not Special\" struck a cultural nerve and instantly went viral. Children today, says David McCullough, are being encouraged to sacrifice passionate engagement with life for specious notions of success. The intense pressure to excel discourages kids from taking chances, failing, and learning empathy and self-confidence from those failures. In \"You Are Not Special\" McCullough elaborates on exploring how, for what purpose, and for whose sake, we're raising our kids. By acknowledging that the world is indifferent to them, McCullough takes pressure off of students to be extraordinary achievers and instead exhorts them to roll up their sleeves and do something useful with their advantages. The YouTube video of his speech has been seen by more than two million viewers and counting.",
