  "title": "Created In Fire",
  "description": "Despite a dating past littered with the broken hearts of women they both knew and worked with, all 34 yr old Michael Larson sincerely wants is to marry Carrie Larson, the mother of his future child, and love them both forever. Even though he truly wants the baby they created in the fire between them, Michael really doesn’t care how or why Carrie is now in his life and his bed. His sole focus is how to keep her there no matter what it takes. He definitely doesn’t have any intentions of honoring the prenuptial agreement with the divorce clause she’d insisted on. Michael won’t—can’t—let her go. He’ll never survive if he loses the only chance with Carrie she’s ever given him.",
