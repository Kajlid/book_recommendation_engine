Suddenly his life is shattered again when a chance discovery propels him into a world gone horribly, terrifyingly wrong.Piecing together clues in this new nightmare, Alex suspects a colleague of taking a few, meddling steps back in time, changing the course of history - destroying Alex's family and his world. Desperately clinging to his sanity, he searches for any evidence his young son still exists.Jessica O'Neil is fighting a nightmare of her own, captured and facing execution for freedom-fighting heroics in her grim, oppressive world. When Alex rescues the feisty young rebel, she resists her dangerous attraction to him - a man who's clearly crazy, literally in a world of his own.Bound together first by chance and desperation, then by growing purpose, respect, and emotion, Alex and Jessie must depend on each other to survive. More than that, they must find a way to prevent a terrible crime from taking place - a crime that plunged both their worlds into nightmare - over a hundred years before. To have a future, they will have to find their way to the past.TIMELAPSE is a winning MEDALIST in the 2014 READERS' FAVORITE BOOK AWARDS.",
