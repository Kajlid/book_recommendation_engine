  "description": "Blake was never one for taking chances. He lived in a world of statistics and probabilities where everything could be controlled. That world disappeared the day the dead got up and began attacking the living. Now he must struggle to survive and to make sense of a new and chaotic world that is quickly spiraling out of control. Rise of the Dead chronicles the first week of events beginning from the moment the dead rise. While the story is a fast-paced thrill ride through an ever-growing zombie horde, the novel aims to draw upon familiar themes as those found in the Romero classics. Along the way, Blake finds himself thrust among other unlikely survivors who must adapt to the realities of the undead world or join the legion of zombies. They must do more than fight off the undead. The survivors must fight against their conditioned apathy towards humanity.",
