From the mind of Mike Richardson, creator of The Mask and The Secret, comes this hilariously frightening tale of Straw and Whip who have lived through a plague that's left the world with seven billion brain-hungry zombies. Soon the two friends save a lovely young gun-crazy woman named Betty, who becomes a source of rivalry between them. With hundreds of zombies out for a snack, the three try their best to blend in so as not become the next item on the menu.",
