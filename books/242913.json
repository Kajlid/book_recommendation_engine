When her son is presented with the chance of exceptional care in her final months, he finds the offer hard to resist.Winifred is assigned to Margaret’s care. She’s a a new kind of carer that’s capable, committed and completely tireless – because she’s a synthetic human being.Under Winifred’s care Margaret’s health improves beyond everyone’s expectations, and Winifred begins to learn from Margaret what it means to be alive. After all, she has a lifetime of experience to pass on – and in a world where youth is the ultimate prize, perhaps it takes a robot to recognise the value of old age.But how will Winifred use what she learns from Margaret – and what does she truly want from her?",
