McKenna may have left me and this town behind a decade ago, but a century wouldn’t be long enough to get over her.There’s only one thing worse than never seeing her again. If she came back, the secret I’ve been keeping would destroy lives. Mine included. As long as she stays gone, everyone is safe.McKennaWhen my world catches fire, destroying the dreams I’ve sacrificed so much for, there’s only one place I can think to go. One man I can run to.
