  "title": "Surrounded by Love: A Story of Orphans and Family",
  "description": "Born in 1930, at the beginning of The Great Depression, identical twins Marge and Marie weighed just a tad more than two pounds each. Left on steps of the local hospital by a family unable to care for them, they entered foster care and, later, an orphanage, but still managed to live lives surrounded by love and family. A heartwarming memoir of love, life, family, and faith. If you liked this book, consider Father's Day (or Father's Day, The Deluxe 3-Pack Edition), by Donald J. Bingle.",
