Tae Rames, a precocious seventeen year old downloads a vid she knows she shouldn’t, and her life is changed for-ever. She discovers that the dead god Loki may not be dead at all, just trapped. She quickly realizes that someone very powerful has gone to a great deal of trouble to keep this secret. She tries to erase the evidence of her snooping but is found out; unfortunately her new enemies mistakenly blame her twin brother and kidnap both him and her mother. Not knowing who she can trust, she decides her only option is to free Loki and plead for his help. The problem is that Loki is in the one place no-one ever wants to go –The Island.  It is a place where all of Earths criminals are sent to fight and die, a place from which there is no escape. To add to her woes, unbeknownst to her, an enemy with a twisted hatred of his own has started to stalk her. Even Zeus himself has decided to come and investigate, to find out just what’s going on down on the troublesome planet, Earth.",
