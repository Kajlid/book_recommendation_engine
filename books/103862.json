  "description": "Teacher Logan Du Rose has won Hana's heart and persuaded her to marry him in a secret ceremony, which she must now try and justify to her family and friends. But life becomes increasingly difficult for the fledgling marriage as Hana makes dreadful discoveries about the complicated Du Rose family dynamic, which is plagued by feuding and violence. Her husband is not just an ordinary English teacher but as he drops his guard, displays dangerous traits that his new wife is not sure she can live with. Hana's adult children are hiding secrets of their own, which will have far reaching ramifications and her policeman son seems determined to discredit Logan. The men pursuing Hana are getting closer, their threats leading to kidnap and violence to get what they want and it seems that nowhere is safe. School has become increasingly unpleasant as 'someone' is watching Hana and passing information back to her attackers. Hana must discover which of her friends is really her enemy. The continuing presence of Logan's ex fianc√© at work makes life almost intolerable, especially as Caroline claims to be pregnant with Logan's child. But Hana makes an incredible discovery about her own situation, which will change her life forever.",
