  "description": "Librarian's note: this entry relates to the collection of short stories under the title of \"For Your Eyes Only.\" The individual stories can be found elsewhere.Now this sounds interesting: \"Bond watched her as she reached the edge of the tables and came up the aisle. It was hopeless. She was coming to meet someone—her lover. She was the sort of woman who always belongs to somebody else. What damnable luck! Before Bond could pull himself together, the girl had come up to his table and sat down. ‘I’m sorry I’m late. We’ve got to get moving at once. You’re wanted at the office.’ She added under her breath: ‘Crash dive.\"Here we find sudden emergencies and beautiful girls who aren’t quite what they seem - the stock-in-trade of James Bond. When 007 is on the case there’s only one thing you can be sure of, that the result will be thrilling. Whether he’s dealing with the assassination of a Cuban thug in America, the destruction of an international heroin ring, or sudden death in the Seychelles, Bond gets the job done. In his own suave and unmistakable style!The stories are: 1. \"From a View to a Kill;\" 2. \"For Your Eyes Only;\" 3. \"Quantum of Solace;\" 4. \"Risico;\" and 5. \"The Hildebrand Rarity.\"",
