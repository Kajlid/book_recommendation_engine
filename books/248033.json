  "description": "Excerpt from Taking the Bastille, Vol. 1Let us add, to complete the poetical reputation of this little city, whose detractors, notwithstanding its royal chateau and its two thousand four hundred inhabitants, obstinately persist in calling it a mere village - let us add, we say, to complete its poetical reputation, that it is situated at two leagues' distance from laferte-milan, where Racine was born, and eight leagues from chateau-thierry, the birthplace of La Fontaine. Let us also state the mother of the author of Britannicus and Athalie was from villers-cotterets.But now we must return to its royal chateau and its two thousand four hundred inhabitants.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
