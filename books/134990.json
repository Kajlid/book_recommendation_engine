  "description": "It was the worst summer of Carrie Hauser’s life, and the it was the summer her parents announced they were getting divorced, and when a dying alien passed on to her his fantastic superhuman abilities. All Carrie wants now is to settle into her new home in Kingsport and get her life back to something resembling normal – but that won’t be easy when her secret is discovered by a group of teenage super-hero wannabes, who need her help to discover why experimental military drones have been wreaking havoc in town. Their search leads the fledgling super-team to Archimedes, an artificial intelligence that will do anything to escape its virtual reality prison and enter the real world. However, the kids aren't the only ones with an interest in Archimedes, and the super-teens soon find themselves caught in the middle of a longstanding feud between Concorde, Kingsport’s high-flying hometown hero, and his nemesis, the deadly mercenary Manticore. Save the day? Sure…as soon as school lets out.",
