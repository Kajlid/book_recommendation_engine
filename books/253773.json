No second dates. No falling in love. Her rules protect her still-healing heart and leave Josie free to chase her true love: the electric nights of Los Angeles. But when she arrives in funky, bohemian Big Sur for a photo shoot, those rules are no match for the small town’s sexy bar owner.Gabe Shaw has a good life in Big Sur. Surrounded by family and friends, he’s the third-generation-owner of The Bar, the only place where quirky locals can escape the tourists and drink in peace. He’s in love with his hometown and its verdant beauty, but he still yearns for one thing: his soul mate.After one night of searing passion, Josie intends to run... like she always does. But a storm as strong as their attraction unleashes on Big Sur, leaving her trapped. Gabe has the funniest feeling he’s found what he was missing. But it’s only been a week – and the last person that made Josie feel this much destroyed her world.She can’t—she won’t—make the sacrifices Gabe is asking her to make.",
