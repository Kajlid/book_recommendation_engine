  "description": "What makes me able to write this book?At nine years old I was sexually abused and forced to live my life as if nothing ever happened. I was afraid, ashamed, and confused. I thought a mother多s job was to protect her children, but my mother took part in the abuse. Through it I learned how to pray. I asked God for help. Then I began writing about the abuse and I promised myself that when I became a mother that my children would never know such sickness. I vowed to make a difference in every life that I came in contact with.Personal years ago I took a look at myself. I wanted to be a better person, I was known as being mean. I had no patience for much of anything. I know now that it was due to all that I went through as a child. I wasn多t happy. I was use to doing what needed to be done like a mother taking care of her children, homework, cooking, keeping the kids safe and showing them that life has many things to offer. Never allowing Sabrina to be Sabrina. I was lost I didn多t know who Sabrina was. I took care of my three younger siblings as if I was their mother, then at sixteen years old I had my own child the first of my five children. I just wanted to be whole and true to myself and be able to help anyone I could. I knew I had something to give but I needed to be complete from within and I多ve reached that point. Writing Only the Strong Survive has helped me in many ways and I want to help as many people as I can to understand that they are not alone.",
