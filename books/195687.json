  "description": "Molly Anderson just found out her dad is getting married to a woman she’s only met once.  Fourteen-year-old Molly had planned to spend the summer before high school reading books, eating junk food, and napping. Instead, she’s forced to spend her days juggling four new family members, a grumpy older brother, a crazy grandmother, and Max, the new boy next door. Having lost her mother in a car accident a year before, she’s not sure how many more changes she can take before she hits her breaking point.  The Trouble with Family tells the tale of a girl trying to make the most of her summer, not just survive it.",
