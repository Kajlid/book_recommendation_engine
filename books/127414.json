  "description": "“The first great Saudi novel.” — The New York Sun Banned in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, this provocative, fast-paced debut novel confirms what The Washington Post  reported about its award-winning \"Yousef Al-Mohaimeed is taking on some of the most divisive subjects in the Arab world . . . in a lush style that evokes Gabriel García Márquez.\" In a Riyadh bus station, a man comes across a file containing official reports about an abandoned baby. As he pieces together the shattered life documented within, a larger picture emerges of three outsiders—a Bedouin, an orphan, and a eunuch-linked by fate and trying to make lives for themselves in a predatory city.Unfolding with the intensity of a fever dream over the course of one night,  Wolves of the Crescent Moon  is a novel of astonishing power and great moral consequence about a deeply traditional society confronting the modern world.",
