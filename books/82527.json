  "description": "Poet Michelle Hartman pokes society in the eye with a sharp wit. This is not your mama's poetry. There is no stocking too blue, no blood too thick, no cow too sacred to escape revelation in Michelle's own inimitable style. From the rhapsodic \"Snow Project\" to the ribald \"Grandmother's Got Game,\" Michelle exposes all our foibles with penetrating precision. Her poetry will make you giggle, will make you gasp, may even make you gnash your teeth. What it will never do is leave you unmoved.",
