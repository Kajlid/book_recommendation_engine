It's your money. You don't have to do what everyone else does. Why not Think For Yourself and choose your own course?  This book will give you a real world understanding of money. Some people call it \"street smart\". Whatever you call it, you will make better decisions because reality makes a better foundation.  For example; When did qualifying for a mortgage become the guide for buying a house? That's just stupid... read our book and you'll know the reality.  How about budgeting? Expense tracking sounds smart and the apps are easy to write, so you get plenty of advice to do it. But wouldn't you rather budget simply and effectively?
