  "description": "The fourth book in Blue Moon House series by Angelica DawsonHow does a slave become an equal? What does it take for a young man to see women in a new light?Will has no interest in women. He thinks them all animals to be trained, beaten. It doesn't take him long to discover his preference for men, but time and error reveal how wrong his view toward women is. Before long, he is able to separate the way he treats women, which is still horrific, from the way he regards women, as fellow human beings.*Trigger This book contains racial slurs and one man's misogynistic ways and errors in judgement until he learns a valuable lesson. This treatment is not intended for the purpose of titillation and does not in any way reflect the author's or publisher's beliefs of the appropriate treatment of any woman or human being. The information is, however, necessary to portray the moral behind this story, the lessons learned, and the appropriate use of SSC within BDSM.*",
