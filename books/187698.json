  "description": "He's the hotheaded one of the bunch, the one who has sworn off hearth and home because of the life that shaped him long ago, before he even had a chance. His brothers were all settling down with their happily after bullshit, not Ty. He was going to be the last man standing; or so he thought. She'd been giving him the look for a while but he'd been able to withstand her and the feelings she awakened in him. He knew that because of his past he could be a danger to her, but then something happened, something that will throw them together in a way that would leave him no choice but to take her to his bed whether he wanted to or not.",
