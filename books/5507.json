  "description": "Eat Wisely and Well\n The teachings of yoga advocate a vegetarian diet, with special emphasis on foods that bring peace to body, mind, and spirit. The Yoga Cookbook contains more than 170 recipes prepared under the guidance of the world-renowned Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers. Illustrated with more than sixty beautiful color photographs, these delicious, easy-to-prepare recipes have an international flavor. Begin the day with Citrus Slices with Pomegranate Seeds and Carrot and Molasses Muffins. Savor Vegetable Ragout over brown rice, and still have room for a square of Gingerbread with Orange Butter Frosting. Serve Cinnamon Beans along with Herbed Polenta with Corn for an Italian-inspired feast. Treat yourself and those you love to Raisin Nut Balls, Banana-Nut Tart, or Chocolate Truffles. All are prepared with wholesome ingredients that increase vitality, energy, health, and joy.  Containing wheat-free recipes, guidance for vegans, and advice on buying, storing, and preparing the basic ingredients used in yogic cooking, and with special sections on feasts and fasts, The Yoga Cookbook brings this soul-satisfying, healing diet to experienced yoga students and beginners alike.",
