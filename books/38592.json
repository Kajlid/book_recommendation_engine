  "title": "The Adventures of Sir Balin the Ill-Fated",
  "description": "Many years ago, the storytellers say, the great King Arthur brought justice to England with the help of his gallant knights of the roundtable.      While most of King Arthur’s knights freely chose a life of duty, for Sir Balin the Ill-Fated, destiny was foretold in a prophecy. And seriously, \"ill-fated\" is right there in his title, so Balin’s not surprised when things go sour. Still, no matter how dire the task, a loyal and gallant knight never refuses adventure!      Will Sir Balin finally discover his true destiny? And which ill-fated path will he have to choose? Join Balin on this, the noblest quest of all.",
