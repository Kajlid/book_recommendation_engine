  "description": "Edgar looked at him, his face shone with expectation…“Really? What is it?”Lou grabbed his suitcase and laid it down on the ground in front of him. There was a clinking sound as Lou rummaged through it. After a few seconds he exclaimed, “Aha! Here it is!” With that he pulled out a small bottle about three inches tall and held it up for Edgar to see. The bottle was dark blue with a tiny cork stopper and two little words that read, “Lying Potion.”When nine-year-old Edgar meets a mysterious stranger on the way to school he receives an unusual gift, Lying Potion. What will happen when Edgar uses this gift to his own advantage? Will it turn out to be a blessing or a curse? In this first installment in the Edgar series, join Edgar as he learns about friendship, faith, and forgiveness.All proceeds from the sale of this book will go to help support Harmony Outreach. www.harmonyoutreach.org",
