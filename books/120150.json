  "title": "Calizona: This ain't yer Daddy's apocalypse",
  "description": "Best friends since kindergarten, survivalists Alex and Mickey take prepping to a new level when they win the biggest lottery in history. Sparing no expense, they build the ultimate subterranean bunker complex. With dreams of surviving the apocalypse in comfort and luxury, they stockpile their fortress with plenty of weed, women, and song. No expense is spared, no scenario is overlooked. But when a meteorite erases Mexico and covers Arizona with a massive debris field, Alex and Mickey soon discover that being kings of the apocalypse is not nearly as much fun as they had envisioned, and certainly a lot more work than they had signed up for. Calizona is humorously crafted as a historical mocumentary told a hundred years after the rebirth of civilization. Images of this bleak world are revealed through personal journals, video logs, surveillance footage, and a little editorial assistance from the lead archeologist who has transcribed the tale. At 255,000 words, this is an immersive world, engineered to appeal to a variety of adult readers who have grown up in a world of reality TV.",
