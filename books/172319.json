  "title": "Forging Divinity",
  "description": "Forging Divinity is an epic fantasy with a strong emphasis on intelligent characters, political schemes, and well-developed magic systems. If you enjoy reading about characters that try to use their abilities cleverly to solve problems, you'll probably enjoy the book. If you prefer stories where magic remains more mystical and vague, it probably wouldn't be to your tastes.Here's a quick blurb:Some say that in the city of Orlyn, godhood is on sale to the highest bidder. Thousands flock to the city each year, hoping for a chance at immortality. Lydia Hastings is a knowledge sorcerer, capable of extracting information from anything she touches. When she travels to Orlyn to validate the claims of the local faith, she discovers a conspiracy that could lead to a war between the world's three greatest powers. At the focal point is a prisoner who bears a striking resemblance to the long-missing leader of the pantheon she worships. Rescuing the prisoner would require risking her carefully cultivated cover - but his execution could mean the end of everything Lydia holds dear.",
