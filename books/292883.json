  "description": "I’ve experienced the ways love can change a poor man into a rich one, a sinner to a saint, and make people beg for redemption.Yet nothing I’d ever done was as profound as marrying the woman I love. Every mission I took was a risk worth taking knowing I'd go home to her loving arms.What I didn’t know was in my quest to right all the wrongs of the world, I was destroying the only part of it I’d die for - my marriage. The ripple effect of miscommunication and the sin of my omissions would change all of our lives.And it would be my wife who would pay the price.",
