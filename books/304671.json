Butt heads with him all day every day as I try to educate him on selling women's underwear, that's what. He's opinionated, blunt, and... Sigh. It's no use. He's amazing. Especially when his beautiful brown eyes glint at me from behind those nerdy glassesâ€”sending messages that both confuse and captivate me.Well, Adam had better fortify those walls he keeps putting up because I've always been the type to go after what I want. And my sights are set on his heart.Get ready to laugh and flutter and possibly even squeal a little. This is Angela's story and things are about to get fun. Don't hesitate. Grab your copy now.",
