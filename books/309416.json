  "description": "The small town of Dunnville is no stranger to fear. Evil has stalked its dark streets once before, twenty years ago, leaving in its wake a legacy of blood and madness. These days, no one in the town likes to talk about it much. Some folks deny it ever happened....But four boyhood friends are about to discover the truth, though no one will believe them. Their parents think they've been listening to too many scary stories. But what the boys have released from an icy well is no legend. It's very real indeed, and it will soon terrify Dunnville to its very core. Unspeakable horror is running free... And the nightmares of the past are about to begin again.",
