  "description": "For the 1st time ever, Contemporary Krampus gathers more than fifty diverse artists from around the globe to create new images of Krampus. From renowned artists like Angus Oblong to up and comers like Minjoon Kim, each image has been hand selected by curator of curiosities and Krampus aficionado Mike Drake. Behold the wages of sin as naughty and misbehaving children are beaten, shackled, and shoved into Krampus' basket to be carried off.. Gather your gingerbread, sharpen a candy cane, secure the windows, bolt the door, Boil the cocoa, summon all your courage, and let the artists of Contemporary Krampus show you what lurks in the shadows on cold winter nights.",
