  "description": "Meet jobbing actor Jonathan Stapleton - failed husband, slightly better father, with no ambition and in his own eyes only a modicum of acting ability; he doesn't need complications in his life, but that's exactly what he gets with Callum Henley - younger, talented, exasperatingly impulsive, and for some reason completely crazy about him. How can they hope to succeed as a couple when one is heading for fame and fortune at the very top of his profession ... and the other one prefers to stay at home?",
