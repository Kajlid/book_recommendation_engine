  "description": "Sometimes a gal’s gotta admit defeat and decide how many cats she’s gonna have when she’s old and crazy…Chloe Hall has tried every dating website out there and continues to connect with duds. Then her mother signs her up for a new dating—mating—service. Human or shifter, everyone is welcome as long as they’re looking for love and not their next bang. Chloe doesn’t care if her mate roars and sheds or howls and smells like wet dog. He’ll be hers. It’s not until she meets Holt—a massive, muscular, totally gorgeous werecougar—that she realizes she really will become a cat lady, and he absolutely drives her crazy.Werecougar Holt Moore’s animal is restless and craves things that scare the shit outta him: a mate, cubs, and a white picket fence. It doesn’t seem to remember that cougars are solitary animals in the wild, which also applies to his human half. His cat is too dominant to tolerate other shifters and when he’s on two legs, he towers over every human he meets. He’s big and mean and that’s how he likes it. Then he meets Chloe—curvy, luscious, human Chloe—and realizes he needs to add “possessive” and “biggest asshole on the planet” to his list of traits. Well, not all relationships are smooth sailing.",
