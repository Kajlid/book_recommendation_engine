  "description": "Mister Marmee is a Victorian gentlecat, not a detective, or so he thinks. Everything changes whenÂ he takes up residence with Stephen Hanover, London's premier doctor of veterinary medicine, and his vivacious dachshund detective, Sir Happy Heart, in their London home, Hanover Place. With a nose for finding and following clues, the tenacious canine soon begins to teach his feline friend the tricks of the investigative trade.Within short order, Mister Marmee finds himself whiskers-deep in one of the most perplexing and brutal crime sprees London has ever seen. Mister Marmee and Sir Happy are inadvertently drawn into the fray by the charming but bewildered Hyrum Farley of Scotland Yard, as case after case is brought to Doctor Hanover for his expert evaluation. The four-legged duo very quickly find themselves following the trail of a lifetime as they endeavor to track down a killer canine before it strikes again. From the slums of Cheapside and the dogfighting rings of the warehouse district, to the sleepy manors of the British countryside, onto the very doorstep of Hanover Place itself, it is a race against the clock and time is running out!",
