  "description": "The Floating Order is a unique and innovative collection of stories. Erin Pringle's world is filled with the dreamlike, nightmarish narratives of children: children in danger, children at the mercy of their parents, children in all kinds of trouble. Children who continually rise, return, and haunt the pages. \"Erin Pringle's stories are true wonders - a beautiful mix of intimate feeling, thick syntax, and dangerous language.\" Michael Kimball",
