  "title": "Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers",
  "description": "This is the first comprehensive critical edition of the unpublished writings of Pulitzer Prize-winning objectivist poet George Oppen (1908-1984). Editor Stephen Cope has made a judicious selection of Oppen's extant writings outside of poetry, including the essay \"The Mind's Own Place\" as well as \"Twenty-Six Fragments,\" which were found on the wall of Oppen's study after his death. Most notable are Oppen's \"Daybooks,\" composed in the decade following his return to poetry in 1958. iSelected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers is an inspiring portrait of this essential writer and a testament to the creative process itself.",
