  "description": "Keeper: Exiled Guardians MC 5 An Alpha Older Man, Younger Curvy Woman Romance  Lilly I found my brother, the President of the Exiled Guardians when I was eighteen. He wanted me safe and sent me away to college. But now I’m back… and the one man I’ve thought about all these years is still here and I’m pretty sure he’s been waiting for me.  Keeper She’s the Exiled Guardian’s President’s younger sister. She’s forbidden… to me and every other brother in the club. I thought I could fight temptation, especially when she’s sent away. But when she comes back, older and even more beautiful than before, all bets are off.  Dear Reader, I love to read MC romances. I’ve just always enjoyed reading about the tightness of the MC brothers and the way they love their women. I love it so much that I have always wanted to write one. However, being a short story romance author, it seemed impossible to build an in-depth storyline like most MC romance series, but I wanted to give it a try. Therefore, I present to you my version of an MC romance. I’m borrowing the term MC Lite from Frankie Love. It is heavy on the motorcycle club sense of family, it has lots of alpha men and the curvy women that love them. However, it is a little lite on the drama and most violence is handled off-page. I sincerely hope you like it. XX, Hope  This is a Steamy, Sweet, Short Story Romance. No Cliffhangers. This is the fifth story in the Exiled Guardians MC Series. If you love short romances with insta love, hot love scenes, and a sweet story, then this one is for you.",
