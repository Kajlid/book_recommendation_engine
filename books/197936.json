  "title": "You Say You Want a Revolution: Rock Music in American Culture",
  "description": "What does it all mean, this thing called \"rock and roll\"? This is different from asking what happened, and who did what. A lot books have dealt with these questions. The meaning of rock music in American Culture is another matter entirely. From its roots in the black and white \"under-classes,\" through its clash with the established culture and the inevitable backlash, to its multi-faceted incarnation today, rock and roll has both fostered and reflected a genuine cultural revolution which has gone on to influence the world. Looking at this phenomenon is what distinguishes You Say You Want a Revolution from all the others. Specifically, during the brief history of rock music, American culture has undergone a period of continuous turbulence, with the fundamental values pertaining to race, sex, work and authority undergoing challenge and change. You Say You Want a Revolution examines the interplay in this period between the larger American culture and this musical phenomenon that has become so much a part of it. One Reviewer notes: \"This is one of the most accurate and significant books ever written describing the impact of rock 'n' roll as a cultural form that worked to transform American culture.\" [Richard Koenigsberg, Ph. D. New York]",
