If they're not getting at her about her embarrassing home-made clothes or her good grades at school, it's about her dark, black skin - a deeper shade than any of theirs. When a new teacher, whose face is blotched with a startling white patch, starts at their school, Maleeka can see there is bound to be trouble for her too. But the new teacher's attitude surprises Maleeka. Miss Saunders loves the skin she's in. Can Maleeka too? A deeply involving novel that will draw readers into Maleeka's world and let them see it through her eyes.",
