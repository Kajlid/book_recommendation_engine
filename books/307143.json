  "description": "Bluebeard's naive bride is only a cover for his truly brutal fetishes. Rapunzel is the unbalanced spawn of an opium-addicted mother. The Wolf is the least of Red Riding Hood's problems. Meet Sleeping Beauty's twin henchman sons. A product of incest when her own half brother comes upon her helplessly passed out in a coma and takes advantage. Discover the real price Rumpelstiltskin charges for spinning straw into gold.If you enjoy dark humor with your incest, torture, cannibalism, dismemberment, and other medieval pastimes you've come to the right place. These are extremely gruesome adult retellings of classic fairy tales more than just fractured. These stories are deeply dark with twisted sexual encounters and the women in these fairy tales are not the tenderhearted pushovers as in modern-day fairy tales.So come down to the dungeon, settle onto your Judas cradles and break out your heretic forks. A delectable feast for true horror fairy tale fans. This book will haunt your dreams if not give you vivid nightmares. Each story and many characters are tied together all into one dysfunctional kingdom with a viciously abusive king and many murderous, lascivious and just plain monstrously evil people. This book includes Bluebeard, Rumpelstiltskin, Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Hansel and Gretel and more. A wicked read",
