  "description": "The tides are changing in Withernsea.  Shelley's adoptive parents make waves after they catch their daughter, Polly, with Drake Lord, a royal of the sea.  Holding Shelley responsible for the supernatural world invading their lives once more, they demand she splits them up or else theyâ€™ll expose the supernaturals of Withernsea to the rest of the world.  The residents of the sea aren't keen on a human dating their royal either, especially a sea nymph intent on hooking Drake for herself.  Can Shelley intervene so that Polly and Drake can make love, not war?",
