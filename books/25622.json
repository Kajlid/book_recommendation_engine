  "description": "“Smart, sly and compelling, with a fascinating main character—the very definition of intelligent suspense.” —Lee Child Francis Hoyt, a daunting career criminal, is on the loose. Having masterfully escaped from his court appearance, Hoyt, now a fugitive, relocates to the West Coast to lick his wounds. Meanwhile, former newspaper journalist Dakota Richards embarks on her passion project: a true crime podcast. A year into her new career, she takes a deep dive into the life of the elusive Francis Hoyt. Hoyt, arrogant and desperate to get back in the limelight, taunts Dakota, dangling the possibility of cooperating with her project. Meanwhile, Hoyt is approached by a shady mob lawyer who offers him a lucrative job: breaking into a “mob bank” and liberating the contents. As Hoyt meticulously plans the break-in, Dakota unearths Hoyt's past and crosses paths with his nemesis: retired state investigator Charlie Floyd, who is on the hunt for Hoyt. As the lives of the fugitive, cop, and journalist become entangled, it's only a matter of time before their dangerous game turns lethal. “It’s a battle of wits and nerves as a cop, a robber, and a journalist dance around one another, weaving a tapestry of deceit and suspense. Salzberg’s dialogue flows like water until it finds truth in this most entertaining read.” —Matt Goldman, New York Times bestselling author",
