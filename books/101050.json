  "description": "Sometimes, when you're broken, you can heal on your own. Sometimes, you need the help of your friends, your family, and the people you love. Keeping those pieces together when the world seems intent on ripping you apart is the greatest challenge of all. Especially when the ones you love, the ones who hold you together, start falling apart themselves. Arowyn and her family continue on their journey to return the Elven Prince, Shael, to his homeland before he fades and dies. A journey full of triumph and horror, love and sorrow, rips them apart with every fighting moment, and yet brings them together as a family. They don't allow the prophecy to rule their lives. Some don't believe, some don't care. Prophecies aren't written in stone. Events can change. People can change. They are only words. From besieged cites, to the elusive Were and wild Fey, nothing quite prepares them to face their deadliest of enemies, one they didn't know existed. \"Broken Prince is a story about love and hope, loss and pain, facing the odds and not giving up. I couldn't put it down!\" Wendy Knight, Feudlings \"Filled with fantasy, non-stop action and suspense, Broken Prince is a heart-achingly romantic read that had me flipping the pages, needing to know what would happen next to Aro and her boys. The end is bittersweet and perfect, and I need the next installment now!\" Trisha Wolfe, Of Silver and Beasts",
