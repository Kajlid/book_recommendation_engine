  "description": "David Munro has everything a man could wish for - a beautiful wife, two adoring daughters, a top academic position, and a circle of devoted friends. But he also has another life - lived mainly at night and frequently in what he comes to know as 'The Gardens of Spain', the places where gay and bisexual men meet. Now he must choose which of his two lives to follow... This landmark book from one of New Zealand's most highly regarded authors explores the precarious divide between sexuality and social mores. It examines the dilemmas of contemporary gay culture with anger, laughter, sensitivity, and honesty.",
