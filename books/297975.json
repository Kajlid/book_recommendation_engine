  "description": "\"It's a pillar,\" says one. \"It's a fan,\" says another. One by one, the seven blind mice investigate the strange Something by the pond. And one by one, they come back with a different theory. It's only when the seventh mouse goes out-and explores the whole Something-that the mice see the whole truth. Based on a classic Indian tale, Ed Young's beautifully rendered version is a treasure to enjoy again and again.\"Immensely appealing.\"( The Horn Book , starred review)",
