  "description": "Torn between his first love…and a forbidden attraction he can no longer deny.\n  Jonah McLendon is no stranger to polyandrous love. With his mom married to his three dads, and his brothers sharing a wife, he didn’t think twice when his high school sweetheart, Chloe, revealed her secret desire for a ménage with his best friend. There was only one problem. He didn’t expect to fall for Pryce, too.  Beaten within an inch of his life after Chloe exposes their secret, and Pryce having been shipped off to a religious boarding school a half state away, Jonah tells the biggest lie of his life and leaves Falcon Ridge with his heart in pieces. When he returns a year and a half later, the last thing he expects to find is his best friend engaged to the girl who betrayed them both.  No longer the scared, confused kid he once was, Jonah is determined to get to the bottom of Pryce’s sham of an engagement, but the truth behind Chloe’s betrayal threatens more than his love for Pryce. If he can’t let go of the past and coax Pryce out of the closet, he could lose them both forever.
