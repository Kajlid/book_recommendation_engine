  "description": "I need to learn how to control my new magic—before it gets me killed.  As the first ever Faerie Games player gifted with magic from the king of the gods—Jupiter—all eyes are on me. Especially since I won the first competition of the Games. Now I need to send three other players to fight in the Coliseum until one of them is dead.  The two that survive will be gunning for me later. So I need to choose my alliances carefully. And as much as I hate to admit it, the magnetically attractive Julian is tempting me to work with him moving forward.  I should hate Julian, since he kidnapped me to the Otherworld in the first place. But he’s helping me learn how to control my new magic. And I’m drawn to him on a level I don’t understand.  One player will win the Faerie Games and survive. The rest will die.  I need to win. If that means getting close to Julian… then that’s exactly what I’m going to do.  Full of magic, mythology, adventure, and romance, The Faerie Pawn is the second book in an addicting young adult fantasy series by USA Today bestselling author Michelle Madow that will keep you reading late into the night!",
