  "description": "Miranda Lee Jenkins has been the subject of local gossip all her life, and has hated every minute of it. The last straw comes when she finds out her low-down-snake of a boyfriend has been cheating on her and everyone in the ever lovin’ town knew it! Including her secret crush… Or, to be more accurate, secret crushes! Wyatt has wanted Randi Lee for as long as he’s known her, and when his lover Jon meets the little spitfire, he wants her, too. The men know that no other woman can complete their family the way Randi can. Now, they just have to convince Randi that a love like theirs is worth giving the folks in town Something to Talk About!",
