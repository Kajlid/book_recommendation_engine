  "description": "Erotic Romance (intended for mature readers, ages 18+)  Part 1 of 2  Danielle Ward hasn’t had sex in six years. Sure, she’s been on dates. She even has a boyfriend, but it seems something is always getting in the way when it comes to doing the deed.  After her boyfriend finally loses his patience and leaves her to drown her sorrows, her best friend Georgia comes up with a plan that becomes more and more brilliant with each shot of tequila.  Book a non-refundable solo trip to an adults-only resort with the intention of getting laid.  The beach is picturesque, her room is luxurious, the alcohol is included … and Danielle can’t wait to get the hell out of there the second she checks in. That is, until an uninvited kiss from drunken hotel guest and Hollywood hottie Evan Weston. Once Evan discovers the reason for Danielle’s vacation, he won’t let up in his pursuit to be the one to solve her problem.  Caught between her desire for a fresh start and the preposterous idea of having a fling with her celebrity crush, Danielle decides it’s time to throw caution to the wind and her panties to the floor.  But it’s never just sex, is it? And Evan Weston isn’t just any man. He isn’t just a movie star.  Evan Weston is Danielle’s last resort.",
