  "description": "Jane Everett is the average teenage actress with a preppy aura surrounding her.Instantly disliked by her peers, she can’t help feeling isolated. Which is why she takes up acting, hoping if she pretends to be somebody else, she’d have an excuse.But her theory is proven wrong when River –shameless, laid-back River– moves in next door, seeing through her mask immediately.Playing the prince in the school play, Sleepless Beauty and Prince Charmless, a parody of the original, Jane is forced to mix with this relaxed, seemingly-clueless boy. Everybody else is cautious around him. A few years back, he used to live in this town before moving back. Something caused him to leave. Something nobody is willing to mention.Jane doesn’t understand why everybody keeps their distance.But she’s about to find out.",
