  "title": "Bob Logan, Gunman At Large",
  "description": "You might say Bob Logan was given birth by the Civil War. As an espionage agent for a Scotsman named Allan Pinkerton, he left his past behind to begin an uncertain future in the west. As a Pinkerton man his identity must be adaptable to match the ever-changing circumstances. On the western frontier after the war he earns the nickname, ‘Bloody’ Bob Logan. In a time and place which requires a man to grow up quickly. With a job description to be one person one day and another the next, will anyone know who he really is? Does he know himself? Set in the days of American Reconstruction, the story brings us into the life of a teenage boy on the cusp of manhood. Already a manhunter exposed to the horrors of war, his introduction to life on the lawless frontier brings him into contact with young men like James Butler Hickock and William F. Cody. Such company assures colorful encounters with hostile Indians, men with lingering post war hatred and the ever-present threat of sudden death.Fans of Dan's books will love this Western which may well remind them of Louis L’ Amour or Elmer Kelton, lightly brushed with a touch of Robert B. Parker and Elmore Leonard.",
