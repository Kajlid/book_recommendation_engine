  "description": "Trauma surgeon Lieutenant Cassandra Toma begins her deployment at the Joint-Unit Air Base on the wrong foot. On her first day, she clashes with her new commander. Her rebellious nature and sassiness rival her excellent performance in the operating room. It might be the only reason she’s not reprimanded … or is it? Major David Hunt is unsure how to handle the brilliant and beautiful Cassandra. As her commander, he can’t consider a relationship. A forbidden passion consumes them with the intensity of an erupting volcano, leaving her heartbroken and him with tarnished honor and pride as an officer. The only way out for David is disappearing into the dangerous warzone in Iraq. When their paths cross again, Cassandra and David find they have a common goal—to find Cassandra’s brother, Maj. Robert Toma, kidnapped by insurgents while on patrol. To rescue him, they must put aside their resentments and fight their common enemy. And the fire between them is back. Cassandra wants to give David—and their love—another chance. But she doesn’t know that his mistake, his secret, could cost them both the love they’ve finally found. REVIEW--From bestselling author Cindy C Bennett Camelia Miron Skiba does it again! In her sophomore effort, Skiba shows that she knows how to write a compelling, fascinating, tug-at-your-heartstrings story. David and Cassandra grab you from the first page and refuse to let you go until you find out if they get their happily ever after. Written against the backdrop of the Iraqi war, their love story is riddled with the pain and terror of living in the middle of so much violence. Skiba balances the beauty of love with the horrors of war without compromising either.",
