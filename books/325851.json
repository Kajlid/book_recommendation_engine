  "description": "Gent is a little wild, a little jaded maybe. When he meets Paul, he thinks he might just have found someone fresh and new, someone who’ll play, maybe someone who will be more than a one night stand.Pretty quick, though, Gent finds out with Paul he gets more than he bargained for. He gets Jamie, too, Gent’s twin, who wants him just as much as Paul does. Gent thinks maybe he’s in over his head, in for a weird triangle that he can’t handle, but as the three come together in an explosion of passionate fireworks, beginning to explore a whole new world of heat, he learns that there can be a lot more fun in having two.",
