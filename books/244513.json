  "description": "The only thing more permanent than tattoos is love--and she's inked all over my heart.I've spent the last seven years screwing half the women in the northern hemisphere, but nobody comes close to the girl I left behind. In the meantime, I've built my reputation as a world-renowned tattoo artist with a six-month waitlist.All of LA is begging me to put my mark on them.The last thing I expect is for Ash Carter to walk into my shop and blow me off.She doesn't know I left her to protect her. That she was my entire world, and that was my only choice. That it was a mistake I've regretted every day for seven years.Now she's back, and she's everything I remember--stubborn, feisty, sexy as hell. And I'll do anything to make her mine again.But how can I convince Ash to forgive and forget when I can't even forgive myself?",
