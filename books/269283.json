  "description": "Nicola was never a hero... until she had to be. She was an everyday single mother, Heathen witch, and herbalist. And she felt the scars of her prior quests deep in her soul and her psyche.​While on a vacation trip with her bff, Joseph, hiking along the Appalachian Trail, Nicola hears of a \"miraculous\" escape from prison. Signs point to a Runespell that releases all forms of entrapment, and the convict is also on the Trail. With a deadly creature waiting to be freed, and Ragnarok once more on the line, the race is on. But Nicola is hindered by PTSD, and Joseph doesn’t seem to understand the sacrifices she might have to make, including their friendship.​​Can Nicola overcome the fears and anxieties from her last adventure in time to stop the end of the world... again?",
