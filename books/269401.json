  "description": "Cade Kingsley uses sandpaper to smooth the rough edges of the custom furniture he makes for his fellow kinksters. But no amount of manual labor can file away the splinters in his heart.  His friends are all settling down into blissful permanence with the submissives who complement their dominance. So by day, Cade tries to move forward too, with the sweet girl who’s slowly but surely worming her way into his heart. But by night, his dreams are filled with the boy he can’t forget.  Sometimes Daddy doesn’t know best. He needs his Littles to open his heart and show him the way to an ending that’s happier than he ever imagined.  The family that plays together, stays together.  (This book can be read as a standalone, but the author recommends getting the background story in previous books. This is the final installment of the Touch Series. DD/lg/lb, MF, MMF, MM. BDSM.)",
