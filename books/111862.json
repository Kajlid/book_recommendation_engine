  "description": "It’s tough being fat; it’s even tougher being a fat vampire. Once you’ve been turned, you’re stuck with the body you’ve got for all eternity; the classic vampire deathstyle, with its elegantly tailored clothes and throngs of willing, waiting, winsome victims, is forever beyond your reach. At least, that’s what Luis, a morbidly obese Colombian vampire, has always heard. When he and his best friend Carlo see an ad for the New Blood Diet, which promises that they, too, can be slender, sexy, swoon-worthy vampires just like in the movies, they’re convinced their deaths will never be the same again. They may be right, but possibly not the way they think. Follow Luis, and other vampires with a craving to change, for a fang-in-cheek adventure that will take you through the perils of the jungles of Columbia, the graveyard shift at a burger joint, and everywhere in between, as you enjoy this first short episode of the Red Cerberus series.",
