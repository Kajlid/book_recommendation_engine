  "description": "In a world that is slowly dying, two races: the Chilsun that solely live underwater, and the Kigon that has evolved into nothing but disembodied spirits, are both haunted by the same stunning dreamscape. They must decide what is the greater evilâ€”each other or the being holding them each captive. To help them make this dangerous decision, Chayn, Jahil, and Villimy, must once again join forces to help save the dying planet and the humanoids who inhabit it. It is a journey of hardships, of self-discovery, and the unwavering belief that survival must be had at any cost. This is Hydrabyss.",
