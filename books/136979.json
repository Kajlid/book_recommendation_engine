  "description": "Becky Richardson's motto is love 'em and leave 'em. The only man she trusts is her best friend Louie, the local computer shop owner and resident geek. When a mysterious man shows up at a masquerade ball and sweeps her off her feet, will she remember that men are good for only one thing or will she let down her guard and open her heart? Louie Hanson has adored Becky since they were in junior high. He lives under no illusion that the former prom queen will ever see him as anything but her geeky friend. In disguise he arrives at the Valentine's Day Ball and manages to take her breath away. Now he's playing a dual role, knowing when she finds out it will be the end of any hope for a relationship with her and the friendship they once shared. How could he ever have thought this was a good idea? How can he stop fulfilling every one of his own fantasies by having Becky in his arms?",
