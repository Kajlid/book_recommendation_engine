  "description": "In the zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic America where Benny Imura lives, every teenager must find a job by the time they turn fifteen or get their rations cut in half. Benny doesn’t want to apprentice as a zombie hunter with his boring older brother Tom, but he has no choice. He expects a tedious job whacking zoms for cash, but what he gets is a vocation that will teach him what it means to be human. This e-boxed set includes Rot & Ruin, Dust & Decay, Flesh & Bone, and the all-new short story “Dead & Gone.”",
