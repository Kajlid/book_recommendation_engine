  "description": "\"A fun and quirky adventure - Chris Wong Sick Hong is an author to watch!\" - Patricia BriggsDoes saving the world count if you do it out of spite?They call me a dick because I am one: Dick Richards, Private Eye. Tour guides and politicians up for reelection crow about how Tipton’s “majestic skyscrapers paint a living mosaic of light against the edges of space,” blissfully ignorant of the Under seeping through society’s cracks like fluorescent mold.Elves, dwarves, superheroes…everyone’s got secrets and what’s a little blackmail among associates? That’s just life. And while there isn’t enough cash in the universe to pay for knight-in-shining-armor suicide missions, there are lines. Tap dance across those—firebomb my apartment and kill my friends—and now it’s personal.Some compare me to Harry Harrison’s Stainless Steel Rat or Jim Butcher’s Harry Dresden. An AI thinks I’m like Tom Rob Smith’s Child 44. One Tom, one Dick, two-and-a-half Harrys. The after-school special damn near writes itself. But do you really need to be told what to think? Buy or don't. I don't have time to babysit.",
