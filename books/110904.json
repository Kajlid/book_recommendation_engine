  "title": "Outside The Wire: Every Man's Guide For Spiritual Warfare",
  "description": "Every day there is a war going on. We often forget that we are in an ongoing spiritual battle. Satan is doing everything he can to stop us from being the Christians we should be. It’s easy to get lulled into a comfortable lifestyle, yet, this would be a grave error. “Outside the wire” is a term that lets a deployed military member know that he will be leaving from the relatively safe confines of the military base. Some Christians feel strong and empowered while in church but struggle when they are outside the church (outside the wire).  Men, we must be prepared to fight not just for ourselves, but for our loved ones also. We must be on alert to the evil the devil puts in front of us. In this book, we'll explore many areas where the devil will tempt you to live less than Christ-like.  The good news is, the Good News has the answers to all of our situation. This user-friendly book will help you examine where you stand on many issues and challenge you to stand for Christ in all areas. I will use some parallels from the war zone in Afghanistan to compare how we must stand up during our spiritual warfare. Be ready to be encouraged and challenged to be the best Christian you can be.",
