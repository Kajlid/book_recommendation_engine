  "description": "This is an illustrated fantasy in which readers accompany three bald dwarves on a perilous puzzle quest. When evil Winston, the wig-wearing wizard, casts a spell which makes all their hair fall out, the villagers of Shortsville (previously known for the length and lustre of their locks) decide that something must be done. Armed only with eight big bug burgers, a bottle of yab's milk and a book of old maps, three intrepid villagers set off to find the source of Winston's power deep inside the dragon's lair. Each scene has strange things to find, mysteries to solve and colourful creatures and characters to spot.",
