His rapidly changing world faces seduction by powerful beings from somewhere else. Dragons have begun to migrate in odd patterns, while hidden power-plays and the open revolt of the Titans subvert social and religious institutions dating back to the dawn of time.

Global conflict looms—a new form of war made possible by the Earth’s abundance and new mechanized techno-sorcery. The Titans of Lumekkor clash with the Giants of the Samyaza Cult, both claiming descent from the new gods.
