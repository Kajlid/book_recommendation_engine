  "description": "An army of darkness marches on the Shining Mines, stronghold of the light for a thousand years. At their head is the shadowmander, an unstoppable monster created from the souls of the dead. A forgotten race stirs in Whisperwood, led by Corlas, who has been granted ancient powers by a banished god...and Fahren journeys with his old enemy Battu to the Morningbridge Peaks, where he is given a task that shakes him to the bones. Meanwhile Bel rides with all the might of Kainordas behind him. He carries the Stone of Evenings Mild, his only means of drawing his counterpart Losara back into himself, thus making his soul complete. Prophecy says that a blue-haired man will end the war forever - and the time has come to look oneself in the eye.",
