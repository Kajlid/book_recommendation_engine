  "description": "In 1994 a corroded pipeline pumped thousands of gallons of Jet Fuel into a steam contaminating the adjacent Horse Farm in rural St. Charles Missouri. This is the compelling story of one women’s 10 year struggle to get that oil off her property. Web of Conspiracy unfolds the story of the controlling effect that Campaign Funds have over the government. It is the story of Federal and State agencies turning a blind eye to help her get the oil off her property. A big part of this story is the lawyers who she turned to for help; one in particular and how he sold her out and what he allowed the oil company’s lawyer to put her though. A captivating must read book if you are fed up with government corruption.",
