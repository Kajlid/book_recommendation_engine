That is until she catches him screwing around and takes off in his prized Mercedes, for once not giving a damn where she's headed. How clichéd is that?Gabriel Jackson is raw and disillusioned. Driving a tow truck is a far cry from the dangerous career he turned his back on, but when he finds the classy blonde in a dangerous part of LA, he's immediately back in the role of protector.Lily is hot and sweet and so out of his league it's not funny, yet Gabe can't deny the sizzling heat between them. He thinks he wants hard, fast and rough--until he gets his hands on her. He knows he should stay the hell away, but Lily makes him feel, really feel, for the first time in two years. Is she just slumming or can she see beyond the harsh, broken façade to the man beneath? A man who dreams of making her his?",
