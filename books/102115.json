  "title": "How Do You Do, Mrs. Wiley?",
  "description": "Through the years a lot of people have whispered, poor Grace, but I have a different outlook, one worth leaving behind. When I’m gone my ashes will drowse peacefully in my urn, and my spirit will rest easy because I wrote the story of my life the way I want it remembered—the story that shows I was never poor Grace. Sure, I’ve seen heartache, I’ve felt heartbreak, but I’ve been blessed more often than I’ve had to stitch up grieving wounds. I’ve laughed more than a billion times, heehawed so long my sides are still aching. I’ve loved so hard my insides feel like strawberry jelly. Why strawberry? Because it’s red like when blood and air greet one another. And I’ve had adventure. God, have I held adventure in my hands and squeezed all the life out of it, or is it the other way around? Perhaps I’ve held life in my hands and squeezed the adventure out of it. Whichever way is right, if there is a right way, I’ve lived a life for which a queen would gladly trade her kingdom. And, yes, the queen would even want to live my life on the day I killed Louis Windle.",
