  "description": "The 1950s were simple times to grow up. For Lewis Grizzard, gallivanting meant hanging out at the store eating Zagnut bars -- the worst thing a kid ever did was slick back his hair in a ducktail and try gyrating like Elvis.But the '60s exploded with assassinations, terrorism, free love, Vietnam and drugs. In place of Elvis, the Pied Piper of his generation, scuzzy Liverpudlians performed half-naked or in costumes straight from Zasu Pitts.ELVIS IS DEAD AND I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD MYSELF is Grizzard's account of coping with a changing world. We may not feel so good ourselves, but Grizzard's commentary and humor help make us feel better.\" (Publishers Source)",
