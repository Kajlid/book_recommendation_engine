  "description": "Nick Robertson has become used to his grandmother Rosie's dotty behaviour. At 86, a widow now, she is determined that before life passes her by, she will live a little. Or, preferably, a lot.It wouldn't be so bad if Nick had nothing else to do, but with a job to find, two warring parents to cope with and a love life in terminal decline, he would prefer his grandmother to get on with things quietly. But, Rosie insists, there is no time like the present. Life is to be enjoyed to the full and to hell with the consequences. She'll help Nick find the soulmate he clearly lacks and he can help her make the most of her few remaining years. Alan Titchmarsh's sparkling new novel is a delicious blend of humour and romance, and a resounding affirmation that there is no such thing as the generation gap.",
