  "description": "When Camry Spencer heads to Miami for a much-needed vacation, she has no idea how drastically her life is about to change. Just a small-town girl from a boring little city, the single mother works hard, is dedicated to her five-year-old daughter, and loyal to her fiancé.Only, all of that goes off the rails and careens quickly out of control.His name is Garland. He wears power like a suit, possesses an ego on steroids, never minces words, and avoids messy entanglements like the plague.Prince Charming? He's NOT!However, when Garland comes to Camry's rescue one night, she isn't only grateful, she's also intrigued. Except, there are just two small problems with that. The man is way out of her league. And she isn't exactly available.But Garland proves not so easily dismissed. When he wages war, he comes fully armored. His words are seductive, his touch; addictive, and his body should be declared a deadly weapon.Camry quickly finds herself on a head-spinning journey that have life-altering consequences--and her world shifts in ways she could never have imagined.Bodyguards, Paparazzi, and High-Stakes might have been more than she bargained for!A NOTE TO MY READERS: Wreckless Engagement was originally written as two books, however, I decided that it would be a better story if combined. Plus, it would save readers a few pennies. So you'll find the book split into two parts, with a single POV in Part 1, and a dual POV in Part 2. I hope you enjoy both!**THIS BOOK IS INTENDED FOR AGE 18 and OVER. CONTAINS SEXUAL CONTENT, VIOLENCE & STRONG LANGUAGE.**",
