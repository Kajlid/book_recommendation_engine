  "title": "Sedich: The Annals of Lusiartha",
  "description": "Enslaved since the age of six, Rilan Crendu lives at the bottom of the Regiment hierarchy, working in the fields of his small island home. Lusiartha is a world divided into those who have power and those who do not, where disobedience means swift retribution and personal choice does not exist. Rilan craves freedom, knowing that there is more to life than the labor forced upon his dark-skinned people. But unknown to Rilan, a secret society exists that struggles against the Regiment. This group, motivated by ancient prophecy, captures Rilan and takes him to their hideout. There, Rilan learns of the sedich, a centuries-old stone imbued with the power of the Creator, and takes its power into himself. The sedich grants Rilan abilities beyond his comprehension and places him at the forefront of the war against the Regiment. But Sovereign Izhara, the Regiment's bloodthirsty dictator, knows of Rilan and the hidden resistance, and will stop at nothing to ensure their defeat. Joined by slaves, soldiers, and civilians from across Lusiartha, Rilan must command those he once had to obey, and he must learn to do so quickly. For if the Sovereign succeeds and Rilan falls, Lusiartha's one chance at freedom falls with him.",
