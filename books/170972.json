  "description": "As part of the Supernatural Enforcers Agency, polar bear shifter Gunner Christiansen can handle just about anything thrown at him. He wasn’t thrilled to have a human foisted onto his team, but he could deal with it. What he couldn’t deal with was the fact that he couldn’t keep his paws off her.  Psychic Erin Jameson is thrilled to be promoted to the Agency’s Alpha team. She’s spent years as the oddball that nobody gave a second thought to – talking to ghosts that no one else can see isn’t exactly great for your reputation – but now it’s her chance to prove how useful she can be. There’s just one little problem – her smoking hot polar bear boss. Just a look from him has the power to turn her into a quivering mess.  Now, shifters are going missing, and one of the shifters has just turned up dead with his heart cut out. Can they keep their minds off each other long enough to catch the killer?  Caution! This does contain swearing (there’s a lot of use of the f word!), as well as scenes of a sexual nature with m/f interaction intended for mature readers.",
