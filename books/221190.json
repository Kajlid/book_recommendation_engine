  "description": "Frank and Billy Young are traveling across Wyoming when their train is robbed. Everyone aboard cooperates, and the bandits get their loot, but for unknown reasons, they start shooting the passengers anyway. The Young brothers fight back, but Frank and six others are killed. Billy survives, but he's no longer an innocent nineteen-year-old. He is now obsessed with seeing these killers dead.  Killing Blood begins as Billy's search for vengeance. But along the way he discovers that evil can run deeper than even the horrors he saw at the robbery. Few things are all good or all bad. Most live in those shadows in between. But Billy learns evil is out there and might exist in everything he's ever known. Including himself.",
