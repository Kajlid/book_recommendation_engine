  "description": "He needs a wife.I need a husband.It’s just temporary… what could go wrong?I’ve always wanted the fairy tale wedding. Not for the princess perfect dress or big party, but for Papa.My grandfather. The only father figure I’ve ever known.It’s his dying wish to walk me down the aisle.Gee, no pressure.But I can grant that wish...I just have to fake being head over heels in love with Ross Andrews, my best friend's big brother whom I embarrassingly crushed on all through high school.Handsome. Knockout sexy. Arrogant jerk extraordinaire.Our childish pranks and tit-for-tat battles were legendary. Then I grew up.Not that he ever noticed.I know it’s a terrible idea, and we’re both in over our heads.It could be the wedding of a lifetime or a total disaster.How do we make it to the altar without killing each other first?Or without falling in love for real?",
