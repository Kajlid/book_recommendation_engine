Find out in Diana Palmer's beloved HEART OF ICE.The last thing in the world romance novelist Katriane James wanted to do was spend her holiday with her roommate's arrogant, infuriating brother. A rugged man like Egan Winthrop belonged in New York City about as much as she belonged out in the wilderness of his ranch.But Egan's powerful presence soon stripped Katriane of her defenses, and his offer of a visit to his Wyoming home was one she couldn't refuse. Soon Katriane had lost her heart as completely as the heroines in her own stories. But how could she convince Egan that, unlike the women in her books, she had never yet been loved?",
