  "description": "Cat loved Wulfe enough to deceive him. She'd lie about who she was, and who had fathered her children, if that was the only way she could save his starcruiser and salvage his Space Corps career. Even though it might mean losing him. Wulfe survived a devastating explosion, blind and unable to remember half the people aboard his beloved starcruiser. Even the little wild woman named Cat who seemed so determined to keep his crew in line was a stranger to him. Then he discovered lie after lie. That same woman stood in the heart of each deception, and she had an answer for every one of his questions, except the most important one--why he loved Cat enough to believe her.",
