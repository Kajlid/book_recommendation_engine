  "title": "The Dance of the King: Decoding the hidden message of logotypes, symbols and other visual languages",
  "description": "The Dance of the King teaches you how to recognize the underlying messages of visual language. What can you learn from the seven liberal arts, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the seven chakras? Answers are hidden in sunflower seeds, Black Pete, Halloween, and Noah’s Ark, among many other topics. Rognvaldr reveals hidden meanings in plain sight by connecting a thousand and one subjects to familiar contemporary logos.Through this book, the author aims to demonstrate that the images you encounter daily trace back to the same source, even if different people may have other mental pictures associated with them. Above all, you will discover what symbols tell you about your body and mind. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to see the forest through the trees or for the unprepared reader who is eager to be surprised by things they didn’t even know existed. From now on, you will view symbols from history, art & culture, language, religion, science, sports, media, and advertising in a different light. “The unique combination of images and text – controversial yet universal – will make you eager to keep reading.”",
