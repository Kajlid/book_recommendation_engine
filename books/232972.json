  "title": "Why Revival Tarries: A Classic on Revival",
  "description": "Leonard Ravenhill's call to revival is as timely now as it was when rst published over forty years ago. The message is fearless and often radical as he expounds on the disparity between the New Testament church and the church today. Why Revival Tarries contains the heart of his message. A.W. Tozer called Ravenhill \"a man sent from God\" who \"appeared at [a] critical moment in history,\" just as the Old Testament prophets did. Included are questions for group and individual study. Ravi Zacharias refers to this as \"the book that shaped me...more dramatically than any other...\"",
