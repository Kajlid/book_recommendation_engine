  "description": "The sole survivor of an ancient race of immortals, the being called Myrwann has nothing but time. Throughout history, as nations rose and fell, as humans waged war, waged peace, wrote poetry and touched the stars, Myrwann lived outside them and beside them, sometimes as woman, sometimes as man. Now, old beyond imagining, tired beyond words, The Last One nurtures the failed and broken souls of New York City's East Villageâ€”even as his own heart cries out for the release of death.",
