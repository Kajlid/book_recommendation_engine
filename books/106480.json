  "description": "Quinn Baker followed her dreams of becoming an artist to New York City. But one failed marriage later and she realizes she has nothing to show for her fancy life in the city but a diploma she’s done absolutely nothing with. Now with news of her grandmother’s death, Quinn heads back home to reconnect with the only family she has left, her sister, and figure out what she is supposed to be doing with her life. She finds an ally in handyman Jonah Goodwin. The widower asks an intriguing favor—teach him to read. The more time Quinn spends with Jonah and his adorable little daughter, Lily, the more she begins to rediscover herself, her passion for her drawing, and her longing for a child and a family of her own. Illiteracy has kept Jonah from forging friendships and building a career his daughter could be proud of. Hiding his secret has always been a full time job. Yet something about Quinn inspires trust—she helps Jonah gain the confidence he needs to make a better life for Lily. But can she show him that, he too, is deserving of love? Add in a dash of fairy magic and matchmaking from beyond the grave, and suddenly this small town has a lot more excitement than anything Quinn could find in the city.",
