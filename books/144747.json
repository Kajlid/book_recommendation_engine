Maybe it's time to listen to a teacher. Day in and day out, teachers watch kids interact with peers, make decisions, deal with difficulty, accept or deflect responsibility . . . Teachers are our eyes and ears--and there's a lot they wish we knew. In Teenagers 101, veteran high school teacher Rebecca Deurlein examines how we can support our teens as they cope with the challenges of the modern world. In an age of instant gratification, how do they learn to work hard? How do they become self-reliant when Mom and Dad are quick to step in? How do they make the transition from kids to adults? Speaking as an educator and a parent herself, Deurlein offers practical strategies for getting teens to: \n\n   * Be self-motivated  \n   * Take responsibility for learning  \n   * Puzzle through problems  \n   * Become their own advocate  \n   * Present themselves well  \n   * And more \nPacked with engaging anecdotes and backed by years of experience, Teenagers 101, is a crash course on the skills teenagers everywhere need to thrive in high school andcollege...and beyond.",
