And to truly make their relationship work, he has to give her everything that he is, just as she is doing for him.Savage knows that what he really needs could break his woman if she isn’t ready. She agreed to come into his world, and he’s not about to give her up. He has to find a way to let her see the monster inside without pushing her away.
