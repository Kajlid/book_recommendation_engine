  "title": "Beyond Binary: Genderqueer and Sexually Fluid Speculative Fiction",
  "description": "Speculative fiction is the literature of questions, of challenges and imagination, and what better to question than the ways in which gender and sexuality have been rigidly defined, partitioned off, put in little boxes? These seventeen stories explore the ways in which identity can go beyond binaryâ€”from space colonies to small college towns, from angels to androids, and from a magical past to other worlds entirely, the authors in this collection have brought to life wonderful tales starring people who proudly define (and redefine) their own genders, sexualities, identities, and so much else in between. Extraordinary stories by Keyan Bowes, Kelley Eskridge, Tobi Hill-Meyer, Nalo Hopkinson, Claire Humphrey, Sarah Kanning, Keffy R. M. Kehrli, Ellen Kushner, Richard Larson, Terra LeMay, Liu Wen Zhuang, Sandra McDonald, Tansy Rayner Roberts, Delia Sherman, Katherine Sparrow, Sonya Taaffe, Catherynne M. Valente",
