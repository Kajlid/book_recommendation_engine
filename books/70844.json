The girls’ hardship is softened by the sudden appearance of their favorite cousin, Tadpole, a charismatic thirteen-year-old with a knack for guitar playing. Tad sees in Carolina a spirit and talent that no one has noticed before, and he predicts that she “is gonna surprise everybody one of these days.” The Collinses soon learn the real reason for Tad’s visit, however, and the weeks that follow are filled with dread that his abusive guardian will come and take him away.But Tad is not the sort of boy to succumb to a bully, and he and Carolina both have surprises in store for everyone.A Junior Library Guild Selection Tadpole is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
