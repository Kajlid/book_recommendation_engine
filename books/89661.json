  "description": "From Hurricane Sandy to Cozy Corner B&B repairs to Aunt Madge's wedding in three weeks. If Jolie can handle that surely she can deal with a sobbing woman who shows up at midnight playing a scary message on a cell phone. Pooki's now-missing husband has told her to hide, and she is at the B&B to do just that. A shady deal for storm repairs at the Ocean Alley Senior Complex seems to be at the root of a hit-and-run death and missing business partner, Pooki's husband, Eric. When Eric ends up dead at the B&B, Jolie's digging for clues in between burning muffins and appraising houses. But when she doesn't share all that she learns with her sometimes-boyfriend, reporter George Winters, he's grouchy. Jolie is convinced she needs to find the murderer and expose fraudulent repair bids. Not everyone shares her views--not the police, her friend Scoobie, and certainly not the murderer.",
