  "title": "The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad",
  "description": "An unflinching look at New York’s most enigmatic crimes and the cops who make it their job to solve them  Between 1985 and 2004, a staggering 8,894 unsolved murders were committed in New York City. Here is the first-ever inside look at the elite NYPD squad that cracks the “unsolvable” cases. Drawing on her unique access to the Cold Case Squad, Stacy Horn follows three tough, indefatigable cops as they sift through the clues to four puzzling murders, from the 1951 strangling of a young wife to a 1996 drug hit that claimed the lives of the parents of three children. As gripping as anything on TV—and much, much more authentic—The Restless Sleep is a completely addictive behind-the-scenes account of the people who offer a final resolution for the unavenged. BACKCOVER: “Masterful storytelling.” —San Francisco Chronicle  “While Sleep hardly makes for soothing bedtime reading, Horn’s gripping writing and palpable sense of outrage ensure that its narrative trail never runs cold.” —Entertainment Weekly  “There is rarely a dull page as Horn portrays her colorful band as they challenge the perplexing past.” —The Baltimore Sun",
