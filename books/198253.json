  "description": "Young as he is, Simon thinks he has it all worked out – he knows just what he needs to do to free his mother and himself from indentured servitude to the corrupt Lord Bastian and escape the constant threat of abuse from Broderick, the lord’s cruel teenaged son. It seems that everything is going according to plan until a violent confrontation leaves Simon on his own, fleeing from Lord Bastian and the law. His future looks bleak, with no chance at redemption, but when he finds himself bonded to a dragon hatchling, things get even more complicated. Can Delno and Nassari, the leaders of the Legion of Riders, prevent the boy from being used as a pawn by nobles eager to ignite a civil war? Can they help him receive Dragon Justice?",
