  "description": "E. Raymond CaptThis book deals with the age old question the purpose of Stonehenge who the master-builders were and when it was built.Stonehenge standing in lonely majesty on England's great Salisbury Plain is wreathed in mystery. From the earliest times it has aroused the awe and curiosity of it's visitors. What was it's purpose? Who were the master builders? When was it built?Although not counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world Stonehenge does count as one of the most unique wonders of the world. A monument so old that it's true history was probably forgotten by classic times. Greek and Roman writers hardly mention it.There have been many folk legends and stories attached to that \"Gigantic Pile\" as it was called by ancient writers. In more modern times most scholars agree it served as some kind of ceremonial building or religious structure for ancient peoples. It is however only within the last century that archaeological excavations and astronomical computations have yielded reliable information about it's origin history and purpose.From pottery shards ancient burials and the silent stones themselves have come the amazing saga of a race of colonizers who created a unique civilization in Britain over 2000 years before the birth of Christ.Stonehenge stands today one signpost left along the way that identifies the Building Race. It bears witness to the vigour and vitality of a national religion already passed from the primitive into the metaphysical stage which embodied abstract ideas astronomical observations and a high and pure code of ethics.Paperback96 pages",
