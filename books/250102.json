  "description": "This is the story, told via a collection of poems, of a woman gripped by pain and loss, life and love, and ultimately joy and resilience. It's a journey through heartbreak to a place of hope and optimism.Here are what a few people are saying about Kai's debut book of \"Kai has such a relatable poetic voice that will pull you in from the very first page. She has created a lovely collection that is sure to become a favorite in the hearts of her readers.” —Liz Newman, A Better Today Media\"...we're in an era where many people are feeling shaken (for a number of reasons) and this collection really taps into a self doubt and tenuous reassurance—a feeling of being lost and then perhaps finding a path forward—that we're collectively experiencing as a society.\" —Kate Caldwell, Testify Producer\"Wonderful! Kaci addresses the complicated and difficult emotions that come from heartbreak in a way that is beautiful and relatable. Her poems tell a story through the pages and are also powerful standalone pieces.” —Kate T.*Bones and Mistakes* as published in \"It Happens to Strong People, Too\"I wonder what stories we tell ourselvesHow we hold on to the people we once wereSo we don’t lose sight of ourselvesGrowing into something different and foreign.Human beings are not static creatures.We flow and bend and mold into the next phaseLike wax melting onto a table.You’d think it was destruction,But really it’s a new sculpture I madeFrom my bones and my mistakes.A new map spread outIn blood red across the dark wood grainMy fingerprints pressedA sign thatSome version of myselfWas here.",
