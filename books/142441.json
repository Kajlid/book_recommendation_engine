  "description": "Beth Garrett spends every waking moment with the love of her life, The Long Branch Saloon. The popular southern bar is a much needed escape from the reality of living in a small Texas town. Never one for drama, Beth swears off screwing around with men from her own backyard, and spends most of her nights alone. That is until fate has pity on her and sends the occasional handsome stranger through town. Thatâ€™s exactly what happens when Eric Alexander comes to Sommerville on business. After a long meeting, Eric ends up at The Long Branch to blow off some steam. With the help of Beth's best friend Wren, the sexy New Yorker challenges her to a game of pool in exchange for an unforgettable Texas experience. Just as Beth thinks she has Eric eating out of the palm of her hand, Wren decides to stir the pot. Now she has to decide if the reward will be worth the risk in this steamy novella, the first in The Tasting Series.",
