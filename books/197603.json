  "title": "We are Still Here",
  "description": "In this powerful and touching collection of essays, Rebecca Liebermann Nissel recounts the story of five generations. From her grandparents' lives in pre-war Europe, to her parents' Holocaust experiences, to her own childhood in Vienna, and then on to her children's lives as Americans and the birth of her first grandchild, Nissel weaves the tale of a family that refused to be torn apart by the cruelest episode in human history. This is the fascinating story of a family that literally emerged from the ashes of Auschwitz, determined not just to live, but to love. Nurtured by the warmth and security of the upbringing her parents courageously managed to give her, Nissel carries a message of hope that touches the humanity within each of us.",
