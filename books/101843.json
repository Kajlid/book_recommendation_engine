  "description": "When the children learned that Mia's foal was to be destroyed as soon as it was born because its sire had been a scrub stallion from the Indian reservation instead of a Thoroughbred like Mia, their reaction was one of horror and dismay. But Kiko, the Mexican-Indian boy whose father was foreman of the ranch, had never in his life questioned the edicts of the adult world. It was Amy, the child of the city, who announced to Kiko that they weren't going to let this happen and it was she who devised the plot to hide the young filly. Set against the picturesque background of a Southern California ranch, the story moves with dramatic impact to an exciting and unexpected climax.",
