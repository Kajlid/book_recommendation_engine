  "description": "DOWNLOAD THE FIRST THREE CHAPTERS BELOW!When Danielle Rouge was sixteen years old, fate sent her the love of her life ... and the poor dear hadn't a clue. Now, twelve years later, she finds herself on the outside of the hotel room that her husband, Jon, and his mistress are currently occupying. More insulted than devastated (after all, who wouldn't want Danielle Rouge?), she runs away, if a grown woman can run away, and happens upon Malcolm Blair. Hmm ... isn't he that attorney The Boston Globe keeps raving about? Gorgeous, wealthy and available. Goodbye, Jon. Malcolm Blair's the smirking type, the politically connected type, the tap-your-phone-to-find-out-what-you're-up-to type. He's assisted fate in its quest to woo Danielle back to him and he believes he's done a brilliant job. That is, until someone begins stalking Danielle, threatening to drive away the one woman he's ever truly longed for. But no worries; he'll fix this. After all, that's what he does. He fixes things, no matter who has to suffer. He. Will. Fix. This.Jon knows that Malcolm Blair is a Boston heavy hitter who is hell-bent on stealing his wife away from him. Those mysterious flowers Danielle receives on the first day of spring, those unsigned birthday cards she's gotten for the past twelve years, all are from Malcolm Blair. The political powerhouse was aiming to seduce another man's wife. Jon can prove it. He can prove it, win Danielle back and destroy Malcolm all at the same time. Just watch him.",
