  "description": "“Okay kid, here’s the deal,” offers the creepy old surfer, “I will teach you to create your own perfect waves using an elemental magic called dynamism. You, in return, will help me locate and bag a treacherous mermaid who now lives on land in human form.” Torey figures, “Everybody knows that mermaids don’t really exist so what do I have to lose?” ~ After a serious wipeout, Dillon follows his surfboard leash towards the surface. He is almost there when he feels a hand grab his ankle and pull him back down. His startled gasp causes him to lose precious oxygen. Kicking his feet violently, he swims frantically upwards. His mind cannot register what is happening. He is too freaked out to think straight as he fights against his reflex to inhale and fill his lungs with water. Just two more strokes and he can breathe again. He is almost there. He is so close that he can practically taste the air. Just one more second and… Hands grab him by his hips and pull him back down again. He knows that he is going to drown, but struggles to see who his attacker is. The mermaid pulls him downwards until she and Dillon are face to face. He becomes instantly mesmerized by the magnificence of her beauty. She presses her sensual lips against his. His body relaxes and all worries of dying flee his oxygen-starved brain. She kisses him more passionately. He kisses her back desperately wanting this final moment of his life to last forever. His world goes black. Lesson #1: Never kiss a stinking mermaid.",
