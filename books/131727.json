  "description": "When is a Dom not a Dom? When it stops him from being with the man he loves…Athol Donaldson has lost many people in his life—his lover, his family, his twin. The latter loss seems hardly worth mourning over. Affric caused nothing but trouble when alive, and now, he seems intent on causing more trouble from beyond the grave.It forces Athol to seek out the one man he has never forgotten.Eden Murdoch has no intention of letting Athol slip through his fingers again. He lost him once, and as they're forced to pull together to unravel the mystery surrounding the parentage of a teenage girl, their love for each other blossoms once more.Surely, being Doms doesn't mean they can't compromise? Will they be able to work out their differences, and find lasting happiness, or will this blast from the past prove to be their final undoing?",
