  "description": "Coven rule is a thing of the past, and the vampire community has spread itself far and wide, but this is no endangered species. Sabian is one of the BloodStar, enhanced vampires who are as reclusive as they are powerful. Some say he is The BloodStar, and garden-variety Kindred are unable to control their fanaticism when they hear the dark, sweet melodies of his bloodsong.Keeping to the shadows is second nature to Sabian even if denying his bond to Marley McRae, his human soul-mate, is not. The intense psychological endurance that comes with the separation is a small price to pay for proof his methods are working. Marley is still alive, and Sabian is prepared to spend eternity haunting her periphery, never coming too close, never risking his gluttony. Faced with a new, unbearable reality when she finds his Colorado sanctuary, Sabian is forced into a desperate attempt to protect her from his murderous, possessive obsession. He will have to face the one vampire-childe heâ€™s created in three-hundred years, and the fallout from the century-old abandonment could cost him everything.",
