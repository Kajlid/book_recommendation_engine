  "title": "Bulletproof eProduct Security: Deliver Digital Products Only To Your Real Customers",
  "description": "Doing a product launch or publishing online is a great way to start an online business. However, it's no product will ever succeed if it's stolen and distributed freely everywhere. Even the most honest person would be tempted to get the free version instead of the one you sell... With intel from over 4 years of observing blackhat forums and torrent trackers and then 1 year in the making, this book finally tips the scales in the favor of the hardworking digital product creator. The goal of this book is to ensure your eProduct delivery process security and to lock your virtual assets for your customers eyes only, without harming your marketing funnel creativity. And all that without any coding or tech knowledge. WishList Member, aMember, DigitalAccessPass, OptimizePress 2.0, InstaMember and so many other \"protection\" software only make it easier for blackhatters to steal your eBooks and eCourses. If you are another of their unhappy customers or… or… you’re just flat-out disappointed with the way people easily steal and then distribute your hard work everywhere, then this book may just be the most important thing you read all year. Because you’re about to get the opportunity to get your hands on a little eProduct security formula and training system that consistently repels any attacks and defends you around the clock from backdooring… and doesn’t require any expensive software, crazy technical skills, or a massive budget.",
