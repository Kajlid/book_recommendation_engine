Dex Thompson is ready for change. After 14 years working he way up the ranks of Hell Raisers Motorcycle Club, he’s tired of living on the wrong side of the law. As second-in-command, it’s almost his time, and he knows what he wants to do -- legitimize the businesses, start fresh, and rebuild the club through honorable means. And nothing is going to stand in his way.  Zoe Carlisle has grown up as the princess of the Hell Raisers and is used to getting the things that she wants. Except when it comes to Dex. Zoe has always had feelings for the dark-eyed rough-rider, but as the step-daughter of Maddox “Mad Dog” Carlisle, all the boys have always known that she was off limits. Until now.  Getting out of a toxic relationship, Zoe decides to quit ignoring her feelings and makes a play for Dex. But Dex has enough going on in his life, and he doesn’t need the daughter of the one man who could disrupt his plans, getting in the way of bringing back honor to the club that Dex has always loved. Even if she does have lips he’s dying to taste and legs he wants wrapped around his waist.  Despite Dex’s intentions, Zoe has plans of her own, and isn’t going to be easily persuaded to give them up. In this battle of wills, will Zoe be able to convince Dex that she’s the woman he needs? Will Dex find a way to bring his dream to life and get the girl? Or will their battle of wills end in a stalemate?",
