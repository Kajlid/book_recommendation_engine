  "description": "Travis hides in solitude in his remote chalet on the border of the Fool’s Mountain National Park. Working from home, he routinely resists his brother’s attempts to lure him back to the city. Since his engagement failed, his life is on standby, but Travis likes it that way. Until one day, after a flood in the park, he finds an unconscious young man on the riverbank. Assuming he’s a hiker who got swept up by the river, Travis brings him to the chalet, intent on summoning help from there. Except Micah wasn’t hiking. He’s on the run, scared, and desperate. And he’s in heat. Maybe he can convince the kind, burly alpha who found him to help him. In every way.Precious is an erotic love story, inspired by MM omegaverse romance.",
