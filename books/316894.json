  "description": "A love they don’t want, a connection they can’t deny.  Filip du Mont loves everything about women—their softness, their curves, their breathy sighs of pleasure. But he also loves shutting the door behind him when he leaves their beds. With no desire to give up his playboy ways, and after seeing firsthand the destruction love can wreak, there’s no way he’ll ever fall in love.Content with her life on the catwalk, and under the blinding lights of the cameras, Chloe Taylor doesn’t need anyone, especially not a prick who thinks he is God’s gift to women. And Filip du Mont is exactly that, the epitome of an entitled heir. She wants nothing to do with him. If only her body got the memo.  The one thing they agree on is their mutual dislike. Then why can’t they stay away from each other? One night of passion to work each other out of their systems, sounds like a good idea, so Chloe and Filip give in to lust.  Now they can get back to ignoring each other.  Well, that’s the plan anyway.",
