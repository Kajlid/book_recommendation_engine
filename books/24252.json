  "description": "America's favorite Supernanny returns to answer questions from confused, conflicted, and confounded parents across the country As ABC's Supernanny and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller of the same name (which has sold nearly 300,000 copies), Jo Frost has no problem handling even the most, er, precocious children. Her upbeat, efficient methods and warm personality have endeared her to parents all over the United States -- and she's got the fan mail to prove it. In Ask Supernanny , Jo responds to the questions she hears time and time again in emails, letters, and personal appearances. Questions like: -My son refuses to go to bed at the appointed hour. How can I put a stop to the endless pleading and cajoling? -My daughter will only eat food that's not touching anything else on the plate. What can I do to change this obsessive behavior? -Our two boys get into raging fights on a daily basis. Short of buying separate houses, what can we do? -And many more, on subjects like bed-wetting, bath time, homework, and independence.",
