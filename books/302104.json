  "description": "Trick the humans, steal the gold, gain the power, achieve god-like status. The motivations of a Diabolical Dragon.Orion's unknown father...yeah, that shitty guy was a fey dragon. When Orion matures into a man, he spends a day in the snow transforming into a warehouse-sized dragon. Now he's hunted. Vile humans want to adorn his head as a trophy in their halls. Except, instead of letting the humans hound him, Orion blends in, swapping between dragon and human to carry out his diabolical plans.Warning: This novella is not for the faint of heart. It contains a bad guy...an actual villain. Does he have motivations? Sure, but he still is the Diabolical Dragon. Contains a magical fantasy setting where men use dowries for their daughters, monster fey are considered scum, and nobility can do just about anything they want if they have enough gold.This second edition contains all new chapters with 20 percent more content than before. Enjoy.",
