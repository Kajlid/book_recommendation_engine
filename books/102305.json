It's typical of a generation educated by music videos and tabloid newspapers...I'm Jimmy Walker, a smart young man with a caring family around me. I'd have the world at my feet, if only I wasn't addicted to white powder.A change of scenery can be a good thing, but it turns out that moving from suburban England to the south of Spain isn't the best idea when trying to get clean. The Costa del Sol is Europe's main point of entry for my favourite poison.Under the Marbella sun, I'm falling deeper into the darkness of drug addiction. With pockets full of cash and bags full of Coke, I'm being led astray by a psychopath named Jason, an Aussie who loves the sort of random violence I'd only ever seen in films.Getting high is easy, and so is hitting rock bottom... But can I Get Clean?Based on true events - Contains adult content - Sex & Violence - 18+",
