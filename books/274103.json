  "title": "The Book of Feasts & Seasons",
  "description": "THE BOOK OF FEASTS & SEASONS is a beautifully mind-bending stroll with a grandmaster of science fiction through the annual Catholic calendar. Over the course of the year, from January to December, the author takes his inspiration from ten different holidays and explores their meanings in a series of stories of marvelous imagination. The book begins with New Year's Day and \"The Meaning of Life as Told Me by an Inebriated Science Fiction Writer in New Jersey.\" The Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin is represented by \"A Random World of Delta Capricorni Aa, Called Scheddi\", while \"The Parliament of Beasts and Birds\" is the story for the Feast of Pentecost. The calendar, and the anthology, culminate on Christmas Eve with \"Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus\". John C. Wright is not only a deeply religious man, he is a devout Catholic philosopher who regards reason as an intrinsic aspect of his faith. THE BOOK OF FEASTS & SEASONS is an imaginative embodiment of that faith taking many different shapes and forms throughout the vast expanse of God's Creation.",
