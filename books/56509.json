  "description": "The Floods aren't like other families - for a start, they're all witches and wizards. And they weren't made in the traditional way like you or me. Some of Nerlin and Mordonna Flood's six eldest children were made in the cellar, using a ancient recipe book and a very big turbocharged wand. The youngest child, Betty, is a normal, pretty little girl - but her attempts at magic never go the way she plans. The next-door neighbours should have known better than to annoy a family of witches and wizards. But they did, and they're about to find out what the Floods do to bad neighbours.",
