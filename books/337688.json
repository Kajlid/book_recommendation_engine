  "title": "The Coming Aristocracy",
  "description": "The Coming Aristocracy is a book for anyone concerned about the decline of America and the steady loss of freedom. More precisely, it is for those dedicated to reversing those trends through education and entrepreneurship.Drawing from years of intense and exhaustive research, Oliver DeMille demonstrates why social, economic, and political equality are being steadily eroded. He highlights crucial constitutional changes, analyzes the current economic crisis, explains why both liberals and conservatives promote aristocracy, and articulates a comprehensive formula for restoring the American republic.The “Mini-Factory” Freedom ShiftAmerica was built and became great on the backs of free and independent owners. If we are to become great again, two things must 1) the owners must again lead, and 2) a significant number of citizens must again become owners. And the key to both of these is Leadership Education.Together, these initiatives form the greatest freedom trend of our “mini-factories.” A mini-factory is “where you do something that has been done historically by institutions, but you do it just as well (or in a way that is preferable for some reason) on a smaller scale.” Entrepreneurship, alternative education, downshifters, environmentalists, alternative health, the growth of spirituality, community architecture, the explosion of network marketing, home doctor visits, local gardening are all examples of mini-factories.Big, institutional, non-transparent, bureaucratic organizations are supporters of aristocracy. Freedom flourishes when the people are as independent, free, and as self-sufficient as possible.Mini-factories are the fertilizer of freedom and the enemies of aristocracy. And The Coming Aristocracy gives you insight, knowledge, and motivation to lead the mini-factory freedom shift in your own life.pixel The BookMini-factory owners think, act, and vote differently then either aristocrats or dependents — they do so as free men and women. They study the nature and anatomy of freedom and are actively engaged in its protection because they have the most to lose from the lack of it, as well as the most to gain from its thriving success. They are the new Founders engaged in the sustainable, bottom-up, inside-out Freedom Shift.",
