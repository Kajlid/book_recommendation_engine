  "title": "A Blues for Annie: The journey of a teen to find herself through the turbulent sixties in London",
  "description": "This is the true story of the enigmatic female vocalist on the eponymous and obscure music album released in 1970 by Panama Limited under the name of Indian Summer. This was just one step on the journey that took her out of the boredom of a dull London suburb to experience life as a blues singer, an Ancient Egyptian dancer in the dance group of Dennis Stoll, a volunteer farmworker on a Kibbutz in Israel, and a member of an intentional community. As she moves on her journey she meets an endless stream of interesting and unusual people who mentor, guide, and point her in the direction of deeper meaning to life.",
