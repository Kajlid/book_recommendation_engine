  "description": "Maureen is sixty-nine, a retired college professor who’s just settling into the quiet and gentle routine of what they call the Golden Years. She’s convinced that her life will be filled with nothing more than yoga, takeout Chinese, and weekly visits to a local buffet with her best friend. But life always has different plans, and all of a sudden Maureen’s gentle routine flips upside down. If the prospect of a new boyfriend—after two years of being a widow—isn’t enough, how about two? And how about the estranged daughter, to whom she hasn’t talked in years? The estranged, sick, confused, disappearing daughter who’s showing entirely too many signs of . . . something Maureen never thought she’d have to face? The Golden Years aren’t so golden anymore, and Maureen is going to need all the strength and tenacity she’s ever had to make it through them. The only question is whether her daughter will make it through them with her.",
