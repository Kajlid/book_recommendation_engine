  "title": "Underway!: One sailor’s story of life aboard US Navy destroyers",
  "description": "What was it like being aboard a US Navy destroyer in the 1970’s? Having spent five years aboard two of them I sat down and chronicled my experiences underway. Ports of call, meals underway, the rigors of operations, the sights, smells, and sounds of being on the “big water” are all shared with the reader. It wasn’t glamorous but it was full of excitement, adventure, and learning how to transform from directionless teen to mature adult. So cock your cover at a salty angle, hitch up your bell bottomed jeans, and prepare for the ride of your life.",
