  "description": "Dan Sorenson was once a high-powered New York defense attorney . . . but that was before a horrifying accident killed the two most important people in his life. As he approaches rock bottom, Dan is unexpectedly offered the opportunity of a lifetime: defend an up-and-coming rapper who swears he&#8217;s innocent of the brutal slaying of his pop star girlfriend. Dan realizes that this may be his only hope to put his own life back on track, but as he delves deeper into the case, he learns that atonement comes at a very steep price. A powerful and riveting new voice in fiction, Adam Mitzner pulls out all the stops in his follow-up to the highly acclaimed A Conflict of Interest&#8212;a gritty, sophisticated thriller that will draw fans of Scott Turow and John Grisham into a world of relentless suspense.",
