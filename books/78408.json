  "title": "A Foot In Both Camps: A German Past For Better And For Worse",
  "description": "Germany seems poised to take a dominant place in Europe. Is this good or bad for the rest of us? This book, written by a British journalist connected to Germany since an early age, offers some answers. As a historical memoir covering the last century, it gives insights into Germans on the basis of direct experience. This is a story of divided allegiance. The author’s German mother celebrated her 100th birthday on 21 June 2012. She emigrated to England after falling foul of the Nazis. His British father fought in World War II, and the young boy grew up proud of Britain’s victory over Hitler. Yet from an early age, the author became acquainted with kindly German relatives and the German economic miracle. With a foot in both camps, the author judges the merits and failings of Britons and Germans over the last century. Writing in a heartfelt, easily-accessible style, he resolves a nagging conflict of personal loyalty only in the ruins of Dresden (in the Cold War, he lived as a Reuters correspondent in Communist East Germany).Based on years of research and interviews, the book traces the dramatic changes which have taken place in German attitudes, including a swing to pacifism, while Britain continues to focus on its military heritage. The author concludes that the rise of a central European power dedicated to peace, thrift, social stability, wealth-creation – and a touch of generosity – is no bad thing for the rest of Europe.",
