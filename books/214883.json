  "description": "At the dawn of time, the archangel Lucifer was cast out of Heaven for daring to defy his creator. Beaten but undaunted, Lucifer vowed revenge against God. For centuries, the Devil and his cohorts were content with small victories, and their valorous march on the pearly gates was nothing but a distant memory of bygone glory. However, the reappearance of an old foe changes everything, and reveals to Lucifer that there may be untapped powers at Hell's disposal, ancient powers that date back to the churning dark that reigned before the Genesis.Lucifer is ready to wager everything he has in a second war against Heaven, but this time, he has stacked the deck in his favor. This time, it will be God that falls.",
