Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy, successful, and content watching my sisters fall in love and start their own families. At least I was… until Mac came back to town. Now he’s stirring up memories and feelings that I wish would stay buried. But what if I was wrong all those years ago? What if one misunderstanding cost me my one chance at true love?MACThere’s a reason I moved away from our small town on Westmount Island, and it has two names. Tawny Michaels. She broke my heart, and I vowed never to let her get close enough to do that again. When my family needs me to come home, I know I’ll have to face her eventually. But nothing can prepare me for the moment we come face to face again. She still owns my heart, but after everything that happened, can we build the future we used to dream about?",
