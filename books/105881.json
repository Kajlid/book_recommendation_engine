  "title": "Pieces: A Life in Eight Movements and a Prelude",
  "description": "Written like a suite in eight movements, Pieces is a novel about music, with leitmotifs, repetitions, counterpoint, harmony and disharmony. The story begins in Oklahoma with a five-year-old violin prodigy who has perfect pitch and a remarkable teacher named Tosca. The following movements, or chapters, capture the protagonist's teen years in Connecticut, student years at Princeton, jazz concerts in New York, and then the big jump to Europe. An enchanting work that carries one along in a flow and movement very much like a symphony.",
