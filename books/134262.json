  "description": "Did you hear what happened to Lady Irene? Yes, Lord Fortson's wife. She went to a slave auction with him. That's right, she watched him buy a new slave. Beautiful creature, I heard. Everyone's saying that he paid an outrageous price for it. But a titled lady going to a slave auction was only the beginning of the scandal. When she saw her husband buy that gorgeous slave, Lady Irene went right around the bend. Completely stark, raving mad. And you know what she did? Scandalous! No one ever heard of such a thing. I knew her, you know, and I can't believe she'd do something like that. But everyone says she really did it. And now, I heard that someone wrote a book about it. It's tells all the filthy details for anyone to read. Lady Annabelle told me that it's downright pornographic. I've just got to get a hold of a copy and hear the whole story.",
