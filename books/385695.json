  "title": "White Flour Cookies: And Eight Other Stories from My Village",
  "description": "The young orphan in \"The Mice Killer\" is typical of many children in rural eastern India. Her hopes to survive hinge on the kindness of an equally underprivileged person she calls her Grandma. \"An Escape To A Richer Land\" is a recreated narrative based on a real story of a child. \"Kindly Consider\" revolves around a practical reality in the life of a faithful servant and a faithful master. Sakshi, the young girl of \"A Room For Music\", grows up into Sakshi of \"White Flour Cookies\". \"The Buffalo Thieves\" is an extended narrative based on a true incidence. The characters in these stories whether human or beast, are those that breathe and live in the sparse hamlets scattered throughout the terrains of this part of the world. Set in a remote village of eastern India, this collection of short stories, is an attempt to paint a picture of village life. Hopefully these stories will intrigue and also entertain the reader.",
