  "description": "Long ago, a brother and sister, lived happily on Mount Olympus until they fell in love. The gods were so angry about their forbidden love that they exiled them from the mountain, turned the brother into a demon, and imprisoned the sister in the deep ocean. As her body rotted under the waves, she asked her demon brother to find a girl that looked like her so that she could possess a new body. In the modern world, the demon finally finds the correct match: a high school girl who looks exactly like his beloved sister. Instead of offering her up for possession, however, the demon falls in love with her.",
