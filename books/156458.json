Not one flaw to be found…that is, until he looks in the mirror… Levi sees his dad’s dreams, his mother’s demands, and lost dreams of his own. Dreams that vanished one by one as his life, and career, were carefully etched out for him by others. He was always jealous of his younger brother Lincoln, a carefree spirit .

But what happens when Levi is forced to sit on the sidelines for a couple of games? At the lowest part of his career, he finds himself magnetized by a blonde beauty. This unexpected girl challenges everything he knows… And dares him to fight for everything he wants… Is Levi Wilks ready for her? Is he ready for “The Game” of his life?Mature Content Warning.
