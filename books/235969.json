  "description": "Everyone in Dark Hollow, Tennesee, knew that old Nora Bonesteel had \"the Sight.\" So naturally she was the first to know about the murder-suicide. Four members of the Underhill family lay dead on a run-down farm, and the two children who survived had no one left. Only the minister's wife, Laura Bruce, was willing to be their guardian.The grisly case was supposed to be \"open and shut,\" but it bothered Sheriff Spencer Arrowood. He had this worried feeling that the bad things were far from over at the Underhill's farm. And he would feel a lot worse if he knew what else old Nora saw: tragedy for Laura Bruce, an elderly man, and a young mother...and the kind of dying that would test the courage of the living and a sheriff's insights into country ways and hearts.",
