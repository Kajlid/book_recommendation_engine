  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Emily van Boyden is down-to-earth, logical and – in her eyes – boring and plain. After her parents’ painful divorce she’s learned not to wear her heart on her sleeve, building a wall around herself to stop people from getting close. But when new guy Theo arrives in town, his piercing blue eyes and dashing good looks have Emily’s defenses trembling on their foundations. Her wild attraction to Theo – and the sudden arrival of her father’s new fiancée – turn Emily’s carefully ordered life upside down. Armed with her two fun-loving best friends, Emily starts to wonder if maybe it is time to let herself open up and give people a chance to bring beautiful moments back into her life.What if being plain does not equal being boring? What if plain is a rarity nowadays?A Journey Through Life is a teen romance about friendship, family, and learning to love yourself – as well as that one special person who can change your life forever.",
