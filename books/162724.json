  "description": "After watching her parents' marriage crash and burn, CIA operative Talia Reynolds doesn't believe in \"happily ever afters.\" Besides, her job entails eighty-hour weeks, juggling a dozen covers and disguises, and tracking down a dangerous Russian spy ring. She hardly has time for romantic entanglements, even if she could let her guard down enough to get close to anyone. But all the rules she lives by could be broken when she meets aerospace engineer Danny Fluker.Danny moved to Canada for a great job--and a chance to start over after a bad breakup. Dating definitely isn't in his plans . . . until beautiful and enigmatic Talia throws a perfect storm right in his flight path. When he catches a glimpse of the real woman behind her facade, he has to get to know her better.Talia has to find a Russian spymaster before he figures out she's not who she claims, and failing to keep her two lives separate in the process could mean the death of more than just her budding relationship. Danny has to decide if a future with Talia--and facing the past--is worth the risk of getting hurt again. If they can break through the barriers keeping them apart (and avoid a major international catastrophe), they might have a chance at being happy together.",
