  "title": "The Reality of Being: The Fourth Way of Gurdjieff",
  "description": "Based on notebooks kept by G.I. Gurdjieff's closest follower, this book offers new insight on his spiritual teachingsâ€”a way of gnosis or \"knowledge of being\" passed on from remote antiquity. It is a complete and uniquely authoritative guide to the great teacher's ideas and to his methods for liberating ourselves from the state of \"waking sleep\" in which most of us live our lives.Gurdjieff respected traditional religious practices, which he regarded as falling into three general categories or \"ways\": the Way of the Fakir, related to mastery of the physical body; the Way of the Monk, based on faith and feeling; and the Way of the Yogi, which focuses on development of the mind. He presented his teaching as a Fourth Way that integrated these three aspects into a single path of self-knowledge. Progress in the Fourth Way comes through conscious effort toward a quality of thinking and feeling that brings a new capacity to see clearly and to love.",
