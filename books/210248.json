  "title": "Rest in Peace Roz, Book 1 in The R.I.P. Series",
  "description": "Fifteen year old Rosalind Ines Pastrano has lived her entire life neglected, tormented, and abused by her parents. However, all that changes one night when Roz’s mother is murdered and she escapes a vicious attempted assault, thanks to Jimmy. Jimmy is her protector, and he is also a spirit. For unknown reasons, Jimmy’s ghost has attached itself to Roz, and she is the only one who can see him. Time and again, Jimmy proves he is a gentle, loving protector. He is unfailingly there for Roz as she battles inner demons brought about by years of living with her drug-addicted mother. He comforts her when the nightmares begin. He soothes her as she begins a new life in a foster home. He reassures her when she loses hope. He even watches over her each and every night, with the promise, “I’m always here.” When a dangerous student takes an unexpected liking to Roz, however, forces stronger than Jimmy are brought into play, and no one is prepared for the motive and magic behind it all. With every terrifying, mysterious event that unravels, Roz and Jimmy develop an unbreakable bond and their feelings soon turn into more than “Protector-Victim.” Which would be perfect except for one small thing: She's alive. He's dead. And Jimmy must work harder than ever to make sure she doesn't end up dead, too. ***FOR MATURE YA READERS*** This book is not intended for readers age 13 and younger. While it does not contain sexual scenes or strong profanity, it does have scenes which may be triggers for more sensitive readers, such as illegal drug use, child abuse, and attempted sexual assault.",
