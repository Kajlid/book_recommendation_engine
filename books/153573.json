  "description": "How often do we pass strangers on the street, in shops, at school with lost sad expressions on their faces? How often do we notice let alone try to help? Jodi is one such person struggling in a world where most people donâ€™t notice or care. When her sexuality becomes known to the school by accident she becomes an outcast. Fearing for their daughter, her parents move their family away to start over. It is in this new environment that Jodi meets Carsen who had a similar high school experience. Carsen has problems of her own, a past not dealt with and a rocky marriage to contend with. When she extends a reluctant hand in friendship to Jodi she is surprised when Jodi is not the only one who learns from it. She teaches Jodi strength in adversity, in return she slowly begins to face her own demons.",
