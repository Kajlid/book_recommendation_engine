  "description": "For the â€œNameless Detective,\" investigations involving matters of the heart are to be avoided at all costs. When an old poker buddy asks him to help frazzled and distraught Kay Runyon, whose husband, Victor, is having a clandestine affair with a mystery woman named Nedra, Nameless unwillingly relents, but he soon discovers there is much more at stake than a simple affair. Nedra is a modern-day Circe who attracts men who become dangerously obsessed with her. Compounding the sticky situation at hand, Victor's obsession with her takes a bizarre twist when she suddenly vanishes without a trace. Did she disappear willingly or was she the victim of one of her lovers' private demons? Nameless must find out before it's too late to save Victor and Kay from tragic ends. And he must do so while trying to cope with a very personal and private demon of his own.",
