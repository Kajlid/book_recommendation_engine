  "description": "When Bryn’s loyalty to her own people is tested, the decision she makes will change the course of her life forever…Truth be told, Bryn isn’t really sure where her loyalties lie. Of one thing she’s sure, though, is that her fraternal twin sister, Jolie, who also happens to be the Queen of the Underworld, should be her sworn enemy. But after spending months with Jolie, Bryn can’t deny the fact that she genuinely cares for her sister, much though she shouldn’t. If it weren’t maddening enough that her relationship with Jolie is anything but black and white, then there’s Sinjin.Cool, calm and calculated, Sinjin Sinclair is everything Bryn imagines she should find reprehensible in a man. First of all, he’s a master vampire and all vampires, in Bryn’s mind, are nothing more than bloodsucking parasites. Secondly, his unflagging cockiness when paired with his boyish charm is enough to irritate any sensible woman. Mostly, though, it’s Sinjin’s unapologetic sexuality that Bryn finds extremely off-putting…and, well, somewhat entertaining and possibly even exhilarating...After Bryn purposely botches her leader’s attack on Jolie, Bryn finds herself returned to her old life, a life she thought she’d wanted. But the old adage, “be careful what you wish for because you might get it,” will take on new meaning once she finds herself playing hostage to her own people.",
