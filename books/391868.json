  "title": "Wonderful Town: New York Stories from The New Yorker",
  "description": "Anthologized from the reigning literary magazine of the century - and in honor of its 75th anniversary - the finest short stories about the greatest city in the world.Wonderful Town is the second half of our celebration of The New Yorker's 75th anniversary, masterfully anthologizes a selection of the greatest short stories written this century. While the individual stories differ widely in their theme and tone, all share the common thread of taking place in and around New York City. However, this anthology is as much about the writing as the venue and will make fascinating listening for all. In the authors' capable imaginations, the city itself is not just a setting but a character itself, with the kind of range and impact that any major literary character achieves. Like New York, Wonderful Town contains the anomalous and the commonplace, shock and comfort, triumph and melancholy.The impressive list of short story authors include among others: Isaac Baschevis Singer, J.D. Salinger, John O'Hara, John Updike, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, John Cheever, Bernard Malamud, Wendy Wasserstein, Tama Janowitz and Grace Paley.",
