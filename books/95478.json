  "description": "WHEN YOU’RE A big girlCherri has often wished she were thin and graceful like a ballerina instead of being a six-foot-tall blonde with curves that require serious caution. Surely a charming Irishman like her new boss Colin, with his throaty brogue and to-die-for bod, would never go for someone like Cherri. Unless maybe he’s looking for the exact opposite of a delicate lass?   there’s more of you to loveWhen Colin hired Cherri to work in his furniture-restoration shop, he had his eyes, first and foremost, on her artistic talents. But now he can’t help but see Cherri for the lush, spirited beauty that she is…and, soon enough, he finds himself mixing business with pleasure. But Cherri turns out to be more vulnerable than she appears. Is she in need of more than Colin can give? Or could it be that a feeling stronger than lust has him thrown for a curve? Praise for Sugar Jamison’s Dangerous Curves Ahead “Dangerous Curves Ahead is laugh out loud funny and super sexy, with unique characters you can't help but love!”—New York Times bestselling author Lori Foster",
