Body of a god and dressed like a biker.Exactly my type.He acts indifferent which is the challenge I need.By the time I’m done, he’ll be begging for more.Only in end, it might be my heart that gets broken.HimShe’s a princess and I’m no prince.I’ve got more skeletons in my closet than a graveyard.My tastes run dark.The women I go for run hotter.As beautiful as she is,The last thing I’m looking for is arm candy.I don’t do girlfriends or relationships not on my terms.The best thing she can do is walk away.Only one taste isn’t enough.By the time this is over, one of us will break. It isn’t supposed to be me.Kingdom Come is part of a duet and is NOT standalone. The story concludes in Kingdom Fall.",
