  "title": "The Boston Tea Party",
  "description": "Follow a crowd of disguised protestors through the quiet streets of colonial Boston as they defend their right to control their own destinies. Russell Freedman's engaging narrative, incorporating meticulous research and quotes from contemporary accounts, follows the rising tensions between the citizens of Boston and representatives of the British Crown. From the controversial, unpopular taxes on tea through the defiant act of dumping hundreds of chests of British cargo into the harbor, this exciting retelling puts readers in the middle of this historic event.  Detailed watercolor illustrations bring this story of early American protest to life, artfully depicting the colonial era and the charged atmosphere of Boston in the weeks leading up to the Boston Tea Party.  Informational backmatter includes a bibliography, index, and historic map of Boston. A perfect introduction to a pivotal moment in American history for young readers.",
