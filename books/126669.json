  "title": "The Moth and the Sun",
  "description": "A book that has been said to have magical power. In 1860, an artist brought his drawings of a small, ordinary moth's flight around Paris to many children asking that they write a story to complement his images. Those who wrote stories, had their dreams come true. An inspiring trilingual (English, Spanish and French) story that encourages children to not quit. The last pages include small thumbnail images of the illustrations throughout the book with space to write their own story.",
