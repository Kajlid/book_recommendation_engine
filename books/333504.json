  "description": "Bryce has been avoiding his brother’s best friend since they were children, but now that she was living across the hall from him, staying away from her was the last thing that he wanted to do in this holiday romantic comedy from New York Times bestselling author R.L. Mathewson.He wasn’t in love with her.It didn’t matter that he couldn’t seem to keep his eyes off her or that he couldn’t seem to think about her without feeling like a part of him was missing, falling in love with his brother’s best friend wasn’t an option. So, when his sister offered him the one thing that he couldn’t resist to prove him wrong, one thing became painfully clear…This was going to be the worst Christmas ever.It was time to move on. Granted, Cayley would have preferred to wait until after Christmas, but with her best friend somehow managing to get her fired and evicted in the same day, she’s left with no choice but to rent the apartment across from the one man that really didn’t seem happy to see her.That was fine.More than fine because if she could handle her best friend making her life a living hell and an ex-fiancé that was determined to get her back, then she could handle the man that was letting his past destroy them both.",
