  "description": "I had the perfect life until tragedy struck, turning my world upside down.Now I'm focused on picking up the pieces and starting over.Easier said than done, right?The last thing I needed was the lingering stare from the sexy-as-sin homicide detective. And those soft touches, making me feel things I wasn't ready for.I tried to keep things casual, but lines started to blur, and instead of pushing him away, I found myself pulling him closer.I wanted to pretend that his kisses weren’t bringing me back to life. I tried to hide the smile that would break out whenever he entered a room.I convinced myself that nothing was happening because he was the type of man a woman like me tried to avoid…. sexy, charming, and way too confident for his own good.Losing my first love almost destroyed me. I wouldn't survive it a second time.So, when the unexpected happened, and our relationship was put to the test, I found my newly built life hanging in the balance.And it might just turn out to be more complicated than I can handle.Perhaps I should have listened to that little voice in my head after all.He told me I could have whatever I want, but why does the one I want have to be the one I can't have?",
