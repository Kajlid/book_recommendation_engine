  "description": "When Leo Sommers opens the door to his record store, the last thing he expects to find is a screaming baby--a baby that he fathered. Flung into parenthood, he struggles to care for the one week old. Until he literary crashes into his savior. Erin Miles gets out of her car to trade insurance details with the man who has rear-ended her car and receives more than she expected. Instantly, she's drawn to the tattooed, exhausted man holding the squalling bundle. She sees how much Leo loves his son and offers help. Erin's patient and gentle caring for Leo and Joe soon develops into something far more than either of them had expected. Caught up in a whirlwind romance, they are on the cusp of exploring their new relationship, when reality hits them in the face. Can Leo admit his growing feelings for Erin, and make them a family?",
