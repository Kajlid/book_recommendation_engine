  "description": "Mishok is a desert land. The nomadic Wayfarers are the lifeblood of trade and power in the country. The caravans live together, jealously guard their magic, and the men marry multiple women.  In the middle of Mishok lies the strange city of Oasis where evil sorcerers secretly steal the energy, spirit, and virtues of its young population. After both of her sisters are taken, Ezriel is determined to put a stop to this dark magic, but she can't do it alone. When she meets the four men known as the Flames, she realizes there are forces at work greater than anyone suspects. Ez and the Flames find themselves challenging Fate and the Gods in their quest to right the balance.  Can the nomadic men deny their traditions to share and love one woman? Are they strong enough to fight a battle that has been waging for centuries?  ***This is a medium-burn reverse harem fantasy with strong character development and world building. It ties into the Soul Tenders Trilogy but can be read in any order. Scenes and content intended for 18+***",
