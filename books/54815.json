  "description": "In a watery world where only the strong survive, the reptiles and fish living in a small pond launch a plan to eradicate Mr. Big, a snapping turtle that is terrorizing them. Despite a few protests from some pond dwellers, who warn of the potential consequences this could have, the animals solicit the support of a murder of crows to carry out their plot. But the scheming crows have their own motives to kill the large reptile and decide to use this opportunity to do so. However, as the plan is put into action, a different, greater terror has found itself a member of the pond. Will Mr. Big be ousted forever? Or will the pond dwellers come to realize that even the old snapping turtle might serve his purpose in their small environment? And what will become of the new threat to those living in the peaceful pond?This stunning graphic novel written for young readers illustrates the delicate balance that exists in small, self-contained, natural ecosystems and the relationship between predator and prey. Mr. Big is perfect for the classroom and will appeal to children interested in nature and comics.",
