  "description": "I don’t know what it is exactly you think will be accomplished by writing things down about myself. But since you asked, let me give you the rundown.I have an emotionally distant mother and a dead father.I have had anxiety since I can remember, and have been treated once for depression–although that treatment failed.Given my need to keep my past hidden, the closer you try to get to me, the more I lie.I have an annoying habit of saying no to all the right men and yes to all the wrong—recently showcased by my affair with a married man, while distancing myself from the one I’m really in love with.But knowing me, you will never get the chance to actually read this. Instead, I will numb myself with the contents of a bottle, rip these candid words from the journal, and carry on as if I still recognized the reflection staring back at me in the mirror.",
