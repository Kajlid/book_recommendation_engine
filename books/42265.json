  "description": "“Move over Wilbur and Babe, there’s a new pig in town.” — School Library Journal (starred review) Flora’s a die-hard dreamer. She’s never left the farm, but she knows she was born for adventure. She’s determined to become a sled pig! A harrowing voyage to Antarctica, a bacon-loving cook, and a shipwreck in deadly conditions stand between Flora and her dream. What will happen to Flora, whose companions see her as more of a meal than an adventurer? As the ship’s captain says, you never know where brains and talent will come from. They just may come from this brave pig.",
