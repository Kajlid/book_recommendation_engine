  "description": "Tatyana is the unluckiest woman on the planet. She never wins anything. Everyone she touches ends up dead. She wakes up one morning engaged to the crown prince of a Russian crime family. This will be a temporary engagement as she's touched Nikolay Kaerta, all over, condemning him to death. Tatyana knows his handsome face, arrogant attitude, and fast gun hand won't save him.Nik isn't worried about dying. He's worried about killing the brat he's engaged to. All he wants is respect. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently it isâ€¦ especially from a saucy bad luck charm with curves that could tempt the Godfather himself. Only when he finds the killer tracking the brat will Nik set her free and return to his relatively peaceful life of crime.",
