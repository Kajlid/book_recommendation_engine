  "description": "My name is Meghan Foster and I'm going to save you from yourself.That is, if a certain someone doesn't stop me... Don't let the pretty face fool you. I am a product of a seriously troubled past, but I'm a resilient little bugger. I'm a night shift stock replenishing machine and if by chance, you don't think that sounds too exciting? You are sorely mistaken, my friend. This is my life, I can't explain it, I won't even attempt to try.I do have certain powers of persuasion that I am more than willing to use, especially if aforementioned 'certain someone' doesn't interfere. His name is Lance and he is by far the most delicious creature I've ever laid eyes on. I have no idea who he is or what he wants with me, but I guess I'm about to find out the hard way...Who says stocking shelves is boring?Excerpt:“Oh hey, Mr. Carson…”I’m looking over Lance’s shoulder to my imaginary Mr. Carson. Just as soon as his head turns, I flick my wrist and a can of peaches screams off the shelf and hits him.Square in the crotch. Direct hit.His hands immediately cup his privates, and I see him wince, but only for a fraction of a second.I’m standing in the middle of the aisle, wanting so badly to yell out “Ha Ha”…or “Gotcha”…or “How ya like me now?” Or something clever like that. My mouth has turned up into a smile, and I watch as he slowly looks up. My smile dies a quick death. He’s pissed. I mean…pissed. Like his eyes are glowing kind of pissed. I have no idea what he is, and suddenly I am full of fear. I do what every self-respecting intelligent adult female would do.I turn around and run for my life.",
