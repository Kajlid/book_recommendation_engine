  "title": "Affairs of Caste: a Young Diary",
  "description": "One book is enough to disrupt our myths, prejudices, our inability to empathise with others, and our reluctance to come out of our ignorance. This book promises to do all these for all of us. This book will reconstruct our ideas of the society in which we live but don't seem to have much of its understanding. This book will challenge us to think beyond our understanding of the society in which we lived so far. Sumeet Samos is an illustrious writer in-making. And Panther's Paw Publication is so proud to publish this book.",
