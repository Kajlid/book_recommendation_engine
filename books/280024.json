  "description": "Freya Maxim Ivankov is the devil incarnate. With the fierce blood of Mongolian conquerors running through his veins he is pitiless. From the time I was a child, I knew he was my enemy, and I have always hated him with a shocking intensity. Now my father wants me to marry him.  I cannot say no to my father. No one says no to him, not if they wish to live. I may be his daughter, but his honor is more important than my life. So I will marry that heartless brute. Yes, he is beautiful, with piercing blue eyes and raven black hair, but I will not bend to him. I will not share his bed, and I will not bear him children. Our marriage will be more barren than the wild landscapes his ancestors rode across when they came to conquer our lands.  Maxim I have watched her from afar for many, many years. Those flame colored locks tumbling down her delicate shoulders, that creamy-white neck when it is stretched and exposed. I have imagined how it will feel when she offers herself to me and I am inside her. She despises me, but now she will bear my name and be mine. I will make her call my name. I will make her get on her pretty, little knees and beg me to take her. I will be her last thought when she goes to sleep and the first when her eyes open. I will fill her belly with my seed.
