But the wise-cracking wall-crawler is up to his neck in trouble with the all-new, all-deadly Scorpion! Who else can Misty deploy? And what other shocks can she reveal about the lies upon which the Heroes outfi t was built? Then, as the terror of Fear itself engulfs the streets, our underdog operatives fight just to keep the city together - and that means Misty Knight must recruit some very unlikely agents! Just who is for hire tonight? Would you believe elektra, Shroud and Gargoyle? Plus: the Heroes For Hire go to...the Jersey Shore?
