  "title": "Earogenous Zones: Sound, Sexuality and Cinema",
  "description": "In the growing scholarly literature on music in film, one category that remains discreetly neglected is pornography. Yet in 2003 it was reported that in Los Angeles alone there are are more than than 10,000 porn films made year, as compared with an average of 400 feature films coming out of Hollywood. This is, by any qualitative standard, a major film genre. From as far afield as the UK, the US, South Africa, Australia and Finland, this collection explores the role of sound and music across a wide spectrum of pornography and its increasingly uncertain boundaries with mainstream erotica.",
