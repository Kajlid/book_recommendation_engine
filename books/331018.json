  "description": "Sweet little Fawn is the daughter of a boss in The District Cosa Nostra.The daughter of the man who betrayed my family.Not only is she a burden—barely eighteen, naïve, the epitome of a little deer in headlights-But she is too damn pretty.Too pretty to have clawed her way through life, merely surviving.Too pretty to be so utterly vulnerable, alone, and asking for help from the deadliest man in the city—me.Christ. She is too pretty to be walking my halls at midnight.Too damn pretty. . . to not be mine.My pretty little burden.His Pretty Little Burden is part of The Kids of The District series but can be read without the previous books, although it follows a greater narrative. It has a happily for now. It features a powerful Mafia Don, and his endearing tortured little heroine. His Pretty Little Burden has an age-gap dynamic that some people may find uncomfortable. It is an epic love story first. Word steam second. Violence, gore, and drama, third. Enjoy.",
