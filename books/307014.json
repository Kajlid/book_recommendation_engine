When a Washington lawyer is found savagely mutilated and murdered in his vacation home in the Virginia woods, Sam Picken and Jessie Macaulay, lifelong friends, are forced to confront the childhood they left behind in West Virginia coal country. It seems like an open-and-shut case, but a key piece of evidence leads Sam and Jessie down different paths as the childhood friends seek to identify the killer. Their friendship is battered as the secrets revealed during the murder investigation point to disturbing conclusions that are too damning to be shared, even with each other.
