  "description": "Explore the past of Critical Role's daring half-elf twins, Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan, in this original prequel novel to their adventures with Vox Machina.Vex and Vax have always been outsiders. A harsh childhood in the elite elven city of Syngorn quickly taught them not to rely on others. Now, freed from the expectations of their exacting father and the scornful eyes of Syngorn's elves, the cunning hunter and the conning thief have made their own way in the world of Exandria. The twins have traveled far and experienced great hardship. But with the help of Vex's quick wit and Vax's quicker dagger, they've always kept ahead of trouble. Now, unknown perils await them in the bustling city of Westruun, where the twins become entangled in a web spun by the thieves' guild known to many as the Clasp. Trapped by a hasty deal, Vex and Vax (along with Vex's faithful bear companion, Trinket) set out into the wilds to fulfill their debt to the infamous crime syndicate. As the situation grows more complicated than they ever could have imagined, for the first time Vex and Vax find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict that threatens the home they have carried with each other for years.Written by #1 New York Times bestselling author Marieke Nijkamp, Critical Role: Vox Machina-Kith & Kin follows a brand-new adventure that delves into the twin's unexplored history, and returns to some of the iconic moments that forged Vox Machina's most unbreakable bond.",
