His wife has lain comatose for months, and the accident that put her there has raised questions that she’s unable to answer.

Worse, Evan’s put in the position of interim sheriff while he investigates the murder of his former boss.Evan keeps coming up with more questions than answers; questions about what really happened in the dark privacy of the swamp, and questions about what really happened to his marriage and his wife.As the answers begin to surface, he discovers secrets as deep and twisted as the roots of the ancient cypress trees that litter the landscape - secrets that no one wants revealed.This is the first book in the Still Waters series; character-driven suspense filled with rich, coastal atmosphere and dry humor.
