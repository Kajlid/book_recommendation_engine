Even if she couldn't be on the outside, that didn't mean she couldn't be a part of it from the inside.'\n Along with the characters that keep readers turning the pages, the plot remains interesting throughout, making this fairy tale twist easy to read in one sitting.\" -  Yousra Medhkour, USA Review of Books",
