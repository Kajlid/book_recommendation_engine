  "description": "Rodrigo is a sex worker who’s had a few years of great experiences. But lately he’s been wanting someone special enough to give him a reason to quit. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with sex work, but he’s finally ready to move on.Enter Bernie and Edgar, two older husbears who become Rodrigo’s next clients. Given that Rodrigo loves older men—the older the better—he’s in for a treat. But it’s not just sex like it’s been with the other clients. In fact, Bernie and Edgar are quite taken by his beauty, and they have room for a third with an offer that’s hard to refuse.So, Rodrigo needs a little time to ponder such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These men are so much his type, and sex with them would probably be fantastic. But are they really enough to solidify his decision that could change his life forever?Or maybe what Rodrigo’s really missing in his life is something a little more…furry?",
