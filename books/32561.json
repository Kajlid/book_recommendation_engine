Also available in Spanish, El dragón diferente .When 7th grader Alba Clark expressed an interest in translation, her Spanish teacher Pamela Torres handed her a copy of The Different Dragon . This passionate teacher and her motivated student worked closely together, delving into the essence of language and searching for words to honor the intention of the original story. Because of their efforts Two Lives Publishing is proud to bring you El dragón diferente . Author’s I wrote The Different Dragon more than ten years ago, when I longed to read my children bedtime stories that mirrored the reality of our playful, average two-mom family. At the time I was also beginning my work as a PreK-12 consultant, helping schools address issues of gender and sexuality. Early Elementary teachers use The Different Dragon to teach students about the joy of telling stories, the value of being true to oneself, and the problem with stereotypes--- even of dragons. The Gay Lesbian Straight Educators Network (GLSEN) created a PreK-3rd grade lesson featuring Dragon that explores different kinds of families.",
