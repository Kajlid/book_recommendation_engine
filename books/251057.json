  "description": "Allie Kimball is excited to be starting sixth grade. Her best friend is going to be in the same school and she is going to try out for the soccer team. But she soon learns that middle school is a very different world, full of strange new beasts, like glommers--girls who never go anywhere alone--and norks-a combination of a nerd and a dork. Allie realizes its time to define herself before she gets lost in the sixth-grade jungle. Sixth Grade Glommers, Norks, and Me is a funny and poignant look at sixth-grade friendships, crushes, and trying to define yourself.",
