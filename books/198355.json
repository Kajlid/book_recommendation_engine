  "description": "Joan Walsh Anglund became successful with her first book, A Friend Is Someone Who Likes You, in 1958. She's been making books featuring these same round-faced mouthless characters ever since, and her popularity continues to grow. There's something ineffably sweet about her creations, which are based in large part on people and places in her own life-- particularly on her children Joy and Todd....She seems to strike a nerve and her images of childhood have an innocence and purity that people respond to with a rush of nostalgia.--Loganberry BooksText and illustrations describe what a friend is is.",
