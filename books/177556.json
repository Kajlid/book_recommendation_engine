  "description": "I don't know when it happened. I didn't think it'd ever happen. I can't lose her. I can't even imagine losing her.----- Rule #6 â€“ This is supposed to be fun. Understand?He's my bad boy and I'm his good girl. And, yes, he's my stepbrother and I'm his stepsister. He wasn't always, though. We aren't just that. There's a lot more to us. Sometimes you need to follow your heart, or else you'll regret it for the rest of your life. You don't always have a choice in who you fall in love with. Sometimes you can't be perfect. You just have to be yourself. Sometimes that's what makes you perfect.",
