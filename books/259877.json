  "title": "Disturbing Borders",
  "description": "Disturbing Borders is a walk in the woods or on the beach. It is the sadness that comes with aging parents, grief at the death of those we love, frustration with a world gone mad; it is also joy at the birth of a grandchild and a celebration of the landscapes we inhabit. It is about birds, skies, walks with dogs, and mostly it is a small tribute to grace.",
