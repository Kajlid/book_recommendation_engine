  "description": "The first rule of working together? Don't fall for the boss’s daughter. Definitely don’t fall for her when you’re trying to buy the business.The trouble is Sloane is smack dab next me from 9 to freaking 5. And she’s as captivating, brilliant, and sexy as ever, which means I’m taking more than the recommended dosage of office romance temptation every day. Make that every single second, because she’s not only “the one” -- she’s the one who got away.But she’s the very definition of off-limits, so I keep my hands to myself. Fine, we might flirt. Okay, we do indulge in the occasional dirty text. And there was that one time when we kissed on the street. But we’ve been good since then.Until the night she issues me a challenge -- seven nights of O lessons and then we walk away. Sounds like a simple arrangement.But I was never good with those kind of rules.",
