  "description": "Summer Holland is set on one thing--convincing her childhood sweetheart *and* local preacher's son, Gabriel Edwards, to marry her so she can get back the daughter she gave up for adoption. She’s always been able to count on him to rescuing her when she needed it most, but this time is different… there’s a new woman in Gabriel’s life. Only, Summer's not going to let a little thing like that get in her way. It would be a marriage of *major* inconvenience… There’s only been one woman for Gabriel Edwards—Summer Holland, the daughter of Holland Spring's most notorious woman. But unless Summer needs cash, food or a place to stay, she wants nothing to do with him. He’s done playing her knight in shining armor. He’s finally found the woman to settle down with—the town’s newest librarian. She’s smart and sweet, and wholly in love with him. Nothing and no one will get in the way of his plans... until, that is, Summer comes home to Holland Springs, and needs his help once more. Determined to protect her heart, Summer tries to keep Gabriel at arm's length, but with one hot kiss, she realizes that not only did she get more than she bargained for, but she might not be over him.",
