  "description": "A journey, yes, of sorts. With purpose, yes, that too. An author from another time, endeavouring to unearth space in today’s cyber world – and hopefully be less ambiguous with his planetarian/galactic metaphors. And to generally find his way around in the attempt; all with the lofty dream of becoming a known author; an author of merit and for the right reasons: to bring literature back down to earth… to a place like, say, where fangs are still utilized for ripping into more traditional foods. With success, too… umm. Maybe that one is down to you, the reader. What you’ll find here are 22 of his favourite posts carefully chosen from his own website, and from a writer who never claims to own the answers to his queries and observations, but who simply articulates them as they, seemingly, seek to trip him over – he’s adept enough at tripping over his own shoe-laces. Sometimes he’s amused; sometimes he’s bemused. And sometimes, well, he’s completely flummoxed… And it’s all for £0.77p. Book form. So come along for the ride. Who knows, he may even persuade you to purchase his debut novel, Wood Talc & Mr. J, set in 1970s northern England, to which each of these posts refers, by way of comparing its numerous themes with how we might view them today…",
