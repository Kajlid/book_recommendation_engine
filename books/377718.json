  "description": "When you're the daughter of faerie royalty - born and raised in a faerie palace, with a kingdom's worth of magic at your fingertips - what kind of place could possibly seem exotic? The human world, of course! And that's exactly where Princess Melia is headed. All she has to do is cast a spell on her parents, King Consort Henry and Queen Holly Blue, to make them forget they ever had a daughter.Anticipating nothing more than a day's outing, Mena is not prepared for a portal miscalculation that accidentally lands her in Haleklind, where she discovers rebel forces preparing an invasion using a terrifying new magical weapon. And that's not the only plot threatening the Faerie Realm. The evil lord Hairstreak has returned - though he's now an evil head in an evil box. That doesn't stop him from launching his most nefarious plan yet to gain control of the Realm - and he won't let a little thing like a princess stand in his way.",
