  "description": "Meet Josephine Foster, or Zo Jo as she's called in the biz. The best pint-sized photographer of them all, Jo doesn't mind doing what it takes to get that perfect shot, until she's sent on an undercover assignment to shoot Ned Hartnett―teen superstar and the only celebrity who's ever been kind to her―at an exclusive rehabilitation retreat in Boston. The money will be enough to pay for Jo's real photography classes, and maybe even quitting her paparazzi gig for good. Everyone wants to know what Ned's in for. But Jo certainly doesn't know what she's in falling in love with Ned was never supposed to be part of her assignment.",
