  "description": "Gods are vanishing; their only salvation is bonding to a human soul.  My name is Clara Daniels. I was your average New Yorker with a degree in business and a need for a job. Everything in my life was normal; well, as normal as it could be with an overbearing mother obsessed with the Lord and trying to find me a man. Not to mention, dealing with the many chauvanistic men that dominate the business world of New York.  Then one day, I ran into Fate - literally - and my entire world was changed. Now, my normal is being the human soul for four, overpowering, disturbingly hot gods. Think Zeus, Aries, Hades - see where I'm going with this. Turns out all that mythology was true. Now, I'm the only chance these four gods have to continue to live and soon they'll become my only chance.  Unfortunately, there's a group of people that don't agree with this and I just became their next target.  Can I trust them to protect me? Or will they let me down like so many others before them? Only Fate knows...and she's not telling.",
