  "description": "\"Riggs brings it all together brilliantly, assembling all evidence of Marlowe's life and adding to that a wider and deeper focus . . . Superb.\"-- Los Angeles TimesThe World of Christopher Marlowe is the story of the troubled genius, raised in the stench and poverty of Canterbury's abbatoirs, who revolutionized English drama and poetry, challenging and scandalizing English society before he was murdered in his prime. David Riggs, a prizewinning Elizabethan scholar, evokes the atmosphere and texture of Marlowe's life from his birth to his ties to the London underworld and his triumphs onstage.It was a time when nothing was sacred, and no one was secure. Espousing sexual freedom and atheism, Marlowe proved too great a threat to the religious and political leaders of the time, who were struggling to maintain their tenuous grip on power. In the wake of his untimely death, Marlowe would leave behind a shadowed legacy of undeniable genius. This magisterial work of reconstruction illuminates his enigmatic, contradictory, and glorious life with immense richness.\"The book engrossingly narrates the circumstantial details of Marlowe's life against a richly detailed backdrop. Riggs writes with scholarly yet conversational elegance . . . Enjoyably provides fresh insights into the life and work of this important poet and playwright.\" -- San Francisco Chronicle\"A worthy book . . . if you want an exhaustive account of the life and times, Riggs is your man.\"-- The New York Times Book Review",
