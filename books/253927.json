  "title": "Mixed Korean: Our Stories An Anthology",
  "description": "“From the struggles of the Korean War, to the modern dilemmas faced by those who are mixed race, comes an assortment of stories that capture the essence of what it is to be a mixed Korean. With common themes of exclusion, and recollections of not looking Korean enough, black enough, white enough, or ‘other’ enough, this powerful collection features works by award-winning authors Alexander Chee, Michael Croley, and Heinz Insu Fenkl, alongside pieces composed by prominent writers, poets and scholars. Interwoven between the better known literary names, are the voices of newcomers with powerful memories that have never been captured before. Collectively, these stories will resonate with anyone who has ever stood on the outside of a group, longing for inclusion.”",
