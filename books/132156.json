When a most out of the ordinary daydream takes him into the reality of a small town legend, he is faced with a quest for truth that forces him to question the life he has always known. With his childhood friends Case and Wayne, along with the new girl Noel Peterson, Boone finds himself using hidden symbols to unearth a secret from long ago. They must use the clues disguised in the symbols to lead them on an epic journey of adventure to a forgotten world that will set Boone face to face with an enemy and a decision that could change his ordinary life forever.
