  "description": "Tiara has lost her memory and wakes all alone to strange psychic powers and bloody visions. As she seeks to find herself, she is taunted by a phantom seducer in her mind. It would seem that he is leading her on a merry adventure to find her identity, but is he the lover whose touch she craves or a madman intent on destroying her mind? He sends her pristine white roses, but their purity is tainted with the dripping of bright red blood upon their petals. Praise for PSI [Painting the Roses Red] hooked me in the first chapter and compelled me to continue reading. -- S. Rogers Never Smile at a Crocodile is a brilliant tale with great characters and a fast moving storyline. -- Syria Says (from www.seriasays.com) [Pour Unfortunate Souls] had magic, humor, emotions, puppies, twists, and revelations. I didn't want to put my kindle down and I didn't want the story to end. â€“ LuvMyKindle",
