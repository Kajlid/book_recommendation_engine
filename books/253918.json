The boy with green eyes and crooked smile. The boy with stories and an imagination that could take us far, far away.  In our castle he was the prince, and I the princess. For the first time in my life I was safe, happy. I was loved. But every fairytale has a villain, ours would be no different. I just never expected the villain to be me.",
