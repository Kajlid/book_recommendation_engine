  "description": "For Jimmy Pecatti, joining the mob doesn’t seem so bad. The street tax on his old man’s business drops to zero, he pulls down more cash in a week than he used to see in half a year--and, if he’s gonna learn to channel his innate talent for magic, the underworld is the only place to do it. It seems like everything he could ask for.Trouble is, Jimmy doesn’t know what he’s getting into. The Mafia isn’t such a big deal in Boston these days, and the Russian mob is gearing up to exterminate them. Worse, the Russians have hired a notoriously out-of-control wizard named Kelsen who is conjuring up unkillable demons and leaving wiseguys in pieces all over town. As the Mafia’s hot new talent and the only one with enough mojo to stop Kelsen, Jimmy might as well be wearing crosshairs.When the violence escalates into all-out war, Jimmy pulls every trick he can think of to stay alive, protect his family, and keep ahead of the Russian gangsters. Luck and smarts won’t get Jimmy through this--it’s going to take magic. But magic is a dirty back room deal with the universe, and demons mediate the deals, sinking their hooks into Jimmy’s soul a little more with every spell he works.Jimmy just might be able to protect his folks, take Kelsen out, and bring the war to an end--but he’ll have to take a flamethrower to his own soul to do it.",
