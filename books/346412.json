  "description": "** OUT OF PRINT **Travis Bell is openly gay to family and friends, but as a college athlete, he chooses not to define himself by his sexuality. When he covers for a friend's misdeed, he's forced to renegotiate his future. Carefully. Or he's going to lose his coveted lacrosse scholarship. The last thing Travis plans on, however, is a \"volunteer vacation\" in the remote wilderness with members of Omega Beta Pi, aka Off the Beaten Path, a fraternity devoted to gay rights and environmental causes. To make matters worse, he must share a tent with Kyle, an opinionated activist who also happens to be the hottest guy Travis has ever met.Kyle Schafer is a proud activist who disapproves of Travis's ignorance on issues affecting the environment and gay community. To his even greater annoyance, Kyle finds himself attracted to his shallow tentmate on a purely physical level. Travis goes against everything Kyle believes in, but that doesn't dampen the chemistry that sparks between them. Pretty soon, it looks like Travis isn't the only one who'll be going off the beaten path.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, male/male sexual practices.",
