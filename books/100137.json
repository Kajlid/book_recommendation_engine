  "title": "Yin, Yang, Yogini:  A Woman's Quest for Balance, Strength, and Inner Peace",
  "description": "Yin, Yang, Yogini is a memoir about transformation through yoga, with yoga as the backdrop for change, a story of how one can evolve in mid-life and in mid-stride, of how one can learn to let go of the past, let go of fear, and live with trust in the present moment.  This is a memoir about a transformational two years of Kathryn’s life, a time in which she learned to trust herself and the universe, even while facing such issues as the death of her parents, her children leaving home for college, panic and anxiety issues, and breast cancer. Kathryn's story is heartfelt, humorous and timely and about finding courage, strength, and happiness within.",
