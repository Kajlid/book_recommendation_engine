  "description": "*Something stirs in the night, and shadows are chasing shadows.*  Charlotte has always lived life as she was told: normal apartment, normal job, normal life. When tragedy strikes a New York City nightclub, she and everyone else is saved by a mysterious, striking man who shrugs off bullets before disappearing into the city streets. The world praises him, calling him the “real-life Superman,” but Charlotte knows the truth—he’s a vampire.  Jackson is on the run. He has broken the oldest and most sacred commandment of his kind: secrecy above all else. As others of his ancient house pursue him to put him to death for his crime, he cannot avoid the urge to find Charlotte once more and make her his own, no matter the cost to him…or to her.  \"Deathless Ecstasy\" is the first book in the Blood and Sex series, and is intended for 18+ readers.",
