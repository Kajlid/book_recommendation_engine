  "description": "At the dawn of the 30th century, the Age of Machines sinks into chaos. Throughout the Earth, cataclysmic changes devastate nations and terminate technological ways of living. In the British Isles and in Brittany, Gaelic-speaking folk build themselves into new Celtic nations, joined together by common spiritual beliefs and the determination to preserve a culture of love, honor, and respect for the natural world. Ten centuries pass. In the first year of the 40th century, the five nations of the Latter Day Celts endure but are now threatened by an ever-colder climate and powerful, determined enemies.The three volumes of “Saga of the Latter Day Celts” tell the story of a single tumultuous year that tests to the limit the Celts’ courage, determination, unity, and willingness to sacrifice. Yet in the end it is a tale of individual human beings. Like us, Conor and Fethnaid, Mairin and Oran, Padraic and Liadan wish for things they cannot have, make mistakes of omission and commission, and in darker moments ponder why the world is so much crueler than they would like it to be. This is their story.Volume III, “The Blood Upon the Rose,” will appear in 2020.",
