  "description": "Anastasia (Stacia) Uqualla has been dead for eleven years, residing as a spirit in the Italian Church of Ognissanti, when she suddenly awakens in the body of the renowned Renaissance beauty, Simonetta Vespucci. She reunites with Mariano, the father of Botticelli, whose ghostly presence has kept her company in the afterlife. Her journey through the Renaissance will also find her rubbing elbows with the young Leonardo da Vinci, Lorenzo de' Medici, and many other Renaissance painters, including the awkwardly dashing Botticelli himself. With the body and raging hormones of a teenage girl, Stacia experiences all the passions in life a second time around. Take a ride through history in this second book in the \"Remains\" series by Laura T Emery, a light historical fiction with a sense of humor and a sexy edge.",
