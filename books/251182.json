  "description": "Scotland and America, 1774. Thirty years and one generation after Highland Rebel, the Camerons have returned to Scotland and are living under the English occupation with their five children. Ronald and Lauchlin, the oldest, wage private war, presently abetted by third cousin-twice-removed ‘Uncle’ Matthew, Jade’s younger brother, and as reprehensible as she could have wished. To avoid being hanged, the three go to the loyal Tory Lennox cousins in Virginia. A lot of opinions get revised before they end up having a go at a third King George. And while Rory returns to his beloved Highlands, Lauchlin marries the teasing Andrew Dare who adores her irrepressible ways.",
