  "description": "Mercenary She was just a job. I needed to get in and uncover the Iron Fists’ next move. They’d hit the Oath Keepers enough in the past, and being the newest member, it was up to me to get close. Had I known I’d be getting close to Chevelle, maybe I could’ve prepared myself. I went in seeking revenge and came out wanting to protect one thing—her.  Chevelle Running The Pit was my life. I needed nothing and no one except my cars and a heart-thumping race. Gear head, Pit Master, alpha bitch, take your pick on what you’d rather call me. However, make note of one thing: I take shit from no one. Not even a broody, bossy, gorgeous biker aiming for my race spot and heart.  Complete standalone/HEA/No cheating/Over The Top Alpha",
