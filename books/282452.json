  "description": "Oh! The snowy night the stars are brightly shining It is the night of the lumberjackâ€™s big fall Long lay his heart in eternal slumber Till she appeared and his soul felt enthralled A thrill of hope the romance world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious tale Swipe open your Kindles And read the latest story Of slight surly Conn And of Faith who brought new hope",
