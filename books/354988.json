  "description": "Mia was all set for Christmas. She had the turkey and the cranberry sauce, a big bone for Murphy and a juicy herring for Mopp, the mistletoe and the decorations. All she needed now was a tree. But on her way to get one, she stopped to help an old man who had slipped on the ice. Then she stopped to help a little boy who had lost his cap. Before she knew it, it was too late to get a tree. Christmas without a Christmas tree just isn't the same, Mia said sadly. And then, there was a knock at the door.",
