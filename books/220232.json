  "description": "Back on the streets of what they used to call home, Travis and his friends must face the abandoned world the Scytharene have left behind. They have escaped alien captivity; if only that meant they were safe. As they struggle to put their lives and relationships back together, they find they are not the only ones to have escaped the alien slave harvest. The promise of more survivors brings both a new hopeâ€”and new dangers. As they get ready for the final battle against the invaders, the truth becomes clear: the hardest work of today is planting the seeds of tomorrow.",
