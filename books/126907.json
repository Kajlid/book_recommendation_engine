  "description": "Murder is Getting to be a Habit!With the press accusing him of every crime since Jack the Ripper (including Don Masson's missed penalty against Peru in 1978), Scotland's most notorious - and misunderstood - serial killer, Barney Thomson, is on the run.The Holy Order of the Monks of St John seems the ideal hide-out for a sad little Glasgow barber with a fear of small talk. As \"Brother Jacob\" he's even managing to keep his hand in with some part-time barbery - even if his legendary creative genius is limited to just three styles (Mike McShane in \"Robin Hood\", Sean Connery In \"The Name of the Rose\" and \"Cadfael\".)Only with the police hot on his trail, Brother Jacob has just discovered that he's chosen the only monastery in Britain that already has its full complement of serial killers!",
