  "description": "A deal with a notorious rake may be her only hope. In a desperate search for her missing sister, Lady Natalia Abbingale is out of money, out of options, and out of hope—until she spies the one man that may be the key to finding her sister—the Marquess of Lockston. He was a rake. A connoisseur of young widows. She knew that. But he was also the only man that could help her.  Fletcher Williston, the eleventh Marquess of Lockston, had been minding his own business in the brothel, never imaging he was being watched. That is, until Lady Natalia appears at his home, demanding he help her to find her sister. Refusing her should be easy. He has secrets he must live his life by. And those secrets did not need to be threatened by a downfallen lady of the ton.  Yet Lady Natalia possesses the right family, the right veneer, and most importantly, the right circumstance—desperation—and a deal made with her could possibly be just what he is looking for.  Note: The books in the Lords of Action series by K.J. Jackson are each stand-alone stories, and can be read individually in any order. These historical romances are set in the Regency and Victorian eras, and do not shy away from scenes with steamy heat, occasional naughty language, and moments that might possibly make you squirm.",
