  "description": "At first Alexandra thought it was a dream. She would just lie there in the forest, quite still, until she really woke up. But the birdlike little girl tugged at her hand again. She tried to explain: \"I'm Zan, and I'm lost.\" The little girl only smiled, clearly not understanding.That was how Alexandra Scarsdale first encountered the Orathi, the gentle forest-dwellers. She woke from her own private sorrow into a mysterious, peaceful world that seemed removed from time. The Orathi called her 'Tsan, which in their language meant stranger; but as she learned their words and their ways it became clear that she had been sent to them for some special purpose. And when emissaries from the City came with their cruel demands, Zan knew what her destiny was. Only she could protect her new friends from the peril that threatened them.Zan's quest was to take her far into alien lands, and it brought her a little band of companions whose unexpected talents combined with hers to win a surprising success. Colors in the Dreamweaver's Loom is a fantasy in the grand tradition, filled with varied and fascinating characters and rich in color and adventure.",
