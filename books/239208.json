  "description": "The Criticized Eldest Sister... Do family members demand more from her? Did society create unwritten rules for her? Does our birth order influence the way others perceive and treat us?Have you ever wondered how the eldest sister's psyche is formed? Birth order studies may vary, but several conclude that many first-borns are hard-working, conscientious and natural born leaders. However, are these characteristics innate or are they drilled into the oldest daughter?Many elder sisters play a key role in supporting their families and others. Yet, in spite of their efforts, many of them repeatedly find themselves criticized and misunderstood. Demands from others seemingly come by default whether you are the oldest sister by birth or have adopted this role.Martha, Martha offer readers a different view of this woman from the Bible and all eldest daughters. Get ready for an enlightening and thought-provoking experience while looking in depth into the mindset behind the behavior of these women in your life. You will be challenged to see Martha, and every eldest daughter you know â€“ sisters, mothers, grandmothers, wives, aunts, cousins, friends, and colleagues from a fresh perspective.",
