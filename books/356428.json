  "title": "A Children's Treasury of Milligan: Classic Stories & Poems",
  "description": "This unique anthology of Spike's poems and stories for children presents his classic children's books in a way they have never been seen before. The large format gives ample scope to make the most of Spike's own illustrations, lovingly coloured specially for this book. The anthology comprises Silly Verse For Kids (1959), The Bald Twit Lion (1968), A Book of Milliganimals (1968). Unspun Socks From A Chicken's Laundry (1981), Sir Nobonk and the Terrible, Awful, Dreadful, naughty, Nasty Dragon (1982) and Startling Verse For All The Family (1987). Spike does not regard children as small grown-ups, but as an entirely different species who live in a secret, magical world which very few adults understand. His poems were inspired by listening to his own children, and subsequently his grandchildren, and marvelling at the way they could invent new words or incorporate sound effects into their everyday language. In 'borrowing' their language, Spike has created a range of poems and stories which are a delight to read to younger children, for older children to read themselves, or for grown-ups recapture some of the magic.",
