  "description": "I come to Jotunheim to fight and conquer such evil giants as you are...In the action-packed stories of Norse mythology, both gods and mortal heroes speak loudly and swing mighty weapons. In A. & E. Keary's dramatic retelling of those beloved myths, a wise hero named Odin rules the great city of Asgard, keeping watch over the earth and waging war against evil giants.Tales of Norse Mythology relates his remarkable exploits, along with those of many others, including Thor, Odin's headstrong, warlike son; Baldur, who awoke to find the shadow of death in his heart; and Frey, the king of the elves who brought summer wherever he went. There are treacherous villains, like Loki, who became wicked upon discovering the half-burnt heart of a woman. Mythical creatures abound, from the great and fearful serpent Jormungand to mischievous dwarfs working in gold and diamond mines. The stories also lead readers through fantastic realms like the Abodes of Death, with its beds of unrest, curtains of weariness, and walls of despair. In Tales of Norse Mythology you will discover:  What Odin gave up for a draught of wisdom  Why cunning dwarfs mixed the blood of a giant with honey to make a golden mead  Which mysterious maidens run the golden threads of time through their cold fingers  What happens to those who ate Iduna's powerful apples  What Tyr sacrificed to keep others safe from the savage wolf Fenrir  How the mischievous Loki was severely punished for his evil-doings  And much more! Illustrated throughout, this handsome volume will keep readers completed engrossed in these dramatic myths of valor, magic, and danger.",
