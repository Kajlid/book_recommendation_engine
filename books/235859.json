  "description": "Ivy Towers is working hard to get Miss Bitty’s Bygone Bookstore on its feet in Winter Break, Kansas, when she discovers a map hidden inside an old music box. Could the map lead her to the Lost Gambler’s Gold? The legend of the ill-fated 1860s gambler had circulated among residents for as long as Ivy can remember. But when Ivy follows the directions to where “X” marks the spot, what she digs up uncovers a mystery that leads to more than she ever imagined. Lives will be changed, old secrets revealed, and Ivy will learn that lost treasure can sometimes turn out to be much more valuable than a chest full of gold.",
