  "description": "A hot baseball romance by bestselling author Mindy Klasky. If you can't take the heat… Chef Ashley Harris wants to own a restaurant – that's why she attended culinary school, and that's why she's working for the world's most lecherous restaurateur. Raleigh Rockets third baseman Josh Cantor wants to launch his investment restaurant with the family recipes he loved growing up. Josh has been promised that treasure trove – but only if he can convince his grandmother that he's dating again, after a traumatic divorce. When a cooking reality show comes to Raleigh, Ashley and Josh must compete against each other to achieve their dreams – even when the flames in the bedroom roar higher than the ones in their kitchens. In the end, only one of them can win Who Wears the Apron. Will their relationship survive this trial by fire?",
