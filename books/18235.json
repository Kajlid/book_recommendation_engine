They are Rizzoli's only clues, but they're enough for her and pathologist Maura Isles to make a startling discovery: this violent death had a chilling prequel.Nineteen years earlier, a horrifying murder-suicide in a Chinatown restaurant left five people dead. But one woman connected to that massacre is still alive: a mysterious and beautiful martial arts master who knows a secret that lives and breathes in the shadows of Chinatown.It soon becomes clear that this is an evil that has killed before and will kill again - unless Jane and Maura can track it down, and defeat it.",
