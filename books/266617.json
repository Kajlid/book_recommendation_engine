  "description": "My dreams were always in black and white, once in a while, I’d be gifted something gray.  Until her.  Then, I broke her. I tore her up. I shattered her. But she was breathing, living, and I knew damn well, she was on the verge of loving, but it couldn’t be me.  I turned from her for the red white and blue. Because war, destruction, hell even death was more welcome than the possibility of hurting her.  I didn’t deserve her, and she sure as f*@^ didn’t deserve me.",
