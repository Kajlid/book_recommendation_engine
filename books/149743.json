She and her mate, Learden, are separated, along with her son, Peter; and she is left trying to keep her army hidden from the king, by constantly moving; while she tries to find them.

As the story unfolds, it soon becomes clear to her that it is not the king they are really fighting, but a foe much more dangerous than once thought. As more of the prophesy is divulged, she begins her training for a much bigger role than she expected. She will soon become the most powerful being on the planet, and her mettle will be tested to its fullest. Even though her life is in constant danger she is determined to save the lives of those around her at the peril of her own life. This is the story of how an entire planet bands together to save, not only their lives but their world. And even though they know that many will die; they do it gladly under the guidance of one who has spent most of her life on another planet, in another galaxy.",
