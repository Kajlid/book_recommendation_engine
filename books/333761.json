  "description": "“It’s probably nothing….”Usually, when Victor Bayne is called upon to investigate a ghostly apparition, the “haunting” can be chalked up to a perfectly mundane cause. When he’s sent to check out some suspicious phenomena in small-town Iowa—and no one seems unduly alarmed—he’s hoping for more of a weekend getaway. Especially since he’s bringing along Jacob as his Stiff.He ends up finding way more than he bargained for. Women undressing in public—with no memory of doing so. A car rental agent who knows far more than she should. And a shocking discovery they must keep to themselves at all costs.Instead of merely supporting Vic, Jacob finds himself thrust into the driver’s seat, using a talent that’s clumsy and untested. And when Vic starts acting just as strange as the stripping women, all bets are off.Can Vic and Jacob get a handle on the situation before FPMP National storms in and shuts them down for good?PsyCop is an ongoing series filled with supernatural action and delightfully awkward humor–with a steady undercurrent of gay romance. It’s best read in order, so if you’re new to the series, start with PsyCop #1, Among the Living…and prepare for a hauntingly good read.",
