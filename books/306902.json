  "description": "JASPERI didn’t plan to kidnap her. I was just doing a good deed. I saw a car stranded on the side of the road in the middle of a snowstorm and decided to help—didn’t expect to get anything out of it.Even criminals can do nice things every once in a while. When I approached the driver, my motives were as pure as the snowflakes clinging to the silky strands of her long, dark hair. Her tire had popped and she didn’t know how to change it. Clearly, the damsel was in distress. Unfortunately for her, I’m no white knight. Now, I’m a decisive man. Once I make a decision, it’s pretty much a done deal—and it didn’t take me long to decide Autumn was going home with me for the holidays, whether she wanted to or not. I was prepared for stealing Autumn to change my plans, but I wasn’t prepared for her to be such a quick study. I may be the one who stole a girlfriend for Christmas, but if I’m not careful, this pretty little snowflake just might steal my heart. **How the Hitman Stole Christmas is a full-length, standalone novel.",
