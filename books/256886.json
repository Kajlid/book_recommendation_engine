The chase is on when the assassins find out that they have been discovered. In his small motorboat, Peter leads them in the falling darkness through the hazardous channels of the boggy terrain where they finally find refuge and think they are safe. However, the next morning, Brigid has vanished. The ensuing rescue mission leads Peter into a Gordian knot of political and religious intrigue involving the Blueshirts--an Irish Fascist group--including Major Adler, a Nazi agent; Abbot Jonathan, the rheumy-eyed abbot of a local monastery; and Kincade, the ruthless enforcer. A shared objective unites them silence Peter Coltrane. Peter must race against the clock to save Brigid. But will good trump evil, and at what cost?",
