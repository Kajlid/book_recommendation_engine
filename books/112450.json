  "description": "Veronica’s werewolf tattoos mark her as the mate of two sexy insatiable alphas, Rafe and Slade, identical dark-haired hunks. Together their powers and their pleasures are amplified. They teach her when to control her inner wolf and when to let it run free. Veronica wants to tell her friends everything only she fears they won’t be able to handle the truth that she is a werewolf. And even if they can adapt to the reality that the supernatural world exists, will they accept that she loves both men? Whether they find out or not may be out of her hands. The full moon is rising and danger is closer to her friends than she realizes. Danger is no problem for Rafe and Slade. They are virtually invincible. The only thing stronger than their power together is their love for Veronica. When she gets an ominous warning that their bond will endanger everyone, she would rather kill the messenger of this bleak prophecy than give it any credence. The girl with the werewolf tattoo won’t let anything separate her from her gorgeous blue-eyed alphas. Not fate. Not fear. Not even death. This book is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.",
