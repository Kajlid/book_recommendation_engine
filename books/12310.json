  "description": "History opens itself to you in this book.

As you proceed through this engrossing narrative, you'll find some troubling facts about the modern world as well; such as the fact that the workers of the world have indeed been robbed, but not by capitalists, and that the Rule of Law actually ended two centuries ago.
