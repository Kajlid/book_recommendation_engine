It was all in a pattern, hard to describe, but somehow like when you finally understand someone who you’ve been trying to figure out for a long, long time. Everything clicked into place.

It was all there, enveloping me with perfection.\"When head-driven Med student Adam has an emotional vision of Claire, he doesn’t yet understand the dimensions by which his life is about to change. His new ability to sense people’s feelings is only the beginning of the roller coaster of supernatural he is thrown onto as he sets out to find Claire. There is an unknown heritage slumbering within him, waiting to be unleashed. And his love for her puts them both in danger.
