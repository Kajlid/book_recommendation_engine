  "description": "Chan Kim has never felt like an outsider in his life. That is, not until his family moves from L.A. to a tiny town in Minnesota--Land of 10,000 Lakes--and probably 10,000 hicks,too. The Kims are the only Asian family in town, and when Chan and his twin sister, Young, attend high school, it's a blond-haired, blue-eyed whiteout.Chan throws himself into the only game in town--football--and the necessary roughness required to make a player. On the field it means \"justifiable violence,\" but as Chan is about to discover, off the field it's a whole different ballgame.",
