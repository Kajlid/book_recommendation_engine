  "description": "Emily is beautiful, successful, but has no love life – not with a real man anyway. Involved in the hottest sexual relationship of her life with the ultimate man of her dreams, lately she’s been waking up before the job is finished. Determined to start living her life again in the real world, she banishes him from her nights. An immortal Seducer created to fulfill sexual fantasies, Devan takes the rejection personally. Determined to correct the error, he visits the earth to seduce Emily in person. Only allowed one full cycle of the moon, he arrogantly assumes that she will capitulate immediately. The only catch…he can’t tell her who he really is, or he will return to the void forever. While Devan learns about life and love in the mortal realm, with humorous and poignant results, Emily learns to trust her own feelings as their sexual passion for each other escalates. But time is running out for them as rules are broken and Fate intervenes. Can their love for each other survive across dimensions when he must return to his own?visit http://lauraeno.com",
