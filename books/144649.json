A balance enforced by ruthless double-dealing, blackmail and a special cadre of secret watchmen. Now, armed with a mysterious substance that turns men into ravening ghouls, the Count is prepared to upset the balance. Installing himself as Underking, master of all crime in the city. Thief battles thief as the city threatens to erupt in violence. Then Heden returns from the forest. Prepared to exact vengeance against the bishop, he finds Vanora caught up in the Count's lethal scheming. Before he can act, he must ensure her safety. He can stand against the count, the guilds, even the bishop. But he cannot do it alone.",
