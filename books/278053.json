  "description": "Curiosity can be a curse, and just like the proverbial cat, feisty Shandra Covington could soon end up dead. As a newspaper reporter, Shandra meets unusual people every day. But Pinky Templeton is the first one who has claimed, quite vocally, to be dead! She would just ignore him as another nutcase, except life-threatening events are happening to those close to her. And Pinky seems to be involved although official records show he died in 1957. Now that he's gone and died again, Shandra feels she must find out the truth even if her police officer friend Bobby Richter doesn't want to help. After all, how many times can one man die? With Pinky, it's hard to tell. Feel the rain pounding on your face as you shiver along with the interesting, and often funny, characters in this rollercoaster of a mystery that will leave you wanting another ride.",
