  "description": "Megara never imagined meeting Hercules while trapped in the cave of the Nemean lion. Hercules is drawn to Meg like a magnet to iron even before learning she is the rebel daughter of King Creon. After a long, sweaty afternoon in the lion's cave, Hercules can't get Megara out of his mind. He shouldn't see her again. People feared his strength and anyone associated with him was in danger. Against all reason, he invites Megara to help him slay the Lernean hydra, his second labor. A trained warrior, she agrees immediately. Her body rises to Hercules' touch like steam, but she tells herself he is just for fun. She cannot fall in love again. Will Hercules pay the price for putting Meg's life at risk? Can Meg's heart withstand the charms of a demigod? Ravished by Hercules is the first a series of Hercules erotica.",
