  "description": "Molly Shaman is the CIA's most exotic assassin. She insists on first dining with her victim, then sleeping with him, before rubbing him out.Molly's current target is Aaron Lamb, an Al-Qaeda operative buying black market arms in Germany and shipping them to Afghanistan. The CIA wants him reliably and expediently slabbed. Molly has decided to bring him down with \"the Dew of Heaven,\" a concoction of poisons designed to thwart any antidote he may have on hand, or may have taken in advance.The precaution is necessary, since Lamb has been alerted a hit man is on his trail. Fortunately for Molly, he thinks all hit men are male.Unfortunately for Molly, he's tipped off in time to insist that Molly drink the poison herself.The CIA codenamed Molly \"Praying Mantis\" with good reason. First she's going to wine and dine you, then she's going to have her way with you. Afterwards she's going to send you to your maker. And all three experiences will be the most exquisite of your abruptly truncated life.",
