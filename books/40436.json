  "description": "When Kate Watzen sees her future in a dream, she can hardly believe the life of a Chosen could really be hers. After all, their abilities and Gifts are the stuff of legends, and she's had no training to draw out those Gifts, unlike the other teenagers on her planet. Despite her concerns, she goes to Meeting anyway, only to discover she is exactly what the Chosen have been waiting for. Moving from her small farming community to study at a school full of hundreds of aliens, Kate's Gifts begin to manifest, drawing her into the focus of a ruthless man, Lord Ruark, who wishes to use her abilities to gain access to an object of great knowledge and power, the Book of the Golden One. Kate's unwillingness to help him leads to a confrontation endangering all those she loves, including her best friend, Ben, who will do anything to protect her, and her new crush, James, whose mysterious past may lead her to more danger than she realizes. Through these trials, Kate discovers the strength that has been dormant within her, showing her that she is anything but ordinary, and the small town life she had was full of mystery, adventure, intrigue, and a betrayal far beyond anything she could have imagined.",
