  "description": "Zee Tees Off. Post-Apartheid South Africa seen through the eyes of 15 years old golf fanatic, Zee. Its Cape Town in 2003 and Zee’s mum tragically dies. The fight for custody is vicious between her dad and aunt. Zee has limited agency as a child, and this threatens her dream that one day, she’ll be the best golfer in the world. There’s still racism all around. Hundreds die every day through HIV & Aids, Gender-Based Violence and child abuse are endemic. Corrupt politicians rule the day. Gangs rule the night. Zee’s teen years mirror South Africa’s post-apartheid growing pains. Zee must learn to love what’s good is in herself and others–and change that which isn’t. A book about bravery, optimism and hope in the face of loss – even if, along the way, the journey is hard. Zee’s attitude looks set to be the most important club in her bag. It will be tough, but can a girl from the grimy, dusty township wish for a better playground? Honestly? (less)",
