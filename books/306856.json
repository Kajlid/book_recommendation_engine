  "title": "Worse Than Dead: Survival in the Zombie Apocalypse",
  "description": "Kelly and Rob witnessed the fall of civilization and are barely surviving in a city overrun by the ravenous, reanimated dead. Every day presents a new challenge and the hungry corpses wandering the streets arenâ€™t their only problem. Food is scarce, infrastructure is collapsing, technology is gone and the few other, remaining living can be a greater threat than the dead. Surviving means constantly running, hiding and when there are no other options, fighting. Kelly and Rob decide they want something more from life, if they can only live long enough to figure out what that is. But, being alive in the zombie apocalypse is a condition that can change in an instant, and often does.",
