  "description": "Reno Gabrini believes his number one job is to protect his family. His beautiful wife, Trina, and their two sons are the very reason he gets out of bed every morning. But when he returns home from a business trip to find his wife partnering with people he barely knows, a gold digging female attempting to worm her way into the family, and a lovesick son with a dead body in his trunk, he knows his job has gotten that much harder. He takes charge, believing there’s more going on than meets the eye, but his family insists he’s overreacting and is being, as usual, overly protective of them. Until the lid blows off of their idyllic life and plunges all of them into a world of passion and obsession where Reno begins to believe that all of their unsolicited drama may be disguising another mob war.In the sixth installment of the Mob Boss series, Reno Gabrini comes face to face with his greatest fears and is forced to put it all on the line in ways that nearly costs him everything.THE BESTSELLING MOB BOSS SERIES IN ORDER:ROMANCING THE MOB BOSSMOB BOSS 2: THE HEART OF THE MATTERMOB BOSS 3: LOVE AND RETRIBUTIONMOB BOSS 4: ROMANCING TRINA GABRINIA MOB BOSS CHRISTMAS: THE PREGNANCY",
