  "description": "Orlando Saxton still does not know that his father hired for him a blind assistant. Seductive and arrogant plastic surgeon, the last scion of the Saxton family is so accustomed to the extreme reactions he provokes in women that he needs more and more exciting diversions to be satisfied. Moreover, the dissolute women he usually dates are more than happy to offer help. Maya O'Byrne, so used to getting by stirring trust in others and sensing danger, remains puzzled by the unusual scent that constantly surrounds her new boss: a dark smell of wild and tropical forest. But will imagination - so developed in people like her- be enough to prepare Maya for the truth? And above all, will Orlando 's heart be able to withstand a candor so fearless and lethal?Original italian title: Jaguar√†",
