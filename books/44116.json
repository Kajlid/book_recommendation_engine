  "description": "Riley is one of the best hackers around. She’s always kept her online identity separate from her real life…mostly because she doesn’t have much of a real life. But someone is stalking her through the network. Someone who knows about the big job she just pulled off and won’t stop ’til he finds out who she is. Two years ago, CJ was a hacker at the top of his game, until he got caught. Now the prisoner of a ruthless corporation, he is forced to hunt down his former friends and colleagues. He finds himself irresistibly drawn to the woman he knows only by her alias, Samantha, as he traces her from virtual nightclubs to the dark streets of the Manhattan sprawl. But when Riley and CJ’s relationship crosses over into real life, things get dangerous.",
