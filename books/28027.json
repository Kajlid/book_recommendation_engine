  "description": "\"I'll Be A Stranger To You\" is a portrait of a modern Mormon struggle, a man of good conscience divided between desire and faith. A young software pro returns to Moscow troubled by carnal memories of his old missionary companion. His wife stays in Boston, waiting for him to return, to build a happy family and a Mormon way of life. But it's the end of the 1990's, the end of Russia's gold-rush era, and the end of ideals stretched beyond good use. The novel was awarded 1st place in the Utah Art Council's writing competition (2007), where Kevin McIlvoy offered high \"'I'll Be A Stranger To You' asks us to confront what prayers can be said that will return a person's innocence, what blessings can be given that will return a person's beliefs. It is an excellent novel of conscience.\"Cara Diaconoff has been the recipient of several residencies, including The MacDowell Colony and Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. She lives in Seattle and is the author of \"Unmarriageable Stories\" (2008) from Lewis-Clark Press. For further reading and related video, start at Cara on @cdiacono.",
