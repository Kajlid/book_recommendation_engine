  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Lexa Tate isn’t having a great night. Her sister’s constant yammering sends her outside to get some peace and quiet, but her walk isn’t all that peaceful, or quiet, when a car tries to run her over. If the seriously cute Brennan Ward hadn’t been there, she would have been road kill.With the ability to relive her own memories in full-color, Lexa replays the attempted hit-and-run and realizes something that shocks her more than almost being run over: the car didn’t have a driver.Reluctantly, she shares what she knows with Brennan, but he doesn’t sound surprised. He actually believes her and knows why. But that’s one secret he’s not sharing.",
