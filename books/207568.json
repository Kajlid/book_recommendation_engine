  "description": "A dark, desperate tale of greed, crime, drugs, family, fear – and commercial crab fishing.Brothers Adrian and Matty Collins are close to rock bottom: sick of the sight of each other and barely scraping a living from the only job they have ever known: crab fishing off the south coast. Every day is a depressing repeat of the one that has gone before - until a discovery in a remote spot of the English Channel changes everything. It could be the best thing that has ever happened to them – or is it the worst?Pot Luck is a thriller with sinister twists, a raggedy mob of opportunists and bottom-feeders, and an ocean of bad blood.Nick Fisher is a BAFTA-winning TV scriptwriter and series creator who has also gained a diverse range of writing credits in film, radio, stage, print journalism and books.
