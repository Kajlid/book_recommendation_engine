  "title": "Eve of the Fae",
  "description": "When Faerie tale dreams come true, nightmare creatures can be deadly.  Eve doesn’t believe in magic or fate. But, when her carefully ordered life begins to unravel, she decides to take a chance and follow her recurring dream of the legendary Faerie Queen to Lydbury Manor, her uncle's family estate in England. Maybe spending the Christmas holiday with her aunt and uncle will help her sort out her future and solve a family mystery.  As a member of the Fae High Court, Liam should be fighting on the front lines with his cousins, not cooped up in Lydbury Manor masquerading as a human and playing secretary to an elderly professor. But he still hasn’t completed his mission, and he’s running out of time. The Wild Hunt will ride again at the Winter Solstice unless he can find and destroy the artifact that will stop the spirit of Lord Edric from laying waste to the remaining Fae.  Forced to work together, and failing to fight their mutual attraction, Liam and Eve are caught between deadly Fae laws and the Spirit of a madman. Survival will mean surrendering control and rediscovering strength.  Award winning finalist in the 2017 San Francisco Area Romance Writers' Heart to Heart Contest and finalist for the 2018 Daphne du Maurier Award presented by the Kiss of Death Romance Writers.",
