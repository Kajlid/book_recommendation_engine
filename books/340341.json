  "description": "Solstice Macaffey was the world’s most powerful and glamorous witch. Achieving unparalleled influence and dominance. Breaking barriers, as well as, hearts and heads along the way. But that was such a very long time ago. Now, nearing the end of her life, Solstice is an old and angry witch living in a dilapidated brownstone with her cantankerous housekeeper, Constance. She has been reduced to children’s ridicule and taunts, subsisting on little more than vodka and recollections. When one day Newel, a precocious ten year-old boy, arrives with the potent “Is you a witch?” Sanguine at the notion of taking on an apprentice, Solstice sweeps Newel into the story of her nefarious, violent and often campy rise to power. Leading frogs in revolt, bewitching boys to procure love, cavorting with demons dripping with saccharine duplicity, she enchants him. Solstice has deceived, betrayed, used, neutralized or killed everyone, foe and friend, on her meteoric and scandalous journey to become the ruler of the world. But just when she realizes that Newel may be her one chance at redemption he is snatched away by poverty, addiction, neglect and abuse. To save Newel, she must battle the evils of her past or else they will both suffer eternal damnation.",
