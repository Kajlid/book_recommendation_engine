  "description": "After gaining twenty pounds, former Dairy Festival Queen Annie Winston dreads going back to Big Knob, Indiana, feeling like a dairy cow. But if Annie has changed, so has her quirky home town. A matchmaking witch and wizard have moved into the neighborhood…and they've found the perfect match for Annie. Shy computer whiz Jeremy Dunstan secretly lusted after Annie when they were teenagers, but he never had the courage to pursue her. Now he has a second chance, but only if he can unleash his wild side. It's the sort of transformation that requires confidence, determination…and a little hex.
