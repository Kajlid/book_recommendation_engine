  "title": "Atheists Are More Intelligent? Refuting That Old Atheist Myth",
  "description": "This is a short ebook addressing the claim that atheists are smarter than non-atheists. This ebook exposes how that claim is a lie based on atheists misrepresenting and misinterpreting data to suit their agenda.We find that atheists aren't more intelligent, in fact, according to The Psychology of Atheism, many atheists became atheists for motivational reasons rather than rational reasons during their adolescence suggesting a link between emotional thinking and atheism. (Source The Psychology of Atheism [2013]. Oxford Handbook of Atheism Page 470) This seems to be reinforced by the fact that many atheists use emotional arguments to support atheism (i.e \"bad things happen in the world ergo god doesn't exist\").",
