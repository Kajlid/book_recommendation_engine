This collection of Christmas tales from the Black Meadow contains three new Yuletide stories. Experience a beautiful inversion of The Nativity inA Black Meadow Christmas, warm your toes in a tale of matriarchal terror inThe Meadow Treeand marvel at the delightful wonders ofThe Black Star. You will also find details ofideal gifts you could give and games that you can play when visiting the Black Meadow. With beautiful illustrations by Andy Paciorek and Nigel Wilson, this is a festive treat that will bring joy and fear in equal measure to your Christmas celebrations.
