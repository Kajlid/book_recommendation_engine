  "title": "Go Home!",
  "description": "An anthology of Asian diasporic writers musing on the notion of \"home\"—and the possibilities of outsiderhood and belonging. “I read this book and see my people—see us—and feel, in our collective outsiderhood, at home.” —Ocean Vuong, Night Sky with Exit Wounds “To be from nowhere is the state of Asian diaspora, but there is also a wild humor and imagination that comes from being underestimated, rarely counted, hardly seen. Here, we begin to draw the hopeful outlines of a collective history for those so disparate yet often lumped together.” —Jenny Zhang, Sour Heart Asian diasporic writers imagine “home” in the twenty-first century through an array of fiction, memoir, and poetry. Both urgent and meditative, this anthology moves beyond the model-minority myth and showcases the singular intimacies of individuals figuring out what it means to belong.",
