  "description": "Prince Raine has only one chance to escape a miserable life—find an alpha husband before the end of the marriage circuit. With the threat of being banished to the priory hanging over his head, Raine will do whatever it takes to find himself a husband. Even visit Stormshield, a remote kingdom no omega prince ever sets foot on. A kingdom that just so happens to have three eligible alphas. Prince Darien has all but given up on the idea of marriage after years of being snubbed by royal omegas. He has far more important things to worry about, like the pirates besieging their island kingdom. When an omega finally does step off the airship, Darien has no interest in a wedding. But he's not given a choice—this marriage represents an alliance his kingdom cannot refuse. Bound to each other only hours after meeting, Raine and Darien face a rocky road. One wants this marriage at all costs, and the other resents being forced to marry the son of an enemy to keep the peace. They're both hiding secrets, but in Stormshield Kingdom, secrets never stay hidden for long. Omega’s Gamble is a slow burn m/m shifter romance with a dash of magic. It features an arranged marriage, two stubborn princes, pirates, and a mysterious kingdom. It contains mpreg and mature themes.",
