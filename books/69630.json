  "description": "The realm of Queen Arianna is a kingdom of beauty and peace. She rules with gentility, love and a velvet glove, beloved by all her people. Amidst the tranquility of her reign there is a breed of men, warriors and pirates, knights and knaves, that engage in back-alley duels.  These are the \"Rogue Blades.\" They battle for the entertainment of the masses and the coins that they throw. Her subjects, bored by the peaceful era of Arianna, crave the clashing of weapons, the ringing of swords, and the taking of lives. Disturbed by the violent blood sport that is staining her reign, the Queen has ordered her Royal Guard to put an end to these contests. In the dueling world, Dave the Knave, self-proclaimed Greatest Swordsman That Has Ever Lived, hears about the growing fame of Sir James the Great Knight, seconded by the faithful Squire Paul. Dave believes that they are on a collison course, headed for a battle of epic proportions. Will they meet before the Royal Guard brings an end to the street duels? Or is there something even more ominous in store for everyone?",
