  "description": "The Wrong Todd is a contemporary romantic comedy by USA Today Bestselling Author, Donna McDonald. This standalone story is a steamy romance for the romance over 30 crowd who are looking for love a little later in life.What is the craziest thing you would be willing to do for a friend?After winning her bid at the bachelor auction, Sabine vows she is never doing another embarrassing favor for a friend. This is especially true for favors that involve spending large sums of money and buying men whose last names she doesn't even know.In twenty bachelors, Sabine expected to find several Davids, Mikes, or Johns. But what were the odds of two Todds?And now what is she going to do on a very expensive date with the wrong one? This story is a humorous steamy romance which is one of my favorites to write. If you like this book, you'll like all of my work. The comedy situations are both sexy and funny, and there is lots of flirting. You can count on an absolute HEA in this story. It has lots of humor and is guaranteed to make you laugh. Plus, it has a Hawaiian hero who is very much an alpha male.",
