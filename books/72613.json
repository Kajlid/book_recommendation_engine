  "description": "Jamie McAlister has resigned herself to the fact that in this job market, her painfully expensive degree might only get her a position at Starbucks, when she suddenly lands a prestigious internship at the White House. Although she doesn't hit it off with the other interns, lockjaws who come from so much money that ten weeks without a paycheck doesn't faze them; she is eager to work hard and make the best of the opportunity while it lasts.An unexpected encounter late one evening with the charismatic President Gregory Rutland seems like just a fleeting flirtation, but when he orchestrates clandestine meetings and late-night phone calls, their relationship quickly escalates. Jamie knows what she is doing is wrong: he's married, he has kids, he's the President. Yet each time she tries to extricate herself, Greg pulls her back in.With the conflicted desires of the most powerful man in the world driving her to her breaking point, Jamie can't help but divulge intimate details to those closest to her. But she must have confided in the wrong person, because she soon finds herself, and everyone she cares about, facing calculated public destruction at the hands of Greg's political enemies, and perhaps no matter how much he cares about her at the hands of Greg himself.",
