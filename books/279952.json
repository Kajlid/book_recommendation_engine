  "description": "'Now - now I want to write recollections of my own country. Yes, I want to write about my own country till I simply exhaust my store. Not only because it is a \"sacred debt\" that I pay to my country because my brother and I were born there, but also because in my thoughts I range with him over all the remembered places. I am never far away from them. I long to renew them in writing.' In numerous letters and journals, Katherine Mansfield recorded her feelings, thoughts and observations about writing, about the New Zealand of her childhood, the Europe of her later years, the people she encountered, the every day and the extraordinary. This classic selection - the only one available that combines material from both her letters and journals - brings together the pieces that most illuminate her character, her life and her stories. Chosen by renowned scholar and acclaimed writer C.K. Stead, they are a lively and informative entree to one of our most gifted writers.Contents:1. New Zealand, 1907-82. Bavaria, 1909-103.
