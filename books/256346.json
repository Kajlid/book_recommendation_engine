Descriptions are accompanied by essays on the reproduction, classification, economics, and ecology of non-tropical marine algae. Individual algae are illustrated, as they appear in nature, in over 100 full-page black and white drawings by the noted Cape Cod artists Marcia and Edward Norman. The authors have revised the text of the first edition extensively and brought it fully up to date with the latest scientific discoveries. This easy-to-carry paperback edition is suitable for use at the seashore.",
