  "description": "A Time of PerilThe Inquisitor, Carlos Vicente Solitario, charges a young Jewish midwife, Ruth bas Elazar Saul, with heresy. Ruth may be the daughter of the city's chief rabbi, but this is no protection against the Inquisition's accusations.A Quest for JusticeDetlef von Tennen, nobleman and canon, cousin to the Archbishop, suspects that something other than religion drives Solitario to persecute Ruth. Determined to ensure that justice is done, Detlef joins the investigation--and finds his passions fully aroused by Ruth's impressive intelligence and darkly exotic beauty.Two Hearts' DesiresAll her life, Ruth bas Elazar Saul has thirsted for knowledge, despite the price she paid by concealing her gender and being cast out of her father's house. Her faith sustains her through all, even the attentions of the Inquisition. Then, in the very heart of danger, God blesses her with the greatest love she has ever known.",
