  "description": "I was walking down and road. I had no idea who or where I was. I had no place that I was going. I was really just wandering. I needed a friend and a point of reference.  The village that I entered was small. The friend that I found was a young woman in a hood and tunic that covered her from head to foot and I had no idea what she looked like. She spoke well enough and was gracious and helpful, and she wanted to help me navigate my circumstances, but she wasn’t thinking that she could be my friend.  She was “Nogud”. I didn’t know what that was, and I had no idea what she looked like under there, but I knew that I needed her and I liked her. And I knew that I was a little afraid because that was all that I knew.  That was the first day. A few days later, I was “The Wizard of Bonvale” and I knew the girl, the nogud, very well indeed. She was bright and funny and marvelously sexual.  I didn’t know where I came from, but I knew that I was staying here.  This is the first book in my story, The Nogud Legacy, Book 1: The Wanderer.  Warning…or perhaps enticements: The story of The Nogud is filled with mysteries, humor, good friendships, a bit of martial arts, post-apocalyptic fantasy, robots, and later on in the series, horrible monsters… and a lot of sex and casual nudity. The culture where our hero lives has a tradition of having more than one mate, so that’s where the sex comes into it. His story doesn’t shy away from the graphic details of any of it. It’s an adventure story for mature adults. A vicarious romp with heroes, nymphs, and pixies. Maybe you will enjoy it. Writing it was certainly a lot of fun.",
