  "description": "Describe your professor. a.) Older Man b.) Teacher c.) Best Friend’s Dad d.) All of the above Correct answer below  Teacher student relations are strictly off limits. But this possessive professor puts college rules to the test for the first time when he protects me from some cocky coeds.  His picture should be in the dictionary under tall, dark, and handsome. But he’s also the definition of first time crush. As in mine.  But he’s not just an outrageously hot older man, he’s also my best friend’s dad.  And when word gets out that he doesn’t tolerate even the slightest disrespect towards women every sexy student is looking for a little teacher student romance.  But he tells me he’s not into meaningless things with random people and that he’s only ever wanted me and only me, and that gives him all the extra credit in my book. And when I see just how possessive he can really become I have to admit I’m a little taken aback, but I’m also quickly turning to putty in this possessive professor’s hands.  But when his lecture on biology turns into schooling me in the art of baby making I know he’s the kind of supportive older man who will give this younger woman room to grow, both in my own career and into the big family I’ve always wanted.  School’s in session and this perfect professor is the ultimate teacher student fantasy not just for a college romance, but for forever.  Correct answer: If you guessed “D” you get an “A+” :)  *Possessive Professor is an insta-everything standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
