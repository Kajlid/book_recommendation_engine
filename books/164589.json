  "description": "The 2016 EPIC eBook Awards Winner for Best Mystery!  The Magnolia Parish Sheriff’s Office is on high alert after a deadly sniper begins executing high-ranking cops. Sheriff Burke puts his best sniper, London Carter, and his internal affairs officer, Bethany Riggs, on the case. Pressure mounts and panic sets in as the body count rises and the killer becomes more embolden. London and Bethany find themselves sifting through evidence, lies, and feelings for each other in their quest to stop the deadly attacks. A mysterious note at the crime scenes might offer a clue to the killer’s motive, but will they decipher it before the sheriff’s entire staff is wiped out?  \"...compelling and intense from start to finish...one heck of a read.\" --Kevin R. Tipple, Reviewer at Kevin's Corner  (NOTE: Originally published on December 7, 2014 by Amber Quill Press, LLC)",
