Content on being alone and broke in his personal crusade, Gavin meets a young girl, Solstice, with the powers of a vampire, and then some, with none of the drawbacks like aversion to sunlight, garlic, and crucifixes. Torn between his hate for vampires and his love for human life, Gavin is torn as he decides to protect Solstice, the thing that he’s supposed to hate. With the agreement of protection in exchange for information on people spreading vampirism, both go on a personal crusade. However, there is more to Solstice than she lets on as Gavin’s humanity, and faith, will be tested along the way.Solstice is the first entry of a four-part series, aptly named, The Solstice Chronicles.",
