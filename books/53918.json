  "description": "\" Bearer of Fruit\" is an award winning adventure unfolding in a unique civilization. Aedon may be a prince in Atlantis but no one recognizes him, nor his mother’s claim. The Prince Lord sent him away to a private educatory; ready to graduate, Aedon vows to find his father and prove that he is worthy to receive his rightful place. At the last exam he rejoins friend, Faeraud who cares nothing for the rules, is obsessed with taking the kingdom for his own, and will use anyone to get there. Aedon is divided between being perfect to get his father’s love or the excitement that his friend’s secrets offer him. When Atlantis’ ruling Lord becomes suddenly ill, Aedon is tricked into following Faeraud’s plan of travelling to the forbidden mountains to obtain a magical cure, one that could also give Faeraud everlasting life. The stakes are raised when the life of Aedon’s girlfriend and his father’s freedom depend on him obtaining this produce from a garden which no one has a map to, and most don’t believe exist. He will have to fight his enemy Andromache and others who also have an interest in obtaining this prize. Nearly every religion of the world has a “flood” story and this one is filled with symbolic characters that represent many. The adventure will take you on a journey filled with excitement, mysticism and historical references of Atlantis from Biblical to Grecian accounts.",
