  "description": "At last, Lady Angelica Cottington returns, in this mysterious and hilarious sequel to Brian Froud's huge international hit Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book. In this quirky and seductive new volume, 15-year-old Angelica stumbles on an annotated photo album belonging to her long-dead sister, Euphemia. The revelations within tell of fairy enchantments, wanton romance, and bawdy trysts. Angelica responds to the album in true character, and her fits of fairy pressings and squashings instigate terrible (if weirdly entertaining) consequences.Along with its mysterious tale of Cottington family deviance, this extraordinary artefact offers near-indisputable evidence of the existence of fairies in the form of letters and never-before-published Victorian photographs of actual fairies, authenticated by Brian Froud, the Cottington Archive, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Fairies. Fairies defiant, fairies au naturel, and, of course, fairies squashed: they're all here. Without doubt, Lady Cottington's Fairy Album will radically alter the study of the fairies' hereto-fore-secret world.",
