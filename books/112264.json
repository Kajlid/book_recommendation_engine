  "description": "Newly reissued for holiday gift giving―a collection of charmingly weird tales conjured from the unique imagination of acclaimed filmmaker Tim Burton From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy tales, filmmaker Tim Burton has become known for his unique visual brilliance―witty and macabre at once. Now, he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children―misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and tragedy of these dark yet simple beings―hopeless, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly, anyway).",
