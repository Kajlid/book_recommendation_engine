  "description": "Secrets present. Secrets past. Secrets in India, where Stephen's grandfather is a lowly functionary in the engine room of the Raj. Secrets at home, held tightly by Stephen's half-Indian, half-Scottish mother. Only by uncovering what has been hidden can Stephen win Julia, a woman with secrets of her own... Set in St Andrews, Scotland before the millennium; among the early-Twentieth century jute mills of Dundee; in the industrial underbelly of colonial Calcutta and on the epic plains of ancient India, Karna's Wheel is a poignant story about love, inheritance, and the things which make us what we are.",
