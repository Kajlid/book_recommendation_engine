  "title": "Pippi Longstocking",
  "description": "Pippi is nine years old. She lives alone in her own house with a horse and a monkey, and she does exactly as she pleases. Her friends Tommy and Annika are green with envy - but although they have to go to school and go to bed when they are told, they still have time to join Pippi on all her great adventures. Astrid Lindgren's stories about Pippi Longstocking are probably her best-known and best-loved. She began her writing career in 1944 after she won a children's book competition. She has published over forty novels for all ages and has won many awards, including the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Award and The International Book Award. This new edition of Pippi Longstocking has new cover and inside illustrations by the well-known artist, Tony Ross.",
