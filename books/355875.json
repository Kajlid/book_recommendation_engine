  "title": "A Matter of Time Book III",
  "description": "Three years have passed since Jory Keyes was kidnapped, shot, and left by his lover, Detective Sam Kage. Jory walked through fire and came out the other side stronger. He changed his name to Harcourt and shut the door forever on a past full of pain. Jory now owns his own business, and has a life he enjoys. What he doesn’t have is love. He’s been unable to make that deep connection with another man, the kind of connection he’s only had with Sam. When a chance encounter brings Sam back into his life, Jory doesn’t know what to do. But for Sam there’s no hesitation. He wants Jory back and this time he wants him for keeps. When Sam is called away to a crime scene in the middle of the night, Jory realizes that his fear has nothing to do with being emotionally vulnerable. Why, he wonders, is he so damned uneasy?\nThis book is no longer available at Club Lighthouse Publishing.",
