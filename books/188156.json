The dream comes—a mountain covered in brambles, a treasure at a summit just out of reach, a luminous man with wings and silver hair. Path’s twin, Sierra, doesn’t understand her sister’s nightmare, but she knows whatever is happening to Path, it’s getting worse.It is the year 2066. People can control machines and electronics with their minds, but they can’t control evils older than time itself. Demons and fallen beings continue to stalk the earth—and they want Path. Her vision is the key to unlocking existence, reshaping the world, and bringing forth the Light Bringer’s kingdom.",
