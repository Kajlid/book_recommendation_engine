  "title": "Lizzie at Last",
  "description": "Determined to shake off her reputation as a nerd, Lizzie Archer puts on a new face at the start of seventh grade. She exchanges her flowing lace dresses for jeans and tank tops, feigns dumb in math in a misguided attempt to impress a boy, abandons her beloved poetry-writing and imitates the guy-pleasing giggling of a popular girl in her class. On a class trip to the rare books room of a university library, Lizzie, inspired by Emily Dickinson's individuality, suddenly realizes that she can be herself without worrying about what others think and without severing the new bonds that she has made with her classmates.",
