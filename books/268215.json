  "description": "Embark on a whirlwind journey to Africa with a 20-year-old college student who just realized he hated business school. In 2013, with only bug spray and a plane ticket in his pocket, Matt Freihofer traveled with a mission team from the United States to the heart of West Africa: Sierra Leone. On this trip, he kept a detailed journal in which he recorded the highs and lows of his experiences, from being comically chased by massive spiders and accidentally accepting marriage proposals, to hearing first-hand accounts of the violent civil war. Fully fleshing out the details of that adventure into this delightfully short novella, Matt skillfully explores faith, tragedy, and humor in every day life as this American comes of age and finds his path on the mission field in Africa.",
