  "description": "What happens at Volare STAYS at Volare…Ever since her relationship with Mark crashed and burned, Chloe's been unable to take off and reach the big O. Enter Damien Walters, a deliciously unconventional sex therapist. Damien's therapy sessions take place at his nightclub, and Chloe quickly sees why admittance to Volare is by-invitation-only. Volare's patrons, who are Damien's satisfied and discreet former clients, leave their inhibitions at the door when they walk past the bouncer. Anything goes on Volare's dance floor…Using a few key accessories and some hands-on help from Volare's regulars, Damien enables Chloe to reach her full sexual potential once more. And he has a special proposal just for her: Chloe can join him on the Volare crew as his accountant and therapy assistant. It's an offer Chloe can hardly refuse, especially given the fact that Damien's the man with his hand on the throttle.With the pulsing beat of Volare's dance floor, the seductively suave Damien bent on pleasing her, and her newly restored sexual prowess, Chloe's position at Volare seems like a dream come true. However, she's going to have to help Damien get over some of his own issues in order for the two of them to soar together.",
