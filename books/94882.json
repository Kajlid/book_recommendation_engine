  "description": "Here is the full and rich story of a wilderness place that endures in modern times, although surrounded by a sea of spreading cities. It is written by a talented author devoted to a hopeful mission: the protection of this fragment of original America for all time. Within these pages are episodes of heroism and humor, of touching poignancy and stark tragedy. For the long story of the Great Smokies is molded around woods people and town people in a backdrop of scenic beauty; it is characterized by folklore, native genius of backward people, of harsh struggle preceding victory for those who love our natural wonders. Strangers in High Places is a book truly worthy of this countryâ€™s most popular national park.",
