Bitter and betrayed, the Highlander vowed never to return . . . . . . until a lady pleads for his help. Margaret Mackintosh cannot believe that the wild and scowling warrior in the tavern is the man she seeks. This is Gregor Grant, the proud laird her people have been whispering longingly for? But the new lady of Glen Dhui has no choice. Forced into a betrothal to a duke determined to unite their lands, Meg needs a champion. And who better than Gregor Grant, the clan's rightful leader? So the fiery lass makes him an offer he'd be a fool to refuseâ€¦and the sweetness of her kisses awakens a desire Gregor had thought long buried. Will Meg be able to resist its heat, or the raging power of his love?",
