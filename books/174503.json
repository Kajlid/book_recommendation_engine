  "description": "This exciting new collection brings together the writing talents of international fantasy author A J Dalton, Nadine West (Bridport Anthology) and Matt White (prize-winning scriptwriter). Magic, myth and heroic mayhem combine in a world that is eerily familiar yet beautifully liberating.Raggar refused to tire or submit. With savage energy he sought to lay ahold of the god and strangle him. For the briefest of moments it seemed he would find a grip or sink his bared teeth into the deityâ€™s throat. His strength was prodigious. Yet it was in that fatal moment that the god slipped him and threw him down.
