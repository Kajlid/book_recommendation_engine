  "title": "Don't Miss This in the Doctrine and Covenants: Exploring One Verse From Each Section",
  "description": "You’ve read the Doctrine and Covenants before, but Emily Belle Freeman and David Butler, hosts of the popular YouTube scripture-study channel Don’t Miss This, have created a new approach that will change the way you read your scriptures. These great teachers, whose love for the scriptures is contagious, explore the significance of one verse from each section of the Doctrine and Covenants, showing you how to dig deep and find personal application of God’s word. Each short, devotional-style lesson shares a story, typically beginning with the question that prompted the revelation, a little background about the person the revelation was for, and that person’s experience with the revelation. Then the authors relate that experience to us today. Their invitations will lead you to a more meaningful personal study of the Doctrine and Covenants.",
