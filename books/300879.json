  "description": "Kala and Skye’s world is set aflame by Soren, a self-declared child of the winds, who was ripped from his family and sent in an airship to the harsh northern steppes. To assuage his anger, Soren has raised an army to destroy the world and every airship in it. The Church fans the flames, hoping to usher in a cleansing apocalypse and return the world to a garden-like state before humanity can destroy itself or the planet the way the Ancients almost did. The Church believes Kala’s prophesied role is to raise an army to oppose Soren’s, thereby obliterating each other and furthering the Apocalypse. As the mismatched confrontation looms between Kala’s allies and Soren’s cruel and ruthless army, Kala fears the Priestess’s prediction… that her friends love her enough to die for her.",
