  "description": "Maggie Ballentine’s life is perfect. She has a responsible career, a tastefully tailored wardrobe, and a safe, dependable CPA fiancé. But when she catches her fiancé cheating on more than the taxes, she decides it’s time for a change. She gets a job creating special effects in Hollywood and trades in her beige furniture and boring blazers for hot tubs and flirty skirts. In L.A., land of the beautiful people, where breasts are plastic, sex is casual, and every apartment has a wet bar, the new Maggie is determined to let loose and have some fun. But when it comes right down to it, finding Mr. Right-for-the-Night isn’t as easy as she’d imagined!",
