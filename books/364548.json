  "description": "The destructiveness of passion, both earthly and supernatural, makes cities bleed and souls burn across worlds, through endless time. Experience the spiritual side of the zombie apocalypse in \"The Days of Flaming Motorcycles\" and transcend both hell and nirvana in \"Zen and the Art of Gordon Dratch's Damnation.\" Look into \"The Mad Eyes of the Heron King\" to find the beautiful brutality written in the moment of epiphany or \"Go and Tell it On the Mountain,\" where Jesus Christ awaits your last plea to enter heaven--if there is a heaven to enter when all is said and done.Horror's top authors and promising newcomers whisper tales that creep through the mists at night to rattle your soul. Step beyond salvation and damnation with thirty stories and poems that reveal the darkness beneath belief. Place your faith in that darkness; it's always there, just beyond the light.",
