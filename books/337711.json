  "title": "I Am Jackie Chan : My Life in Action",
  "description": "Jackie Chan is a martial arts superstar. The star of some 40 movies, for decades his adrenaline-charged moves won fans; in 1995, with the release of \"Rumble in the Bronx\", the mainstream caught on - and now he ranks alongside Bruce Lee. Despite widespread media exposure (from chat shows to men's magazines and a host of Internet websites), Jackie has never told his own story in his own words. He relates his story from an almost Dickensian childhood (his parents nearly sold him to the doctor who delivered him!) apprenticed to a Chinese opera master, to his glory days today following hsi \"discovery\" as a stuntman by the director John Woo.",
