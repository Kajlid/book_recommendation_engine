  "description": "There are some things a girl has to keep to herself…  Hopeless romantic Katy Carter still dreams of becoming bestselling novelist. A ghost writer by trade, Katy knows she’s no Booker Prize winner but has fun penning sizzling scenes and hot heroes for celebrity novels. Writing aside, Katy no longer fantasises about a hero of her own - she’s found him in teacher boyfriend, Ollie. After five years together their own happy ever after is just around the corner - if she can only rescue the couple’s ailing finances.  But with Ollie becoming increasingly career minded and teaching at a very strict school, Katy’s racy writing soon causes difficulties. When she secretly signs a contract with steamy publisher Throb, tensions mount. A surprise trip across the pond brings things to a head, sparking a chain of events which set Katy on a collision course with family, friends and, most of all, her one true hero…  “Takes Bridget Jones’s mantle and runs with it” Heat Magazine “Made me laugh out loud” Richard Madeley",
