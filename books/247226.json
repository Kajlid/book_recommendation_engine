  "description": "The great northern nation of Tersatellus is supposed to be perfect. They have vehicles that drive themselves. They power everything with lightning. They even have a digital Plexus of codes that connect every citizen together via chips implanted in their heads. However, some citizens find this idea sketchy (or they’re up to something and don’t want to get caught), and they choose to have themselves extracted from this Plexus. From there, the cutouts, as they’re called, have approximately two options: die slowly without knowing what to do on their own, or turn against the law. For one cutout in particular, the second option has always served her well. Then the law turns back on her with a special offer meant to correct or eliminate all criminals in her tier of infamy. Out of greed, pride, and dumb curiosity, she can only accept and soon finds herself thrust into unknown territory with a bunch of fellow felons almost as crooked as she is. Sure, Death and other surprises wait around every corner, but to a thief like Rat, that’s all a part of the job.",
