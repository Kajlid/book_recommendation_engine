  "description": "It's graduation night. Ayo, Momo, Jireh, and Jonah party the night away to celebrate their newly found adulthood. As they each reveal their plans for the future, Ayo realizes that he's, once again, the odd one out. When they start to run out of whisky, the group ventures off to Momo's house for one last round of beer, with Ayo lagging behind.Lost in his thoughts, he finds himself—and his graduation cap—momentarily tossed in the air, and then flattened by a truck. With his death, Ayo enters some twisted version of Purgatory and sees his friends and family in a new light.There, Ayo meets two gods who give him the opportunity to explore any time and any place in the past, present, or future. It's only after a few journeys into the lives his closest friends lead without him, that the gods realize the gravity of their one-in-a-lifetime offer.Our Bubble of Stars is a heart-wrenching tale of a young, Nigerian boy who struggles to recognize his value in the world. It touches on several serious topics, like mental health and substance abuse, so we'd like to warn our readers that this story may be hard for some to swallow.",
