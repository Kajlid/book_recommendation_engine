  "title": "Diet for a New America: How Your Food Choices Affect Your Health, Happiness and the Future of Life on Earth",
  "description": "An extraordinary look at our dependence on animals for food, and the profoundly inhumane and unhealthy conditions under which they are currently raised. Well-researched and equally well-written author Robbins sounds the alarm and reveals the astounding physical, emotional and economic price we unknowingly pay. You may never again look at the local supermarket's meat counter the same way after you read this book. A must-read for anyone involved or interested in ecological and political issues.",
