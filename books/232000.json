  "description": "In a world where membership in one of the four magic guilds guarantees respect and wealth, it is strange that Lucinda Guillierre is terrified of being exposed as a witch. The Fire Warlock finds her attitude puzzling, but does not give her his full attention until a long-buried secret comes to light.  She has good reasons to be afraid.  As war looms and dangerous romance beckons, who will have the best chance to kill her? Her enemies, her friends, or Lucinda herself?",
