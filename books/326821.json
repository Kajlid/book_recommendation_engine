  "description": "Are you ready to meet your next book boyfriend?A baking competition for the Happily Ever After channel could bring success to my small-town bakery... and one night of toe-curling passion that would keep me warm for years to come. But could it bring me love, too?Alessandro Torre marches back into my life with the same tattooed broad shoulders, half-grin and smoldering-dark eyes that had me melting like butter almost a year ago. I was never supposed to see him again. To me, he was Thor (because of his hammer). But now, we're stuck together with the best sugar glue in town. A former grumpy bodyguard (and so stubborn!), he's the head of security of Sweets For Love, the baking show I have to join if I want to save my bakery. This time around, I won't throw caution to the wind. Maybe, except for one night. Just one. Right? Right.Jamie Bond, or should I say Aisling O'Connor? Here we are. Again. For months, I dreamed about seeing her again. Touching her again. Finishing what we started almost a year ago in that elevator. But now, there are rules in place. She has a daughter, and she's even more stubborn than I am. Plus, I learned the hard way I can't trust anyone. All I need to do is finish this stupid assignment with my dickhead of a brother and move on. I promised my men I wouldn't let them down. Nope. Not happening. Except maybe for one night. No feelings. I don’t do relationship and love isn’t on her agenda.No one else can know. Because if they do, we might lose everything.",
