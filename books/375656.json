  "description": "In 1926, \"Winnie-the-Pooh, \" a collection of stories about a rather stout, somewhat confused bear, was published in England and America. The enchanting tales of Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Christopher Robin, and the others were an immediate success, and firmly established A.A. Milne, already an acclaimed dramatist, as a major author of children's books. \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" was followed in 1928 by a second collection, \"The House At Pooh Corner, \" which continued the adventures from the Hundred Acre Wood and introduced bouncy, lovable Tigger.",
