In a poor, isolated valley, a young boy, Alexicles, looks up in the night and wishes his fate might bring him the adventure and treasure he craves. When a stranger with apparently miraculous powers comes to his small village, Alexicles determines to go with him, leaving behind the toil and ill treatment of his life in the valley, seeking treasure and adventure and, possibly, glory.MOSARR is an epic fantasy novel packed full of adventure, battle, intrigue, politics, philosophy, and war; a \"realistic fantasy\" with appeal for both adults and younger readers.",
