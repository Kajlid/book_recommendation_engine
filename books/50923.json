  "title": "Found in Translation: Modern Hebrew Poets",
  "description": "The American-born Robert Friend, who died in Jerusalem in 1998, was a distinguished poet and translator. Friend's skill as a poet, combined with his facility for languages, allowed him to excel at the exceedingly difficult task of translating poetry. He translated some eight hundred works first written in Hebrew, Yiddish, Spanish, French, German, and Arabic, but is best known for his translation of Hebrew poetry. Toby Press is pleased to release this classic as a new bilingual edition, the original Hebrew poems appearing next to Friend's superlative translations.",
