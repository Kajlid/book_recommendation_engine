  "description": "These are the continuing tales of Bowdyn, itinerant 17th Century Gleeman, member of an ancient story-telling guild. The Gewissae, the followers of warrior chieftain, Gewis, fleeing famine in their blighted land to join their kin on the east coast, are storm driven to the West Country of a Britannia now deserted by Rome. There they become warrior confederates of Caradoc, ruler of the Durotriges, in exchange for a place to build and farm. Joining to defend the land with Dux Caradoc's Legio II Militia, and Arthur the peacekeeper's Frisian cavalry, they tip the balance of power. In battle with the armies of warring petty tyrants they start the knitting up of the broken land of post-Roman Britannia, creating the Kingdom of Wessex as the Fates intended. Following on from the Axe the Shield and the Triton it is the continuing story of the workings of the Fates, forging in the white heat of joy and tragedy the iron hard warrior kings needed to build a nation, which will, over time, create an empire that changes the world.",
