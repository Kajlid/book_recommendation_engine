  "description": "Izzy Dying young is tragic. Dying young and being reborn over and over for all eternity? That’s exhausting. My goal had always been to reunite with my sister witches and break the curse put on us. Love was a risk I wasn’t willing to take. It wasn’t worth knowing it’d end in heartbreak. Then a handsome beast found me and took me as his mate. Grant McTavish linked our souls without giving me a choice. Now, with a ticking clock, a shifter pack on the hunt for me and my sisters, and Grant trying to claim my heart, I’ve got to save myself in order to save the man I don’t want to love.  Grant I never thought I’d find my mate. I’ve watched my pack members find theirs time and time again, but for me, it wasn’t an option. I do my job, fight to keep my pack safe, that’s it. But when my beauty walked into my life, there was no stopping my instinct. Izzy is mine, and no curse is going to take her from me. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe. She may think keeping her love from me will keep me alive when her curse takes her, but I know better. We’ll have our happily ever after. I’ll make sure of it.",
