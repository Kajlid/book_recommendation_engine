  "description": "F.W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret, which described his role in the breaking and use of the top-secret German code during World War II, was a sensational best seller that made newspaper headlines. In this equally exciting book, Winterbotham reveals his hitherto secret activities as a British spy in the early years of Hitler's Third Reich. Even before the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, Frederick Winterbotham was sent by British Intelligence to Germany to befriend the Nazi leaders and learn as much as he could about their plans.",
