This board book features sturdy pages and is just the right size for little hands. This Caldecott Honor Book features bright colors and bold shapes. Even a child not lucky enough to have counted freight cars will feel he or she has watched a freight train passing after reading Freight Train . Donald Crews used childhood memories of trains seen during his travels to his grandparents' farm in the American South as the inspiration for this timeless favorite. Red caboose at the back, orange tank car, green cattle car, purple box car, black tender and a black steam engine . . . freight train.",
