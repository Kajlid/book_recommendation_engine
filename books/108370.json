  "description": "“An honest and genuine DIY punk-rock lesbian love story.” — Kirkus ReviewsAmanda moves to London with nothing but her guitar and her collection of punk music as the soundtrack to her every move. With the company of a few friendly voices in her head, she looks for—and finds—a best friend and new lover. She forms a band, Lesbian Raincoat, and completely rewrites the story of her life. In this irreverently funny yet profound novel, Amanda risks deportation, recalls the fervor of AIDS activism in the United States, connects to the class struggle of punk, and finds redemption in love. But she also must confront her own mental illness, her lover’s rape, and the violence of post-9/11 politics. Pissing in a River captures the glee and turbulence of surviving the cacophony of modern life.“A love letter to the obsessions that captivated an outcast punk, politics, passion, and provocation.” —Maria Raha, author of Cinderella’s Big Women of the Punk and Indie Underground",
