  "title": "The Heart Is a Pool: Poetry in the Shades of Love",
  "description": "The Heart is a Pool is a short collection of poetry that touches on young love, love of children, friendship, love between lovers, leaving love, losing love, and finding new love. It's a short book that can be read poem by poem or in just one sitting. It is written for those lovers of (mostly) lyrical poetry who have a few moments to explore the shades of love. How much love can one heart hold? Like a lot of children, my son looked at the love in your heart like a valentine cookie. Split too many ways, there would not be enough left for anybody. The title poem of this book was born of that conversation. Writing these poems was my catharsis, a cleansing from grief borne through many of the different types of heartache found in life. Yet, as I wrote, I began to recognize the enduring qualities of love, the strength in the bonds it forges, and the second chances it never fails to offer. I wrote some of these poems in my teens and some as a young mother. Yet, for the most part, this book is a selection of a larger collection of poetry, which I wrote from 1999 to 2001. Putting the poetry into this short book brought back memories of a boy on the beach and one in a back seat, of the joy of giving birth and the sorrow of saying good-bye, and the bulwark found in the firm handholds and soft shoulders of friendship.ASIN: B00L2Z7WAS",
