  "description": "Who or what is Taylor Lane?\nMost people go through life unaware of the war between light and dark raging just beyond their field of vision. They live blissful, ordinary lives, but that is a luxury Taylor will never have. With a single birthday wish, she is thrown into a war between Eve's angels and Lilith's demons. Bestowed with the magical ability to control light and adorned with the sight of supernatural races, Taylor is forced to fight for her own survival. Then Lucian, her shadowy protector, enters her life and heart. But there’s something dark inside of him: he’s a vampire, the original Dark One. With her mother murdered and a hideous beast out for her blood, Taylor has no choice but to put her faith in Lucian and go to war as she tries to unravel the mystery of who she truly is.",
