There’s no way she’s not a spy, not with her allegiance with the sociopath drug addict who walks the halls with murder on his mind.We’re watching her every move, every choice she makes reshaping the world we live in.The halls of Hannaford Prep have never been so deadly. The game is only just beginning and now I need to make my move.",
