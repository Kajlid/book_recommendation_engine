  "title": "Ligature Marks",
  "description": "With all the respect due the English language and the art of erotica, M. J. Lance spins spicy tales of lust and desire which most people only fantasize about. Ligature Marks features, as the name might suggest, the sensual act of rope bondage as a recurring theme; but it wanders far and wide in its search for human sexuality and pleasure.Aside from light BDSM (such as spanking and handcuffs), Ligature Marks dabbles in public sex, sex with strangers, outdoor sex, voyeurism, exhibitionism, power exchange, threesomes; and is, of course, rife with oral and anal pleasure.This is the Early Edition, and as such, it contains one story \"Midnight Train\", and also an excerpt from the story \"Call on Me\". In much the way that a pre-order works, and through the magic of digital products, this ebook will soon be updated with the full Ligature Marks collectionâ€”around 50,000 words of hedonistic debauchery for your reading pleasure. Buy this Early Edition, enjoy the stories herein, and learn more about the project.",
