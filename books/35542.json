  "description": "\"Cory Doctorow’s novella ‘Chicken Little’ [..] does an excellent job of updating and commenting on some of the themes that informed Pohl & Kornbluth’s classic novel 'The Space Merchants'. Doctorow’s updated high-tech take on Pohl’s take on Jonathan Swift’s 'struldbrugs,' creatures who have immortality but not eternal youth, continuing to age through their extended lives, is particularly ingenious. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this one show up on an award ballot next year.\"Gardner Dozois, Locus MagazineA story with a product designer, jetpacks and an immortal quadrillionaire living in a vat.\"Chicken Little\" also appears in the collection \"With a Little Help\".ABOUT THE AUTHORCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger -- the co-editor of Boing Boing and the author of Tor Teens/HarperCollins UK novels like \"For The Win\" and the bestselling \"Little Brother\".
