  "description": "Jake Thompson thought college was his ticket out of a dead-end small-town life—until one foolish mistake lands him in the crosshairs of Professor Daniel Carver, a cold, calculating academic with a taste for control. Caught cheating on a brutal exam, Jake faces expulsion unless he submits to Carver’s twisted pledge to Delta Iota Kappa, a notorious frat with dark secrets, and surrender to their every demand. Forced into a pink skirt and a chastity cage, Jake becomes the lowest pledge—a freeuse slave for the frat’s rowdy brothers. What starts as humiliation spirals into something deeper, though, as Jake’s straight-boy pride crumbles under the weight of submission. From the basement’s stained mattress to the steamy showers, he’s theirs to command, his body a playground for their desires. Professor Carver watches from the shadows, pulling strings with sadistic glee, but someone else lurks behind the scenes, orchestrating Jake’s fall into this gay underworld of dominance and surrender. Will Jake break free from the frat’s grip, or will he embrace his new life as their eager bottom? A provocative tale of blackmail, chastity, and forbidden cravings, Freeuse Frat Boy explores the cost of survival—and the unexpected allure of giving in.",
