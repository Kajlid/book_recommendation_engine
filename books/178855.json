  "description": "He's a temptation I can't afford.Last year, I tanked my freshman year at college. It was nothing short of an epic fail.Instead of focusing on my classes and hockey, I cracked under the pressure and lost everything important to me. Nine months later, I’ve pulled myself together and am at a new university. A place where no one knows about my anxiety or how I totally went off the rails. It’s a fresh start where I can get my life back on track and prove to my family that I’m not a screw up.This year, I’m focused on academics. Sure, I’ll humor my roommate, Brooklyn, by going to a party or two, but I’m not about to make the same mistake twice by becoming unfocused.Unfortunately, someone should have mentioned that to a certain hockey playing hottie. He just won’t take a hint and leave me alone. As much as I hate to admit it, if I had a type, Cole Mathews would fit it to a T with his dark shaggy hair, golden-brown eyes, muscular arms, and damnable dimples.Oh, and did I happen to mention his wide chest?Yeah…totally dreamy.Er, if I were the dreamy sort, that is. Thank goodness I’m not.To make matters worse, he’s ridiculously easy going. And yeah, nice.Definitely kryptonite.Which makes him much too dangerous for me and this year, I’m smart enough to realize it.",
