  "title": "The Truth of Yesterday",
  "description": "\"We like to think of life as a story - complete with a nice, neat beginning, middle, and end. Real life is seldom that orderly. We often forget just how powerful the past can be. After all, it's over and done with, so how can the past affect the present? The truth is, while it may be over, it is seldom done. The past has a way of twisting our perception, our feelings, and even our reality. Things we thought long behind us can suddenly be very much before us.\" Killian is thrilled when his first real case takes him on a surveillance trip to Washington D.C. - and with his boyfriend Micah, no less. When Micah takes him out to celebrate the successful resolution of his case, Micah's past comes back to haunt them in a big way. Killian is stunned by what he learns, and even more shocked to hear about the murder of Micah's former lover, Paul. The truth threatens to tear them apart, but at the same time, Killian finds himself drawn to find Paul's killer. Meanwhile, Judy has asked him to investigate an old friend, Jake, whose behavior has changed radically over the last few months. She is worried he may be involved in something dangerous...and she has no idea how right she is. Entering into the perilous and often grim world of male escorts, Killian discovers that things are seldom what they seem and everyone has a past. The truth of yesterday becomes a lie tomorrow.",
