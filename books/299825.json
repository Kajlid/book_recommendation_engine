  "description": "For fans of Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier and The March by E.L. Doctorow comes a brilliant novel of the Old South.Based on a true story set in antebellum Virginia, Masque of Honor is a riveting tale of romance, political intrigue and loyalty about two sons of the aristocracy and the women they loved.Just after the end of the War of 1812, General Armistead Mason and his brother-in-law John “Jack” Mason McCarty become embroiled in a bitter dispute that puts in motion an irrevocable chain of events—leading them to the fight of their lives and an outcome that changes everything.From a cold February morning in 1819 on the snow-covered dueling grounds in Bladensburg, Maryland, to the parlors of Virginia, the District of Columbia, and New York City, Masque of Honor will transport you to the past as only brilliantly detailed historical fiction can. From the men who shaped the law of the land to the women who loved them, this compelling novel is an accomplished, stunning debut.",
