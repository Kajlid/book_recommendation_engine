  "description": "Stories of Desire in Poetry is a kaleidoscope of lust and love.Grace invites the reader into the world of a woman who deeply experiences life from sexual obsession to the familiarities of marriage, to juggling what it is to be a lover and mother. She explores the shadow side of desire including infatuation and infidelity, as well as the creative cauldron that a Beloved inspires, all with honesty, poignancy and celebration, very rarely offered in our society that merely titillates and discourages true expression. Grace asserts to get to know our passion is a spiritual journey. She takes us on hers with care, exquisite imagery and eroticism. Read these poems to be turned on, tuned in, ultimately connected to your own heart.",
