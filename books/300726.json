  "description": "Updating his survey of language atrocities, Ken Smith has again subjected himself to the continuing barrage of mindless jargon, hackneyed expressions, and war euphemisms. With hundreds of new examples pulled from everyday life, Junk English 2 shows how our language has become so pliable and flabby that the more we read and hear, the less we know.",
