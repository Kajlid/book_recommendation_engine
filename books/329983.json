  "description": "When your job is protecting people, the first rule is…never mix business with pleasure. Keira Mantz has been given the job of a lifetime, and she refuses to fail. Trained as part of an elite security team, her first mission is to protect the Sheikh of Jawhara and his wife. What she thought would be a solo operation, though, is suddenly a two-person job. And her partner is none other than Brock Wells, the Viking-like team member who trained her. The last thing Keira wants is Brock stealing her thunder, but she’ll do whatever it takes to succeed—even if it means pretending to be in love. When Brock found Keira in a bar fight and offered her a place on the team, he knew she was the right choice. With her mile-long legs, fierce determination, and unwavering focus, he has no doubt she can hold her own. But with the threat to the Sheikh closer than they realized, Brock has no choice but to intervene. To give them the cover they need, they’ll have to act like they’re a couple. And although Brock told himself he’d never get close to another woman, the job always comes first. When their ruse becomes a little too real, can Keira and Brock risk letting their guard down, or will admitting their feelings put others’ lives in danger?",
