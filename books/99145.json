  "description": "His charm is contagious. He speaks seven foreign languages. He wears a tuxedo to the opera. But when he leaves his beloved New Orleans and straps on his Colt he becomes the most dangerous man alive. In this three-part western a secretive gunman travels to Dodge City to rescue his client Joan Clark and face the men who raped her, raped her daughter and killed her husband - twenty-two of the most vicious men that ever rode north out of Texas. In Part II he teams up with his friend Jose Mendez, a half-Mexican half-Apache former Army scout. Their goal - break the stranglehold on a small town in the Arizona badlands - a town terrorized by the mayor and his deputized killers gone mad. In Part III he meets Jose Mendez in El Paso where they face their greatest challenge - the largest rustling operation in U.S. history involving vast political stakes and bodies strewn across West Texas.  It started years ago with his brother's unavenged murder. Now he vicariously seeks revenge. It's an obsession. And yet his deadly occupation gnaws at his conscience. He operates in the shadows. He guards his name and his heart not knowing that the anonymity masking his identity will create a legend of historic proportions. A beautifully written novel that paints the American West in dazzling fidelity - hard-edged, historically accurate and fast-paced - fiction at its finest.",
