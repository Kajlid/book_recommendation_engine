  "description": "A chance encounter with an old university friend leads a newly qualified priest, James Brittain, to accept an invitation to participate in the CND Aldermaston march in April 1963, where he unwittingly learns of a plot to assassinate President Kennedy during his forthcoming visit to the UK. As a result, he is drawn into the sinister worlds of extreme church politics, secret service intrigue and ex-Nazi collaborators, resulting in him being hunted for a murder he did not commit, and suffering from recurring doubts about his faith. All this is carried out against the backdrop of the cold war, at its height, and the imminent Profumo scandal. Can James avoid elimination and unravel the plot before the President arrives?",
