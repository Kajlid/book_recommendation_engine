  "description": "Theo is a budding scientist who builds all sorts of inventions. Some are useful, some are useless, and some are downright appalling. Leroy is an action man and Toby is convinced he has telekinesis. All are twelve years old and are being bullied at school. Tired of the name-calling they join forces to combat their tormentors. Things don't run to plan, however, and events unfold with hilarious results.",
