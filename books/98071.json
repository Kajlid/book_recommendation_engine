  "description": "Interdimensional voyager Sebastian Talbot (aka Set-d’Elous, legendary warrior) is content to laze on his private island, in self-exile, writing his memoir. Until the emissary from Queen Tammy arrives with a mission he cannot refuse. Returning for Tammy’s son who was left behind on Earth gives Sebastian ideas about what else he could change on his adopted world of Ghoupallesz. Perhaps he could do something to prevent the Great War he fought through years before from ever happening. Or will changing history make everything worse, especially for his Ghoupalle family?",
