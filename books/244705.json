  "description": "He's my teacher. I shouldn't be alone with him. But I can't help that he's irresistible.\nI let the door silently close at my back. He stared at me, and a taut quiet stretched between us.\"I like hearing you play,\" I said, moving toward him.He turned, in sync with my slow approach. He looked up at me but didn't say anything. I rested my clammy hand on the cold, slick body of the baby grand. \"May I?\"The muscles in his throat shifted, then he swallowed. \"Eden.\"My knees weakened, like a soft tickling kiss had just been blown against the backs of them. \"Is it okay?\" I asked.His gaze held mine like two hands joined. He understood what I was really asking.\"Let me stay,\" I said. \"Please.\"\"You're going to get me in trouble,\" he said.",
