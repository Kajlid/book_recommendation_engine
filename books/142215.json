  "title": "Concerning Littleton",
  "description": "Littleton only looks like your average college town.  True, it’s quiet, unassuming, and home to the best hot cocoa in a thirty-mile radius. But if you wander down the tree-lined streets or queue up for a midnight showing at the Excelsior Theatre, you will quickly discover that the town and its inhabitants are anything but ordinary…  In Littleton, Aiden is finally free to explore his fetishes. When he meets David, and learns he’s not the only diaper lover in town, he’s awakened to desires deeper than he ever imagined…  Sarah isn’t interested in casual dating or romantic gestures; she needs something else entirely.  An act of delicious cruelty changed her forever; now she can’t suppress her craving for power and control…  Christina is thirty-six, going on six.  Although her husband, Adam, doesn’t quite know what to make of it, he’s eager to understand why her girlish demands drive him crazy…  Concern yourself with Littleton and find out what happens when their journeys of self discovery intertwine.",
