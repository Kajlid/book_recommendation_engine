I’m not a quitter.That’s why I’m still alive when every doctor agrees I shouldn’t be.Dealt a horrid genetic deck of cards, I live with Batten disease. It’s rare, incurable, and always fatal.Since my diagnosis, my parents, family, and doctors have worked tirelessly to find a cure. Yet the disease still took things from me…mostly my eyesight and my energy.But I refuse to give it my happiness. At almost seventeen, I’m still ticking off the boxes of my dream bucket list. I’ll keep pushing for the seeing-eye dog…but only because romance seems too far-fetched. A girl can dream. Right?Maybe this summer will be different…Get it now.",
