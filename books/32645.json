  "description": "V Skyler has it all. Fantastic career, amazing husband, and an unbelievable view from her apartment on Central Park West. Her whole life is wrapped up with a big silver bow, and she is sure it will be no problem to tie a rattle to the end of it. But problems start even before Baby Madison arrives. V wants to schedule a Friday delivery, but her water breaks in the middle of the board room. At the hospital, a resident cuts off her frantic e-mailing. And the head nurse won’t give her a private room for her 3:00a.m. conference call with Asia. V is determined to get back to business, but Baby Madison has other plans. She can’t even get through voice mail without splitting an eardrum or getting covered in goo, poo, or some other “oo” that has no place in the corporate world. Even as she fights to get back to \"normal,\" V is drawn into the world of the Stay at Homes. By the time her maternity leave is over, she's no longer positive which path she wants her life to take. For ten months V bounces between her two lives like a super ball in a fun house. At home she faces mothers who can’t figure out why anyone would ever think about leaving their child for eighty hours a week. At work her colleagues whisper every time she leaves the office before 8:00. And to make things worse, Jason has a definite opinion as to how V should handle the tug of war that has become her life. Pushed to the brink of losing everything, V knows she's going to have to take a stand. She just hopes it is one she can live with.",
