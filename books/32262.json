And they both just woke up in the same body.When a vampiric reincarnation goes tragically wrong, two immortals find themselves ever-meshing into the newly-formed William. To make matters worse, someone is poisoning London's vampires and no immortal is safe.

Embarking on a perilous adventure, William and Ingrid struggle to decipher ancient clues while staying one step ahead of the pursuing Stone Masters. Scouring the city from the aristocratic heights of its regal facade to the darkest deviancy of its corrupted core, they search for a way to reverse his catastrophe—and save all vampires from a growing threat far worse than the Stone Lords ever were.Rising straight from the ashes of the shocking ending of A Vampire’s Reckoning, V.M.K. Fewings brings faithful fans back to The Stone Masters Vampire Series right where they left off, while guiding new readers into the embrace of London’s nightwalkers.",
