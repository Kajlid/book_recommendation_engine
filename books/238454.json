  "description": "This is the first of the three poetry book series from Gems Eclair Morton. Gems died, a relatively unknown man. He was fond of reading poetries and would recite them to his friends, I being one of them, whenever we met at his house for poker. I found his two diaries, hidden behind stacks of his books of poetries, which were being auctioned after his death. It was then that I realized that the poetries he used to recite were his own. The World should have known Gems before and he deserved a more respectable death.English was not Gemsâ€™ mother tongue, but he loved the language more than any other language. We loved to listen to him when he talked and no wonder I have loved handpicking his best creations. I present to you the first book of his three book series that I have compiled from his writings. This book contains his poems and writings about his childhood memories.",
