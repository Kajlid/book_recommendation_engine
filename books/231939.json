A hyena shifter wants her, and when his obsession with her turns dangerous, she’s forced to make a drastic decision. Alone and desperate, she makes the wolf shifter she’s just met an offer she hopes he can’t refuse.With the help of his brother’s security company, Porter promises to keep Maggie safe. Pretending to be her mate is surprisingly easy. But with each passing day, their mutual attraction grows stronger and soon Maggie’s sweet kisses have his wolf howling to claim her as his mate for real.Author’s “Porter’s Mate” is Book Four in The Shifters Series. Although it is a stand-alone story, I would recommend reading the first three books in the series. Please note that this book contains steamy and explicit scenes and may not be your cup of tea.",
