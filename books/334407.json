She and her dearest friend never surrender their love of reading, even when Janina is forced into the newly formed ghetto.But the closer Warsaw creeps toward liberation, the more dangerous life becomes for the women and their families—and escape may not be possible for everyone. As the destruction rages around them, Zofia must fight to save her friend and preserve her culture and community using the only weapon they have left—literature.",
