Stone Corp. Security Soldier 034 is a top ranking agent responsible for eliminating those who resist the capture and enslavement. When he himself is captured by a Separatist colony on Old Earth, during a mission to locate the mankind’s greatest invention, the 600 year old artifact known as the Psion Machine, he is selected as a prime candidate to test the machine.Before, the Separatists had only been able to use the Psion Machine to push to human brain to 93% activation, which drove all prior subjects mad, and could not uncover the mystery held within the final 7%. Until now. When 034 enters the Psion Machine, he is a mindless soldier, who has been programmed to enforce the strict laws of the UNION regime, but when he walks out, now possessing 100% of his brain’s vast power, he becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.",
