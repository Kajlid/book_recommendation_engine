  "title": "Dear Hunter,: Letters from Father to Son",
  "description": "Endearing and enlightening. Dear Hunter is a book that readers won’t soon forget. “DiGeronimo’s writing is clear and smooth like warm honey spread over a decadent dessert. Each letter needs to be read and savored slowly.” “A simply wonderful book!” “DiGeronimo delivers the messages in this book to us in such an open and vulnerable way, that I’m so deeply moved with each new letter.” “Drawing in equal measure upon his own experiences and from a staggering array of great minds that he admires, this book shows that - above all else - the author is a student of life.” “Rarely ever do I come across a non-fic and call it a beautiful read, this book is truly it!” Matt DiGeronimo holds his young son’s hand, pulls him across the boundaries of time for a father-son sit-down, discussing life’s most complex issues with graceful simplicity. DiGeronimo guides his future Hunter through the vicissitudes of life that he will face as a young man, bringing us along on the journey. Gentle and pensive in its delivery, yet powerful and impactful in its message, no topic is Love, Mental health. Decision making. Courage. Bullies. Influence. Confidence. Procrastination. Integrity. And so much more. Dear Hunter provides us with a timeless work that is the result of DiGeronimo’s lifetime of experiences as a nuclear engineer, United States Navy submarine officer, an entrepreneur, a corporate executive, an artist, an author—and a dad.",
