  "description": "Some people borrow a cup of sugar, others a cordless hand-drill, but what young lesbian Lucy gets from her sexy neighbour is beyond the realms of probability...and decency!  Neighbour from heaven: A short sex snack from best-selling author Jade Winters & co-author, Alexis Bailey.  Lucy is new to the area. Adventurous and up for fun, she is just the girl to take ‘loving thy neighbour’ to a steamy new level. Enter the object of her desire – her deliciously attractive neighbour, Melody. Fit, friendly and oozing sex appeal, Melody is every girl’s fantasy, but is she ‘one of the girls?’ or just a flirty tease?  This is a tale to get your heart racing and change the way you view that sexy neighbour down the hallway forever. Who knows, it may inspire you to borrow more than a cup of sugar yourself. After all, sharing is caring…  This is a 3500 word erotic short story.  Warning: Contains graphic language and f/f sex.",
