  "description": "As one of just sixty-one people on the planet with hyperthymesia, 17-year-old Jhalon never forgets anything. Literally. Give him any date, and he can recite his entire day to the smallest detail. But all he wants to do is live in the moment, be the first person in his family to graduate high school, and find the courage to ask out his crush.Then, in a split-second decision to save his brother, Jhalon takes the fall for a crime he doesn't commit. Assuming he'll only be sent to juvie, Jhalon is dismayed after he's tried as an adult and sentenced to 25 years in prison with grown men. Just when he doesn't think things could get any worse, Jhalon is shipped off to the secret government-owned island inhabited and run by convicts.While deciding what murderers to trust and which ones want to bury him alive, Jhalon learns a secret about the island--a secret tied to his brother's crime. But if Jhalon is going to save him again, he'll have to make allies with murderers and find a way off Convict Island.",
