  "description": "From Wall Street Journal & USA Bestselling Author M. Robinson & #1 NYT Bestselling Author Rachel Van Dyken comes a full length, standalone dark romance novel.“Play for me, Juliet…”Those four words whispered in my ear again and again until I craved what I used to fear. Such a simple demand from my captor—the man who stole me and refused to tell me why he wouldn’t let me go. I was his. He made me need him, just as much as he needed me. I broke all the rules of the golden prison he put me in.  During the day he ruled his dark, seedy world. His subjects and me. During the night—he bowed before my feet.  Have you ever wondered what happened to the villains in all the fairy tales you read? You’ll soon find out. It all started when he kidnapped me and made me his pet. And it all ended with me… Calling him master.   *This story is not for the faint of heart and may be uncomfortable for some readers. But, then again, stepping outside of your comfort zone may be exactly the thing you need… Care to play with us, readers?",
