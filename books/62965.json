  "title": "Chapter One: Janey",
  "description": "Chapter One is a series of short stories, with each short story acting as the first chapter, or “chapter one,” of the featured character’s larger story.Each short story is connected to and advances the others, culminating in an ending that will leave you wanting more.Readers will be invited to vote at the end of the series and decide which character’s Chapter One becomes its own book. Or maybe Chapter Two will follow.The story is based in the heart of Boston; Charlestown, Massachusetts. And it follows the lives of two extended Irish Catholic families, spanning three generations, and the events that shape them. Strong language, strong emotions and stronger truths – do not read unless prepared to be shocked, cry and laugh out loud.In this first chapter, originally titled “Tough Chick,” we meet Janey, a strong-willed young woman at odds with the world around her, and herself. Thrust into a role she was never prepared for, we witness her battling back against circumstances that are beyond her control while creating a whole new set of circumstances that aren’t, with destructive consequences.",
