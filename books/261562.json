  "title": "The Heart Of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made",
  "description": "In The Heart of Rock & Soul, veteran rock critic Dave Marsh offers a polemical guide to the 1,001 greatest rock and soul singles ever made, encompassing rock, metal, R&B, disco, folk, funk, punk, reggae, rap, soul, country, and any other music that has made a difference over the past fifty years. The illuminating essays—complete with music history, social commentary, and personal appraisals—double as a mini-history of popular music. Here you will find singles by artists as wide-ranging as Aretha Franklin, George Jones, Roy Orbison, the Sex Pistols, Madonna, Run-D.M.C., and Van Halen. Featuring a new preface that covers the hits—and misses—of the '90s, The Heart of Rock & Soul remains as provocative, passionate, and timeless as the music it praises.",
