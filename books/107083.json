  "description": "First Place Winner - Midwest Book AwardsAutobiography/MemoirHere Comes the Sun is the tale of a quest. It offers a clear and honest look at what happens when an illness throws life off track, and how a combination of science, love, and serendipity can help put things right. At the age of thirty-four, Betsy Lucas was diagnosed with late-stage leukemia. Without treatment she had only months to live. At the time her daughters were ten months old and three years old. Together, Betsy and her husband, Brian, started a journey through chemo, radiation, and a bone marrow transplant. The path was far from steady, but with the help of countless supporters and a generous young man in Germany, they put one foot in front of the other, crossing days, months, and years off the calendar on the way to being cured. Here Comes the Sun isn't a cancer story-it's a love story.",
