Three hundred innocents were sacrificed in order to snuff out the life of one man: Professor Alexey Sokolov, a senior adviser to the Russian government.  As well as a CIA asset recruited by a ghost known as the Hangman...  Trapp doesn't know any of this.

But he sure as hell intends to find out...",
