  "description": "$0.99 Preorder Special. Price will go up on release day. Five Reasons Why I Should Never Apartment Sit Again I won’t pretend that I’m the new owner of a penthouse apartment while accidentally sipping on thousand dollar wine. Oops. I won’t slip out of the luxurious king-sized bed at midnight to bang down the door of ‘said apartment’s’ next door neighbor complaining of the egregious noise pouring through the walls. I won’t bang said apartment’s annoying next door neighbor just because he’s hot. I won’t leave the next morning pretending to head to my exciting jetsetting job, when hot neighbor asks me to make him breakfast. As if! I won’t show up at my new secretarial job and find out that my boss is none other than the man I’d left just two hours previously. With a smirk on his face and my panties in his hand.",
