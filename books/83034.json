  "description": "Emily met her knight in shining armor, started a beautiful family and became a vampire? Sheâ€™s had ten years to deal with the crazy results of that devastating night. Fighting the urges for human blood and male intimacy were easy. Raising mortal children while sheltering them from The Confederation had its challenges but even it was doable. It was the move from New York City to rural Pennsylvania that nearly broke her. Together, she and Draco must honor their loyalties to Francesca, leader of The Confederation, while fighting for their lives and the lives of their mortal charges.Katrina never had it easy. Orphaned at the age of three and raised by her much older brother came with more disadvantages than simply not having a mother to buy bras with. Nothing he said was true. He even changed her last name. Had her mother lived, she would have known she was to carry the Cole Legacy of Hunters into a new age. Instead, she must rely on new faces to help her transition to life as a vampire hunter.While two strong women fight to resettle in their new reality, the vampire world continues to spin around them. Villains continue to build ruthless armies. Women go missing. Innocents become martyrs.And then there is Felipe Castillo, eight centuries old and not against killing everyone in his path for what he wants. No one is safe. Vampires and Hunters alike must unite if there is any chance to save the mortal world from the slaughters he has planned.Allred has played with genre lines in order to create vampire fiction riddled with Mythological characters, historical events, and all based on a sword carried by Beowulf.
