  "description": "What does a spoiled rich boy do when he can't get his girl? He pretends to be engaged to someone else.  When Karissa Harris takes a bribe to be engaged to Jayden Arrington for one short evening, she doesn't realize that her innocent guise will catapult her into a world of forced deception. Her once-peaceful lifestyle is turned topsy-turvy as she tries to deal with the twists and turns of her life while dealing with some unexpected emotions in her heart.  Irrevocably Engaged is a clean romance that shows that you can find love in the most unexpected places.  A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.
