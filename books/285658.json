  "description": "Have you ever met someone and wondered where they might be from? Hi, I'm Tolu! I play steelpan, I love the saxophone, and I like art. Dad always says I am his curious Caribbean Canadian girl and I'm super excited to go to my new school tomorrow! Mom said there are many kids that don't look like me. Do you think that's cool?!! I do, but I'm a little nervous too. What makes Canada strong is its diversity, but we often don't take the time to truly explore it. 'Where are you from?', is a book where you can follow Tolu as she explores and teaches us about diversity for what it is, a strength.",
