Not surprisingly, his first choice hasn’t changed since all things being equal, he’d rather be down the shore.Scott worked on The Duelist magazine before joining the Creative Team for THE GATHERING®. He worked on almost all the Urza/Phyrexia saga and has since written eight novels and a handful of short stories for THE GATHERING. All this, and yet he has only ever appeared on one Magic card. Though he finds this burden bitter and onerous, he will at least admit that that it’s a really good picture.",
