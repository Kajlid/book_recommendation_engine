  "description": "There’s nowhere left to hide. Lydia Anderson is an unbonded omega living in fear of the day her past catches up with her. Hunted by her ex, betrayed by her own family, staying out of sight is her only protection. Or it was, until she met Pack Saint Clair, and found love and safety in their arms. Her new pack’s status as a powerhouse of the business world makes it impossible for them to live truly private lives. Their influence can protect Lydia from those set on hurting her, or so they hope. But their past may prove to be just as dangerous. The pack have been fighting their own battle to break free of Seth Douglas, an omega who will stop at nothing to maintain his sadistic control over them. Jealous and bitter, Seth will do whatever it takes to get rid of Lydia, even if that means leading her abusers to her front door. When her past finds her, Lydia must decide what price she’s willing to pay for love… and hope that price isn’t her life.",
