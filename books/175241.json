  "title": "The Incident at Outpost 31",
  "description": "In the future, the Earth has become severely overpopulated. Poverty and unemployment reach an all-time high. The independent nations of the world have fallen and unified under one global government: The United World Alliance. Natural resources have been almost completely exhausted, so mankind is forced to venture out into space in search of new sources for replenishment.   This is a series of independent short fiction that serves as a gateway to a much larger dystopian universe, where a corrupt government rules with deception and lies; and enforces their secret agendas with its military might. From the mind of author and creator, John Mercier, The Alliance Case File series gives us our first glimpse into this expansive universe.",
