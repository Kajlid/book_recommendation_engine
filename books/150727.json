  "description": "You met Matti Raven briefly in Refuge when Adam Rainger gave her a ride just minutes before the invaders appeared above Adobe Creek. Now join her in surviving the destruction of her town.  She is sixteen years old. She is black. She survives a fiery, Earth invasion by creatures from the stars. Her family does not, and she is alone.  In the midst of fire and ash, Matti and her boyfriend, Woody, discover they have inexplicable, new abilities. She survived the initial holocaust by intercepting the thoughts of a dog cowering in a storm drain and joining it there. Woody’s power of levitation saves her, first from the clutches of an angry mob, and then from a collapsing house. He lures an invader away from their hiding place but fails to return, and she is alone again.  Matti is present when a lay-preacher commands from his pulpit that the invaders be gone, and, seeming to comply, they leave Earth en mass. The preacher, a fire and brimstone spewing racial bigot following his apparent mandate from God to rid Earth of evil—as he defines it—accuses Matti of being a minion of Satan and in collusion with the demon invaders. Forced to flee the group she had joined in her struggle for survival, she is, again, alone.  Amid ruin, Matti is given a choice to either join a gang of cutthroats in their brutal mode of survival—a life of evil she should be suited for if the preacher spoke the truth—or to be skinned alive just to see if she is black all the way through. Opting to go down fighting, she discovers she is not alone.",
