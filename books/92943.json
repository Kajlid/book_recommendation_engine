  "description": "The black witches are gunning for me, but I’m ready to hit back.\nSomeone is trying to kill me. It’s been happening for a while, so death threats and murder attempts are getting mundane. When a rogue fire elemental throws a fireball at my head, I’m not surprised, but I’m not thrilled either.Luckily, I currently have a live-in-protector; Bastion, the preeminent assassin of the magical world, has become my bodyguard and tormentor. The former because the coven council have paid him a princely sum to keep me alive, and the latter because he keeps strolling around in his underwear. How is a witch supposed to think with all of those muscles flexing about?Unfortunately, thinking is rather necessary in my line of work. I can’t afford to be distracted. I’m a rune and potion mistress, and it’s going to take all of my skills to concoct an antidote to save the life of one of my witches who got led astray by the black coven. She tried to quit, but the black coven doesn’t believe in notice periods. Her life hangs in the balance and I’ll do everything I can to save her life – even consult with my sentient grimoire.I’m ready to give the finger to the black witches and save her young life, when I get summoned to Edinburgh. My acolyte isn’t the only one who is in the black coven’s crosshairs. The Crone – my Aunt Abigay – has been targeted too.I have to choose.Do I save my young charge, or my aunt?\nDon't miss this witchy series if you like humour, heart and a strong heroine with a slow burn, enemies to lovers, fade-to-black romance.\nWritten in British English.",
