  "description": "Kai has been trained all his life to serve a great lady, so when he is sent to serve one, it is considered quite an honor. The honor doesn't seem to mean much, though, as he starts his new life, because the lady has little use for him. Kai soon realizes he's nothing more than a puppet in a game he has no control over. That's not his only problem. When bandit Chojiro kidnaps him to use as a bargaining piece in a very private negotiation, Kai finds himself in the awkward position of desiring his captor, wanting to be with Chojiro more than he wants to serve his lady. Wrapped up in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, will Kai find a way to happiness, or is he destined to be a pawn forever?",
