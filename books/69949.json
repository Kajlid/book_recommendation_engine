  "description": "Richard Ferguson serves up a gourmet's delight of living, walking, shrieking nightmares.If you are a connoisseur of heart-pounding terror accompanied by a side dish of the eeriest of whimsy-tales brewed in the outer limits of a great imagination, you couldn't ask for a more frightening menu.Richard Ferguson has prepared five of his most unsettling short pieces -- bizarre tales of dark doing and unthinkable acts where horror and madness take on weird, unearthly forms . . . where indistinct shapes in the dark and bumps in the night are always signs of something dreadful on the prowl.The settings are familiar and unsuspected.RUM AND HORS-D'OEUVRES -- One would hardly think two bankers relaxing on a porch would attract the forces of evil . . . unless one of them practiced the dark arts of Haiti.THE GENEALOGIST -- When Harry Poindexter sets out to learn about his ancestors, he has no idea what malevolent forces he will unleash.THE NIGHTRIDER'S SONG -- Doctor Vodun and The Mambo Sisters find out loose lips can sometimes do more than sink ships when their rock group heads for the next gig.LI FAN'S CAMERA -- Johnny Corbett discovers that sometimes crime not only doesn't pay, it can unlock an unfathomable surprise.BAEL STUMPE -- When Bael meets his father after thirteen years, he enters the world of madness.In Richard Ferguson's cookbook, the entrees are always flavored with evil spices.",
