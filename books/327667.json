  "description": "Mason I watched the love of my life die in front of my eyes, and in that unparalleled moment of pain and rage, I made a terrible mistake. But I was wrong . She wasn’t dead, and the consequences of those actions did not disappear. The man I owed my debt to, my own father, didn’t care that he cleaned up my mess. He didn’t even want recompense for me abandoning the empire he built and intended to hand to me. He wanted a war. There was more at play than an old vendetta and new wounds. Our city was built on a foundation of lies and pain, and I needed to stop it. I needed to protect the woman I loved, but what would those efforts cost me? Claire The man I loved grew darker by the day. Each night he didn't come home to me, he sank deeper into his old world. The lies easily flowed from those dimly lit and bloodsoaked places. Why didn’t he trust me to bear his burdens alongside him? Hadn't I proved I loved him despite the secrets and half truths. His fear, and his need to protect me made sense. He almost lost me in the shooting, but I lost myself. The guilt, pain, and fear, all drove me to decisions I would come to regret. Would my quest for justice bring me the peace I so desperately craved? Despite how complicated our lives became, I would never regret choosing Mason.",
