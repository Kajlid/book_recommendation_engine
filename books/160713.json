  "description": "Kellen Vargas, Lead Enforcer of the Rue Pack, never thought he'd ever find his mate - that missing piece of his soul. Walking into the Pack House one fateful day changed all that. He came face to face with Ryan Oliver, the most beautiful man he'd ever seen. He then proceeded to make a fool of himself, in the time-honored tradition of all men. Ryan is shy and very unsure of himself, especially around Kellan, the tall and blond Nordic God. Can they overcome their fears and misgivings as they wait for Ryan's 18th birthday in two weeks? Their forever love depends on it.",
