  "description": "Even in the barren wasteland of urban decay new green life is possible. In Nature and in Love,that which can be, somehow finds a crack, a corner or ledge and grasps its chance of life.A woman on the run from domestic violence with no one but her vulnerable autistic teenage child as a companion, lives in isolation and fear. While her hand to mouth scenarios are played out in the shadow of a threatening suspense, a story of crime and love unfolds around her. She cannot risk her child. Her own longings for love and romance have to take a poor second place. When the fallout from a prison break, a hero rescue and a murder mystery crash through her door and into her need and loneliness, it is no longer a crime story. It is a question of when Love in itself is a crime and how far a woman will go in its name and for those she loves.Part of Emma Calin's 'Love in a Hopeless Place Collection' - a series of stand-alone titles. Available as an individual e-book or as a part of the 'boxed-set'.
