  "description": "Both girls spotted the attractive hunk in the art gallery. One dreamed about him, the other tried to forget him and concentrate on her art studies. Drug addiction and shame interfered with romance. Salvation came unexpectedly, and just in time. Escape from the drug dealer's revenge was made possible through the unexpected intervention of a friend, Tommy. As tragedy struck, they now focused on him, of whom the drug lord needed to make an example to anyone who considered crossing him. All this happened while life went on for his stepbrother, the hunk, who hoped to win the favor of the pretty girl in whose eyes he looked so directly for a fleeting moment.",
