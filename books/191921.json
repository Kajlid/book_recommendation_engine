  "description": "Look out, Shifters of Silver Peak, there’s a new sheriff in town. Unfortunately, it’s curvy, clumsy Chelsea Wintergreen, who knows how to make twenty flavors of cake pop but knows nothing about law enforcement. And even worse, after she’s suckered into letting the local pack deputize her, she finds out that her first assignment is…bringing in sexy, deadly Roman Kincaid, the leader of a rogue band of shifters. Roman Kincaid may be allergic to commitment, but he takes one look at Chelsea’s lush curves and knows he has to have her. In his bed. In his life. He’s spent his whole life on the run from his past, but sweet, sassy Chelsea may have him rethinking his “hit it and quit it and leave town tomorrow” philosophy. But he and his gang of uncivilized shifters are going to have to work double-hard to convince Chelsea they’re capable of changing their ways…and a mysterious rash of sheep thefts and murder isn’t going to make it any easier.",
