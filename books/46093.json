  "description": "Four hundred years in the future, the Caliphate of Chrislam rules a galactic human empire from the cities of Ulthule and Anthule in Earth’s Northern and Southern Polar regions. The oppressive rule of the Caliphate is unchallenged except for one group of people who will not the Durans, who are descendants of warriors genetically engineered to be resistant to chemical weapons and nuclear radiation, and who now live in the blistering, tornado swept deserts of Earth. Ben Har-Jude, a young student of history, arrives on Ulthule hoping to pursue his studies at the Great School of History and Religion, but on an archaeological expedition in the deep desert his helicraft crashes and he is captured by the Durans. There he meets and falls in love with Farah, the beautiful Duran raid leader, who enlists him in her plan to threaten the Caliphate with an archaeological discovery of data from the early 21st century, data that will destroy the central tenet of Chrislam and precipitate the fall of the Caliphate. But—unknown to Farah or Ben—there are greater challenges emerging than the conflict between the Desert Durans and Caliphate Chrislamists. The future of interstellar space travel, and with it of galactic humanity, is at stake.This tale is a future history, a story of where our planet may be heading if we continue to make the wrong decisions as nations and as a species; a story of the perennial cycles of conflict between peoples, and of the power of human love, human imagination and human creativity to continually redeem and renew existence.",
