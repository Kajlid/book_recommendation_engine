It's just her luck that everything falls into its precise place in her life. At least it seems that way until her blueprints go up in smoke. She loses the job she loves, and her Prince Charming is turning out to be the villain of her fairy tale instead.

Two sides of him constantly wage war against each other, and to keep the internal bloodshed at bay he allows himself to indulge in his violent vice. Suit by day and brawler by night aren't easy dual lives to manage for a man of his status. The only way to do so is by following a strict set of rules - rules he won't break for anyone. But what if he already has?On a summer night in the depths of the city, a chance encounter will turn Beth and Braxton's perfectly constructed worlds upside down. Will they battle together against all odds to break Braxton's rules? Or will Beth tap out to save herself before the fight is over?",
