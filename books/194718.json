  "description": "This book is fun, smart, manic and ecstatic; it puts on a clean shirt before it loads the gun. You Are a Little Bit Happier Than I Am has the energy and oddness of a thing that is rising very fast that is not supposed to be rising, or that is supposed to be rising but for a moment you forget that, and for a moment this ordinary thing looks very strange and exciting",
