  "description": "Can true love exist between a man who believes a woman is capable of sticking a shive in his heart while making love and a woman who is convinced men think with only one head? Maxwell Magic, an eccentric mysterious matchmaker swears it can and he's the man to provide the stimulus to make it happen. Kasey Bell, feminist writer, and Guy McLane, radio's famous chauvinistic psychiatrist, are his targets. Even with carefully executed plans, the road to true love is strewn with mishaps, mirth and money-hungry nighttime talk show hosts. Will Kasey and Guy risk their reputations by exposing secrets buried beneath layers of shame and self–doubt for a desperately needed big money payoff? Or, will they claim what has evaded them their entire lives–a love that lasts forever?",
