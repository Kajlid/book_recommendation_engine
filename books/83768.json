  "description": "Rylie Gresham has enjoyed two peaceful years as Alpha of the last werewolf pack in existence. But she's feeling kind of confused. Her boyfriend, Seth, has been away at college, and her feelings for his brother, Abel, have been growing as they run the pack together. Everything gets a lot more complicated when someone sends her a silver bullet and a threatening message. It throws her into a deadly battle with enemies old and new, which is only slightly less perilous than the battle inside her heart. Sooner or later, she's going to have to choose: will she marry Seth, or follow her feelings for Abel? This is a collection of the first four episodes of The Cain Chronicles: New Moon Summer, Blood Moon Harvest, Moon of the Terrible and Red Rose Moon. If you've read episodes 1 to 4 before, there's nothing new here.",
