  "description": "DECEMBER 21, 2012. The Mayans chose this as the point of alpha and omega. The day when one age would end and a new one begin. They called it Creation Day.BEFORE THE BEGINNING... The war between Good and Evil began in the untime. Long before the universe existed, God's most beloved archangel and his legion rose up against Him, and were cast into Hell. And Lucifer became Satan.OCTOBER 1947. Two scrolls are discovered. One was written by Lot, after his escape from Sodom. The other is the precursor to the Book of Revelation: the Apocalypse of Enoch, personal scribe to God. Their eyewitness testimony gives indisputable proof: HEAVEN AND HELL ARE REAL. THERE IS A GOD. THERE IS A SATAN. Enoch foretells their day of reckoning: DECEMBER 21, 2012.Thus begins the ultimate archaeological dig: the dig for Hell. It is a demon-stalked quest that will Zeke Sloan from Satanic murders in Washington, D.C. to a necropolis deep beneath Jerusalem--where a man believing he is John the Baptist communes with God, and the dead await their Messiah. Then deeper, to the lowest point on earth: the Dead Sea. Then deeper still--into the darkest heart of Evil. For it is far below the mysterious body of water the Greeks called the Devil's Sea that Armageddon will take place.THE WAR THAT BEGAN IN HEAVEN MUST END IN HELL.",
