  "description": "\"...an emotional ride as each life is seeded and grows to fruition, full of hope, and vowing to be different, only to be struck down by the vagaries of life/climate.\" -Kindle customer reviewThe windswept Flint Hills of Kansas promised bountiful wildlife and fertile valleys, but for Virginia, Helen and Leah it was an empty promise. Dreams here often withered and died from starvation or the harshness and unpredictability of the climate. Eventually, each woman must face the decision to set aside her own hopes and dreams in the struggle to maintain home and family against impossible odds.Skillfully creating compassionate characters with a range of emotions, WINDBORNE is a novel unique in style and scope. Set against a historical backdrop of major economic and cultural changes of the past century, it is an elegantly timeless tale about the nature of love, loss and awakening.",
