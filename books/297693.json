  "title": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall",
  "description": "Another cover edition for this ISBN\nCompelling in its imaginative power and bold naturalism, the novel opens in the autumn of 1812, when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Bronte's enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized. This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.",
