  "title": "The New Du Rose Matriarch",
  "description": "The Du Rose family have returned to Hamilton to begin married life with their new daughter but things are not going well. Hana’s ideas of being a better mother at forty five are continually challenged by the demands of her child, not least because her husband has been drafted in as the temporary manager of the school boarding house and the staff living accommodation is dreadful. Logan welcomes the distraction of trying to unravel the financial mystery which is threatening the future of the boarding house, because it stops him having to deal with the chaos of his mother’s death and the subsequent misery that it has unleashed on the whole whanau. Hana’s pursuer is in prison and she should finally be safe, but another danger is getting ready to stretch its influence over her and make life unbearable.",
