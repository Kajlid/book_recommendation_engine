  "description": "Ciarah O’Rourke was born into torture. A human spirit reincarnated in the body of an ancient fae goddess, she’s spent the last five years in iron shackles, her mind poisoned with magic for secrets she doesn’t know.  Waking up in a dirty alley with no memory of her escape, Ciarah finds herself in the hands of The Wild Hunt Motorcycle Club--a ruthless and violent group of bikers with faerie blood in their veins.  Arlo. Reece. Killian. Three men drenched in death, sin, and old magic. From their clubhouse in the middle of the Louisiana bayou, they’ll offer Ciarah the keys to unlock her memories and control the veil between worlds. But even her knights can’t erase the twisted scars that remind her they aren’t the only ones who hunt.  When The Wild Hunt rides, the souls of the dead join their parade. All that’s missing now is their queen.  DARK GLITTER is the first of three books in THE WILD HUNT MOTORCYCLE CLUB series, a full-length reverse harem novel with dark faeries, werewolves, goddesses, voodoo magic, steamy scenes, graphic violence, cursing, and a supernatural motorcycle club.",
