  "description": "When inventor Godfrey Davis arrived at the ministry that Monday morning he had his first experience of the new phenomenon. There was something wrong with the aging android fleet that served the colony. Since when did they ever have names?The president’s visit to his office later that morning gave credence to his earlier experience in the foyer, and somehow his long deceased father now seemed implicated. As Godfrey’s week spiralled out of control the future of the colony was now in jeopardy, and it was all because of him. He should never have left his latest piece of technology unattended.If only he could find his father’s secret invention and turn back the clock then maybe he could redeem himself and save their society. But the past was about to collide with the present and the future now seemed very uncertain indeed.",
