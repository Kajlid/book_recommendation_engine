  "title": "The Body of Chris: A Memoir of Obsession, Addiction, and Madness",
  "description": "Struggling with lifelong disordered eating and adolescent addiction, Chris Cole had his first psychotic episode at the age of eighteen, suddenly believing he was the Second Coming of Christ. He lost his identity and tried to perform miracles and was ultimately arrested in the lobby of his college dormitory—all while convinced he was being taken to his crucifixion. Even when sanity returned, he could not help but contemplate God’s involvement. For years, Chris danced with delusion, but he eventually surrendered to his humanity and learned to embrace reality.The Body of Chris explores mental illness—from bipolar disorder to substance use to binge eating—in one man’s search for salvation. From his oldest wounds to his renewed spirituality, author Chris Cole tells his story with unflinching honesty in hopes of reaching people who suffer from mental illness and those who love them.",
