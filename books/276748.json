  "description": "Shifting Into High Fear\nGhost/god Wes Cooper and his not-life partner, vampire Hudson Rojas, have settled into cohabitation in an upscale part of Toronto. So what if their hoity-toity new neighbors haven’t exactly rolled out the welcome mat for the paranormal pair? Their PI business is booming, and when a suspect they’ve been tailing winds up in the morgue, it’s alongside a rash of other shifters in apparent drug-related fatalities.Now Wes and Hudson must connect the dots between the shifter deaths and an uptick in brutal vampire attacks across the city. Throw in a surprise visit from Hudson’s niece—who may or may not be on the run from European paranormal police (who may or may not exist)—and guardianship of a teen shifter who might be the key to solving the whole mystery (if only she could recover her memory), and Wes and Hudson have never been busier…or happier.But when a nightmare from Hudson’s past comes back to haunt him, their weird, little found family is pushed to the brink. Mucking this up would mean Hudson and Wes missing their second chance at happily-forever-afterlife…Not Dead YetBook 1: Not Dead YetBook 2: Give Up the GhostBook 3: Graveyard ShiftAshes and DustBook 1: All Fired UpBook 2: House on FireBook 3: Out of the AshesChaos Station by Jenn Burke and Kelly JensenBook 1: Chaos StationBook 2: Lonely ShoreBook 3: Skip TraceBook 4: Inversion PointBook 5: Phase Shift",
