  "description": "Tacky’s the odd bird out among all his friends. Will this nonconformist teach old penguins some new tricks and help save the day? Tacky the Penguin is a delightful tale about being true to yourself—even when it means being a little different from everybody else. Tacky likes to do splashy cannonballs and greet his friends with a loud, “What’s happening?” His fellow penguins find his odd behavior somewhat bothersome. But when fearsome poachers come to the iceberg hunting for penguins, Tacky’s odd ways may be just the thing that saves the day. From beloved children’s book author Helen Lester and cherished illustrator Lynn Munsinger, the funny Tacky the Penguin books follow the adventures of one superlative penguin and should not be missed!",
