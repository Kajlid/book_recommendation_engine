  "title": "Monkey Love and Murder",
  "description": "Emma Parks joins a monkey research project deep in the South American rainforest on a whim. She refuses to admit it might have something to do with a close friend's death from which she has not recovered, but it's certainly not because she knows anything about spider monkeys, least of all what they look like. She's barely arrived when International Wildlife Conservation's renowned director drowns during a party celebrating the group's controversial takeover of the park. Tension mounts following the machete murder of a researcher, threatening Emma's budding primatology career, her secret romance with an Australian zoologist, and more importantly -- her life.",
