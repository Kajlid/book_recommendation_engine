  "description": "When Kitty hears about the notorious ‘panty raid’ happening at a bar Friday night, she heads in looking for a good time with no strings attached. She might want to get laid, but she does not want to be part of any motorcycle club’s lifestyle. She’s not good with following directions or taking orders, and she’s been told that’s what an old lady does.  But when she meets Gemini and Domino, everything changes. The dual presidents of the Bedlam Butchers, they stake their claim on Kitty and decide to show her what the club lifestyle is really about: riding free, living on the edge, and letting them show her just how good being claimed by two men can be. Kitty might like being the center of their attentions, but when her life takes a dangerous turn, she has to decide who to trust both in bed and out of it.  This novella contains boy on girl on boy, fun on AND under a table, and a naughty heroine who gives as good as she gets.  PACKING DOUBLE is a complete novella of 25,000 words. No cliffhangers—only hot and sexy romance. The Motorcycle Clubs series is romance for readers who want all of the heat and emotion, but who don't have all of the time.  HIS WILD DESIRE - Out now!
