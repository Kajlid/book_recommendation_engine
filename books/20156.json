  "description": "When Angelica Skylar is found dead in the local duck pond, her fourteen-year-old daughter Thumbelina is completely alone in the world, her pee-colored hair flowing over the back pockets of her jeans and thick glasses covering a face she doesn't even know is pretty. Captivating yet incorrigibly stupid about men, Angelica wasn't much of a mother when she was alive, but now that she's gone, Thumbelina yearns to have her back. Quickly placed into a foster family, Thumbelina bumps straight into Myrna, a feisty redhead half her size who has a baby in her stomach. Also fourteen years old and as savvy as they come, Myrna has no trouble figuring out that her secretive new roommate is pregnant, too. With little money but lots of spirit, the unlikely pair strike out on their own, only to run into more serious trouble and heartache than they could have ever imagined.Laughs mingle with tears throughout this unforgettable story of a young girl embracing hope against all odds. Thumbelina's distinctive and instantly lovable voice will hook readers on the very first page...and it won't let go until the last.",
