  "description": "\"This guide is to help people avoid some of the obvious as well as not so obvious pitfalls of unwitting racism and anti-Semitism.\"Amoja Three Rivers' \"Cultural Etiquette: A Guide for the Well-Intentioned\" was originally published in 1990. It was intended as an antidote to the poison of microaggressions committed by people of all racial and ethnic groups in writing and thinking about as well as speaking and interacting with Black/Indigenous/People of Color and Jewish people.Long before Franchesca Ramsey's \"Sh#t White Girls Say to Black Girls\" YouTube video and all the videos and blogs that grew from it, \"Cultural Etiquette\" was a thoughtful, witty account of the things no one should say to members of racial and ethnic groups subjected to systemic oppression in the United States. Sample chapter headings include \"What Is Ethnocentrism and What Should I Take For It?\" and \"Just Donâ€™t Do This. Okay?\"This edition is authorized by the next-of-kin of the late Amoja Three Rivers and is published by the author's designated custodian of her writings. It preserves all of Three Rivers' words with only tiny changes in punctuation, spelling corrections and formatting necessary for an ebook.",
