  "description": "He's in love with his best friend. She's dating his number one suspect. What could go wrong? Harmony Brose can't stop fantasizing about her best friend. After a few drinks, she took a risk. She asked Chase to kiss her. It was the best kiss of her life. Until he jumped up and left, breaking her heart. Officer Chase Harvey had thought about kissing Harmony for years but never crossed that line until that night. Fearing Harmony was drunk, he had to cut it off until he was sure she truly wanted him. Apparently she didn't, because Harmony just started dating the new man in town. Chase doesn't have time to waste on regrets. A woman vanished from their small town and he'll do whatever is necessary to solve the case. When evidence points to the new man, Chase must follow the lead. It has nothing at all to do with the fact the man is dating Harmony... Now he has to decide. Is he willing to risk losing the woman he loves in order to protect her?",
