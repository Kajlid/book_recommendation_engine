  "description": "Hearts drawn together, hands cannot touch. To be together, one must forsake her family, and one must poison himself. On a secluded farm in northern Arkansas's Boston Mountains, Thadacus, a vampire, happens to be passing through. Someone else magical steps out into the night air to gaze at the bright moon, a girl, Rhymee Stewart. Their encounter is no coincidence. Thad is drawn to Rhymee, and he soon discovers that several ancient forces are conspiring to kill her because of her family legacy. Thad devotes himself to protecting Rhymee, but the forces attacking her are beyond his power to control. Thadacus and Rhymee seem destined to be together, though it is painful for them to touch while Rhymee is still human. Their lives have long been connected, and it seems there is no way to live apart. Still, they are each the other's toxin; being with Thadacus will pull Rhymee away from her family, and Rhymee's very blood-which Thadacus must drink-could kill Thadacus. While she is human, she has deep magic coursing through her veins, which could react disastrously with vampire blood. As Rhymee is hunted by evil beings, time closes in on Thadacus's decision to take her life into his own hands. Rhymee longs to join Thadacus as a vampire, but she fears the separation from her family. In this new twist on the classic vampire tale, author Kymberly Cook fluidly weaves an original vampire mythology into the traditional lore. Western civilization comes together with ancient history and mythology, including Thor's hammer, druid priests, and the code of chivalry. Will these Rhymee and Thad go against nature and live together as vampires, or will Thad heed Her Blood's Warning ?",
