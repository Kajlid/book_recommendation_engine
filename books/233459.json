Crispin - New York Times Bestselling author of the STARBRIDGE series, numerous STAR WARS and STAR TREK titles, and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: The Price of Freedom.  In a family with a long line of “witchers,” Ethan West exhibits the ability to see across time and space at an early age. Punished mercilessly by his mother to suppress his power, Ethan grows to adulthood in the present-day Maryland countryside learning to hide his gifts, only exercising them to make a modest living. He achieves brief happiness by marrying the love of his life, but normalcy doesn’t last long. In a thunderstorm, Ethan’s wife, Bethany, is vaporized by a freak lightning strike. Like a whisper in the wind, he hears Beth’s thoughts and knows she still exists somewhere, somewhen.  If he can see across time, why can't he inhabit one of those times? Ethan takes on a quest that will shatter his understanding of reality and require Herculean efforts to master time and space to rejoin the woman he loves. But to do so, he must make a devil's deal with an unscrupulous scientist whose only goal is power, no matter who gets hurt.  TIME JUMPER asks the question every classic thriller presents: Who will prevail?",
