  "description": "alternate cover edition of ASIN B08ND9Z5K3Resisting the shortstop has never been my strong suit. I failed at it during my first spring training. It sure as hell looks like I'm about to fail at it again. The sport I love playing with my very soul hangs in the balance. But everything my heart craves lies with the guy I've got to resist. A guy who's asking me to make the toughest choice ever. But how do I become the man I want to be...with him or without him? Trouble is, I can't seem to get Declan out of my head, even if I stand to lose everything I've worked for my entire life... \nWinning with Him is book two in the utterly addictive Men of Summer series, and should be read following Scoring With Him. This romance between two professional athletes spans five epic years.",
