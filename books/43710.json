An errant dart thrown at a map leads him to the beautiful Andalucian city of Seville where he enrols on a yearlong, intensive Spanish course.Andy embraces his new life and crosses paths with a disparate group of characters. There’s hippy- chick Saffron; mad, philosophical Swede Johan; feisty Maggie-a girl who isn’t his type; and dark, Sevillian beauty, Marilo.As the year races by, Andy becomes convinced that destiny has something amazing in store for him.But destiny doesn’t always turn out in the way you think it will. Life and love can sometimes force you to make some very tough choices. Can Andy make the right choices?Set against the cultural backdrop of Moorish Spain and the release of seminal albums by U2 and Nirvana, 'Finding Yourself in Seville' is a novel about finding love in unexpected places, and a very funny, male rom-com with a twist.",
