  "description": "Drawing the Indian Women Fight Back!\"\" is a comics anthology by 14 women of their day-to-day experiences in India. Produced out of a week-long workshop with Indian women artists, both amateur and professional, Drawing the Line is part of a larger national conversation in India around sexual discrimination that emerged in the aftermath of the brutal gang-rape and murder of a young medical student in 2012. First published in cooperation with feminist Indian publisher Zubaan Books and the Goethe Institute, Ad Astra Comix is pleased to bring \"\"Drawing the Line\"\" to a North American readership, reminding us that feminism must be intersectional and global in its approach.",
