  "description": "One of the world's greatest novelists, Leo Tolstoy (1828â€“1910) also wrote numerous excellent short stories, three of which are contained in this volume. \"The Kreutzer Sonata\" (1891) is a penetrating study of jealousy as well as a splenetic complaint about the way in which society educates young men and women in matters of sex. In \"The Death of Ivan Ilych\" (1886), a symbolic Everyman discovers the inner light of faith and love only when confronted by death. \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\" (1886) is a simple, didactic story of peasant life, written by Tolstoy in the wake of a spiritual crisis. All three tales offer readers a splendid introduction to Tolstoy's work as well as the focused delights of the short story form brought to a pinnacle in the hands of a master.",
