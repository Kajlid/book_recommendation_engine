But when the suspected murderer turns out to be a leather-clad vagabond who died in 1889, her carefully controlled quiet life explodes. Not only is Sophie in the wrong place at the wrong time, as a local history buff who loves old legends, she knows too much about the past to remain uninvolved.

Going against her best judgment, Sophie joins forces with the distracting sexy detective on the police investigation and in pursuit of a killer. Jackson is hot to solve the case as they follow the clues through Connecticut and New York State, uncovering both legend and fact. As they move closer to solving the murder, a series of missteps shoves Sophie right into Jackson's arms and straight into the media. Trouble is everywhere. Jackson's career begins to crumble and Sophie becomes a suspect in the heinous crime. The case unravels. The past and present collide. Sophie is swept into more danger than she could ever imagine when the Old Leather Man comes looking for her hide to tan.",
