Now everyone is trying to get to the government, the Imria, and a mysterious corporation that would do anything for the upper hand against the aliens.Beyond the web of conspiracies, Reese can't reconcile her love for David with her feelings for her ex-girlfriend, Amber, an Imrian. But Reese's choice between two worlds will play a critical role in determining the future of humanity, the Imria's place in it, and the inheritance she and David will bring to the universe.In this gripping sequel to Adaptation , Malinda Lo brings a thoughtful exploration of adolescence, sexuality, and \"the other\" to a science-fiction thriller that is impossible to put down.",
