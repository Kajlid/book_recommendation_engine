Now, two of them are dead and the third is close on Teagan’s heels, intent on eliminating the last obstacle to a monstrous plot. She cannot risk entrusting the police. Her finger prints are all over one crime scene and her foot print smeared into blood at another.

Teagan flees with the babies to the only refuge she can think of − the wilderness cabin belonging to the grandmother of her lost love. But is even this remote location safe?",
