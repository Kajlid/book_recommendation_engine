  "description": "Have you ever asked yourself, “Is this worth dying for?” FBI Special Agent Rheyna Sorento must answer that question when she gets the assignment of her life and how she answers, may very well put her in the ground. When three key government informants connected to the Massino crime family turn up dead, all signs point to an internal leak and FBI Deputy Director Kyle Edwards decides to take action and Rheyna jumps at the opportunity to join the team.Using friendship and deceit, she soon finds herself deeply immersed in the family of Anthony Big Tony Castrucci, the man slated to become the next Under Boss. Over the course of several months, a rising body count, and countless hours of mind numbing surveillance, Rheyna jeopardizes the mission, her life, and those of her team when she unexpectedly falls in love with Caroline, the mobsters all too beautiful and very straight daughter. If Rheyna thinks things cannot get much worse, she is sadly mistaken when the mole releases her identity, setting Big Tony on a path of destruction like none the bureau has ever known, a path that in the end will produce the unlikeliest hero.",
