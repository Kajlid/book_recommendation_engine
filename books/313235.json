  "description": "Cassidy Smith is desperate for some excitement. Her free-spirited best friend keeps her on her toes with the occasional misadventure, but deep down, she just needs... more. When the girls stumble into a bar known for its bad reputation and a tattooed, bad boy owner, Cassidy’s left daydreaming about what it would be like to ditch her boring life and find a way to fit in with the rough, rowdy crowd of The Pound. Jack Campbell’s got a one-track mind. He works hard to provide for the guys who work for him and even harder to keep his bar running in tip-top shape. He can’t afford the temptation of Cassidy being more than just a temporary employee, but against his better judgment, he offers the beautiful blonde a job at his bar. Things get more complicated for Jack when his older brother starts stirring up trouble in town, etching a target on his back and forcing him into a world he promised never to turn back to. With their hearts on the table and a deck full of secrets, will they bet it all... or give up their hand?",
