For those born without magic, like Lilith, the Arcane Ceremony, where witches are evaluated by the Council, it’s a waste of time. When Lilith somehow develops powers she shouldn’t have, her entire life is turned upside down with the possibility that she may have to leave her home coven of Ignis.At the Arcane Ceremony, an attack from a rogue witch forces Lilith to use her newfound ability to save another witch. Intrigued, the Council recruits her. Fearing the consequences of saying no, Lilith accepts. Under their wing, Lilith is gradually let in on the truth—everything she’s learned about the Land of Five, herself included, have been nothing but lies. **Winner of the 2019 Fiction - Fantasy Pencraft Award of Literary Excellence**",
