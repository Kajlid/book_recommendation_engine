His days of unruly behavior and risky decisions have dealt him a hand that he’s still trying to overcome as he seeks to accomplish his business dreams.But the hits keep adding up. His best friend is knocked up by an ex that won’t back off, a family member drops in unexpectedly and questions need answered, and the easier aspects in life are suddenly being tested beyond his control.When ultimate tragedy wreaks havoc on his life, it sends Jay over the edge. He can’t seem to manage the simple things anymore and he reverts back to his old ways of shutting people out and living carelessly. He loses everything he’s gained so far—everything that he didn’t know he wanted—all in one ugly weekend.There is only one thing that can really save him from complete ruins, and this time it might not be so easily at his disposal. And then there is that damn McCallan pride that automatically resists help at every turn. It just may be the very thing that causes him to lose everything for good…",
