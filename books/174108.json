  "description": "After accidentally treating her in-laws to a peep show upon their first meeting, and having a catfight with her husband’s vengeful ex, legal investigator Sara Townley hopes her next assignment is a simple one. So she takes on a case of stolen identity—that finds her in a seedy back street. Then Sara narrowly escapes becoming a casualty—a fate awaiting her one and only witness. In the meantime, Sara seems to have picked up a sidekick: a big, black Labrador who shows up at every turn. And since her only lead is growing cold in the morgue, maybe following the dog’s nose isn’t such a bad idea…REVIEW:",
