  "description": "Our voices and love will never be silenced...Everett James ThompsonKnown for my charismatic stage presence and being the oldest son of music royalty, I’ve always been able to do exactly what I want.Front my own band? Become one of the powerhouses in the metal genre? Make a name for myself without using that of my parents? I’ve done all of it.But when Brianna Jenkins walked into my life during a Vegas show, I knew without a doubt my carefully laid plans were over.Getting married to her after a drunken night of debauchery should’ve been the worst mistake of my life. Instead? It’s the best decision I’ve ever made, and our record company thinks so too.Or they did…Brianna Jenkins ThompsonI’ve traveled the world, performed at Madison Square Garden, and sold out arenas everywhere. Nothing ever really made me nervous. That is, until I met EJ Thompson in Vegas. I needed liquid courage to talk to him, and that night changed my life forever.Gone is the girl under her parents thumb, doing everything the record company tells her, and worrying constantly. In her place is a wife. A woman who knows her worth, standing beside the man who gave her his last name, his ring, and the confidence to let her voice be heard.When the record company realizes just how much of a power couple we are; they serve us with a summons for breach of contract, expecting us to roll over.But there’s two things they can’t silence. Our voices, and our love.",
