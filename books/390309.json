After narrowly escaping justice in a desperate dash to Mexico in Leighton Rockafellow's previous novel - Immaculate Deception, Lindy Roller is back in this latest installment of the pulse-pounding series, featuring the Tucson attorney and his partner, Bill Wilson. And this time Lindy is the hired killer for drug lord Juan Pacheco. As Ross struggles to put a stop to the mayhem caused by the reckless surgeon, keep his severely injured client in check, and chase the trail of money as it hemorrhages out of the hospital's coffers, Lindy becomes the wild card, plunging into the midst of it all, with a contract to kill and vengeance on her mind. And just when Ross doesn't think it could get any worse, he finds himself in the middle of a lawsuit - where he is the defendant!",
