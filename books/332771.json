  "title": "Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography (The Definitive Inside Story of the Supergroup",
  "description": "Crosby, Stills, and Nash created some of the most indelible songs and beautiful harmonies of the late 1960s and early 1970s: \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\" \"Woodstock,\" \"Teach Your Children.\" Now the story behind the songs has been told in this engrossing account of the trio's personal and musical history. Zimmer, with the full cooperation of the band, traces each of the performers from their early musical roots to their first song together in L.A.'s storied Laurel Canyon, from their addition of Neil Young to Woodstock, from their stormy years of creative conflicts through their reunions and reconciliations. A new chapter delves into Crosby's recovery from drug addiction, CSN's ongoing solo and group projects, and the making of the new CSNY album.",
