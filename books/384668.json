  "title": "Alas, Babylon",
  "description": "This true modern masterpiece is built around the two fateful words that make up the title and herald the end - \"Alas, Babylon.\" When a nuclear holocaust ravages the United States, a thousand years of civilization are stripped away overnight, and tens of millions of people are killed instantly.But for one small town in Florida, miraculously spared, the struggle is just beginning, as men and women of all backgrounds join together to confront the darkness. Will Patton's narration paints this classic tale as an ominous picture of the terrible possibilities of the nuclear age.The day after the bomb dropped the thousands of years of \"progress\" that had covered the treacheries and lusts of ordinary man with a thin veneer of civilization were dissolved and melted like snow on the desert's dusty face. Then--the law of the jungle reigned. But in the wreckage a few courageous survivors, men and women with the guts to have hope, were determined to build a new and better world on the ruins of their old. THIS IS THEIR STORY.",
