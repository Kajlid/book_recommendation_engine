  "description": "No one can survive outside the Dome…Outside of the Dome, the Earth is ravaged by toxic waste and violent mutants, but the Outside also has resources necessary to keep the Dome functioning. Inside, life is split between the rich Sky and the poor Dirt. The Decemites—carefully selected children injected with nanobots and trained to survive the search for resources—have a chance for a better life. But that life comes at a steep price, and few survive long enough to enjoy it.Myla wasn’t chosen to be a Decemite, but she’s carried a secret in her blood since birth: her parents, a forbidden Decemite match, passed along to her the same nanobots that make the chosen strong. When Myla’s foster sister, Ona, is chosen as a Decemite and goes missing on her first mission, Myla will have to brave the toxic world to find her. She’s determined to go it alone, but when Lock, the Decemite golden boy, finds her he becomes an unlikely companion in her quest. No matter how close they grow, however, she can’t tell him her secret. She’s hidden the truth about her nanobots all her life, and if Lock finds out about her, he’s sure to turn her in.But Myla is unprepared for the truth of the Outside. No human is supposed to be able to survive, but rebel Outsiders prove everything she’s been taught is a lie. And a rebel boy, Ben, shows her a life she could have never imagined as he draws her deep into the rebel world.To find Ona she’ll need to infiltrate the rebel Outsiders, where she learns the ugly truth about her home. Can she ever go back to her old life underground or is her only chance at freedom Outside?",
