  "description": "ABRACADABRA ...... Ancient words uttered to invoke a magical response and the very phrase which catapults Alexander Storm and Company into their next mind-bending race against evil. High adventure abounds as the returning cast of characters dash around the globe in an effort to thwart the rising menace. Their journeys take them to the ancient ruins of Solomon and the secretive caves of Qumran, across the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean and through the vast landscape of India. Their objective … a morphing mystery. Their adversaries … relentless and evil. And at the heart of it all … a magic force so archaic that it threatens to unravel the very fabric of existence.",
