  "description": "NYC. Height of Depression. The male Miss G columnist is weighted down by gloom. Obscene rhymes repeat, patterned after songs for children or mocking religion. His boss yells them in the office. In the Speakeasy other drunken writers chorus, commiserate and rant, with rape fantasies about female writers.",
