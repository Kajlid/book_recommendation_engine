  "description": "This second collection of Nick Cave's song lyrics and other writings covers the period from the ground-breaking album Tender Prey to the sublime simplicity of The Boatman's Call. In addition to all Cave's lyrics recorded with The Bad Seeds during this time, King Ink II includes several lyrics as yet unrecorded, as well as a number written for other artists and for the Wim Wenders films Faraway, So Close! and Until the End of the World. A short film treatment and a substantial essay on the subject of language and the Bible, \"The Flesh Made Word,\" are among further material which is not available elsewhere.",
