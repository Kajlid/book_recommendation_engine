  "description": "In this hotly awaited sequel to Worldshaker, the Filthies are in control. But violence and tension simmer just under the surface: supplies of coal are fast diminishing, the acts of a mysterious saboteur are causing great hostility, and the Imperialist powers are massing for war. Col and Riff's relationship is pushed to the limit as they do all in their power to preserve the fragile peace. This shattering conclusion to the saga shows Richard Harland at his vivid, energetic best.",
