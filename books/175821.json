  "title": "Paradigm Shift: How to cultivate equanimity in the face of market uncertainty",
  "description": "The best traders have learned to detach their self-worth from any potential trade outcomes. They have learned to free their mind of the emotional stigma associated with mistakes and failures. They don't crave certainty, money, or being right; nor do they incessantly dwell in futile thoughts of past and future - they have evolved beyond those fetters. Getting to this point is a by-product of self-knowledge, which comes through a spiritual practice of some sort. Spirituality does not have to have religious connotations. Sitting in contemplation of your body and mind is a spiritual practice in and of itself. Paradigm Shift, targets the new generation of online traders who are struggling with the psychological aspect of trading. It sheds light on the different factors that prevent us from manifesting trading success - or any kind of success - in our lives. It lays down the foundations for the cultivation of equanimity in the markets. It is my hope that the material presented in the book will bring you one step closer to that ideal mindset that will allow you to manifest not only wealth, but also physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.",
