  "title": "The Hopper-Hill Family",
  "description": "Piper Hill had lived in the same house, with the same neighbors, and the same routine, most of her life. Seventh grade started the same as every year before it, but everything changed when her dad received a phone call about a tragedy that led Piper’s three cousins (and their dog) to live with her. Now Piper wonders where her sixteen-year-old cousin, Seth, goes when he gets angry, how to handle the rapid mood swings of six-year-old Sam, and what to say to fifteen-year-old Cora when she cries. Things get even more complicated when Uncle Carlos shows up out of nowhere and needs a place to stay. Even her parents and her best friend, Lois, seemed to have changed overnight. When things seem like they can’t get more chaotic, her mother makes an announcement that surprises them all.",
