  "description": "You’ve read the Book of Mormon before, but maybe you’ve missed these oft overlooked but short, powerful verses. Explore the significance of one verse from each chapter this year with Emily Belle Freeman and David Butler, whose love for the scriptures is contagious. Along with short devotional-style lessons, their invitations will lead you to a more meaningful, personal study of the Book of Mormon and vibrant discussions with your family and friends about its teachings. You may also enjoy looking for your personal “don’t miss this” verse as you study on your own. Short enough to read quickly and share every day, you’ll easily rediscover just how completely the teachings and truths of the Book of Mormon apply to and enrich your life today.",
