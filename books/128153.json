  "description": "Ryan has decided to build his own organization in a new city, away from the shadow of his brother, Nick. With the help of Elijah, Ryan is willing and anxiously ready to take on one opponent after another to take over his new city. There isn't much most can do to stop them; that is until one comes in contact with an elusive Lord of the 3rd, Marius Cane. Marius has been playing it quiet these days, a little too quiet, but his intentions begin to become clear when he purposely goes after Ryan and not Nick as everyone expected. “Where’s the Dragon, young Jayzon? You used him to kill Savage and in doing so, he is bound to you and I want him.” Does Ryan now hold the power of the Dragon? And if he does, will he be able to hold onto it or die much like his grandfather? There is no doubt that Ryan will fight and that he won’t be fighting alone.",
