  "description": "It had been night far longer than anyone could rememberâ€¦I had never known the sun, nor had my parents or their parents before them. It had been stolen from us, blocked long ago by the spiteful fae king.There is a glimmer of hope when the Night King announces to the country that his son will take a human bride. A contest is to be held to decide the future queen, one which draws in hundreds of entrants from across the country. But only nineteen will be chosen to go to the palace and meet the prince. I am thrown into the competition against my will, the first one chosen.Unfortunately, I have no wish to marry a fae, let alone one like Prince Edwyn who by his own admission is incapable of love.But once I am there I find I cannot leave, not that easily. I am tested by the bonds of friendship and devotion to my country. I can not let the kingdom of Whynne remain shrouded in darkness, not when I alone hold the key to lifting the veil of darkness.",
