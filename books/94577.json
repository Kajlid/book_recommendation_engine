  "description": "When Brighid wakes to find a man standing over her bed, it isn't fear that races through her. It’s curiosity and desire. Her captor brings something out in her that is as foreign to Brighid as being out of control. After years of being strong she's able to admit for the first time, that dominance is just what she’s always craved. As the line between pain and pleasure blurs as Brighid learns that giving up control and trusting Ry with not only her body but also her heart is the bravest thing she’ll ever do.",
