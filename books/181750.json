  "description": "The dark and thrilling sequel to the book Kirkus called, \"Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland, and Inkheart all rolled into one\"Alice has her first adventure outside Geryon's library after he volunteers her to work with five other apprentice Readers, including Isaac, to capture a rogue apprentice who murdered his master. But none of them realize that the library of the late rival Reader is still a working deadly labyrinth, or that the vicious guardian is still protecting it. As they face the fight of their lives, Alice learns much more about Isaac, Geryon (her own master), and the fate of her father. \"Wexler is an able builder of magical worlds and creatures, with labyrinths, an enchanted library, and a feisty, swashbuckling heroine at the center. A story rich in action and allegory—fantasy fans will want to hang on for what comes next.\"—\nKirkus Reviews",
