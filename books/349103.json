  "title": "Winter in the Forest",
  "description": "Winter in the ForestÂ is the second in a series of picture books for pre-K, K and early elementary kids about the natural world, in particular the deciduous forest of the American Northeast. This book depicts the cold stillness of winter and adaptations that plants and animals make during this long dark time. The three primary themes are snow and cold, long dark nights, and dormancy.The language of our books is lyrical, the images are entrancing and sometimes humorous but always realistic - think field guides for 3 to 8 year-olds. There is a tracking activity in back for young readers.Children will learn the names and habits of forest animals and plants so that they can recognize them in natural settings. These books engage children's innate curiosity and connection to the living world so that they can learn complex principals in simple, age- appropriate language.We publish in hardcover, paperback, and audio ebook.",
