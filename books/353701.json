  "description": "The True Bloods are in disarray, their alliances crumbling and their armies humbled by the merciless forces of the Black Road. Their savage invasion is now guided by Aeglyss the na'kyrim, casting a shadow across all as he spirals deeper into madness. His long reach extends even to the court of the High Thane. There Anyara faces a bitter struggle for survival against the na'kyrim's newst puppet: the Shadowhand, Chancellor to the Thane and his most trusted spy.Far from the intrigues of an enemy court, the embittered Kanin plots a desperate rising against the mad halfbreed. As he musters his forces in the Glas Valley he struggles against the sickness spreading in the minds and hearts of men. And Orisian, Thane of a Blood that no longer even exists, is on a journey that will bring him face to face with a darkly transcendent Aeglyss, and with the cruel choices required in a world slipping towards chaos.As events mount to a climax, the world will change and no one can anticipate the twisted pattern of what lies ahead.",
