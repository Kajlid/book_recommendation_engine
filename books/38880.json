  "description": "Her spirit waited within the stone, ready to live again.   Renowned sculptor Jeremy Copper is determined that his latest work, Girl Blue, will be his masterpiece. He’s found the perfect stone for it, a rare block of blue granite from a quarry in Brazil. But this stone is special in more ways than one. The former owner of the great block was a woman named Franscesca, a witch in the 1920s who loved a talented young sculptor. He promised to carve her likeness, but when he betrayed her love she exacted a terrible vengeance and paid for it with her life.   Jeremy begins to fear for his sanity when he finds flakes of granite in his bedroom. Late at night, he hears strange noises coming from his locked studio. The sculpture continues to progress, even in his absence, a sinister form emerging beyond his control. But this frightening new version is not at all what Jeremy intended. Franscesca’s vengeful spirit lives on, and she’s more dangerous than ever.",
