  "description": "When Paranormal Investigation Bureau agent Bluebell Kildare (a.k.a. Blue) arrives at the scene of the crime it is obvious the grotesquely damaged body of the deceased teenage boy was caused by far more than a simple hit and run. Using her innate sixth sense, she locates a powerful magical artifact that acts as a key to an ancient Grimoire and is likely the motive for the crime. She soon discovers the Grimoire has a dark past as it was instrumental in the creation of the Vampire breed and still holds the power to unravel the boundaries between hell and earth.Blue and her faithful wolf Varg follow the trail starting at the Cock and Bull Tap and all through the town of Crimson Hollow, which leads to plenty of dead ends; some more dead than others. Between being sidelined by a stalker that sticks to the shadows, and chasing a perpetrator that vanishes in thin air, things are getting complicated. Dark vampire activity is at an all time high and hate group activity is increasing. However, it's her burgeoning feelings for Jack Tanner, her sexy Daylight Vampire boss, who alternates between warm affection and cool indifference that just might undo her.While Blue searches for clues to nail the perpetrator, someone seems to be conducting a search of their own and things are getting extremely messy. Who will find whom first? Danger lurks in every corner and Blue needs all her focus in this increasingly dangerous game or she risks ending up the next victim.Author Note: Rated R: A few scenes contain explicit sex and graphic violence. Recommended for 17+.",
