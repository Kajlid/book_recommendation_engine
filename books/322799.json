And as welcoming as the locals are, Kit can't shake the feeling that everyone seems to be hiding something from her.Agatha is so happy to finally meet her only granddaughter, and the town is truly charming, but Kit can't help wondering, if everything is so great in Rosemont, why did her father ever leave? And why does it seem like he never wanted her to find it?",
