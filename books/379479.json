  "description": "Across a thousand miles a dead man spoke to London and for Marcia Heath it was the beginning of terror. She was annoyed when her husband was summoned to attend a top secret, high level conference in Whitehall. Her irritation would have turned to fear if she had known the real reason for that summons. But soon they all knew. Tony Heath and Dr. Hearn and General Kirk of British Secret Intelligence - they knew what it was the nameless thing that was destroying humanity through the female of the species. But where did it come from and how long had they got to find the antidote? The answer was simple. 'As long as it takes the wind to blow from the East.'",
