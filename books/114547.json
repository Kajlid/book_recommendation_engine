You can’t get gas, groceries … Commerce has essentially come to a halt. Such is the backdrop of THE BACK DOOR MAN.Our society is computercentric. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. We’re plugged in. Managing our finances online. Downloading apps for our iPhone. Reading the WSJ on our Kindle.There are things out there on the cutting edge we don’t even know we need to fear. THE BACK DOOR MAN takes us there.We see it through the eyes of James Kolinsky, a simple family man who works in information security. His day goes from bad to worse when he discovers that his greatest fear is his fault and what’s happened to him has happened to millions of others.He’s been set up. His family—make that the world—has been taken hostage. The next twenty-four hours we find out what James Kolinsky is really made of.(THE BACK DOOR MAN is available in French as Hackeur et contre tous and in German as Der Mann an der Hintertür.)",
