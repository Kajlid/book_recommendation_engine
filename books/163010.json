  "description": "Handsome businessman Charles Sinatra and his regal African-American wife Jenay are living the good life in Jericho despite the bluebloods in town who despise their wealth and power and will stop at nothing to bring them down. Jenay continues to run Charles’s Bed and Breakfast, and Charles continues to run the rest of his empire with the same ruthlessness and uncompromising fearlessness he is known for. He also continues to be there for his grown sons, despite their many issues. Even his oldest son Brent has found somebody to keep him warm, even though that somebody is Jenay’s best friend.  But when Jenay becomes the target of somebody’s twisted revenge, Charles will stop at nothing to protect his family and to show the haters in town just how far he’s willing to go with his protection.  In the latest installment of the Sinatras of Jericho County series, the entire Sinatra clan comes together to serve, protect, and defend their family and their good name.",
