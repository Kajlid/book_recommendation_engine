  "title": "The Devastating Boys",
  "description": "Here is the collection of Elizabeth Taylor's greatest short stories. Varied in their settings and characters, they are nevertheless the quintessence of all that is most distinguished, and witty, in her art. We meet women, children and men, often ostensibly ordinary, who follow their paths of ruthlessness and ambition, each in pursuit of happiness, love, or power - each a classic creation.",
