  "description": "\"What's happening to me?\" I breathed out as I shivered in want. \n\"You're going into heat,\" Elijah whispered, his eyes shining liquid blue, his face twisting with restraint. \"The mating call is in my blood, too. My control is slipping.\" \nHis words didn't make sense, but it no longer mattered. Lust burned through me like wildfire. In its wake, nothing could survive, except my savage need for this archangel. \nI must take him raw and hard until he couldn't take it, and then I'd still have him, marking him as mine over and over. He'd beg and scream, but I still wouldn't stop... \nEscaping hell is nothing compared to the mating fever. One just feels a lot better. \nMy name is Calamity. \nMy past is dust and my future is a life to fight to the death in hell. I never expected this to change, but then three smoking-hot warriors - a primordial vampire, a fae prince, and a Sv√°va archangel - arrive in my wrecked world, claiming I'm the lost queen and their fated mate. \nThey come to return me to the great Atlantis to claim my stolen birthright, despite the fact that no one has ever escaped the Underworld. \nI don't trust anyone, but I can't deny the terrifying power awakening inside me any more than I can deny my fatal attraction to the immortal males who fight with me. \nWarning: This is a full-length reverse harem fantasy romance that features one hell of a hybrid woman warrior and her four powerful mates. It contains battles, explicit love scenes, curses, magic, dark fae, vampires, shifters, fallen angels, and a lot of demon assholes.",
