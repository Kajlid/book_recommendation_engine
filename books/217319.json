By making a success of a business so impractical, she invites the hostility of the town's less prosperous shopkeepers. By daring to enlarge her neighbors’ lives, she crosses Mrs. Gamart, the local arts doyenne. Florence’s warehouse leaks, her cellar seeps, and the shop is apparently haunted.Only too late does she begin to suspect the a town that lacks a bookshop isn’t always a town that wants one.Basis for the major motion picture starring Emily Mortimer, Bill Nighy, and Patricia Clarkson.",
