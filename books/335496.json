  "description": "For an ordinary guy like Marc Jeppson, life has suddenly become dangerously complicated. A Latter-day Saint widower and professor of Arabic, he's hired by an arms dealer to help cinch a multimillion-dollar deal with Saudi Arabia. It's an opportunity of a lifetime, but the stakes get higher as he's pulled into the tumultuous world of international politics, big business, organized crime, and fast living. Is the deal worth the risk of losing his children and fiancee, or can Marc do the nearly Survive at the top long enough to save those he loves, help convict the criminals, and close the deal all without compromising his integrity and values?",
