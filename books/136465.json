  "description": "Devi Mahatmayam, also known as Durga Saptashati, Sri Chandi or Saptashati, is from the Markandeya Mahapuran. Devi Mahatmayamm literally means 'Glory of the Goddess'. Here the seven hundred mantra story describes the victory of the Goddess over the Asuras (Madhu-Kaitabha, Mahishasura and Shambha-Nishumbha) - representing the conquest and freedom from the tamsik Mahakali (Chapter 1), rajsik Mahalakshmi (Chapters 2-4) and satvik Mahasaraswati (Chapters 5-13) forces. Her adversaries represent the all-too-human impulses arising from the pursuit of power, possessions, pleasure and from the illusions of self-importance. The Devi, personified as one supreme Goddess and many goddesses, confronts the demons within us - representing the field of human consciousness within each person.",
