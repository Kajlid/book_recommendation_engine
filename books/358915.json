  "description": "Being a schoolmarm in 1886 means looking the part. Evelyn knows that well and has never deviated from the path of the strict and somber.Until she walked into a supply closet and saw her new employer consorting with his lover. But it was hard to condemn the lovers when her heart raced and her body breathed to life like it never had before.Brenton Ashton should have left his little schoolmarm in chaste peace but the innocent curiosity of her sensuous gaze told him she didn't want that. No, burning right there was desire that the right man could unleash and he just couldn't stop thinking about being the man to set her free.All love begins as lust. When human nature is aroused, the fire never dies, it only recedes until the right tinder is applied. When Brenton takes over her \"education\", Evelyn discovers that the improper lessons are far better than any she has ever received. Behind locked doors, lust mingles with love and only pleasure matters. But more is at stake than either initially realize.Note: This tale features scenes of m√©nage a trois, shared partners, spanking, and voyeurism. Not for the faint at heart, but definitely for those who want to raise their heartrate!",
