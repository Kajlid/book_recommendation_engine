  "title": "Confidential Confessions, Volume 1",
  "description": "This is not your average Manga. The first volume of this controversial series has two short stories (one shots). The first deals with suicide, the second with prostitution. There's no glittery happy endings, but it's not all angst and sorrow either. Engaging, realistic stories with characters you'll care about.",
