Contains dark elements.Ever get that feeling you're being watched?You probably are.Her sad eyes.Her thick lips.Her long dark hair.Her quickening of breath.Her hurried footsteps.Her undiluted fear.The anxiety a woman has when she knows she's being followed does something to the sadistic animal inside me.We all have issues, mine just run a little deeper than most.My sister and I had a childhood tarnished by an abusive parent.We grew up two very different breeds of our mother's creation.Then I discover the beautiful, yet broken, Alice Young.She's seeking advice, a place to unburden her thoughts.What she gets is a dangerous, callous predator who wants to quench his thirst with her tears.My precious, Alice, feels so alone, but she's not alone.I'm watching her.I feed on the fear of others.Alice Young may prove to be too damaged, even for my appetite.",
