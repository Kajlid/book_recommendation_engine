They've joined the pirates they once hunted and are prepared to leave Wefrivain in quest for a new life. However, an unexpected cry for help brings them unwillingly back into home waters.The fauns of Maijha Minor are in trouble, and helping them seems like the right thing to do. To succeed, they must circulate Gwain's forbidden book, which tells the truth about the wyvern gods. Gwain himself has already given up the task as hopeless, but Silveo has other ideas. Together, they will get into more trouble than anyone thought possible.Out of the Ashes is the fourth illustrated book in the Guild of the Cowry Catchers series. This 64,000-word book is DRM-free and carefully formatted. It includes 11 character portraits, 19 full-page illustrations, and 2 versions of the map. Cowry Catchers looks beautiful on a black-and-white viewer, but you can also open this eBook on a color screen to view the illustrations at their best.",
