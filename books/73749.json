  "title": "Medicine Men: Extreme Appalachian Doctoring",
  "description": "\"Medicine Men\" follows \"Heart in the Right Place\". This is a collection of the most memorable moments from more than a dozen rural physicians who each practiced medicine for more than 50 years in the Southern Appalachian Mountains from 1930-2012. Hilarious, heroic, true stories of miracle cures, ghost dogs, and much madcap medical mayhem. Unimaginably funny and touching situations where men with nerves of steel and hearts of gold get stuck between a rock and a hard place in the Smoky Mountains. These men are saints who walk among us and Jourdan's father is one of them. Jourdan's work is often compared to James Herriot and Bill Bryson. This story collection is like \"All Creatures Great and Small\" but with people instead of animals or vingnettes from country doctors who took \"A Walk in the Woods\".",
