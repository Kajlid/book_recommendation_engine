  "description": "A long-lost father. A world of nightmares. And sorcery. Let’s not forget the sorcery...  Tooth & Claw, Book 4.  Randall Carter lost his father when he was ten. Not to accident or to crime, but to nothingness. Randall’s brother Kieran swears dad left mum for another woman, but the truth is he disappeared and not even the police could find him.
