  "description": "20-year-old Lilac York doesn’t like to talk. She doesn’t like to exist outside her books, and she certainly does not like to be involved with the most notorious playboy in uni. But when the gorgeous and arrogant billionaire Nick Christakos asks her to be his friend, she finds herself saying yes, no matter what “friend” could mean to a serial bed-hopper like Nick. There’s just something about him that draws her, something that makes her think he wouldn’t mind if he learned just how broken she was inside.Nick Christakos is not used to denying himself. But for the sometimes-aloof, sometimes-naïve Lilac he strives to make an exception, doing his best to keep his hands off her even though just one blink of her doll-like eyes has him on fire. With Lilac, he’s not afraid to show the ugliness in him. When she looks at him, Nick almost believes there’s still hope for him to be the man that he used to be.When another man threatens to take Lilac away, Nick is desperate and selfish enough to pretend he’s fallen in love with Lilac…even though his heart still belongs to the girl who tore him apart.",
