  "description": "The Devil's Dictionary, An Imperfect Conflagration, The Boarded Window, and Death - here are four of the best works by Ambrose Bierce, one of the most brilliant and incisive writers ever. This volume collects one example of each type of composition for which Bierce is most famed: a hilarious satire, a bone-chilling horror story, a sardonic piece of humor, and a macabre poem. Renowned artist Gahan Wilson, whose work finds the comic and the eerir in the most common of situations, brings the perfect, blackly humorous touch to Bierce's eccentrically unique visions.",
