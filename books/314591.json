  "description": "A rookie cop. A team of supernatural detectives. A power hungry witch on a killing spree.My name is Cat McKenzie, and I’m in over my damn head. I’d finally come to grips with the fact that not all Supernaturals are a**holes when the witch downstairs is murdered and I’m rescued from certain death by the fae assassin responsible for revealing the existence of Supernaturals to humans six months ago.That’s not the best bit though.Said fae wants me and my partner to look into the death of his niece, and he made us an offer we can’t refuse...just like in a bad mob movie.To top it all off, I’m on the hunt to figure out who my parents really were, because they sure as sh*t weren’t the archaeologists I was led to believe. Clandestine groups, magical artifacts and a growing headache, all I want to do is get into my fuzzy unicorn pajamas and crawl into bed. Like hell that’s going to happen anytime soon.",
