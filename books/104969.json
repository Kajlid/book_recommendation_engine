  "description": "The boy fell to his knees, silence like a shawl on his naked shoulders. He wrapped Kalo’s wound in tapa with an endearing and almost feminine gentleness. It seemed to surprise Kalo, and he burst into tears... Malani couldn't imagine what Kalo must be feeling. Malani would one day return to his village, his family, his life, after he had remembered all of Kumulipo. But Kalo would never be able to go back: the sea wouldn’t let him. Kalo was born of the ocean, so like a child, he must cry to learn to cope with the pains of living… The boy patted the man's shoulder and soothed him, all the while trying to remember what, according to the name chant, followed the darkness out of the dark.",
