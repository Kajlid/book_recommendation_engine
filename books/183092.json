But his life changed when he accidentally ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, an enchanted Devil Fruit that gave him the ability to stretch like rubber. Its only drawback? He’ll never be able to swim gain—a serious handicap for an aspiring sea dog! Years later, Luffy sets off on his quest to find the “One Piece,” said to be the greatest treasure in the world…Luffy and his Straw Hat crew duke it out with CP9, a band of dastardly world government goons headquartered on the island of Enies Lobby. CP9’s goal? Abducting Nico Robin, the Straw Hats’ newest crewmember, in order to activate an ancient weapon called Pluton. But when the enemy accidentally initiates a dreaded “Buster Call” military maneuver, the island and everyone on it is slated for complete annihilation!",
