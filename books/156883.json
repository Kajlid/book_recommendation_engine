  "description": "Lethal Creed: Genesis is an action/adventure thriller set in the present day of America leading to the future events of World War III. Jake Rooley is an interracial high school graduate from Detroit, MI blessed with the opportunity to be enlisted into a new U.S. Special Force called S.A.G.E. for his outstanding achievements in JROTC. Jake considers the life ahead of him a straightforward fulfillment and that his career as a comrade under his already captain-ranked older brother, Kevin, is the purpose he’s been waiting to grasp. The night before his graduation, however, he has a peculiar dream that he doesn’t understand. In the dream, an unknown voice apparently reminds Jake to fulfill his true purpose in life—a purpose supposedly far more extraordinary than what he had envisioned. Perplexed by the dream but intrigued by the vague mystery of its contents, Jake moves forward with his military career, contemplating on the many dramatic experiences that come his way. Unfortunate events elsewhere in the world cause the declaration of WWIII and now Jake is officially propelled into a savage journey that appears to entail the gradual revelations of his dream and the discovery of his true purpose.",
