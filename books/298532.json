  "description": "ErinDeliverance.\"The action of being rescued or set free.\"I never thought I would need to be rescued or set free from anything in my life, but that all changed when I took a taxi home after a night out with my friends.But the taxi didn't take me home. It took me to a warehouse filled with women in cages, and I found out that I was the newest captive. I was told I was lucky. I wasn't lucky. This was my karma for flirting with the bouncer at the nightclub when I had a boyfriend waiting for me at home. RicardoSavior.\"A person who saves someone or something (especially a country or cause) from danger, and who is regarded with the veneration of a religious figure.\"I was a Navy SEAL, trained to save people. After I was medically discharged, my uncle tricked me and got me involved with the wrong family in New York City when I needed a job. Right away, the king made sure I watched him kill a soldier for falling in love with one of his girls, which meant I couldnâ€™t act on my feelings when I fell in love with Erin. But I knew she sparked my interest at the club for a reason. I needed to save her. Except, year after year, we were living in a nightmare of sex, lies, and murders because the only way out was to make the king fall, and I knew I had to wait for the perfect moment in time.Or we would both be dead.",
