  "title": "Servant",
  "description": "In the aftermath of a small invasion and partial coup, rebellious whelp Kent is in an awful lot of trouble, both with the alpha he adores and the Icarian pack as a whole. Things are getting desperate as Stavros tries to keep Kent in line without sacrificing the well being of the pack he is bound to protect. But powerful beta-wolf Tennyson's rumblings of disquiet are growing by the day and when Kent is injured during one of the beta's efforts to discipline him, tensions come to a head. Enter Hans Winters, a charismatic older dominant with a sadistic streak a mile wide. He proposes a period of enforced servitude during which Kent will taught what it means to be part of a pack - and what it means to be subservient to an alpha. At the mercy of a man who will stop at nothing to ensure that he is neutralized as a threat to authority, Kent must prove that he is worthy of the Icarian pack - and the alpha's bed.",
