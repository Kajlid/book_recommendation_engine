  "description": "Readers can once again enjoy Helene Glidden's classic, \"The Light on the Island\" as this 50th Anniversary Edition retells the touching story of a young girl growing up on Patos Island in the San Juan Archipelago. Her parents raised thirteen children while her father served as the Patos Island lighthouse keeper from 1905 - 1913. Helene reminisces about the adventure and heartbreak experienced on a beautiful but remote island where smugglers, old timers, and \"God\" weave in and out of their lives. The book was originally published in 1951. This 50th Anniversary Edition has added historical photos and a postscript with biographical information about Mrs. Glidden and her family.",
