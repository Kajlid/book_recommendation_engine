  "title": "Finding My Lich",
  "description": "Long before time was recorded, most of the mythical races—lichs, gryphons, ogres, and more—were banished to Abaddon. When the powerful lich, Eric, becomes king, the Maker offers him a chance to earn his people’s return to Earth…but only if he can prove the races of Abaddon can live peacefully on Earth without harming the fragile humans. After five centuries of trying to balance between the two realms, King Eric has hit a wall. The sands of the hourglass tracking his progress—and the fate of his people—haven’t moved at all in the last sixty-five years, and his subjects are getting impatient. Then he meets Tamara, a beautiful human who inspires caring in everyone she meets, and he’s drawn to her immediately. With her help, he believes he can teach his people the lessons of Earth and earn their freedom…as long as he doesn’t get too attached. Centuries on Earth have taught him the pain of caring about a mortal. But once he gets to know Tamara, walking away is no longer an option. Meanwhile back in Abaddon, a silent usurper threatens everything Eric has worked toward. He will be put to ultimate test as he’s forced to choose between his heart and his people. Fantasy meets romance in Finding My Lich, the first book in the Abaddon series, an extraordinarily imagined tale of the fall—and rise—of the creatures of ancient myths, and the undeniable power of love.",
