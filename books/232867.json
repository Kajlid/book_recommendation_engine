  "description": "A wise old dog travels through the courts and battlefields of Europe and through the centuries in search of the master who granted him immortality Tomorrow tells the story of a 217-year-old dog and his search for his lost master. His adventures take him through the London Frost Fair, the strange court of King Charles I, the wars of the Spanish succession, Versailles, the golden age of Amsterdam and to nineteenth-century Venice. As he journeys through Europe, he befriends both animals and humans, falls in love (only once), marvels at the human ability to make music, despairs at their capacity for war and gains insight into both the strength and frailties of the human spirit.With the rich historical vision of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and the captivating canine perspective of A Dogâ€™s Purpose, Tomorrow draws us into a unique century-spanning tale of the unbreakable connection between dog and human.",
