  "title": "Stolen Spring",
  "description": "Welcome to spring on the Oregon Coast. The sky is blue, flowers are blooming, a woman has been murdered, and the first-born grandsons of Alder Bayâ€™s coffee club are disappearing one by one.Reporter Elliot Lake thought he'd dropped out of life, stepped onto the slow path, but life was just getting ready to ride his ass. And what a ride it will be. Armed with only the intuition of the mysterious violet-eyed Sky Lark and the ramblings of the local mumbling man, Elliot knows the clock is ticking for this story to have a happy ending.Introvert, part-time slob, fan of grilled salmon and the occasional beer, Elliot Lake grew up in an affluent neighborhood in Seattle with his domineering Chinese mother, passive Caucasian father, and spoiled-rotten sister Princess Maggie Morning Star. He left his position with The Seattle Times over a decade earlier and ran screaming for the Oregon Coast, where he spends his days (barely) working for the weekly paper and his nights avoiding commitments of any kind.At least that was supposed to be the plan.",
