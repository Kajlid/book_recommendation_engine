  "description": "***FBI Guys, book 1*** Pretending to be newlyweds is a dangerous game...especially when you're falling in love.FBI Special Agent in Charge Caitlin Chaney believes in doing things strictly by the book. It's the only way to prove she's earned her rank despite her father's position in the federal government. Just her luck, she's been teamed with an agent who's known for following his instincts, not the rules. To her way of thinking, Agent Jake LeFevre is a screw up and bound to trash her operation--and career.Jake is used to running undercover ops his way, and he's not too happy with his new boss--an accountant, no less, whose undercover experience is limited at best. He needs a partner who can hold her own, not a prima donna.At first the sparks that fly between them aren't the good kind. From the very beginning, their cover as madly-in-love newlyweds at a New Orleans casino is tested to the max. But as they work together to find a missing whistleblower in a money-laundering scheme, their admiration grows to respect--and something more.Then Jake discovers the casino CFO is someone he loved as a teenager. If the woman recognizes him, things could go sideways, and fast--and in a way that could leave their bodies--and hearts--in pieces.",
