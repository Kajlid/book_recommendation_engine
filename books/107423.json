  "description": "\"Take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime!\" ~ D.G. Torrens, Bestselling Author of Amelia's StoryTHE ASTONISHING, TRUE STORY of a group of thirty-two boys and leaders who accomplished an amazing feat in 1972, when they rode their bicycles from Wood Dale, Illinois to Jacksonville, Florida.The 1960's and early 70's were a simpler time--a common sense two-pedal world with realistic adventures, and everyday heroes. In the summer of 1972, an innocence was lost when twenty-six young boys in a small rural town set out to accomplish something bigger than themselves. Their journey of nearly 1,400 miles would take them through eight states, crossing over the Great Smoky Mountains. It was a tremendous achievement--one that would be hailed as the longest organized bike hike in the history of Scouting.\"I keep thinking this has got to come out as one of the greatest experiences for these boys. I would put this up with any amount of education, any amount of travel and any amount of history. I just can't say enough about an organization that puts itself through a thing like this.\" ~ Mal Bellairs, Former Radio Talk Show Host, WIVS-AM, Crystal Lake, Illinois",
