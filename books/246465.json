  "title": "Transforming Trauma: A Guide to Understanding and Treating Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse",
  "description": "Practitioners helping adult survivors of child sexual abuse need to be aware of the thought processes of offenders. The premise of Anna Salter′s major book is that those who do not recognize an internalized perpetrator when they hear one will often be frustrated by the tenacity of the survivor′s self blame. Primarily oriented towards treating adult survivors, this invaluable book will also be useful for treating sex offenders. It includes discussion of crucial issues such what clinicians who treat survivors need to know about sex offenders; the different ways sadistic and nonsadistic offenders think and the resulting different `footprints′ they leave in the heads of survivors; how trauma affects survivors′ world-views;",
