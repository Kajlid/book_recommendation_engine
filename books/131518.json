A little fun never hurt anyone.We'll go our separate ways at the end of the weekend, when his holiday is over. Wanting more, from the private man with secrets he won't share is madness. Even knowing that, I can’t stop wanting him.Will he break my heart? Probably. Will it be worth it? I wish I knew.***** “OMG!! this book was wonderful!!!
