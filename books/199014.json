Catching the blackmailer should be simple, but when William finds a beautiful, injured young man on the beach, unfamiliar desires surge.

Daniel’s question is Should he trust William? Daniel has his identity, his past, how and why he washed up on the shore… and more. With revelations of espionage, blackmail, and the arrival of William’s colleagues, the danger of exposure grows. Daniel’s instincts tell him that William is a decent man, a man of honor, but his instincts have been wrong before. As the attraction grows, so does Daniel’s desire to confess, but if he’s wrong, he risks everything—his secrets, his freedom, and his heart.",
