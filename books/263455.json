  "description": "Getting sick sucks, and magic sucks worse. So when Saul finds out that his sudden bout of sickness is actually a curse, he's understandably freaked out by being referred to a necromantic specialist. But the ordeal is made moderately better by the cute receptionist, Theo, who is exactly Saul's type—aside from the fact that he's dead.Sure, he's gray-skinned and put together from the remains of various corpses, but Theo is gentle, kind, and shares Saul's tastes in TV and video games. He knows all the right places for coffee, and enjoys long walks in the park. Maybe getting involved with the undead isn't so bad after all—and maybe you don't have to have a heartbeat to win someone's heart.",
