  "description": "When twenty-seven-year-old event planner and blogger Clare Finnegan got married, she didn't mind moving out of the city. After all, a suburban existence didn't necessarily equal domesticity, book club parties, and a subscription to Martha Stewart Living . But when, after a weekend in Vegas, Clare discovers she's pregnant, she is thrown into a world where eating lunchmeat is equivalent to smoking crack and maternity clothes appear to have been molested by a BeDazzler. In the midst of her slow transition from beer bottles to baby bottles, Clare juggles burgeoning Internet stardom, plans Chicago's biggest black-tie gala, wrangles her traditional in-laws who are scandalized by her every choice, and attempts to keep the peace between her two feuding best friends. Not only funny but smart, sassy, and witty, to boot, this is a debut novel that will have you laughing for a good nine months.",
