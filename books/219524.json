  "description": "The TSA liked having fresh agents on the job with a clear mind and steady hand. Time travel wasn’t for the faint of heart. The pay was good enough, but as Scrooby had decided long ago, that even if he didn’t get paid for it, the thrill alone was payment enough. Then again, the TSA realized they couldn’t afford to have disgruntled employees with the power of God at their fingertips, so the pay was very, very good.Things happen at a certain time in a certain way, which in a sense, is what it’s all about. If it didn’t, then things would be completely different. Johnathan Scrooby was extremely tense. His job at the Time Saving Agency was a tough one. Billions of lives depended on him not screwing up. Once, he’d screwed up in only a small way and people wore those little yellow smiley faces on t-shirts for decades afterwards. And that was just a small screw up.",
