After losing his mother and his home, he struggles to provide for himself and his brother. When homophobes attack him, he thinks his life is over, but then he’s rescued by jackaroos from a nearby sheep station.

Everything goes well until Chris realizes he’s falling for Jesse a lot harder than allowed by their deal.Jesse is a drifter who moves from station to station, never looking for anything permanent. Convinced Chris is too young and fragile for a real relationship, he sets rules to keep things casual.

He and Chris will have to decide if a try for happiness is worth the risk before the end of the season tears them apart.",
