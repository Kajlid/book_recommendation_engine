  "description": "An Angel, a Demon, a Reaper, a Ghost, the Darkness, and a broken soul travel through the seven layers of Hell... Sounds like the start to a bad joke, right?After Administer's attack and Lilith's unexpected arrival, we're left reeling. Add in the fact that my essence is trapped in a cage in Hell, and you can see that my life is in complete and utter chaos. The solution? Travel through the seven layers of Hell, each one more dangerous than the last, to free my essence from Caius's prison and save my soul.I thought that dying was the worst thing to ever happen to me, but maybe...Maybe I was wrong.Maybe there are some fates worst than death. The only thing left to do is defy destiny. Defying Destiny is the third and final book of the Afterworld Academy series by bestselling authors Katie May and Loxley Savage. This is a reverse harem romance, meaning that the main character won't have to choose between her love interests. This is medium-burn and does contain strong language and sexual themes. Oh, and death. Lots and lots of death. Reader's discretion is advised.",
