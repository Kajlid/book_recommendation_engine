  "description": "Everyone knows Megan and Cashol hit it off the moment they resonated… didn’t they? But when Josie goes into labor, an off-hand comment makes Megan point out to her friend that no, things weren’t always so smooth. Just because resonance is immediate doesn’t mean it’s immediately perfect.But also…just because it’s an instant bond doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Sometimes it’s very, very right.*CONTAINS MATURE THEMES.*RUNNING TIME => 5hrs. and 25mins.©2020 Ruby Dixon (P)2020 Tantor",
