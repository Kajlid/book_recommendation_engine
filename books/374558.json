  "description": "When sophisticated travelers get together to discuss ever more exotic destinations, the name \"Molvania\" often comes up. Not even John McPhee or Jan Morris can claim to have visited this small, remote Eastern European nation, the birthplace of the polka and whooping cough. How would they even get there? Fortunately, this definitive Jetlag Travel Guide offers everything a curious tourist will need to prepare for encounters with the Molvanians. With winning insincerity, the authors describe the fascinating complexities of the native \"Molvanian is a difficult language to speak, let alone master. There are four male, female, neutral, and the collective noun for cheeses, which occupies a nominative subsection all its very own.\"",
