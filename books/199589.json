  "description": "(Please note that this is the spicy version of \n Corva: The Perfect Bride\n)For Corva Collier, life as a mail-order bride in the quirky town of Haskell, Wyoming is her last chance for escape. She longs for a peaceful life away from the darkness of her past where she can create the paintings that are close to her heart, and where she hopes she can grow to love her husband. But how do you love a man who was persuaded to marry you against his will? Franklin Haskell never planned to marry. What woman would want a man who was crippled due to his own arrogance? But when he is offered the chance to help a woman in crisis, he agrees to wed. Corva is so much more than he expected, and when a baseball game gives her the chance to shine, he loses his heart. But how do you tell a woman you love her when she deserves so much better? The game of love has never been so hard to play...or so worth winning. PLEASE BE ADVISED: Steam Level = HOT If you would like to read this story without any \"scenes,\" check out \n Corva: The Perfect Bride\n.",
