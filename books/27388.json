  "description": "Hank and Jason have been best friends since before Hank even came out of the closet. They're both busy, but they're each other's go-to guy when they need to unwind, and relax. At least, that's what they think. When Hank finally fulfills a secret dream and rounds up the money to join the Hammer Club, the first person he meets is a sexy, slinky, bratty bottom namedâ€¦ Jason? They spend dinner together, trying to get a handle on this new view they now have of each other. Will their friendship be able to handle this sudden shift in their realities, or, even better, can these two best friends find a way to be better than friends?",
