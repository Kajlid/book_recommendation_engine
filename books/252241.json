  "description": "The stories collected in Mermaids on the Golf Course, first published in 1985, are among Highsmith's most mature, psychologically penetrating works. Published in the latter part of her career, these stories reveal Highsmith's mastery of the short story form. Moving between locales as various as France, Mexico, Zurich, and New York, Highsmith transforms the mundane features of everyday life into an eerie setting for her chilling portrayals of violence, secrecy, and madness.In \"The Stuff of Madness,\" Christopher Waggoner, increasingly dismayed by his wife's habit of preserving dead pets in their garden, enacts a devious revenge by adding a bizarre new exhibit to their collection; in the title story, an eminent economist's brush with death endows his once-familiar desires with tragic consequences; and in \"A Shot from Nowhere,\" a young painter who witnesses a gruesome death on a vacant Mexican street becomes trapped in an unimaginable nightmare. In these piercing stories, Highsmith creates a world all the more frightening because we recognize it as our own.The great revival of interest in Patricia Highsmith continues with this work that reveals the chilling reality behind the idyllic facade of American suburban life.",
