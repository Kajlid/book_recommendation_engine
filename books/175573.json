  "description": "When you lose the one you love, life is never the same. Liam O’Sullivan can’t shake the memory of his intended mate fleeing from his embrace—caught up in a nefarious plot by an earth elemental without a conscious. Rather than live a life of fear and pain, Caitlin Brannigan ends it all, throwing herself off the Cliffs of Moher and into the sea. Eleven years have passed, and Liam is making a new life in Seattle with his pack. It isn’t what he’d intended, but he’s making the best of it, though he’s vowed never to love another. Until Caitlin crashes back into his life. With no memory of who she is or why she’s drawn to the Irish beta wolf, she clings to snatches of feelings and memories. When the earth elemental who bound her realizes she’s not dead, will he resume his endless torment? Or will Liam and Caitlin’s love be strong enough to end his plans once and for all?",
