As they struggle to rescue five little girls caught in a flooding school, will these two opposites find the love missing in both their lives—or even survive?Set against the background of the magical forested mountains and unique towns and cities of the Adirondack Park, No Ordinary Day introduces both the place and the characters of the rest of the Extraordinary Days series, which is thereafter set in present day.",
