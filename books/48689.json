And some terrific friends to help her along the way. Including to remind her that she doesn't need Prince Charming to rescue her. She's more than capable of rescuing herself. All Kat needs is to get her head out of the clouds and figure out what it is she really wants. She can make her own dreams come true. And if she rescues herself, she'll have a chance at a real happy ending, with a real man, not a fairy-tale prince. But also not a frog.",
