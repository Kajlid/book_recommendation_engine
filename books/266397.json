  "description": "Beautiful. Gorgeous. Slut. Whore.   I’ve been called all of these, except my true name—a secret I’ve never learned.  I was groomed for a life of captivity; brought up as a slave for the exclusive club, Exotique. I’m desired for my body and thirsted after for my addictive blood. I’m stripped and restrained while male after male acts out his twisted desires.  I’m constantly at war with myself while my inner beasts battle for dominance. The succubus half of me craves these sessions. She longs for the toxic mix of pleasure and pain, feasting on the release of others. My phoenix half lies dormant. She's a silent presence who shudders at the crack of a whip, and shies away from the cruel hands of my handlers.  While I suffer through countless degrading sessions, somewhere far away a trio of Phoenix warriors are sanctioned by their King to find and rescue me. Will they succeed? Or will one of my handlers finally take a session too far?  Their race is dying, but so am I.  Bound for Blood is book one in the Feathers and Fire series. It is a Dark, Paranormal, Reverse Harem romance. The final book ends with an HEA. Expect dark elements and explicit scenes.. If such scenes might trigger or offend you, please do not buy this book.",
