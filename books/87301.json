  "description": "The Ancient Evil Sable Lennox wasn't passionately interested in the ancestral estate of her family tree. Her trip to Scotland to check a few dates in family history started mainly as a favor to her aunt. But she became thoroughly, intimately involved when her research began to unearth puzzles, facts that didn't seem to fit, enigmas with a vague but frighteningly sinister ring...Something was definitely wrong in Strathmuir, and Sable was on completely unfamiliar ground in trying to find the right answers. And she could confide in no one, since anyone could be an enemy. But there was romance as well as danger in the air for Sable, love as well as terror and tragedy -- and she had the strength of a truly feminine heart to carry her through to the starling climax.",
