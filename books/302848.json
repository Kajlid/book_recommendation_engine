  "description": "Not all ships reach the shore, but Caldyr Prayers, aspiring detective, is starting to feel like hers is coming in. Her apartment is just a little behind on rent, partially thanks to Reynardine Slybold, a mythical trickster and would-be father figure, hanging around and trying to sneak into her good graces. Despite his faults, and criminal past, he’s even helped Caldyr rustle up a little detective work. But when a new case floats her way, Caldyr ends up deeper than expected. A dead girl, a goddess wanting answers, and a stalker are just the start of the abysmal mystery. Can she outwit old and new shadows, catch a killer, and keep her own heartorb spinning? Or is the fairy’s detective dream life sinking fast and taking her down with it?",
