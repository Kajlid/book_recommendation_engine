  "description": "Ex-stunt woman and champion wisecracker Mary is furious to discover that her twin sister Desiree — accused of murdering her husband — has been wrangled back to an Arizona prison by a grizzled detective named Tuttle. Fueled by an unnaturally obsessive love for her twin, Mary sets off on a homicidal cross-country campaign to free Desiree from the clutches of the law, recruiting a bizarre bunch of cohorts on the way. Flanked by fast-talking lawyer Mexicali Sally, frustrated punk-rocker Revolta, and a hulking but flamboyant mass of a man known only as \"The Violator,\" Mary steals motorcycles, stages lethal stripteases, and generally wreaks havoc until arriving in Arizona, where she plots a prison break for Desiree and faces a final showdown with Detective Tuttle. Bursting with action, How to Smash Everyone to Pieces keeps the pedal to the metal from start to finish.",
