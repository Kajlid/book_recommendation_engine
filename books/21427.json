  "title": "Once Upon a Dragon: Stranger Safety for Kids",
  "description": "After a thump-bumping ride on a slide, a little girl and her dragon friend find themselves inside a fairy-tale book. The stories are familiar, and there's lots of silly fun as the dragon is transformed into fairy-tale characters. But danger lurks in the form of strangers -- including the hungry wolf from \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and Snow White's evil stepmother. And it's up to the girl to keep an eye on the dragon, who walks alone through deep dark woods and takes treats from people he doesn't know. Little by little, the girl teaches her irrepressible friend to be careful about strangers. The winning combination of fairy-tale adventure and concrete safety information -- including the Dragon's Stranger Safety Rhyme and the checklist of rules at the end of the book -- provide the perfect starting point for discussions with children about stranger safety.",
