  "description": "Millions have shared the unforgettable story of the waif Cosette, adopted daughter of Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. Now the tale of Cosette continues in this sweeping, exhilarating epic that interweaves its own galaxy of characters and narrative with real events and historical figures. From dingy artists' cafes to brilliantly gaslit Parisian boulevards, from shadowy prisons to balls at the presidential palace, author Laura Kalpakian has crafted an epic reminiscent of Hugo's original but fueled by its own creative combustion.",
