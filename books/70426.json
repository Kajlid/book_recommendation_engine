  "description": "As a designer for the wealthy, Vivian Yeats doesn't have a lot of time for a relationship. Not the kind of relationships she's had in the past, anyway. She's always settled for compatibility or common interests or misplaced enthusiasm when it comes to partners. Despite being her favorite subject in books and on screen, romance constantly eludes her.For Natalie Harper, romance has never been on her radar. She prefers working hard at her construction job and doing good work to guide her through her days. When she meets Vivian, she's knocked off that focused path. They become successful colleagues and good friends. Could romance become the thing they do best together?",
