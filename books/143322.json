  "title": "Woman Scorned",
  "description": "Book II of the \"Man Hunt\" trilogy. In the North Pacific Ocean there is an island that has been forgotten by mankind. Today, it is a place of endings, of retribution, and of pain. Abused and vengeful women live and work there for ten years in an attempt to take back their lives. Sexist and overconfident men live and scheme there knowing each day- each minute- could be their last. First the women torture and hunt the men,then the men curse and evade the women. It is a never-ending circle of abuse, yet the \"Woman Scorned\" story is not one of mere revenge, for each book in the Man Hunt series merges \"Lord of the Flies\" with hard-core feminism because it tells both sides of the story.",
