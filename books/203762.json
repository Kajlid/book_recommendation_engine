It hurts so bad, forcing myself to let go, but I've got to move on, to make something of my life. I wish there could be a \"happy ever after\" for Talon and me but life never turns out the way we plan..... Talon If I took time to take stock of my life, I would never get out of bed in the morning. I came home from the army with scars and nightmares that haunt me when I sleep, my mother said \"sayonara\" to my brothers and now it's up to me to take care of them. Then there's the club. It seems like I traded one war zone for another. The only beautiful thing I have in my life is Crystal. She's the only one I want. But the jacked up thing about that is she's also the one I need to stay the hell away from. She's gonna make something of her life. And I'll be damned if I let anything stop her from her reaching her dreams. I'll die before letting anything happen to her. But when her dad called and said someone was hunting her down, the same someone who tricked me into killing her brother, I knew things were going to get sticky. What I never could have imagined was just how sticky.",
