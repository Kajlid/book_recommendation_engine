  "description": "Book three in the USA Today bestselling Bliss series (first published as Blissful Surrender)This is a story of Sean Miller, a Dom that will have your panties diving for cover with a simple brow quirk. A man that will have even the strongest women dropping to their knees in submission with a piercing stare. Then there’s Samantha Richards, a tough female cop who’s seemingly impenetrable shell is strong enough to resist everyone except the one man it was built up to protect her against – that being Sean Miller. **Disclaimer – If you thought the first two Bliss books were hot, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Creative use of handcuffs, batons, a club scene you have to read to believe, and a tough as nails dominant blindsided when the one woman strong enough to disarm him threatens his resolve to not let his past dictate his future.**",
