  "description": "It’s what’s underneath that counts. Solo parent Detective Inspector Jake Matthews has dedicated his life to cleaning up the streets of Western Sydney. But when the beautiful blonde with sexy green eyes walks straight into his path, responsibility is the last thing on his mind. Even if it’s the one thing he can’t escape from. When Claire Thompson breaks her golden rule — never ever wear ugly underwear — a near miss with a hot cop’s SUV reveals her embarrassing secret. Lucky for Claire, the handsome inspector finds her rule-breaking captivating. The universe doesn’t. Before the all-important third date, an office drug bust puts Claire on the wrong side of a jail cell door. The evidence is damning, and Jake treads a narrow line between duty and his growing feelings as he sets about proving Claire’s innocence. But Jake and Claire will need to reveal all their secrets — along with Claire’s panties — if they’re going to have any chance of breaking their self-imposed rules and finding their happy ending. With or Without Panties, the first standalone book in the Hot Cops series, is packed with sizzling heat, misbehaving canines, and a dash of suspense. Grab your copy and start reading today!",
