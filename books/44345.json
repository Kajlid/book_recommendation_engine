  "description": "She's On Her Way to Safety. He Redefines Dangerous. It's a sign of Lady Rosalia Armstrong's desperation that she's seeking refuge in a place as rugged and challenging as the Scottish Highlands. She doesn't care about hardship and discomfort, if only she can become master of her own life. Laird Ciaran MacGregor, however, is completely beyond her control... Ciaran MacGregor knows it's perilous to get embroiled with a fiery Lowland lass, especially one as headstrong as Rosalia. Having made a rash promise to escort her all the way to Glengarry, now he's stuck with her, even though she challenges his legendary prowess at every opportunity. When temptation reaches its peak, he'll be ready to show her how he really is...on and off the battlefield. Bad Boys of the Highlands Temptation in a Kilt X Marks the Scot To Wed a Wicked Highlander \"Filled with everything I love most about Highland romance.\"â€•Melissa Mayhue, award-winning author of Warrior's Redemption",
