  "title": "The Reagan Files: Inside The National Security Council",
  "description": "President Reagan and his top foreign policy advisers held over 350 National Security Council meetings during which they fought, debated, and eventually decided the course of American foreign policy. Benefiting from significant numbers of recently declassified top-secret white house documents, this edition of the \"The Reagan Files: Inside the National Security Council\" sheds new light on the inner-workings of the Reagan administration and the foreign policy decision-making process at the highest levels of government. “The Reagan Files” is ideally suited for college courses on the end of the cold war and the cold war in the third-world, and those generally interested in government and foreign policy.",
