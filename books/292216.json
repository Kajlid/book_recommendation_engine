But as Adara delves into this further, the facts she discovers bring her into conflict with her allegiances and beliefs. Then there’s her own erotic explorations, complicated further when she hooks up with the girlfriend of her ex-boyfriend. What will happen when her benefactor reads her final report? And will she, in pursuing her carnal desires, find a way to reconcile past and present?",
