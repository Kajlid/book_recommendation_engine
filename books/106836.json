  "description": "It’s Jessie Elliot’s last summer as a child. In the fall, she’ll be going to Hochelaga High—where the cool kids smoke, have piercings, and make out in abandoned parking lots. Jessie wants to be cool, but it’s way more fun being uncool. That’s why this summer she’s going to get a high score in Tetris, draw her Super Pickle comics, read weird books at her best friend Julie’s cottage, and daydream about her crush, Ben. But when Julie is suddenly BFFs with one of the cool girls, Jessie wonders what will happen to her perfectly nerdy and fun-filled summer.",
