  "description": "In a land ruled by knights, where martial strength is tamed by a code of honour and duty, the line between protection and oppression is a subtle one. When a sickly prince leaves the succession in doubt, ambitious men gather in the shadows ready to take advantage.  Mariette believes that revenge is the only way to end the fear. She will use any weapon to protect her son's birthright.Thrust into intrigue, the politics of the court and the bedroom, Mariette chooses to play a dangerous game. Edouard is certain he understands the concept of honour and duty. As he reaches manhood, his ideals are fixed and certain. A knight's duty is to guard the weak: his code, bravery and honour proven through personal prowess, autonomy and the right of arms. The difference between right and wrong is clear, but in truth, the line is harder to perceive than he can know.Soon both are caught in a twisted world where treachery, honour and love are hopelessly blurred. With each twist of betrayal, the plot unfolds towards tragedy. Soon more than hearts and pride are at stake, lives stand at risk and trust becomes an act of bravery.",
