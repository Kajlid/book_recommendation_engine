  "description": "By the time Newsweek dubs thirty-four-year-old Ben (Superman) Willis \"The New Super-Poet of Pop,\" he has millions of adoring fans, piles of money, a beautiful family--and a secret desire to chuck it all and disappear forever. He gets his wish after a violent storm, some wicked Mexican weed, and a faulty compass cause his precious plane to crash on a remote tropical island.When he hears Marilyn Monroe's breathless voice saying he's \"kind of cute,\" Superman thinks he has woken up dead. Amelia Earhart is there too, noting the worst landing she has ever seen, while Jimmy Hoffa cooks up some fine chicken barbecue. They never died, you see. They just came here to escape their celebrity--invited guests, living out their lives in total privacy, all expenses paid, every need fulfilled. To Superman, it is heaven on earth.Until he discovers the one little catch: he can never leave. . . .",
