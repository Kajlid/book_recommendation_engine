  "description": "They say a single moment can change the course of your life.  Mine wasn't a moment, but a man.  We were wrong for each other in every way, yet it didn’t stop me from wanting him. The broody, arrogant rock star on the verge of self-destruction. His touch was electric, his wounded gaze burning me from the inside out.  He was perfectly imperfect.  Irresistibly tortured.  Utterly broken. Almost as broken as me.  Our jagged edges aligned so seamlessly even I believed we might have healed each other.  I couldn’t have been more wrong.  *This is book one in the STAND ALONE Savages in Ruin rockstar romance series",
