  "description": "Walking Paris Streets With Eug√®ne Inspired Stories About the Ragpicker, Lampshade Vendor, and Other Characters and Places of Old France is a collection of sixteen stories inspired by photographs of early twentieth-century photographer Eugene Atget, often regarded as the first \"street photographer.\" These masterfully-written stories bring the characters in Atget's photographs to life as they confront and suffer through the social and political changes that led to modern France. Some characters are endearing, some are despicable; a few characters rouse a good chuckle and others prompt feelings of grief and sadness. All of the characters and their stories are unforgettable, all securely tethered to the places, history, and mythos of Old France.",
