  "description": "Hapless Dave is at it again, promising his beloved wife Morley that he will take care of the Christmas turkey while she takes the kids to work at the food bank. Dave fails to realize quite what's involved, and the result is a Homeresque struggle to beat all the odds and somehow get an unappetizing, frozen, and slightly scarred bird home and roasted in time for Christmas dinnerâ€”before Morley cooks Dave's goose.",
