  "description": "Genesis (Reign, Book One)Reign is a dark apocalyptic trilogy, which often veers from its light fantasy and science fiction roots with strong dramatic elements of romance and genuinely funny, original humor, with provocative psychological and philosophical undertones.Mercenary and ex-marine, Owen Schaffer, fights to protect his family when a shadow government plunges the United States into indefinite martial law. The corkscrewed plot leads the man down a noxious, transformative path, which contests his usual knack for nobility, forged by his guiding light—his seraphic wife, Emily. For their decade of marriage before the civil war began, she kept Owen’s predestined identity hidden from him, eventually also fooling herself into believing that they had outrun the secret, while blended in the normalcy of Midwestern American life. But it becomes increasingly difficult to hide what they are when her husband insists on taking a proactive approach to the military sweeping from coast to coast, crushing dissent and rebellion one state at a time.This book is intended for mature audiences. Due to harsh language, graphic violence and strong sexual content, readers should be 17+.",
