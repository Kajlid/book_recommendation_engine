  "description": "ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS A HOT B*TCH AND A FAST RIDE.   I’ve had enough of this life. The blood. The mayhem. The tearful begging for mercy from those about to die.  Being a hitman isn’t for everyone. But then again, I’m not exactly your average man.  Callie knew that as soon as she saw me darken her doorstep one unfortunate Christmas Eve. Six and a half feet tall with a grizzled beard and tattooed skin, it was clear that I wasn’t there to mess around. The opposite, in fact…  I was there to kill her.  But then, at the last moment, everything went wrong. I had the weapon in my hand, the girl helpless before me… And I just couldn’t do it.  She looked too damn fragile, too innocent to meet her demise this way. Not to mention way too f**kable.  Instead, I did what I never should have done. I took her and made her mine.  In my line of work, though, failure comes with consequences. Now, there’s an assassin out for our blood and Callie’s abusive ex not far behind him. One wrong step might doom us both.  But if I’m going to die, this is how I want to do it. With a beautiful woman riding me like there’s no tomorrow.  \nIT WAS A SILENT NIGHT – UNTIL I MADE HER SCREAM.\n   CLAIMED FOR CHRISTMAS is a full-length, standalone romance novel with steamy hot sex, strong language, a happily ever after ending, and NO CLIFFHANGERS. Contains dark and disturbing themes, and over-the-top sexiness that may be uncomfortable for some readers.  Perfect for fans of Alexa Riley, Chiah Wilder, L Wilder, Sabrina Paige, Lauren Landish, Vanessa Waltz, Jordan Marie, and Nicole Snow.  Contains a free bonus novel, PURSUIT plus a sneak peek at my bestselling romance, TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL.",
