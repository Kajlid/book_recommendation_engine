  "title": "God Loves You",
  "description": "Borrowing rhythms, vocabulary, and themes from the Bible, this collection of poems is more than artful parody—it is an approach that accommodates large themes, unraveling them in new ways. The first section is a kaleidoscopic view of the sins and sinners of the modern city and opens, appropriately enough, with a vision of a flood to rival Noah’s. The poems feature domestic discord, gossip, suicide, celebrity, and anxiety about the safety and behavior of children and spouses. A skillful use of form is characteristic, along with a meticulous poise and tone that lure readers in with sympathies fully engaged. Gently satirical and with a sophisticated and quietly subversive voice, this book is an antidote to religious fanaticism.",
