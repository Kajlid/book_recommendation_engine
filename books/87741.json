Its enchantment awakens in her the spirit of an Indian Princess and pulls her back in time through her dreams into the arms of the handsome Warrior Chief, Moheeladeck.  Pam realizes the stones entwined within the dream catcher hold special powers and are also the key to a secret cave which is rumored to contain untold riches. When Pam is followed and her house is broken into she realizes she needs protection. That is, when she meets the handsome and charming dog breeder, David Conner. David gives her Half-Breed, but he is no ordinary dog. He is half wolf and mystically charmed.

With rivals in both the past and present pursuing her to control the power of the stones and the treasures in the cave, who is really behind it all? Who can she trust? With two warriors who profess their love for her, who will capture her heart?",
