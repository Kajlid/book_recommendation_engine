  "description": "In Sin City, the stakes are high. Bet big and you may win it all—but you could also lose far more than you bargained for.Indie Garrison is in over her head. Ditched by her husband in the dead of the night, she’s suddenly a broke single mom living with her sister. Sure, she and pro hockey player Pike Morgan got off on the wrong foot in a big way, and admittedly, it was entirely her fault. But Indie’s been fooled by a man for the last time, and no matter how hard Pike tries to break down her walls, she’s not falling for him. At least, that’s what she keeps telling herself.Pike Morgan is at the top of his game. Being drafted by the new Las Vegas expansion team was ideal for the bearded, blue-eyed NHL goalie who’s only serious about two things: hockey and partying. When he accepts a bet from a teammate, he finds himself wooing a spirited woman who wants nothing to do with him. Once he gets to know her and her young son, though, he regrets his wager. If Indie finds out the truth, she’s going to hate the player and the game.",
