I don’t know who he is, but when he tries to pick me up, he seems surprised when I sass him and turn him down. Truth? He’s practically irresistible, and I almost say yes.Turns out, he’s Jackson Bennett, a cocky billionaire with a playboy reputation. And he has a very interesting proposition for me.He wants to whisk me away for a week. No strings. No expectations. Just a crazy, lust-filled week of luxury with the hottest man I’ve ever met.We come from different worlds, and it isn’t supposed to mean anything. But the fire between us is scorching hot—in and out of the bedroom.Our hearts are supposed to stay out of this, but apparently mine didn’t get the memo. And when things get complicated—really complicated—it puts both of our hearts on the line.One Crazy Week was previously titled Must Be Crazy",
