  "description": "From the Author of 'Jake Masters, Bounty Hunter'The old west of the 1800's was a wild and untamed frontier, where robbery and theft was an everyday worry. Men had to be their own protectors and their own law onto themselves, particularly where civilization ended.Ty Fischer, a down-on-his-luck mountain man, is shanghai-ed by the U.S. Army into trying to recover a stolen payroll shipmentâ€”in newly minted gold coins. He is probably up to the job, but for good measure the Army also sends along a grizzled cavalry Sergeant Major to help in the hunt. The robbers are a nasty bunch of cut-throats who may end up killing anyone that gets in their way...or even each other for a bigger share of the loot. Western action abounds in this very latest release from W. R. Benton.",
