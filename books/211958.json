  "description": "As Nazis expand their domination of the European continent, nearly sixty thousand Greek Jews mistakenly believe they are safe. Anna, a young Jewess from Salonika, has gone to live in Athens. Trained as a doctor, Anna knows if the German army invades, she will no longer be allowed to practice medicine at the hospitals. With great anguish, Anna masks her faith and her vocation to live as a Christian and avoid arousing any suspicion. Anna falls in love with Alexander, an Orthodox Christian.  Documenting the terrible brutal occupation of Greece by the Nazis, Hidden in Plain Sight shines a light on the plight of Greece’s Jews and the brave attempts of the Archbishop of Athens to protect them. Carefully researched and expertly plotted, this novel’s attention to detail and compelling characters will appeal to fans of historical fiction and those of Jewish faith or Greek heritage. This book is similar to The Lost Wife by Alyson Richmond.",
