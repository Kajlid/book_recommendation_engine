  "description": "Twenty-three stories from a widely recognized master. Each will resonate, as questions of the human condition always do, in the heart of the reader.Lucia Berlin is widely recognized as a master of the short story. This collection captures distilled moments of crisis or epiphany, placing the protagonists in moments of stress or personal strain, and all told in an almost offhand, matter-of-fact voice.The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, “Most of the stories in this collection are very short and very simple. They are set in the places Berlin knows Chile, Mexico, the Desert Southwest, and California, and they have the casual, straightforward, immediate, and intimate style that distinguishes her work. They are told in a conversational voice and they move with a swift and often lyrical economy. They capture and communicate moments of grace and cast a lovely, lazy light that lasts. Berlin is one of our finest writers and here she is at the height of her powers.”This is a collection for anyone who loves short stories or great writing of any kind.",
