  "description": "In this thriller featuring the colorful Santa Fe trial lawyer Ed Eagle, we find the tables turned on Eagle when he testifies as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of his ex-wife, Barbara Eagle. She has been a very, very bad girl.The trial ends in a way Ed had not anticipated, and Barbara is still in a position to make his life and that of others, a living hell.With private detectives, hit men, double crosses and billion-dollar-bank accounts involved, Ed calls in every favor and follows every lead, no matter where they take him. From posh resorts in the desert of California and the lush wine country of Napa, to the New Mexico high country and the seedy hotels of Tijuana, Ed Eagle won’t rest until he discovers the truth about what Barbara is up to – and settles the score.Librarian's note: the Ed Eagle series has 4 volumes: #1, Santa Fe Rules (1992); #2, Short Straw (2006); #3, Santa Fe Dead (2008); and #4, Santa Fe Edge (2010).",
