  "description": "It's Lucy's first day at her new school, and she's just trying to get her footing- literally. As a brand-new ghost, she's mostly see-through, not able to stand or sit normally, and stuck in the ballet clothes she was wearing before she crossed over.But when the cutest (ghost) boy she's ever seen turns out to be Lucy's very own school guide, things start looking a little brighter. Maybe she's not quite solid yet...but Lucy is definitely going to make this the best Afterlife ever.",
