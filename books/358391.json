  "description": "* Case studies from Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan tackle human rights laws and gender-based violence\"War's Offensive on Women\" contends that humanitarian groups attempts to provide assistance and protection for women will fall short unless they make women major actors in such efforts. Mertus shows how human rights laws are beginning to address gender-based violence, and how agencies can respond to women 's needs in conflict and post-conflict settings. The book is of wide interest to humanitarian and human rights practitioners, policymakers, and students alike.",
