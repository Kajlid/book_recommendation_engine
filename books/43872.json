  "description": "Noah McCoy loves his family more than anything, but he has always had trouble seeing anything from anyone else’s point of view. Some might say that Noah is narrow-minded or judgmental, some might call Noah a pain in the......ha! The truth is - Noah only sees black and white, he can’t see shades of grey until Skye makes a home for herself in his heart. Skye Blue colors Noah’s world with a rainbow of love, laughter and a sensuality which takes his breath away. Noah wants Skye in his life and his arms. But Skye has a secret. She doesn’t think Noah will ever understand the decisions she’d been forced to make. But no one should ever underestimate a McCoy. When they fall in love, they fall in love forever.",
