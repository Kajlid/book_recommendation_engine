  "description": "Three omegas are home for the holidays with the Niemi pack, and every old tradition is new again with these omegas in the mix! Ethan is getting his first taste of living with an outsider werewolf pack and celebrating the Winter Solstice. He's still finding his place among them--and with himself--and that would be challenge enough, but another surprise is waiting for him at the party... Casey is introducing his brand new mate (and soon-to-be co-parent!) to the Christmas traditions of the Niemi pack. It's a time for family, but Casey and Adam are still figuring out just what family means when it comes to the two of them... Rory is looking forward to the first full moon of Winter because it's a night he'll definitely get to spend with his mate, Beau. But this full moon in particular is bringing something they've both been waiting Rory's finally going into heat for the first time since they met, and he's going to have a very long winter's night to spend with his mate... Omega Wintertide is a collection of three connected holiday stories, meant to be read after Omega Required and Omega Defiant!",
