  "title": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall",
  "description": "This was originally published in 1848. Anne Bronte's forthright treatment of a failed marriage, her explicit description of Arthur Huntingdon's descent into profligacy, and especially her plea for a married woman's right to leave her husband was in opposition to the conventions of Victorian society, and was considered scandalous at the time. But it is the deeply felt portrayal of the courageous Helen Huntingdon that provides the heart to this critique of nineteenth century mores.",
