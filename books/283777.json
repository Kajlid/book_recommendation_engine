If none of that was real, I'll have to figure out who I am and what I want all over again. Thank goodness I have my friends by my side. Matt Greenstone was always one of them, a buddy who could make me smile when I frowned. But out of nowhere, there's a new feeling growing with him. A feeling that's thrilling and terrifying all at once. Something unmistakable is happening between us, and my freshly wounded heart can’t help but worry about the fall. I’ve been down this road before, but Matt just might be different.He makes me laugh.He makes me smile.He makes my heart beat faster every time I see him.He could be my new beginning... If I can remember to just breathe.",
