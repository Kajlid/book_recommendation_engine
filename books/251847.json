  "description": "It's almost Christmas and Scalawag the cat decides to write Santa a series of letters to clear up any misunderstandings about unfortunate incidents that occurred over the past year -- and of course, to express his Christmas gift a Catman and Robin video game! But when the Christmas tree catches fire, and Miss Violet (Scalawag's ever-loving caretaker) ends up in the emergency room, Scalawag gets a new perspective on things. He writes to Santa asking him to forget about the video game, and instead asks him to bring a different gift . . . one that expresses the true warmth and spirit of Christmas.",
