  "description": "Sage Cynwrig has finally accepted her destiny and joined ASSET. With the sharp-tongued, machete wielding Grey Maddox as her partner, she’s ready to put her magical immunity to the test. As the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.  Just when Sage thinks she’s getting the hang of this whole agent thing, smooth-talking Djinn named Luke moves in, right next door to her apartment. As if she needed anymore magical men making her life a living hell. His arrival coincides with a number of strange disappearances in the supernatural community.  It’s all hands on deck at ASSET as rumors from the underground suggest that the missing creatures are part of a magical recipe. Someone’s attempting to recreate the lost Amulet of Emmuri: an artifact of legend capable of bestowing the power of the gods on whomever wears it.  With a little help from her street-wise vampire informant, Zack, Sage is able to pinpoint the malevolent force orchestrating this devious scheme. But just as she closes in, her human roommate Matt is pulled into the fray, and everything gets personal.  Stop the Amulet from being completed, or save her best friend? With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, either choice will force Sage to break the very magical laws she's supposed to uphold.",
