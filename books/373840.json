  "title": "Operation Seabird",
  "description": "Monica Edwards' new novel is set, as are so many of her justly famous stories, on the Romney Marshes. Tamzin and Rissa discover to their horror that many seabirds in the district are dying because their wings become clogged with oil which floats on the sea. What are they to do? They form the Seabirds Rescue League and try to start a clinic to de-oil the birds. They range farther afield, and the adventures they encounter in their efforts to contact the experts almost distract them from the object of their quest. On one terrifying occasion, Meryon becomes, unwittingly, an engine driver. Operation Seabird, as Monica Edwards' many admirers will expect and new readers will warmly approve, is an exciting story, packed with action, yet it is based securely on real people coping with real problems.",
