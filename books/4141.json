  "title": "Seeds of Consciousness: The Wisdom of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj",
  "description": "Seeds of Consciousness is the first of three books edited by Jean Dunn, which are wholly taken from daily Talks given by Nisargadatta Maharaj at his Bombay apartment during 1979 and 1980. Books of this type have been prepared by other editors, all of whom used the same group of English translators, but Dunn (a disciple for many years) has selected the clearest talks, least burdened with technical Hindu pointers.",
