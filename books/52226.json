  "title": "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine",
  "description": "The 1948 Israeli War of Independence involved one of the largest forced migrations in modern history. Around a million people were expelled from their homes at gunpoint, civilians were massacred, and hundreds of Palestinian villages destroyed. Denied for almost six decades, had it happened today it could only have been called \"ethnic cleansing\".In this groundbreaking book, renowned Israeli historian Ilan Pappe offers impressive archival evidence to demonstrate that, from its very inception, a central plank in Israel's founding ideology was the forcible removal of the indigenous population, a strategy that continues to the present day. Dr. Pappe's vivid and timely account sheds new light on the origins and development of the Palestine-Israel conflict, and is indispensable for anyone interested in the Middle East.",
