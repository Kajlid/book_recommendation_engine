  "description": "Have yourself a very Merry Witchmas in Holiday Haven, where the magic and mystery of Christmas is snow joke! Lumi Northrop is a powerful guardian of the north--the North Star Reindeer Sanctuary, that is. When Rudolph vanishes the week before Christmas, Lumi is thrust from the peace and quiet of her family's farm, into the magical town of Holiday Haven to help find him. Lumi quickly discovers that Rudolph isn't the only local celebrity who's gone missing. Jack Frost is also MIA, just days before his coronation as the next Frost King. Teaming up with Corbin Frost, Jack's reclusive brother, Lumi finds more questions than answers. What she thinks is an odd coincidence quickly turns into something more sinister. With time running out for Rudolph and Jack, can Lumi use her powers to save the North Pole?",
