  "title": "Icelandic Trolls",
  "description": "For centuries, the mountain trolls used to inspire terror in the hearts of the Icelandic people. Nowadays, however, little is herad from these beings, and the old terror seems to have changed to puzzled curiosity. It has been argued that many of the old trolls have turned to stone, the usual evidence for this being the huge, moss-covered, troll-like basalt rock columns that can be found all around the countryside, standing out against the skyline. In this richly illustrated book, Brian Pilkington brings the amazing world of the trolls to life in an amusing and original fashion. The Icelandic folk legends have been used as a background, but a great deal of new and surprising information has been added concerning the living conditions, traditions and customs of these ancient creatures. The wide range of illustrations in the book all testify to this popular artistâ€™s incomparable breadth of imagination.",
