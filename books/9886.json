  "title": "An Englishwoman In India: The Memoirs Of Harriet Tytler 1828 1858",
  "description": "This book includes an eye-witness account of the siege of Delhi, in 1857, a most crucial encounter of the Indian Mutiny, where the author was \"the only lady\" present and during which she gave birth to a son. Her memoirs, which are accompanied by some of the photographs of India taken by the Tytlers in 1858, were never published in full during her life. The author was born into an army family in India. She traces her development from childhood to marriage in India and England, recounting the experiences which helped mould her personality. This is a personal story of one woman's life as well as illustrating the attitudes and assumptions of the British in India during the 19th century.",
