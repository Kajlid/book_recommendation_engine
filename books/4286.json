  "description": "The most electrifying espionage thriller debut in years--and one of the first in modern memory to be written by a former agent under his own name . . .Matthew Dunn spent years as an MI6 field operative working on some of the West's most clandestine missions. He recruited and ran agents, planned and participated in special operations, and operated deep undercover throughout the world. In Spycatcher he draws on this fascinating experience to breathe urgent, dynamic new life into the contemporary spy novel.Featuring deft and daring super spy Will Cochrane, Dunn paints a nerve-jangling, bracingly authentic picture of today's secret world. It is a place where trust is precious and betrayal is cheap--and where violent death is the reward for being outplayed by your enemy.Will Cochrane, the CIA's and MI6's most prized asset and deadliest weapon, has known little outside this world since childhood. And he's never been outplayed. So far . . .Will's controllers task him with finding and neutralizing one of today's most wanted terrorist masterminds, a man believed to be an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. Intending to use someone from the man's past to flush him out of the shadows, Will believes he has the perfect plan, but he soon discovers, in a frantic chase from the capitals of Europe to New York City, that his adversary has more surprises in store and is much more treacherous than anyone he has ever faced--and survived--up to now.",
