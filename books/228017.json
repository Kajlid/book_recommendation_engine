  "description": "Jocelyn Barrett had never gone out of her comfort zone, but now she’s crossing some lines…    A STEAMY ROMANCE COLLECTION IS INCLUDED INSIDE FOR A LIMITED TIME!   She sees her big brother David doing these extracurricular activities and she’s jealous that she hasn’t found anything that she’s passionate about. Not having any interest in sports, she finds herself being dragged to one of David’s hockey practices. She meets up with Owen, but he’s not exactly the little kid that she remembers. She begins to get into the thrill of competition, screaming at the top of her lungs. She knows that her big brother David would never condone anything happening between her and one of his teammates. It’s that feeling of doing something wrong that pushes her to take things to the next level. Is this her way of sewing her wild oats, or can there be something more between them?    WARNING: This ebook contains mature language and content. It is intended for 18+ readers only!",
