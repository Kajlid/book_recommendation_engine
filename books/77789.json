  "title": "The Orchard Book Of Stories From The Ballet",
  "description": "A beautiful new edition of a classic ballet story collection. Travel to the magical Land of Sweets across the Lemonade Ocean in The Nutcracker; be dazzled by the magical Firebird with her flame-bright feathers; and dance until the clock chimes midnight with Cinderella and her handsome prince. Master storyteller Geraldine McCaughrean retells these classic tales with poetry and magic, while renowned artist Angela Barrett's exquisite illustrations dance off the page. I love all the ballets, they are magical! I also love Angela Barrett's gorgeous illustrations. She is a wonderful illustrator! This book is lovely! :) xx",
