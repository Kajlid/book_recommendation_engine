  "description": "It was only a high school reunion. What was the worst that could happen? Corinne Fuller has regrets. Facing a stagnant marriage and an impending empty nest, she spends her days living halfway between fantasy and reality, imagining herself as the heroine in a true-love-lost fairytale. When she reluctantly agrees to accompany her best friend on a trip to their hometown, an unexpected encounter with ex-boyfriend Nick offers a tempting glimpse of what might have been (and, as Nick makes clear, what could possibly still be).Back home, Corinne’s world is in tumult. Are the problems she’s having with her husband signs she made the wrong choice? Meanwhile, her daughter begins a serious relationship with the (literal) boy next door, and Corinne can’t help being nostalgic for the excitement and romance of first love.Corinne must choose between pursuing “what if?” or embracing “what is” in this coming-of-(middle)-age tale of love, family, and the dangers of attending your high school reunion.",
