  "description": "I can't repeat old mistakes in the New Year. And Dax was the biggest one of them all. And now he's back. Dropped into my life like the Times Square Ball. There's no way we can get back together. Even if he's hotter today than ever before. That big bank account and his perfect suit has women falling all over him. I've seen him without clothes. I've felt his hard abs over my skin. There's no denying that I miss him. But I can't get past the secrets that tore us apart. And I have one secret left to tell... I'm pregnant. Will he abandon me again when he finds out?",
