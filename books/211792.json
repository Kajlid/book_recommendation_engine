  "description": "All Deena Sharpe wants to do is learn how to write a good mystery. Instead, she finds herself embroiled in one. Max Dekker is a well-known author who has agreed to teach a writing class in the small Texas town of Maycroft. But when his wife is killed in a car crash, the police suspect foul play. Is it some kind of hoax to teach his students about plotting a murder? Not likely. Soon the list of suspects piles higher than Big Tex at the State Fair. Deena is once again sucked into the investigation when her brother’s friend is accused of the crime. With Russell by her side, she must clear their friend’s name and stay out of trouble with Maycroft’s newest police detective. Not only that, but it’s Gary’s sixtieth birthday, and her mother-in-law is coming to town. What’s a Southern gal to do?",
