  "description": "Set amidst South Australia's beautiful but isolated mid-north, The Railway Dog tells the true story of Bob, a scruffy brown stray, bought on impulse by a local railway man as a gift for his wife -- and setting in motion the beginnings of a legend... Recognized near and far for his cheery bark, waving tail, and devotion to train travel -- Bob quickly became a beloved member of the tight knit railway community. Charming, humorous, and at times intensely moving, the adventures of Bob the Railway Dog, entwined with the lives of the fascinating people he meets on his journeys -- make for an inspiring and touching Australian story.",
