  "description": "Beaches, Bones, and Petoskey Stones. Who Knows What Dinosaurs Are Made Of? Traverse City, Michigan is home to three extraordinary heroes. Meet Abigail, the oldest. When it comes to sports, she can't be beat. Andrew is her twin. If it has wheels, he can ride it. Baby Zoe is the youngest but also the strongest. Don't let the diaper fool you! In this adventure, a trip to the lake turns into anything but a day at the beach. Digging is usually for making sand castles, but our heroes have other plans. They dig so deep that they discover something terrifying and better off buried. Worse, it's got a bone to pick with them-several hundred, actually.",
