  "description": "When he looks into their eyes, none of their thoughts are safe.Jonathan knew that his working life as a Hollywood special effects expert was over after a devastating car crash but he was still searching for something to challenge his mind. That challenge came from an entirely unexpected direction.Following a chance meeting on a train journey, he finds himself being drawn into the shadowy world of “Operation Checkmate”, an organization dedicated to exposing corruption and deceit in the British government. Jonathan did not realize just how useful his strange mental powers could be, but Operation Checkmate does and they will make good use of the powers that he acquired as a result of the car crash and the brain changes it caused.Jonathan meets Sir Fergus “Mac” McKinnon, a retired MI5 officer who runs Operation Checkmate from his castle in Scotland. Soon, Jonathan is thrust into his first front line operation. Using his ability to see into the thoughts of people and induce hallucinations into their minds, he uncovers a British government conspiracy to bring terror to Britain’s railways and blame it on al-Qaeda.He puts himself at deadly risk by surreptitiously delving in to the mind of the government minister in charge of the conspiracy and he and Mac track down the former IRA bomber Sean Donnelly, who MI5 Black Ops have selected to carry out the dirty work. But their pursuit of the bomber takes an unexpected and dangerous turn when they discover that they are not the only ones who have an interest in catching him and it soon becomes a question of just who is chasing whom. And why?",
