  "description": "Morgan Palatine wants to wrap Honey in his embrace and keep her from harm. But it’s too soon. He can’t just sweep in and claim her. As a foundations specialist, he knows the importance of establishing trust before the rest of the relationship can be built.  Honey knows the dangers of judging a book by its cover. Her abusive ex is a shining example that looks are deceiving. She’s trying to get past the superficial barriers of Morgan’s job and his proclivity for wearing plaid shirts, now if he would just kiss her already.  Morgan will do whatever it takes to support Honey but when he unexpectedly leaves, she’s left on her own to deal with her own personal demons and inadequacies.  A recent truce between the long-time family rivals the Palatines and the Aventines, is well timed as the new allies share information that presents the science behind their mythology.  However, an attempt on Morgan’s life alludes to impending danger on a grander scale.  Is there a connection between the attempt on Morgan’s life and the scientific discovery? Are the Aventines really playing nice and new allies? Morgan needs to find out who is on his side all while he gets his head on straight so he doesn’t blow his chances with Honey.",
