  "title": "All for Jesus: The Easy Ways of Divine Love",
  "description": "One of Fr. Faber's greatest books; and definitely his most encouraging; for it was written precisely to help us save our souls by \"serving Jesus out of love;\" for \"everything comes easy to love.\" Gives us powerful motives for loving God. Says if we did; it would be with us as it was with Jacob working to earn the hand of Rachel: \"Years would seem but days; for the greatness of our love.\" Makes a person feel rich to be a Catholic. This is Fr. Faber at his best!",
