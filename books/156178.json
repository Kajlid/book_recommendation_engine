  "description": "Trav Ford doesn't like strings and he doesn't like messes. Coming off a messy breakup, Trav is grimly determined to keep his life absolutely pristine. When Trav is asked to take over the management of Outbreak Monkey, his first order of business is to clean up their act—and that includes shipping the youngest, most troubled member off to detox and rehab before Mackey Sanders's life choices kill him.But Mackey didn't become an addict overnight, and it's going to take more than one trip to rehab to fix him up. When an act of violence destroys Mackey's struggling equilibrium, Trav is going to find that messy isn't so hard to escape—not when it's wrapping its mess around Trav's heart.",
