  "description": "With intelligence and humor, Susan Brownmiller explores the history and unspoken rules of the burden of \"feminine perfection\"What is femininity? How is it measured? What are its demands? How are women meant to dress, look, think, act, feel, and be, according to the mores of society?Susan Brownmiller offers a witty and often pointed critique of the concept of femininity in contemporary culture and throughout history. She explores the demands placed upon women to fit an established mold, examines female stereotypes, and celebrates the hard-won advances in women's lifestyle and attire. At once profound, revolutionary, empowering, and entertaining, \"Femininity \"challenges the accepted female norm while appreciating the women throughout history who have courageously broken free of its constraints",
