  "description": "The chairs have come inand the crisp yellow thwockof the ball being hitsays somehow, now that it's fall,I'm a memory of myself.My whole old life--I mourn you sometimesin places you would have been .-- OctoberThe poems in this fierce debut are an attempt to record what matters. As a reporter's dispatches, they concern themselves with different forms of what it means to feel at home in wrecked places and then to experience loneliness and dislocation in the familiar. The collection arcs between internal and external worlds--the disappointment of returning, the guilt and thrill of departure, unexpected encounters in blighted places-- and, with ruthless observations etched in the sparest lines, the poems in Wideawake Field sharply and movingly navigate the poles of home and away.",
