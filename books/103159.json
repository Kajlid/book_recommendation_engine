  "description": "Beck Evans keeps the Triple M Motorcycle Club running. He's a badass Southern biker boy with a mean right hook and a crooked smile. As an ex-military man with a checkered past, Beck's seen it all. The only thing in his opinion that's worth living for is the club, even if they're on hard times. Beck would give his life to see his brothers live happily ever fucking after. But as far as his life goes, a new lady every night and a bike that runs are all Beck needs. And then there's Emilie Hathorne, a girl known simply as 'Tease' in her MC, Seventy-seven Brothers. Raised by her brother, the current president of the MC, Tease knows she's nothing more than an old lady running on borrowed time. Tease hasn't ever really had a life of her own, and she's okay with that. Or so she thinks. Sometimes though, we don't really know what we need until we come face to face with it. Biker girl meets biker boy. Love. Trouble. Blood. The best things always come in threes. But there's a price, always a price. Beck and Tease just have to decide if they're willing to pay it.",
