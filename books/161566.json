  "description": "Tired of life as a lone wolf, shifter Gabriel has joined his brother’s pack. The last person he expected to see was the sexy woman who ran out on him in the middle of the most incredible night of his life. The Leigha he meets now is nothing like the wild, sensual woman he let his guard down with, but he likes both sides of the complicated female. But now somebody—or something—sinister is targeting Leigha, and Gabriel moves quickly to get her under his protection.  Keeping the sexy female safe and proving they belong together are two missions he doesn’t plan to fail. Because this time, he’s playing for keeps.
