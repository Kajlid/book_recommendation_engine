  "description": "The Complete Ripley Novels - a first-time, boxed collection of the entire Ripley series - is a cause for critical and popular celebration. Its publication reflects the fact that Patricia Highsmith, \"no more a practitioner of the murder mystery genre... than are Dostoevsky, Faulkner and Camus\" (Joan Smith, Los Angeles Times), has finally entered the American literary canon. Marginalized throughout her career as a mere thriller writer, Highsmith has experienced a remarkable renaissance since her death in 1995. Now Highsmith fans and new readers alike can find these five novels - The Talented Mr. Ripley, Ripley Under Ground, Ripley's Game, The Boy Who Followed Ripley, and Ripley Under Water - all housed under one roof in this brilliantly designed, highly collectible edition.",
