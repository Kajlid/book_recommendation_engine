  "description": "Vodou Saints is an account of Dr. Arthur Fournier's travels through the earthquake-ravaged nation of Haiti. He shares lessons of life and death, courage and resilience as he joins with Haitians dealing with the aftermath of the world’s largest natural disaster. The author recounts stories of the special care needed for patients with AIDs, and reveals a personal family tragedy that brings the story full circle. The work is arguably the most compelling series of insights on the human condition since Albert Camus’ The Plague.All proceeds from the sale of this book will go to Project Medishare for Haiti, a nonprofit organization dedicated to sharing its human and technical resources with its Haitian partners in the quest to achieve quality healthcare and development services for all.",
