  "description": "The end has come and Team DEVIL face their biggest challenge. The Devil has opened the Seven Seals of the Apocalypse, and if Hell and Up There don’t find a way to come together, then the souls of the Afterlife will be lost forever. Elinor Powell, the oldest and gentlest of the four teen friends known as Team DEVIL, has seen horrors in life and death that no soul should witness. Unwittingly made a Banshee and The Devil’s Dreamcatcher by the despotic former ruler of Hell, Elinor now has more power than all of the souls in Hell combined. But Elinor also understands that the ultimate power is love, and as Team DEVIL face down the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in this final battle of the dead, she will face a choice that will see her put the love of her friends before her own soul.  THE DEVIL’S HORSEMEN is the fourth and final book in Donna Hosie’s critically-acclaimed, award-winning DEVIL’S series.",
