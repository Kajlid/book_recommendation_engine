  "description": "Kate is twelve years old, and chats to God about everything - her parents and their new baby, her friends, getting used to her new glasses, even about the ants who drown in the puddles in her driveway. If God exists, why doesn't he teach ants to swim?Kate also talks to God about Stephanie, the new girl in her class. Stephanie isn't the sort of girl Kate is usually friends with; she's too 'nerdy' for a start. And she looks weird, too. But getting to know Steph proves to be unexpectedly interesting for Kate, making her look at friendship in a new way.Things get serious when Steph becomes ill. Steph's a good person, so why isn't she getting better? But just when Kate's ready to give up on God, she finds the answers to her questions in an unexpected place.",
