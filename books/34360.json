  "description": "Whether you consider yourself a real cowpoke or a western romantic, you are going to enjoy this batch of new cowboy poems. Reading them aloud, it's easy to get caught up in the spirit of the West. You can almost hear the creak of saddle leather, smell the aroma of chuck wagon coffee, and feel the glow of a mellow campfire beneath a starry desert sky.Here is a first-rate sampling of the best cowboy poetry being written today. The poets in this collection hail from all over the West--California, Montana, Texas and everywhere in between. Some of them have been seen on the \"Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson, and all have recited their works at the granddaddy of the gatherings, the annual Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada.",
