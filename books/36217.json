  "description": "Karl Taro Greenfeld, author of the acclaimed memoir Boy Alone, delivers a stylish first novel about a group of families in a fashionable Manhattan neighborhood wrestling with the dark realities of their lives.A book reminiscent of Tom Rachman's The Imperfectionists and Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad, Greenfeld's Triburbia is a bold literary tour de force in which the author renders New York City's vibrant and affluent Tribeca neighborhood as a living breathing, character, much like Armistead Maupin did with San Francisco in his acclaimed Tales of the City. Winner of the PEN/O. Henry Prize, Greenfeld dazzles as a debut novelist, marking the beginning of a brilliant career in long-form literary fiction.",
