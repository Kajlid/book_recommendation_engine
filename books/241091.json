  "description": "Life for twenty-seven-year-old Hershel Lawson has been relatively uneventful and thatâ€™s the way he likes it. When his grandmother passes away, leaving him her car and a last wish of him taking her ashes to L.A., his life takes a turn and it will never be the same again.With his new task and grandmother's ashes, Hershel sets out from St. Louis Missouri in the spring of 1962. He travels unimpeded along scenic Route 66 for two days, but is suddenly and unexpectedly relieved of two important things, his car and wallet.Sally is a sassy and street smart young woman on her way to Hollywood. She's determined to prove everyone wrong in the \"one horse town\" she left and make it as an actress in California. Through mishaps of her own, Sally comes across Hershel. Though neither one realizes it, the real journey is about to begin.Take a seat and journey with Hershel and Sally along historic Route 66 during its heyday. Laugh and maybe shed a tear or two as they struggle against the odds, and often each other, to make it a few more miles down the highway.",
