  "description": "They were known by the tales, the people of the Lodge weaved around them. Extremely skilled Assassins, with no moral codes, no emotions, barely human. Some of them had risen to a legendary status, surrounded by myths about unbelievable deeds and incredible cruelty. Some of these stories were false, others were just innocent exaggerations of a younger generation. Like the massacre in the village of Verita or the Cairo events four years earlier. They all had their own version of what happened which they passionately defended. They were all wrong. This is the omnibus edition of the Dark Hunters series. It contains all previous three volumes, The Ghost of the Cazador, the Shadow & the Blood Assassin and the Legends, with a completely new prologue from the writer.",
