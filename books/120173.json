  "description": "Gail Giles (Shattering Glass, What Happened to Cass McBride, Girls Like Us) returns with another winner to entrance readers young and old, an adventure that pits a boy band against the devil. Pod does card tricks to prove he’s in control. Flaco is rich and loyal beyond words to his abuelo. Manny is desperate to get out of his Bar Mitzvah. Together, what these misfits want most is for their fledgling band to get noticed. When their made-up song conjures a strange man in Pod’s ancient barn, fame follows so fast it’s scary. How much is talent and how much is from something they don’t understand? They want to think Fred is anything but a demon, but as strange things pour from the sound hole of Pod’s guitar, they have to face the fact that they may have accidently inked a deal with the devil. Success, family, friends—even their very souls are at risk unless they can find a way out. “The first movement in an ambitious song cycle of a tale” Kirkus Reviews",
