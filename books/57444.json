  "description": "Praise for Wilde's \"The action starts right at the beginning and never seems to cease!  While there are some beautiful, romantic, electric moments that will leave you breathless, there is also plenty of doubt, fear, lying, pretending, and running from daemons to keep you reading straight through to the end! 5/5\" ~ Jackie Mcpherson @ Sated Faery\"Absolutely brilliant! Everything I hoped it would be and more! Thrills, romance, surprises...what more could you ask for? 5/5\" ~ Farrah @ The Golde Rule of 666About Wilde's \"Hello, Katriona.\"Those two words spark fear in Katriona Wilde and give way to an unlikely partnership with Perth, the man she's been traded to marry for a favor. Saving her true love and protector Arland, her family, and their soldiers keeps her motivated, but the at-odds duo soon realizes trust is something that comes and goes with each breath of Encardia's rotting, stagnant air.The moment when concern for her missing sister spirals out of control, all thoughts of trust are pushed aside and she finds herself trapped by the daemon tricks Perth warned her of. When so many she's grown fond of die along the journey, will she still be Katriona Wilde, the girl with fire?Wilde's Army is the second installment of young adult author Krystal Wade's Darkness Falls trilogy, continuing the epic story of Katriona Wilde, a new adult experiencing love, romance, death, and demons in a strange world.More Praise for Wilde's \"This book is full of magic.  If you liked the first book even half as much as I did then you will love this book. 5/5\"  ~ Eve Langell @ Functioning Insanity More by this",
