  "description": "In the aftermath of the devastating barbarian invasions which came to be known as the Barbarica Conspiratio there • A soldier searching for a fortune in looted gold which a dying man told him lies hidden beneath the waters of a lake on the far side of the Great Marshes, many miles to the south of the Cotswold Hills where the story begins. • A young priestess searching for a man who mysteriously disappeared a year before, hoping that by finding him she will restore her faith in the goddess she thought was protecting him. • A small brass figurine of the sinister underworld goddess Hecate. And linking all three is a story said to have begun with a girl picking flowers in a meadow in Sicily on a summer's day long, long ago when the Ancient World was young. The Sower of the Seeds of Dreams is set in those parts of the Roman province of Britannia Prima which were later to become Gloucestershire and Somerset. It is a stand-alone sequel to The Moon on the Hills (Matador 2009).",
