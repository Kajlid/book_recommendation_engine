  "description": "Meet Walter, the ghoul next door. He could be the most boring man alive…except for one small detail: Walter isn't human. Though he was raised by humans, Walter is, in fact, a ghoul, a mystical flesh-eating monster of myth. And now, for some reason, some one – or some thing is trying to kill him. Suddenly the monster who wanted to be human finds himself pursued by murderous hunters, hounded by werewolves, and embroiled in the absurdly complicated world of vampire politics.",
