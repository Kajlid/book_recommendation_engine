  "description": "Kitty Haskell has everything – a perfect house in a perfect neighborhood, a handsome husband, charming children, and a nasty case of gonorrhea. Rather than dealing with her cheating husband, Kitty worries the exclusive clique of Overlook moms will find out. Unfortunately, The Lookers already know everything, about everyone. Stacia Curran, the queen bee of Overlook, wants to help Kitty but she has problems of her own – falling property values threaten her beloved neighborhood, her children are leaving the nest, and she is losing her grip on The Lookers.",
