  "description": "It is AUC 815 (62AD). Numerius Meridius Pulcher, former Capri Boy and brothel keeper, currently at loose ends in Rome gets a midnight call to the House of the Vestals. There an old friend and keeper of shared secrets asks for help in finding a newborn. The only catch is that the mother of the newborn is dead...and a Vestal. Reconstructing the crime will lead Numerius scurrying in and around Rome both grand and glorious and cheap and tawdry, running into old friends and enemies and those unable to be placed firmly in either camp.Numerius Meridius Pulcher and the Case of the Not So Virgin Vestal is the first of a series on Numerius Meridius Pulcher set in the Ancient Roman Empire.",
