  "description": "If there hadn't been a 24-hour blackout...\nMallory never would have had the nerve to seduce her photographer, and first love, Adam. Sure, she knew she was on the rebound, but it was for only one night. And for Mallory, that was going to have to be enough....Adam never would have believed he'd end up in Mallory's bed--just days after taking her boudoir photos for another man! But he was definitely enjoying their sensual reminiscing.... Unfortunately, the timing was all wrong--he was leaving the country next week. Still, he couldn't say no to her tonight....They never would have experienced the best sex of their lives! But then again, chemistry had never been their problem. After all, there was more to life than just good sex. Wasn't there?",
