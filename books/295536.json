  "description": "Now safely gathered in Lebanon, Kansas, our survivors work with Micky Rode and the Nacogdoche Indian Tribe to train refugees of the apocalypse to become true warriors.  To find Climbing Fox Wattana, they must cross a countryside teeming with flesh-craving skinwalkers.  The skinwalkers have drawn together to form massive hordes – some wandering on their own; others amassed by Qaletaqa, an ancient Chief of the Hintoka Tribe who possesses near immortality. But he also hides a deeper secret of which few living humans are aware.  Micky’s original plan has finally come to fruition in this, the final book in the Zombie War Chronicles trilogy.  Join Micky, Cole, Georgina, Lilly, Danny, Roxy and Terry as their fierce determination drives them toward the ultimate battle for the survival of humanity.",
