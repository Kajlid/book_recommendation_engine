  "description": "Healing secrets and a battle for survival await in Eden Springs. Kate Tyler is already in a life crisis when she inherits Howard's Walk in Eden Springs, North Carolina, after the sudden death of her twin sister, Rebecca. The last thing she wants is to be tied down to an abandoned estate and its neglected once-famous gardens. She vows to sell it as quickly as possible. But on her first visit to Howard's Walk, Kate finds a family heirloom, an embroidered tablecloth, that Rebecca has left behind, and that connection, and the deepening sense of loss she is feeling, convince her to stay--at least until she is able to decide her future. As Kate struggles alone in her grief, healing appears in the form of new friends and neighbors. When secrets begin to surface within the old house, Kate questions the connection she feels with a mentally challenged young man from the farm next door. When she meets the owner of a local garden center, she begins to open her heart again to the possibility of love. Kate learns that a powerful and vengeful man who was denied ownership of Howard's Walk in the past is determined to finally own it at any cost. She must decide.",
