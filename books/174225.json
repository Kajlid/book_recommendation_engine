  "description": "He was convinced he was dying, slowly wasting from the same disease that took both his father and grandfather’s lives. So Bishop began to take the necessary steps to wrap up his life, trying to gain closure in every area. Especially in regard to his ex-wife, Dory. A woman who left him when he’d just been a lowly recruit in the Hellion Motorcycle Club. Reaching out, he asks to meet with her in order to finally put to rest all the unresolved, heart-sick emotions her quick departure had left behind so many years before.  Dory had escaped Missoula and the Hellions where she’d once been a Honey and a wife.  She’d moved on, creating a new life for herself in Casper, Wyoming. And those thirteen years away had been bordered in secrets, both in the past and present. So when Bishop calls her, almost demanding she meet with him, Dory recognizes it’s time for truth. For letting go of the undisclosed, of exposing her hidden life in favor of the peace that only honesty can bring.  From the author of Hiding in Plain Sight, The Possibility of Trey and the other books in the Hellion MC Series comes the last novel, Checkmate With Bishop.  It’s a story about forgiveness…especially when one of the many apologies you offer must be given to yourself.  *Intended for mature audiences only (18+) due to strong language and sexual situations*",
