  "title": "The Doctrine of Venus",
  "description": "A short story like no other. Historical fiction melded with erotica, and The Doctrine of Venus at its heart.Step back in history one hundred years to the trial of a society beauty. Her scandalous affair lends publicity to a book that advocates sexual depravity--the Doctrine. Reproduced here in its entirety, the 3rd edition of The Doctrine of Venus has been censored in America for a century. A seminal work of domination and submission, it is a rulebook for collaring your lover. It is a manifesto for romantics and sinners. Shocking and arousing, and complete with a dozen erotic photographs of the period, it whispers temptingly to readers to try it for themselves.As sensational now as it was back then,  The Doctrine of Venus  is more than a hot read; it is a book that may change your life--forever.",
