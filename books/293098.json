Except that she's so beautiful I'm having trouble keeping my hands off of her. The club comes first. My d*ck second. My heart? This is a f*cking mess.   Toxin is part of the new chapter of the Dead Souls MC. It is a hot motorcycle romance that follows the prospects of the Dead Souls Motorcycle Club and the women that love them.",
