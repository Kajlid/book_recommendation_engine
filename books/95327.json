  "description": "Perfection is Dianna Faraday's family motto. Unfortunately, being the head cheerleader, on the honor roll and most popular girl in school isn't perfect enough to save Dianna from her from her father's belt, which is the only parenting tool he thinks he needs. With the start of 10th grade and his angry punishments increasing in frequency and intensity, she isn't sure she'll make it to 11th. That is, until she meets Laurie Burns. Laurie is the biggest nerd in school, wears ugly clothes and annoys everyone around her with her know-it-all attitude. She also has a warm, caring heart and opens up her life, and her family, to Dianna in a moment of crisis. Can this weird, unusual girl and her equally unusual family be the key to finally finding the love and security she needs?",
