  "description": "It was slow going with her heels sinking into the wet ground on every step. Almost to dry ground, her shoe caught and stayed in the mud sending her hopping forward on one foot. She made a mad grab for anything to keep her vertical. Her hands unerringly snatched the front of the princeâ€™s suit jacket, simultaneously pulling him toward her and down to the ground. They fell in a tangle of limbs, him turning to hit the ground first and her head smacking into his chest hard enough to make her see stars. When they stopped moving, mortification, like she had never felt before, spread through her like wildfire. His Royal Highness, the Prince of Ghadrik, lay flat on his back on the White House lawn with her sprawled across him. She was so getting fired.",
