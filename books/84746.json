  "description": "Not many people have heard of IIM and IIT graduates becoming bestselling writers or chief ministers. The professional career path chosen by many people is as plain as daylight and can be predicted many years into the future. But Sonia Golani's book, My Life, My Rules: Stories of 18 Unconventional Careers, catches the imagination of the reader and provides valuable insights into the inconceivable ways a person's career can proceed. It is a collection of eighteen different stories, each featuring an individual who has dared to walk the less-traversed path. Amish, a successful corporate employee, ventures into the risky world of fiction writing. Eventually, his Shiva series becomes so successful that he quits his job and becomes a full-time author. Having graduate degrees from prestigious institutions and a doctorate in environmental toxicology, Rahul Ram chose to become a musician instead and played for the famous 'Indian Ocean' rock band. Such stories in this book challenge the common set of decisions that most people make for their futures. These stories show just how unpredictable life can be.",
