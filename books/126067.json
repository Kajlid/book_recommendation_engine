  "description": "Lenore moves to the Gothic small town of Whitby, Yorkshire and discovers a hidden world of vampires, shifters and demons. Her precognitive visions of death lead her to become the target of a serial killing demon. ''A young man held a young woman in his arms, her head leaned to one side, her eyes empty and still. He was shadowed, but I saw that the figure was kissing the girl's neck. No that wasn't it. As I moved closer I saw what it was. She was unmoving, a statue, while he sucked on her bleeding neck. I was cold with fear, yet I moved closer.. mesmerized.'' Chapter Four Of Whitby After Dark.",
