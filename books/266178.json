So how could she find herself on the wrong side as they rounded on her friends? With her mum missing, she must risk everything to join a powerful new coven and rescue her, but who can she trust? Can she ever master the art of dragon-back combat? Is middle-age spread something over 40's have on toast for breakfast? Was that relevant? Who writes this rubbish? Only one way to find out... Top Amazon / Goodreads reviewer NN Light says: \"Looking for the next thing to read after Harry Potter, pick this up today! Think Lemony Snicket, only better!
