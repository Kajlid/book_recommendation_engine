  "description": "Dominic Kaid is heartbroken over the recent loss of his mother and sister. While trying to return to work, he finds himself in a sabotaged lab. Unable to escape, a series of explosions ignite, and liquid metals engulf him. Those around him do all they can to save his life with an untested experimental therapy. As he's recovering in a coma, they see his body adapting to the metal in impossible ways.While trying to understand what caused the lab explosions and how Dominic adapted, Jack, Aiden, and Patrick begin to uncover a trail of bodies and search for what lies at the end.With help from physicists, psychologists, biologists, molecular biologists, MDs, chemists, and a former FBI agent, this series is as scientifically sound as a science fiction graphic novel can be. Information about the science used can be found in the back of the book.",
