But here’s the thing, these four individuals are no ordinary people. From behind Jay, Karman, Nate and Rayya’s eyes, you’ll get to experience love, carnal desires, dark secrets, and ulterior motives. In the backdrop of all this, a prophecy comes to fruition, and for better or worse, world leaders and powerful individuals are making decisions that will shape humanities fate for thousands of years to come.Madam Lilith - “How do you do it? How do you create such masterpiece? Do you sit on your throne and tinker till you get it just right for all eternity, or do you create your work and let time be the only paint brush?” This is not a book you read the title of and take for face value. This is a book you read if you want to peer into parts of your soul you may often ignore. This is a book you read when you truly want to ponder the world around you, where you ask yourself, where does humanity go from here? – O.M. Wills",
