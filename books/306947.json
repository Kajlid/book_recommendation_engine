  "description": "Take an average looking thirty-two year old woman, an Internet typing blunder, a group of doting gay men, a social climbing gorgeous Latin poser and a humble British Nobleman and you have Just Call Me Lady. With the help of her \"Queer Eye\" team, Connie Botello blossoms and a web of assumptions and comic faux pas ensues when she buys an online Noble Title and assumes the persona of Lady Constance Widford of Exeter, England. Love, deception, exotic locations, arrests, celebrity all complicate this once small town girl's life with a lovely, redemptive conclusion.",
