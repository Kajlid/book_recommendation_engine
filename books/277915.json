  "description": "Meet Lisa, Guy, Keri, Graham, Helen, and Josh. With a tangle of secret lusts hovering amongst them, it only takes one betrayal to trigger a sudden collapse of social and sexual decorum. As these young Londoners fall in and out of bed with one another in a series of sexual adventures, misadventures, accidents, triumphs, and failures, casual indiscretions begin to have irreversible consequences. By turns funny and sad, embarrassing and moving, The Love Hexagon asks how deep loyalties within a group of friends run when eyes and hearts begin to stray.\"Sutcliffe pushes his subject—twenty—something city life—onto the black leather couch and subjects it to some good old—fashioned psychoanalysis; the result is like a ruder, funnier version of Friends with voice—overs from Frasier.\" — The Observer\"An excruciating comic masterpiece.\" — Sunday Times\"One of the finest young talents for the new millennium\"— The Times , London",
