  "description": "Dystopia and Derelict Dreams unashamedly bares the negative side of human beings, ruminates the search for love in times of harrowing loss, and tells the tale of finding oneself in life in the midst of it all.A book of introspective reflection, of postmodern swaggering braggadocio and emotional openness, this poetry collection also tackles an important phase of being human—finding oneself after losing the sense of self-identity. Just like how we lose ourselves every time we give ourselves to someone else and like how we lose ourselves every time we go astray, round and round and never-ending, finding the terra incognita. “I am lost, and I don’t know how to come back,” the poet writes. Drawing from his experiences of terrible loss at a young age, Cerézo’s confessional poetry collection is absolutely dismal. Poignant, solemn, but—right.",
