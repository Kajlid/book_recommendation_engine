  "title": "It Never Happened Again: Two Stories",
  "description": "Two exquisite stories drawn in Sam Alden's signature, flowing, and lush pencil style. In “Hawaii 1997,” few words are spoken, but Aldens imagery evokes the magic of a night-time encounter at a Hawaiian resort. In “Anime” he explores the complicated dynamics of pop culture obsession. Sam Alden is one of the brightest young talents working today.Sam Alden was born in 1988 in Portland, Oregon. In 2013 he was an official guest at the BilBOLbul festival in Bologna, Italy, and his ongoing comic Haunter will be excerpted in the forthcoming Best American Comics 2013 from Houghton-Mifflin. He now lives and works as an illustrator and cartoonist in his hometown of Portland, with plans to move to Montreal, Quebec, in the fall. Sam lives alone with no pets and has won no awards.",
