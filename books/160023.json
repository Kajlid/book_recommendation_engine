  "description": "“Sacrifice isn’t always made…in choice.” When a surprise attack on the camp forces Myla’s powers to surface, she realizes to little too late, that the choice she thought she had was nothing more than a delicately crafted illusion. Her body is a pawn and the game board she stands on is much bigger than she realized. In this war between good and evil, choice is a luxury that cannot be afforded. But in the name of power a sacrifice must be made, whether conscious or unconscious. Faced with the threat of death, the pack must decide for both Myla and Josh how they will be saved. Hunted by beings loyal to Hunter, Andy and the pack know that their only option to save Myla and Josh from their impending demise is to continue to travel up the mountain where a witch of great power and great loyalty to the Luminous resides. It is in this witches presence that the missing pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place. But when a trip through an ancient Luminous ritual site proves to be more damning than enlightening, the mismatched family knows they must embark on their final journey to the Luminous City – only if they leave the safety of the witches dwelling, they face the threat of another witch, a deadly witch, hunting them down for slaughter.",
