  "title": "Ject: The Philosophy of Michael J. Buckner M.A.",
  "description": "Ject is a synthesis of analytic and continental philosophies. Evolution and space-time are analyzed and a richer understanding is achieved. Religion is deconstructed. Humans ascend to their rightful place as the creators of the Gods and Goddesses. Religious cosmologies are diffused and replaced by scientific theories and geometrical paradigms. Ject is a new philosophy. It is ripe and ready for the reader living in this Technolithic Period. Ancient, Medieval, Modern, and Millennial philosophers make cameo appearances throughout the work, rooting it in the fertile tradition of philosophy. Michael J. Buckner nourishes the branches of philosophy and helps it grow into the era of smart technology and globalization.",
