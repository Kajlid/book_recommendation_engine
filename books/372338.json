  "title": "Real Moments: Discover the Secret for True Happiness",
  "description": "To many of us, the experiences that we grew up taking for granted leave become distant dreams in our adult lives: marriages that last a lifetime; safe neighborhoods to call home; the certainty that our children will have a better life than we did; and most of all, lots of time to spend as we wish, living for the moment.  Instead, we find our time and energy spent recovering from the past or protecting ourselves from the future.  The result is a desperate, sometimes dangerous, and often unsuccessful, search for meaning in our lives. In Real Moments , Barbara De Angelis defines happiness not as an acquisition, but as a skill--the skill of capturing every moment and living it completely.  With insight, wisdom, and vision, she teaches us how to rediscover real moments with our mates and our children, with our work and our play, in sex and intimacy, and real moments with ourselves.  It is an examination of our relationship with the process of living itself, offering inspiration as well as practical tools for creating more of one of the most precious moments of all--moments of true meaning in our lives.",
