  "description": "For Cody Merrill, life had only just begun. Having finally graduated high school by the skin of his teeth, and some helpful nudges from his girlfriend, Lisa, Cody was ready for his new taste of freedom. That summer was going to be the greatest adventure of all time. No teachers, no curfews, and most of all…no rules. Content in the unknown future. Parties, beer…and plenty of weed to pass the time. What else was there to do? But when Cody introduces a new drug to the group, he learns how swiftly addiction can consume a person. How it befriends you, plays with you. How it embraces you as a lover, and once it knows it has your undying trust, it sinks its teeth in, a vampire drinking the very essence of your soul. You cannot escape its grasp, and what is worse…you don’t even want to. Stuck in a whirlwind of broken laws, broken trust, lies, and murder, Cody is fraught with disguising his pain, or following his love into a better future. Will Cody make the right choices before it is too late? Or will his luck finally run out, before the tides subside, or the Seasons Change?",
