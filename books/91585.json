  "description": "Barbara, lovely young babysitter, awoke bound and gagged, a helpless captive of solemn twelve-year old Bobby and his younger sister Cindy. It's only a game, she told herself at first. At first, she wasn't frightened. But then she came to realize this was no ordinary prank. Her charges and three of their friends were completely caught up in their new-found power, and determined to experiment with itâ€”to its limits. They had in store for their victim a series of ordeals such as only the compassionless childish mind, schooled in today's sophisticated violence, could conceive.",
