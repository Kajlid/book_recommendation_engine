  "description": "Suede’s just an aging broken in cowboy who has now been promoted to foreman on the CROOKED E RANCH. Over ten years ago Suede had made that phone call to Mason, his former rodeo buddy and had been welcomed to the ranch for much needed healing after a bad tangle on one mean ass bronc. He’d been in Montana since he packed his duffle and limped to the big sky country.  Morgan, a woman who still flinched when the screen door slammed was on a ranch chalked full of rugged cowboys...alone. Knowing she had to get over this constant fear of men is what kept her there. Could she manage being with only the male species without suffering another panic attack?  There was just something about the little slip of a woman. He caught himself thinking about Morgan far more then he had a right to. But there’s more to her...what, is the real question? The petite blonde with the big doe eyes was an awful skittish thing. No doubt someone had did a number on her...but who? Suede’s libido had been in hibernation for quite sometime but Morgan didn’t just jostle that bear she kicked it in the face and slapped it on its ass.  Would Morgan be able to get over her troubled past long enough to use Suede to prove she was none of the things that had been branded into her head? Could Suede give Morgan the no strings attached sex she asked for? Did he even want to when this was the first woman to hold his interest in...well, forever? Whether it was foolishness or the magical feel of Christmas he wasn’t backing away from her.  WARNING: Contains a pixie of a woman who is the one in charge in the bedroom leading one of the toughest cowboys around by his...well, you know.  Approx. 37,500 words",
