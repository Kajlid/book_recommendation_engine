  "description": "Timothy Mayfield is ready to marry for love, but, since his personal finances are thinner than he'd like, he knows he'll also need to find a wife with wealth. After receiving an unexpected inheritance, Timothy’s circumstances change, and he is free to pursue his “perfect woman” - one with blonde hair, blue eyes, a light laugh, arched eyebrows, elegant fingers, and a dazzling smile, among nearly twenty other characteristics.  Maryann Morrington doesn't match anything on Timothy's list - except for wealth. An heiress in her own right, she is tired of men pursuing her only for her money. But at nearly twenty-two years old, and not a particularly stunning beauty, she can’t be as picky as her friend Timothy is. The two friends end up playing matchmaker for each other. Timothy will find a decent gentleman for Maryann, and Maryann will prove to Timothy that his “perfect woman” doesn’t exist. Until Miss Shaw comes to London. Now, with Timothy's heart captivated by the blonde, blue-eyed beauty, Maryann must decide if she should risk her heart and reveal her true feelings for her friend, or if she should settle for someone else. It's an up-and-down game of “he loves me, he loves me not” with both hearts and friendship on the line.",
