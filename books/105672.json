  "title": "The Krinar Captive",
  "description": "A new standalone romance from the New York Times bestselling author of Twist Me and The Krinar Chronicles  Emily Ross never expected to survive her deadly fall in the Costa Rican jungle, and she certainly never thought she’d wake up in a strangely futuristic dwelling, held captive by the most beautiful man she’d ever seen. A man who seems to be more than human…  Zaron is on Earth to facilitate the Krinar invasion—and to forget the terrible tragedy that ripped apart his life. Yet when he finds the broken body of a human girl, everything changes. For the first time in years, he feels something more than rage and grief, and Emily is the reason for that. Letting her go would compromise his mission, but keeping her could destroy him all over again.  NOTE: This is a full-length, standalone romance that takes place approximately five years before \nThe Krinar Chronicles\n trilogy (aka Mia & Korum’s story). You do not have to have read that trilogy to enjoy this book.",
