  "description": "Shamus hasn't had much luck with humans for reasons he can't understand. At ten-months old, he's adopted into his third home by a young family and their canine companion, Lela. Playful, destructive and more than a little insecure, Shamus desperately seeks to find his place among them. But entering a new family is not easy, and Shamus quickly discovers that he has a lot to learn. He can't help feeling jealous of Lela, the family's favored dog, as he struggles to gain a paw-hold.Wise and understanding, Lela patiently mentors Shamus on duty, loyalty and love. Jealousy turns to admiration amid Lela's failing health, and Shamus embraces new responsibilities during a tumultuous period when his family finds their lives in upheaval too. He bravely stands beside them as they trudge through the inherent challenges of daily life - the loss of innocence, a job, a friend, one's self. Through financial woes and marital problems, he comes to understand that while it takes a lot to make a family, it takes even more to sustain one.",
