  "description": "Mysterious Things in the Woods; Mysterious disappearances, missing people; sometimes found... What really is out there in the woods? ....Sometimes the scariest thing is evidence we can plainly see, but can’t completely understand... Mysterious deaths in a forest said to be controlled by Satanists; Mountain climbers found inexplicably mutilated; large numbers of college aged men found dead in creeks; a hiker walks over the top of a hill in front of the rest of the hiking party and has vanished by the time they crest the hill, moments later; the little boy who says he was taken by a ‘shimmering woman’ in the forest; the village of native Inuits that ‘disappeared’; a child playing near their parents in a forest, disappears in the blink of an eye without making a sound; hunters found dead in strange circumstances; experienced climbers disappearing, their bodies never found; missing bodies found, placed as though deliberately intended to be found. No screams for help, no signs of the missing person; vanished into thin air. No trails or tracks left, no clothing found, no smoke, no shelters, no clues...These and many other mysterious incidents in rural locations in America, Canada, Australia, England and indeed worldwide, have sparked debate by many into what could possibly be the cause. There are many theories....and with these theories comes the visceral, primal fear that comes from the thought that we humans may be victim to a predator, that in the blink of an eye, outsmarts us very easily. Stalked as prey and snatched without warning... Never to be seen again. Or found, in the most horrible of circumstances...",
