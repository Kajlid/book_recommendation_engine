  "description": "Curiosity might have killed the cat —but Finn is hoping it will make him a better Dom.  Finn isn’t sure what form of BDSM calls to him more, but what he does know is that he’s drawn to a certain English professor. Unfortunately, Professor Sexy —as he’s known by his students— is skittish, and Finn knows he needs to take it slow. Teasing Beckett with little notes and presents might be a little outside the box, but Finn never claimed to be conventional.  Beckett will admit he’s curious about his not-so-secret admirer, but he isn’t sure he’s ready to take the next step.  Beckett has always maintained a strict policy about not dating anyone associated with the college, but he’s never been so tempted before. Even if he wants to know who’s been leaving him the notes, there’s still one big question left. Does Beckett’s mysterious admirer know what Beckett’s into, or is he expecting a much more conventional professor?  When an untrained Dom falls for an older, hesitant sub, sparks fly in the most unconventional ways.   80k Words Story Contains: Spanking, mild BDSM, Puppy Play, and mild exhibitionism  **While this is a standalone novel, the events in this story take place directly after Unexpected. Reading Unexpected is not necessary to enjoy Unconventional but will show more about Finn’s friendship with Ryland.**",
