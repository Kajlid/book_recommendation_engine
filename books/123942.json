  "title": "Moon Mountain",
  "description": "Set in India and Africa in the early twentieth century, Moon Mountain is a classic of the Bengali ‘kumar-sahitya’ genre or young-adult literature that smoothly blends narrative elements of the thriller, the fantasy and the travelogue into an action-packed adventure story. The language of Pradeep Sinha’s translation is fast-paced and contemporary without compromising in the least either the charm of the old world it narrates or the flavour of the Bangla original.",
