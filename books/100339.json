  "title": "The Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus",
  "description": "Is there credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God? Retracing his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools like Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis who are recognized authorities in their own fields. Strobel challenges them with questions like; How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this award-winning book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ? 'Lee Strobel probes with bulldog-like tenacity the evidence for the truth of biblical Christianity.' Bruce M. Metzger, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament, Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary 'Lee Strobel asks the questions a tough-minded skeptic would ask. His book is so good I read it out loud to my wife evenings after dinner. Every inquirer should have it.' Phillip E. Johnson, Law Professor, University of California at Berkeley",
