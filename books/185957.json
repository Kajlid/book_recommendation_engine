  "description": "Amernia has changed. As the fate of her country hangs by a tenuous thread, the Blood Queen has plunged the capital into a technological renaissance. Musicians and artists have flooded Voskeer, while new mechanical drones patrol the skies and annihilate dissenting scoundrels with bolts of white lightning.The infamous Tilucan Prison stands monolithic and imposing from the blue waters of Azmire’s tropical seas. Only the most vile and wicked souls of Archipelago call the fortress home, and Shrike arrives at its towering walls a tortured, and broken man. Haunted by the ghosts of the dead, Shrike is kept alive only by his burning hatred of the man who put him there. Oblivious to the war raging around him, Calcifer wallows in heartbreak. With the help of an ancient warrior, Calcifer seeks the Throne of Cambrian, and travels north on the desperate hope that the Life-Bringer will resurrect his lost love. What he finds in Amernia’s frozen north will change the fate of his country, and the entire world, forever. Rallying the Huntsmen, Six Shot Salus gathers allies as he marches across the land, leaving clouds of gunsmoke and destruction in his wake. He carries with him the severed heads of Amernia’s once great and powerful nobility, and he’ll stop at nothing to add more to his collection. Revolutions of every kind sweep Amernia, brought about by the hatred of the oppressed, the greed of lords, and love of the fallen. The age of blades is over, and a new wild world has dawned.",
