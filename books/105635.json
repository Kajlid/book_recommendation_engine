While she relishes the hot threesome that makes her friends jealous, she can't deny things are...complicated. Namely, whom to tell about their unconventional relationship, and whom to keep in the dark.In the dark category? Definitely Chris's parents, which should be simple, since they live far away. Except they've sprung a surprise for their son's thirtieth birthday. They're coming for a visit. Then there's Kassidy's best friend Danielle, who's home from Europe, clueless to recent events, and flirting with Dag like crazy.Awkward!Family, friends, coworkers and a wedding put three lovers' best intentions to the test, making them wonder if this unique brand of love has a chance in hell of working out. Contains three vulnerable hearts engaged in a menage a trois, some man-on-man action, sizzling exchanges of graphic language, and rock-your-socks explicit sex. So yeah, it's dirty, but also sweet.",
