  "description": "There's something about almost dying that makes a girl rethink her priorities. Take Nicki Styxâ€”she was strictly goth and vintage, until a brush with the afterlife leaves her with the ability to see dead people.Before you can say boo, Atlanta's ghosts are knocking at Nicki's door. Now her days consist of reluctantly cleaning up messes left by the dearly departed, leading ghouls to the Light . . . and one-on-one anatomy lessons with Dr. Joe Bascombe, the dreamy surgeon who saved her life. All this catering to the deceased is a real drag, especially for a girl who'd rather be playing hanky-panky with her hunky new boyfriend . . . who's beginning to think she's totally nuts.But things get even more complicated when a friend foolishly sells her soul to the devil, and Nicki's new gift lands her in some deep voodoo.As it turns out for Nicki Styx, death was just the beginning.",
