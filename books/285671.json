  "title": "Watch With Me",
  "description": "Watch With Me is the prequel to Liar.  It started as a night to forget my past hurts. I just wanted to watch, to lose myself in my uncle's illicit club. I never meant to find someone — someone much older. I never meant to watch with him. I never meant for him to be my uncle's friend. None of that mattered. All that mattered was how he made me forget—how he made me want more. But was he willing to give me more? Or was it just one night.",
