  "description": "Danielle Rossi knew her boss, Magnus DuMond, was a bloodsucker, but after working 745 days straight, she quit. It no longer mattered that she had loved him for the past five years and had given everything she had to give. Danielle was a curvy girl, and far from the blond cover models or starlets, he chose to date. When Dani goes to Cupid's Bow, GA for a job interview she is shocked to find her boss waiting for her.  Magnus refused to allow Dani to quit. He had waited centuries to find this one special woman. This was his only chance to claim her heart. Magnus knew everything about running a business empire and nothing about winning Dani's love.",
