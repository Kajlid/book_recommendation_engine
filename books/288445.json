  "description": "Over the years, I've heard all the insults. \"That woman has been on more wieners than ketchup.\" \"Her legs open more than a refrigerator. \" Yeah, the neighborhood slut, that's me.  It drives some people crazy that I date and sleep with whoever I want. Men are allowed to do that exact thing without suffering the same judgment so I have no plans to stop living my life.  Relationships are not for me. I just have to keep that in mind every time that sexy, bearded, construction worker tries to make me forget.",
