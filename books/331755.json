  "description": "Reagan Reyes hunts other people’s secrets. A former intelligence officer, she’s currently an in-house investigator for pricey uptown criminal defense attorney Cade McCarrick. The firm forbids in-house romances, but Reagan and Cade are firmly hooked up. Their love—and their agreement never to lie to each other—is the only truth they have in their world of subterfuge and betrayal. That agreement is quickly broken when a mysterious woman leaves an envelope for Cade and is soon discovered dead. The envelope’s contents aren’t connected to any of Cade’s current cases, but Reagan discovers a connection to a brutal crime that happened outside a nightclub—and an even more ominous link to the dead woman. This is a case that goes way beyond the cops. As she digs deeper into Dallas's sordid underbelly, she’s completely on her own—and there’s a killer who’s bent on eliminating her at any cost. This pulse-pounding romantic thriller offers a fresh new take on big-city crime, from a dazzling and exciting new voice in the genre.",
