  "description": "Jade Cannon's life is a mess. She's the laughing stock of West Havenbrook High, and is hopelessly in love with Trace Gibson, the boy every girl dreams about---but that's not the worst part. Her father is dating a beautiful young woman named Erika, whom Jade is convinced is after his money. Nothing seems to be going Jade's way....Not after Trace asks her to the dance, or even when he claims his undying love for her. As Jade struggles with her fears and her innermost desires, she eventually realizes that the only true obstacle standing in the way of her happiness is herself.",
