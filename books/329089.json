  "description": "As Rose anxiously awaits the birth of the family’s new baby, she isn’t sure what to expect about her new role as big sister. She isn’t sure whether she wants a baby brother or a baby sister; actually she isn’t sure she wants a new baby at all! But when her new little brother actually arrives, suddenly everything seems just right. / Susanna Leonard Hill’s text perfectly captures the excitement and apprehension of children anticipating the arrival of a new baby, and Nicole Rutten’s sweet hamster characters make this an ideal story for siblings-to-be.",
