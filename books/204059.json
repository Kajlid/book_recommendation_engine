  "description": "Some men look at others and see flies with wings to pluck. For Lou, a homeless man struggling with pneumonia on the streets of Murphy City, an invitation to a hospital-run overnight program brings paranoia and a fleeting sense of security. Delusions quickly give way to real tensions, however, leaving him to wonder who his true enemy is: The hospital, its clientele, or something far more sinister.",
