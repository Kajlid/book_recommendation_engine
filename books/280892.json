  "description": "'Energy to burn, right up to the shattering climax.' Newcastle Herald Everyone is celebrating young Doug Dooligan's release from gaol. On his first day out Doug is offered a number of choices, each of which seems likely to lead him back to prison-or worse. The Day of the Dog tells the tragic story of Doug s few days of freedom. Set in urban Aboriginal Australia the novel is a fast paced as it is gripping. Scenes of sudden, devastating brutality give way to peaceful, even lyrical interludes as Doug, his family and those close to him find temporary relief in friendship, love, alcohol or escape to the bush. But they are always drawn back into the ever-narrowing circle of crime, violence, and the inevitable destruction.",
