  "title": "Why We Get the Wrong Politicians",
  "description": "A newer edition of this book can be found here.Politicians are consistently voted the least trusted professional group by the UK public. They've recently become embroiled in scandals concerning sexual harassment and expenses. Every year, they introduce new legislation that doesn't do what it sets out to achieve - often with terrible financial and human costs. But, with some notable exceptions, they are decent, hard-working people, doing a hugely difficult and demanding job. In this searching examination of our political class, award-winning journalist Isabel Hardman tries to square this circle. She lifts the lid on the strange world of Westminster and asks why we end up with representatives with whom we are so unhappy. Filled with forensic analysis and revealing reportage, this landmark and accessible book is a must read for anyone who wants to see a future with better government.\n\nWinner at the 2018 Parliamentary Book Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortlisted for the \n2018 \nWaterstones Book of the Year\n\n\nDaily Telegraph's Best Books of the Year, 2018\n\nGuardian's Best Books of the Year, 2018\n\n\nEvening Standard's Best Books of the Year, 2018\n\nDaily Mail's Best Books of the Year, 2018\n\nBBC's Biggest Books, 2018\n\nProspect's Best Books of the Year, 2018",
