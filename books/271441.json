  "description": "Apocalyptic cults. Cursed relics. Paranormal terrorists. Only one man stands against the forces of darkness. After his fiancée is slain by a murderous cult, a professional soldier dedicates himself to a new mission–hunting down twisted occultists around the globe.  \"The Punisher meets John Constantine in this exciting, hard-hitting Supernatural Action Thriller series. \"-- Amazon Reviewer.  After a decade spent fighting the enemy abroad and keeping his country safe, Delta Force Operator Mark Talon is ready to put his military career behind him and settle down with the love of his life. But Talon's world crumbles when his fiancée becomes the victim of a diabolical cabal. The military man now has a new foe in his crosshairs, and this promises to be a very different war.  The person responsible for his beloved's death is a Silicon Valley tycoon allied with the forces of darkness. Fusing cutting-edge computer technology with an ancient evil, the enemy here cannot be stopped by bullets alone. If Talon is to be victorious in his mission of vengeance, he will need to master a new method of warfare -- the arcane arts! He must become... the Occult Assassin.  \"Occult Assassin moves like a bullet exploding from Talon's 9mm Glock.\" -- Nicholas Sansbury Smith, best-selling author of EXTINCTION HORIZON/HELLDIVERS.  \"Good mix of paranormal horror and action/adventure thriller.\" -- Mark Lukens, best-selling author of ANCIENT ENEMY.",
