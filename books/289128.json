  "description": "They tried to break me.  But now I’m back, and stronger than ever. I will discover the secrets hiding at Black Lake Prep and expose them to the light.  Even if I have to destroy all the Diamonds to do it.  I have no idea who to trust, even as I’m surrounded by adoring eyes and mischievous smiles. Asher, Jayden, Kai, Lucas — any of them could be planning to betray me.  Maybe even all of them.  So I have to pretend, make myself one of them until the real truth comes out. I’ll play along, wear a mask to hide the darkness inside, maybe even have a little fun.  I will never forget what they did to me.  But it takes a Diamond, to break one.",
