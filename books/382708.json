  "title": "Touch of a Thief",
  "description": "London's most talented criminal is about to be fingered. . . Lady Viola Preston can relieve a gentleman of the studs at his wrists without his being any the wiser and pick any lock devised by man in less than a minute. But she's careful to wear gloves when she steals jewels. Because when Viola touches a gemstone with her bare skin, it \"speaks\" to her, sending disturbing visions--visions almost as unsettling as the sight of the cool-eyed stranger who catches her red handed. Now Viola will only be stealing at Greydon Quinn's behest. And even more daunting than the violent history of the red diamond he's after is the prospect of a night in the devastatingly handsome lieutenant's arms. Touch has always been Viola's weakness, and the full body-to-body contact Quinn has in mind is about to shatter her defenses and set her senses reeling.",
