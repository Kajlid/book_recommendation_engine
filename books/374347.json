However, when the daughter of his old friend Aleksa sppears in his flat one morning with the news that her father has disappeared, he realises that his life is again about to change. As the two search for clues in Aleksa's war diary, unearthed in a library in Sweden, they come upon tales of unspeakable horror and mystery: meetings with ghosts, a town under siege, demonic brotehrs who ride on the wings of war, and many more things so dangerous - and so precious - that they can only be discussed with the dead.As investigation into Aleksa's disappearance continues, readers will be drawn further and further into a surreal world where rationality has vanished, evil spreads like a virus and not even love can offer escape. While Charon, Hades mythical ferryman, can be found behind the wheel of a taxi and dead horses are seen flying across the sky, cracks begin to erode reality and people start to go missing. Here, amidst such chaos, our hero endeavours to cling to his sanity, doing his best to solve the riddle of Aleksa's disappearance while attempting to save his own soul and bring love back into his life.
