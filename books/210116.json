Jackson calls \"hot and bad in the best way!\" Clay Maxwell is a smart, quick witted, sex-driven, manwhore with the good looks to match. Plenty of women have shared his bed, but only one has ever been constant, Andrea. Their rules were simple. When they're together, it's just the two of them. When they're apart, anything is fair game. And it worked. For ten years. Now, one of them has changed the game... But is the thrill of the game worth losing the one girl he's always loved?",
