  "description": "Ruth Wallace knows she can only hide the scars on her arms for so long. Cutting herself doesn’t make her problems disappear, but at least it helps her cope. Ruth needs to find some way, any way, to heal her scars―the ones she hides and the ones she can’t―before something terrible happens. The seventh book in the TrueColors teen fiction series, Blade Silver deals with cutting, guilt, psychology, and healing. Includes discussion questions.",
