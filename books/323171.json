  "title": "Discourses of President Gordon B. Hinckley, Vol. 2: 2000-2004",
  "description": "Ten years ago, Gordon B. Hinckley became the fifteenth President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Beloved for his sound counsel, his far-reaching vision, his ease with the media, and his sense of humor, President Hinckley has traveled the world over, addressing huge audiences and small congregations. This volume gathers a marvelous sampling of those addresses, including all his general conference addresses from the second five years of his ministry as prophet, many additional talks selected from his travels, and speeches delivered to the general public. This landmark collection takes readers from Manhattan to Madrid, from Guam to Ghana, and also features talks from several historic satellite broadcasts, including the 175th anniversary of the restoration of the priesthood and the 125th anniversary of the Primary. Particularly poignant are the addresses given on September 11 and 14, 2001, when the United States was reeling from the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Truly, in such troubled times, the greatest comfort comes from knowing we are led by a prophet of God!",
