  "title": "Honor Bound",
  "description": "Christian has just come home to England, leaving his commission in the Army, so he can do his duty by the family now that his brother, the heir, is dead. Prodded by his crusty dowager of a grandmother, he sets out to find a wife and produce heirs. He thinks he's done well for himself when he meets a wonderful young lady, someone he feels might help him forget Jamie, his fellow soldier and wartime love affair. Then Jamie turns up right under his nose, and Christian is faced with some hard choices as he has to decide how his honor is best served. This tradional Regency proves that sometimes the ties that bind go beyond blood, and that even a man bound by honor might give up everything for love.",
