  "description": "Having an undead girl in one's room is cool. Having a crying undead girl in one's room... not so cool. It especially stinks when the girl is town legend, Lizzie Monroe, who killed herself in 1862 when she got news that her fianc√© died in the war. Only, Lizzie didn't die... not in the conventional way at least. Oh, she thought she had. She spent the last century thinking she was locked in Hell. In reality, she'd been stuffed in a wall at the old Dixon Church.... the abandoned church Shane Davis just happened to burn down. Now that Shane has her, he has no idea what to do with her. He can't release her into the \"wild\" because people will recognize her. He can't send her away because her muscles have stiffened from her time in Hell. And she can't stay because if people find her, they'll know he burned the church. Being eighteen now, Shane definitely doesn't want that fact coming out.Unfortunately for both of them, someone else finds out about Lizzie and the source of her being alive and that person will do anything to get it, even murder.",
