In order to help him claim his birthright as a demon lord, the demon masters send him the wise and noble teacher Eclipse to be his tutor. As Raenef and Eclipse begin their journey of discovery, they find that the bonds of friendship are stronger than the teacher/student relationship. This volume also includes two bonus stories drawn by the same illustrator but by a different author; \"Crystal Heart\" and \"Terra\".",
