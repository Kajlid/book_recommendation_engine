  "description": "They had been hiding for years, hiding who they were and what they could do, hiding in plain sight so that they would never have to go back. Back to the lab, back to that hell. After years of being experimented on they had managed to escape, go out into the world to live life as best they could and it had worked...until now. They are once again being hunted by those who had turned them into what they are today. The only way to stay ahead of their pursuers is to use the very abilities that were forced on them at such a young age, but even that may not be enough.",
