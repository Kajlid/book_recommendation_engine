  "description": "Beautiful and brilliant businesswoman Olivia had been widowed a year earlier - and ever since, she’s thrown herself into mending everybody’s broken heart except her own. However, on a lonely, sun-drenched vacation to Tahiti, that changes. After delivering a cold beer to a handsome stranger, Olivia finds herself confronted not just by feelings she’d thought had died along with her husband; but also the overwhelming temptation to act on them.For wealthy, aristocratic Dante, love had similarly been the last thing he’d been looking for at this remote resort - at least until the tanned beauty in the red bikini had showed up to offer him a beer. Olivia is bold, blatant, and a world away from the fawning women he’d grown so tired of as a prince of Madiera. The chemistry between them is undeniable.But Olivia and Dante come from two very different worlds - her from small-town Oklahoma, and Dante from a glittering European kingdom. They’ll have just a week together before duty and destiny separate them once again. Having gone through so much already, are either willing to gamble on something that might never be?Then again - can either of them walk away from what might be their only chance of happiness? A Summer of Second Chances is the first installment of the Harris Legacy series - richly emotional, beautifully written, and true-to-life tales of love triumphant despite overwhelming odds.",
