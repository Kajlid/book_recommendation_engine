  "description": "“Salvatore [is] one of the premier writers in fantasy.”— The News-Star (Monroe, LA)From his usurped throne in Ursal, Aydrian, son of former queen Jilseponie, attempts to conquer the entire world of Corona. Even Aydrian does not fully understand what drives his ambition, the guiding voices he first heard from the shadow of Oracle, or the truth of his birth in the elven land—before it was stained and mortally threatened by the demon dactyl. As armies clash and plots unfold, darkness spreads across the land. Only the gemstone-bearing Pony can hope to free her son from the grip of evil—by any means necessary. Battles and magic, politics and loyalties build to a great crescendo in this stunning climax to a sweeping fantasy epic.“As R. A. Salvatore continues to build his detailed world and complex history, his readership is sure to build as well.”—Kevin J. Anderson “Fans will dance with joy.”— Kirkus Reviews",
