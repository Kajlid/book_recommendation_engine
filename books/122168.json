  "description": "When the author agreed to exercise a neighbor's horse, Rory, she had no way of knowing that she and her husband Charles would one day ride on roundup in western Canada. How this came about, via lessons at the local riding school, some extremely hair-raising excursions throughout the English countryside, and a visit to the Camargue to see the horses there, is the theme of Doreen Tovey's latest book.",
