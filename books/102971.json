Those days, when tea-stalls were the most crowded joints, eating at random reception parties was a routine, dialing calls to unknown numbers meant entertainment, first-day-first-show movies were on top of the 'To-Do' list, bike rides meant talking to the wind and sleeping was probably a hobby, I met Sashwat.He believed “Everything is uncomfortable for the first time: School, Smoking or Sex”. Like any undecided, impatient and impulsive teenager, he had fun, friends and an eventful life. His life followed Murphy's law: Anything that can go wrong, goes wrong. His life was enviable because he was happy with his life, satisfied. His social circle was large enough to make his cell phone chime all the day.She was the simple-stupid-silly-romantic girl. The flamboyant diva. The girl who believed in him and loved him unconditionally.How did Sashwat's life take an ugly turn? Did he fall, collide or escape the accident? En route all events, Sashwat lost Swadha. Did he get her back or did he meet a cruel, unfortunate end?An excessively humorous joyride of small town hostel life, passionate, youthful teenage: success, failure, trials and unseen facets of life. Take the ride. But always wear a helmet.",
