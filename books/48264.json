  "description": "Sydney Welsh is a self-made millionaire. She is successful, confident, and seems to have the world at her feet but something is missing. Her life is a catastrophic mess and the reality of her situation sets in when she arrives home from a business trip and finds her lover in bed with a female executive from her company. She realizes that the only woman she has ever loved was Rachel Ashburn and that ended thirteen years ago when Rachel made a choice, a life-changing choice that did not include Sydney. Sydney knew she could compete with another woman, or even a man for Rachel’s love, but how can anyone compete with God. Now with more money than she knows what to do with, she puts an elaborate plan in motion to bring Rachel back into her life. She tells herself that she is doing it for revenge, and hiring business wiz-kid Caitlyn—Rachel’s nineteen-year-old daughter for an internship with her company is a key part of that plan. She learns that it’s okay to make plans as long as you don’t plan the outcome and when an embezzler is suspected inside her company, she makes several miscalculations and unknowingly puts Rachel and Caitlyn’s lives in danger. As with all best laid plans, things can go wrong and once again, Sydney finds herself falling head over heels in love with Rachel, the only woman who had the power to leave her breathless.",
