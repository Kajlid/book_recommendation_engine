  "description": "Christian loves dragons. He's indifferent to people. Because of this, he's perfectly content to live his life as close to a hermit as he could be until a villain bursts through his apartment and changes everything.  “Your dragon just bit me!\" Scott yelled indigently. \"You broke into my apartment.\" Christian countered. \"And I’m pretty sure you’re a villain. Plus, he’s a baby. Get over it.\" \"I’m feeling very attacked right now.\" Scott muttered, but he took a step back. (EXCERPT)  A short story in a series of interconnected short stories with aromantic characters and queerplatonic relationships.  THE DRAGON MAKER is roughly 6700 words.",
