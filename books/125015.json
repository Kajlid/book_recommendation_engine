  "description": "Four college students head to the Colorado mountains for two weeks of rest, relaxation and winter fun on the bunny slopes. What they get instead is the end of the world as they know it as the city of Denver is destroyed by a nuclear explosion shortly after their arrival. No electricity, no cell phones or communication. They are isolated on the mountain top. They don't know if this was a nuclear accident or a deliberate attack. If it is limited to Denver, or the start of World War Three.In the absence of law enforcement, with no threat of punishment from the criminal justice system, those with anti-social, criminal urges are free to do as they please. The former guarantees of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are gone. Now it's up to every man and woman to provide and secure these things for themselves... ...Or die trying",
