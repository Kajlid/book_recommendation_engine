  "title": "The Perfect Mistress",
  "description": "From a #1 New York Times bestselling author: A proper lady in Victorian England is making a name for herself—in a deliciously improper way.   Widowed and nearly destitute, Julia, Lady Winterset, has inherited a book—a very shocking book—that every gentleman in London seems to want. For a charismatic businessman, it’s a chance to build an empire. For a dashing novelist, it could guarantee fame. But to a proud, domineering earl, it means everything: It’s his great-grandmother’s scandalous unpublished memoirs and it could ruin his family’s reputation.   Harrison Landingham, Earl of Mountdale, can’t let the obstinate Julia release the shameless confessional and tarnish the Landingham name. But the only way to stop her may be equally sordid—if far more pleasurable. His rivals are intent on seducing the captivating woman to get everything they want. Harrison isn’t the sort to back away from a competition, especially with stakes this high—because the winner will claim both the notorious journals and the heart of the lovely lady.   “With a delectably dry sense of humor that rivals Oscar Wilde at his best . . . Alexander fashions the perfect romance . . . exceptionally entertaining.” —Booklist, starred review   “Warm, witty and wise.” —Julia Quinn, New York Times–bestselling author",
