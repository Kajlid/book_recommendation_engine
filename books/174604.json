  "title": "Gifts of Love: A Christmas Message",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered if the gifts you are giving are the right ones? In this booklet adapted from a 1982 Ensign message, President Henry B. Eyring uses a story about a jar of cherries to explain that gift giving is much more than finding the perfect gift; it is understanding what the receiver needs and being willing to sacrifice joyfully to give it. He also helps us to understand the role of being a receiver, and how we must look for the sacrifice in others.",
