But before the last battle he entrusted the symbol of sovereignty, the chalice he brought back from the Western Isles, to Gwenhwyvar his Queen — for Llacheu, his son and heir, had died many years before at the hands of his father’s closest friend.During these ten years the original guardians of the chalice, the Clan Menestyr, have sought to discover its whereabouts. So too have the ambitious Princes of Britain, the lesser men who see themselves as Arthur’s successors.Gwenhwyvar vanished after Arthur’s death. Two people hold the clue to her present whereabouts: the warrior Nai, and the last of Arthur’s Companions, Bedwyr.Nai has sworn to protect Gwenhwyvar from her foes. But first he must find her, and in order to find her he must stay alive as her enemies hunt him across a winter landscape.",
