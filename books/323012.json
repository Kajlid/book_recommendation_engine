  "description": "The last thing I thought I'd be doing my last semester was following my ex-boyfriend around, but here I am. I was assigned to write an article about college athletes and he's the biggest one in our town. With this assignment comes a new living arrangement that sets me up in an apartment right next to his.As if it's not bad enough that our parents remained friends after our breakup, now there's no escaping him. I wake up, I see Mitch. I work out, I see Mitch. I'm trying to go to bed, I see Mitch. What's worse is that he keeps asking me out and I'm finding it harder to say no. I just hope I can turn in this final assignment without losing my heart.Again.",
