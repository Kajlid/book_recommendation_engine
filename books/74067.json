  "description": "'The Horned God Chronicles' is a project taken up by the author to look deeper into history and mythology in a quest to understand the harmonic relationship between Society and Mother Nature. In the first book you will find some strings of thoughts although random but honest insights into the world-around-us and the universe-inside-us. These thoughts are some of the cookies that will be relished by your mind provided your mind knows to eat. Here you will get food for thought. I don't guarantee that you will like the taste because your mind may be a better cook than mine, but then you are always free to write to me at rudra@aghorasunited,com so that I can improve my writing skills. In this book, I present to you the struggles of aboriginal tribes of Indian subcontinent during the Aryan Invasion. Beginnings of a long struggle and competition between Brute Force, Rational thinking, Beliefs, Faiths and Blind Faith. I have deliberately kept it short as it will be serving as the platform for the thoughts flowing in my mind. Raghu, the son of Solankhis Clan Leader Dilipa struggles to save not only his clan but the whole humanity from Ignorance. His chance encounter with a Sage reveals a whole new world of possibilities in this 1st book of THE HORNED GOD CHRONICLES. With the wisdom of elders and his own courage, he takes the responsibility of Clan Shaman's secret on himself in a time when danger lurks all around as men who are filled with lust of Power will go to any extremes to meet their own ends.",
