  "description": "I will forever protect her with my own life…Reece Bryant, a college student from Earth, had her entire life turned upside down when she discovered her true genealogy. Not only did she discover that life exists beyond Earth, but also that being brought into the dimension of Pemdas would change her life forever. After she falls helplessly in love with the Emperor of Pemdas’ son, Levi Oxley, she happily accepts his proposal of marriage, and she couldn’t be more excited to start her new life with him in this enchanting dimension. Everything is ideal, and Reece has never felt more content in her life, until unexpected occurrences begin to take place.  Confident that Reece, the Key, is safe in Pemdas, the Guardians are busier than ever protecting Earth from other dimensions who seek to terrorize humans. After introducing Reece as his future wife into royal society, Levi and Harrison resume their duties on Earth where they come across an entity that the Pemdai Guardians have never encountered before. It is when this being is able to read into Levi’s mind, and discover he knows where the powerful stone is, that everything will change for him.  In this installment of the Ancient Guardians series, you will be left guessing as you turn each page, and wondering who is orchestrating the bizarre events occurring within the protected lands of Pemdas. Prepare to encounter the Guardians as fierce warriors, bold and unafraid to do anything within their power to protect the Key, which they have sworn to guard for centuries.",
