  "description": "Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around. - \"Vanilla Sky\" Time changes people, and in Jared's case, it's no different. High school was a struggle for him, and it was a year of heartache. He'd already lost more than anyone should have by the age of eighteen. But when he gets another chance, years later, with the one girl he has wanted from day one, he can't get over the past. Each time she tries to get closer to him, he pushes her further away. Kollie is a survivor. She has faced pain and loss in her young life, yet she doesn't complain about the hand she was dealt. . Forced to support herself, she finds a job as a nanny with a family in her neighborhood. Imagine her surprise when the guy she crushed on in high school shows up. She'd always admired him, but never had the nerve to approach him. It turns out that he's her employer's son, Jared. That night was the beginning of a romance that pushed their boundaries, forcing them both to face their demons, no longer able to hide from a painful past of loss and abuse. Their whirlwind romance takes place over three consecutive summers. Join Jared and Kollie as they in turn try to shield one another from the pain of past events, while at the same time working to protect one another from more hurt and loss. While they strive to find and maintain the connection that continues to pull them together again and again, summer after summer, forcing them to realize that what brings them the greatest happiness of allâ€¦is one another.",
