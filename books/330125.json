  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Amanda Quick presents an Arcane Society novel that reveals the passionate—and paranormal—secrets of proper Victorian London.  Attempting to recover a relic stolen from her family years ago, gifted crystal worker Leona Hewitt secretly makes her way into Lord Delbridge’s private museum. But who she finds there is more entrancing than the crystal she seeks. Thaddeus Ware is a mesmerist with powerful psychic energy—that doesn’t seem to be affecting the woman before him. Instead, Leona seems to exert a rather hypnotic power over the hypnotist himself. After she gives him the slip, absconding with the crystal they recovered, Thaddeus fears for her safety. For he is on assignment for the secretive Arcane Society and knows that the crystal holds the potential for great destruction. It is the key to Lord Delbridge’s membership in a shadowy group known as the Third Circle. The nobleman killed before to acquire the crystal, and Thaddeus has no doubt that he will kill again.",
