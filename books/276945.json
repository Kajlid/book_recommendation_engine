  "description": "All that glitters isn’t gold...Seventeen-year-old “It Girl” Ava Riley has it all – stunning good looks, her own reality show, and endorsement deals with the hottest brands. It’s just too bad that she also has a stalker who’s hell-bent on destroying her life. Desperate to keep Ava safe, the Rileys move to Mar de Lágrimas, a small coastal town in the Yucatán Peninsula. Ava knows it’s the perfect place to hide, to keep her true identity a secret until the police catch her stalker. What she doesn’t expect is to fall in love with the vibrant culture, the breathtaking scenery, and a sexy local named Javier. Javier is passionate, strong, and chivalrous – everything Ava wants in a guy – and even though a relationship is the last thing she needs right now, she can’t stay away from him. Their chemistry is intense, the time they spend together unforgettable, but she’s about to learn that he’s keeping some pretty big secrets, too. Will Ava get her happily ever after with Javier, or will their troubled pasts put them both in danger?",
