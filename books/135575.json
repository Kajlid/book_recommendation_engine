  "description": "SilasThe fae prince caught my eye the moment I saw him, and no, it didn’t have anything to do with the fact that he was being abducted. It’s not even that Callisto adores the large mount who wants to maim him. Or that every time he smiles, flowers bloom around him. No, there’s something else that draws me to him, though when the kingdom begins to fall apart around us, I realize I’m not the only one who wants him.But the others want him dead.With memories of my past hanging over me, I’m trapped between who I want to be and who I need to be to protect Callisto.CallistoWhile being officially crowned prince should be my main concern, something isn’t quite right with the king—unless it’s normal to have an evil mist hanging around you. Then again, who am I to judge when I can poison someone with just a kiss?When an attack on the royal court leaves me wounded, I have no one to turn to but Silas, but he wants to keep me at a distance… like he’s afraid of me finding out the secrets he holds.Thankfully, with Dandelion (my sweet mount—don’t listen to Silas), a strange and suspicious coin, and Silas’s friend who can speak to animals (who don’t seem interested in speaking to him) at our side, we’re going to tip this fight in our favor and prove that heroes (and love) come in all forms.Prince of Poison is a part of the multi-author series, Fortune Favors the Fae. From spicy to sweet, zany romps to epic adventures, there’s something for everyone in this mystical series. Discover destiny and true love and follow the coin on its fickle journey to the next world and a new magical adventure.",
