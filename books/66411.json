Sara is pulled into their world when she is grabbed off the street--disappearing from the human world as if she'd ceased to exist. Now she faces all new challenges. Will she become one of them? Will she fight the change and the people who abducted her? Or will she accept what has happened? What will she do about her attraction to the man who took her out of her world into his? No matter her choices she faces mortal danger, and it will take courage to see this through to the end.",
