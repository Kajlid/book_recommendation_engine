  "description": "Wrestling with Gods(Tesseracts Eighteen)edited by Liana Kerzner and Jerome Stueart, takes faith and religion into the future, into the weird and comic and thought-provoking spaces where science fiction and fantasy has really always gone, struggling with higher powers, gods, the limits of technology, the limits of spiritual experience. At times profound, these speculative offerings give readers a chance to see faith from both the believer and the skeptic in worlds where what you believe is a matter of life, death, and afterlife.",
