  "description": "Mr. Venezi has put up a “help wanted” sign in the pet shop. He needs someone to keep track of the animals. But more help might mean he sells more pets, and the animals will have to leave their home. Sasspants, PI(G)― fluffy-but-reluctant detective―is on the case. She fixes the signs on all the cages, but then a vandal turns turtle into turnip and fish into knish ! Are the crazy ferrets behind it? The game is afoot for Sasspants and her sidekick Hamisher!",
