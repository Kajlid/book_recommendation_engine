  "description": "Books, tires, sand and the sea. Travel back to a time when bookmobiles provided isolated communities with a vital link to the outside world. The heyday of the bookmobile was the 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s, long before every home had a television. A bookmobile’s arrival in a small community’s crossroads was an event. The van and its cheery, hard-driving “bookmobilist” was greeted by smiling children, eager to borrow a stack of books of their very own, and by grownups looking for a library book as a momentary break from rural life’s hard chores and dreary routines. “Type Riders: North Carolina Bookmobiles of the Outer Banks, Tidewater and Sandhills, Photographs, 1939-1960,” is a picture book with more than 50 black-and-white images of the trusty, traveling library vans of the emerging South of not so very long ago.",
