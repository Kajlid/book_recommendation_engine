  "description": "A mirror-image of his former self, Jerry Cornelius returns to a parallel London, armed with a vibragun and his infamous charisma and charm to boot. On the trail of the grotesque Bishop Beesley, Jerry hunts for a mysterious device capable of manipulating the cosmos. Corruption, violence and greed are rife in a war-torn Europe, but Jerry is against history; he is outside of history. He lusts for the equilibrium of anarchy, for randomness supreme - lock up your daughters (and sons), Jerry Cornelius is back.Dunked into the ether of Chaos, the second book in the Cornelius Quartet, A Cure for Cancer was one of the first novels of its form, using hypermedia to spin a web of hauntingly surreal scenes, wickedly funny social satire and sci-fi vignettes that resonate deeply for the modern reader.",
