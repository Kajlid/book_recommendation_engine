King Ruari of the Seelie Court is faced with the seemingly insurmountable challenge of balancing his duty with his happiness, and the stakes have never been higher. With Corbet now holding the Unseelie throne and acting as cold as ice, the struggle to keep the barrier standing becomes all the more challenging when Ruari notices a change in his once-lover setting in, threatening to take Corbet to a place where not even Ruari could follow. This time, the enemy may be of Ruari's own making.",
