Enemy or no, the billionaire is irresistible in a tux.

When he learns that she’s carrying his child, Brody offers Aria the chance of a lifetime. The catch? She has to live under his roof until the baby is born.Either they’ll kill each other in nine months. Or discover love buried beneath their hate.",
