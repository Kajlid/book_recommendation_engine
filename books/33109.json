  "description": "Lainey Kade has been spurned twice since the death of her true love in a logging accident. Now there's been talk. \"That Lainey, she's a shrew all right. Not ever going to marry, likely.\" Seeing herself as an unlovable vixen on whom God has turned His back, she hardens herself to the prospect of such a painful emotion again. Walking away from love's possibilities and from trusting God, Lainey looks for solace instead in seeking adventure and breaking the rules. Zane and Kelly Beaumont are drifters, brothers suffering their own disillusionment and bitter degrees of \"soldier's heart\" since the Civil War. When their paths join Lainey's, risky actions and emotions long thought buried set their course on edge. Then the Great Peshtigo Fire sweeps across the young Wisconsin wilderness, swallowing thousands of lives and 2,400 square miles in its wrath. And Lainey realizes that if she allows the spark of love inside her to flame again, it may tear them each apart.",
