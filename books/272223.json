  "description": "On the planet Barious, war has become a national pass time. During one of these conflicts Taralin Zarco, Queen of Barious, was abducted by the Barion's mortal enemies the Lockeds. When the story starts the war has ended, the Barions have won and the queen has just been found on a distant planet. Enter Drewcila Qwah, a rough-and-tumble salvager, who drinks too much, smokes too much, and has a mouth you wouldn't kiss your mother with. Drewcila (Drew) and her partner, a huge hair-covered alien named Van Gar, have been hired by the king's emissaries to take the confused queen to meet her husband. Only two real problems with this plan. Drewcila hates royalty, and the queen has no memory of being queen or of her husband. Meet a strange world filled with palace intrigue, rebel plots, assassination attempts, civil unrest, economic depression, trash, and the unscrupulous salvager who wants to change it all to suit her own needs. Queen of Denial is a book with one to entertain. It is a fast-paced, hard-hitting, action-packed, science fiction comedy, with a little mystery thrown in for good measure. Ms. Rosen believes in researching her work in every detail. Queen of Denial is the end product of a lifetime of drinking, working in the trash collection business, and getting into fistfights over petty crap.",
