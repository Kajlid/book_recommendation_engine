But in a hall of mirrors, how do you know what’s real or an illusion?Every grueling night onstage is building up to a final show: The Wolf Man. Is he real or a hoax? Why do I feel such a pull to find out his truth? Care to join me on this ride? Step right up.**Harem of Freaks is a slow-build reverse harem series.
