  "description": "Adam Cuthbert, psychopath and Minister of Religion, finds criminality and his work in the Church to be quite compatible. After joining forces with Joey LaMotta, fellow priest and Mafiosi, they go on to break every command in the Bible, embarking on a crime spree that includes sex trafficking and cocaine smuggling. Independently, Adam begins to indulge in a passion for murder, his homicidal urges only being halted by a foe from the past and a mental unravelling. The sole person that seems to be able to make sense of Adamâ€™s plight is Chanda, trafficked Indian and unassuming sage.",
