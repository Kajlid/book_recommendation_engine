  "description": "I can’t say I’ve ever wished for someone to be bitten right on the tip of their junk by a giant bull ant before, but Tanner Morgan—the only man capable of making me want to scream and cream at the same damn time—just might be the guy to change that. He’s infuriating in every way possible, and out of all the massive changes in my life, I thought living next to him would be the worst thing I'd ever have to deal with.I was wrong … so damn wrong.Finding out what Colby Jacobs did to Tanner's sister was sickening, but then realizing my best friend of thirteen years played a part in his crimes … I have no words for that kind of betrayal. Erica and Colby are dead to me, but apparently, I'm not quite as dead to them as I’d have liked to be.“You're under arrest.”Those words have plagued me since the moment my hands were bound behind my back, and Addison's secrets were betrayed to half the senior class. Being arrested for rape and attempted murder was not something I thought I’d ever have to deal with and I knew at that moment that this would be the biggest fight of my life.My world is crumbling and I’m barely holding on. I’m not cut out for this. I don’t know which way is up, but I know one thing is for sure—there’s no way in hell I’m going down without a fight.Colby Jacobs, your time is up.",
