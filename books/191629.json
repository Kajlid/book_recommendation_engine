  "title": "Her Son's Wife",
  "description": "Lottie, cheaply dressed and cheaply perfumes, shatters Mary Bascomb's life, undermining not only the neat comfort of her home, but also her carefully-laid plans for her son's future. Mary's years of control - both as a mother and a teacher - count for nothing against the impact this slovenly young woman has upon Ralph's affections. Humiliated and rebuffed, Mary constructs a barrier of indignation against this marriage. And when the pleasure of self-righteous disapproval fades, devises a means of regaining her supremacy... First published in 1926, Her Son's Wife incisively explores the destructive potential of a mother's love for her son. A story of possession and the misuse of emotional power, it is a memorable work with an acid edge.",
