  "description": "The last person Hollywood actress, Geneva St. Claire, expected to see in Cannes was her best friend’s older brother, Pierce Edwards. But now that she has encountered the drop dead gorgeous CEO, Gin can’t find the will to leave him, especially when he’s drunk and hitting on her for all the paparazzi to see. In an effort to save his reputation, Gin pretends to accept his advances, flirting and seducing him until he invites her back to his hotel room. However, instead of sleeping with him, she ditches him, leaving only a note as an explanation. But what will happen when they both return home to Moonrise Beach and see each other again? Will they choose to ignore the combustible chemistry between them? Or will Gin finally realize that her feelings for this sexy billionaire are no longer an act?",
