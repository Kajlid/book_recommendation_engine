Forced by her mother to remain in the small town that refuses to let Maggie forget and to endure visits with her father at the psychiatric hospital where he’s imprisoned, Maggie’s life begins to change after reading a strange letter sent to her, warning that “It’s all true. Guard the Blood.” Revenants, strange skeletal creatures, are waging a war with The Realm, an unseen world that lies parallel to Maggie’s own. These creatures have watched Maggie grow, knowing she harbors the power to bring them what they want, and by a king who wants Maggie as his ultimate weapon. Aided by her newly found grandfather Liam, and a group referred to as The Trust- composed of the two vampire princes of The Realm, a witch, and a fairy- Maggie must come to terms with and learn how to wield a power over fire that she alone possess as the Last Phoenix while trying to comprehend a new world she never knew existed. While one prince, Michel, draws at her heart, the other, Luc, serves to anger her, Maggie must find the courage and strength to end her years of self doubt and come to rise as The Phoenix she is, the last real hope of saving the worlds around her. Just as the mythological creature will rise again, will Maggie be able to shelf everything she has ever believed and begin to embrace what she really is? Can Maggie face the stuff of nightmares and walk away with her friends alive?",
