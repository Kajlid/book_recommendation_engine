Catherine McKenna - a young composer - remembers exactly why she the claustrophobic intimacies of the Catholic enclave, her fastidious, nagging mother, and the pervading tensions of a city at war with itself. She remembers a more innocent time, when the Loyalists Lambeg drums sounded mysterious and exciting; she remembers her shattered relationship with the drunken, violent Dave, she remembers the child she had with him, waiting back in Glasgow. This is a novel, about coming to terms with the past and the healing power of music, \"Grace Notes\" is a master story-teller's triumphant return to the long a powerful lyrical novel of great distinction.",
