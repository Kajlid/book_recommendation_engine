  "description": "Fate has forced me down a twisted path. When I think it can’t get any worse, it reminds me that it can, pushing me into a thick, thorny maze and leaves deep, irrevocable scars.  My will to fight has taken hit after hit, that burnt-out fire leaving only embers to scorch those closest to me. My fears and demons rage inside me, destroying everything … including the man who loves me more than anything.  A hidden surprise and new danger brings Aiden back into my life, and he’s just as cocky and gorgeous as when we first met. My body jolts back to life the second we lock eyes, but I’m not ready for those sparks to fly. Can we put aside our feelings and work together to find a killer before it’s too late?  Will Fate allow me enough time to heal and glue back the pieces of my life before it decides I need more excitement? No matter what it throws my way, I’ll survive. Right?
