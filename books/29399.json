  "description": "1 cheerleader who’s dealing with her parents’ divorce + 1 geek who’s a lot cuter than he should be + 23 magical beings + 1 scary bad guy = what Tim Kring, creator of TV’s “Heroes” and “Touch,” calls a “cool new series.”In this first book of a series about magic, friendship, and adventure, a seemingly mismatched pair of teens crack open the door to another reality.Julia is too busy wrapping her mind around her parents’ divorce to give half a thought to her friend Kellie’s fascination with “otherworldly stuff.” Julia’s dad has taken off to start a new family on the other side of the country, and now her mom’s decided to ruin her summer, too. Instead of cheerleader camp, Julia will be stranded at her grandmother’s in the nowhere town of Cedarwood Ridge. There she finds that her usual ice-queen act won’t cut it with her childhood friend John Freeman, who’s a lot cuter than he should be and not half the geek she thought he was. Definitely a romance in the making if it weren’t for the visitations from her dead grandfather and John’s infuriatingly open response to such phenomena. And that’s not the only strange thing that’s going on, thanks to a consortium of magical beings called The Twenty-Two who are secretly watching over John and Julia and making big summer plans of their own. Including John and Julia’s future role in saving the world from their nemesis to be, a beyond-evil corporate overlord named Niem Vidalgo Oten. Not that Julia would believe any of it. John, however, would find it way cool.",
