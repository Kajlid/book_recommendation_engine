  "description": "In his early 30s, Henry is hired by a successful software developer and college friend who has created kidnApp, a cell phone app and social network that allows people to kidnap each other for fun. The app is growing fast and making more and more money. His friend Steven (who created kidnApp), wants to groom Henry as the Mid-Atlantic regional manager with part ownership of the company, but he will need to become a seasoned kidnApper first. Steve’s pitch to Henry involves a weekend trip to LA where he shows him how extravagant his life has become. The trouble is, Henry is stuck in his conservative job, suffering from post-fiancée breakup depression, and he is too timid to be a good kidnApper. But this is an opportunity he cannot refuse. Danielle (Dani) Hardly - an aimless bartender in her mid-20s - working at a rundown nightclub. She is barely scraping by, but she is one of the first users of kidnApp in the city. She uses the app as an escape from the increasing difficult world around her, often times pushing the limits of the experience. During a botched kidnApping, she is rescued by newly recruited Henry – someone she has nothing in common with until Henry opens up to her about his less than mediocre kidnapping skills.",
