  "description": "My book Future Gone is conceived as a deep study of human nature, of our hidden, subconscious desires, of the constant roaming in the labyrinth of life and as a journey through human pathology. It presents in a unique way and from different points of view all that is hidden beneath the mask of simple things. In my book there are hypotheses for the development of society and civilization and for the evolution of human nature in far future.",
