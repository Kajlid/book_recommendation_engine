  "description": "Jack Talent is tormented by the demons of his past. Though Jack loves his position in the SOS, he cannot forget what was done to him. And so he hunts down the remaining demons that tortured him and metes out his own brand of justice as the Bishop of Charing Cross. The only thing that soothes him is his secret visits to fellow agent Mary Chase. But while something about Mary calms him, she is also his greatest torment, for she is a reminder of his worst crime - the night he lost his soul by taking her human life. Mary Chase is now free. After years of service to the Ghosts in the Machine, she now assists the head of the SOS and is finally enjoying life - except for the one thorn in her side, Jack Talent. The temperamental shifter unsettles her and awakens a need she's never felt before. But when a copycat killer begins to mimic the Bishop's signature and Jack is assigned to the case, Mary volunteers to join him, eager to unravel Jack's mysterious fa√ßade. Can Jack protect his secret - and his heart - from the one woman who could be his ultimate ruin?",
