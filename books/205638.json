  "description": "Kelly Rolen is a CPA—she's smart, she's focused, and she's worked hard to build an orderly career and a respectable life in her hometown of Darlington, Illinois. Everything is precisely as it should be. Well, it is until her father suffers a debilitating stroke during the busiest time of her year—tax season. Suddenly, Kelly finds herself overworked, exhausted, behind schedule, and forced to hire an intern to meet her deadlines. Elliot Garza is young and brash, but she's also a talented accounting student who is charismatic, driven, and solely focused on completing her internship so she can escape from the bleak Midwestern town to Washington, DC and her dream job. She knows she has the professional skills necessary to do the job well, but she is less certain about her ability to handle her beautiful, prickly, demanding, and compelling new boss. In this fresh new romance from one of the genre's top young authors, will Kelly's past and Elliot's future add up to something greater than the sum of their escalating attraction, or will the answer to their equation end up hitting too close to home? Rachel Spangler is the author of ten lesbian romance novels and novellas and the winner of two Golden Crown Literary Society Awards. She pens the popular blog, Wonder Boi Writes , and lives with her wife and son in Western New York.",
