  "description": "What scares you the most? Is it the things that go bump in the night? The evil hiding behind a façade of respectability? Or perhaps existential despair? No matter what makes your skin crawl, John Loc has you covered. Instafrights brings to you some of John Loc’s best short stories, all in a rigorously non-linear order and written in the haunting, unnerving style that has made him a hit on social media. Pick a title, step back from the daily grind for a minute, and get ready to immerse yourself in a universe where serial killers compare notes over margaritas, the call of the Abyss is very real, and evil spirits love to toy with their victims. Prepare to be Instafrightened.",
