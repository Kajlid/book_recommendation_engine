Fleeing the destructive fallout leads her family to a mysterious southern community, but the Colony is divided from within. Young brides are raffle prizes in the name of fairness, breaking religious code means certain death, and under no circumstances are races mixed.After her father is publicly executed, Florence focuses on rebelling against the monarchy and uprooting the truth behind the Colony's darkest secrets. The only problem is her marriage raffle is looming near, and the more Florence uncovers about the Colony—including the death of her father—the more it endangers both her safety and her sanity.",
