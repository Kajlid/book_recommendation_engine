  "description": "Selina March has lived in the remote Scottish hamlet of Inchcape for nearly 50 years. When she reluctantly takes in a paying guest, her secluded life changes forever. Crime writer Joanna Savile has come to interview the inmates at nearby Moy, the asylum for the criminally insane. Her secret aim is to question former child murderer, Mary Maskelyne, Moy’s most infamous patient. Joanna’s prying will yield unexpected results, for although they have never met, Selina March and Mary Maskelyne are connected by a shared family tragedy—an act of unspeakable cruelty that took place in India 50 years earlier.",
