Now he became a free man and a fighter,learning to command men. From Friar Tuck, an unconventional priest, he learned the meaning of justice. And from Lady Agnes, of the dark and daring beauty, he discovered love, and how to give it up. The time came when John had to choose between Robin's way and his own. How John followed the bolder course, and how he fared on it, make up the balance of this unusual book.",
