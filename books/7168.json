  "description": "The classic, groundbreaking chapbook of BDSM science fiction by Cecilia Tan, originally published in 1992, now available as an eBook! All three stories from the original collection are included, Telepaths Don't Need Safewords, Cat Scratch Fever, and Heart's Desire. Kinky, intense erotic love stories mixing bondage & domination with sci-fi/fantasy. Cecilia Tan launched her career as an erotica writer and erotic science fiction pioneer in 1991 when she wrote \"Telepaths Don't Need Safewords\" and first released it on the alt.sex.bondage newsgroup. She then founded Circlet Press to publish the printed edition, and quickly expanded to publishing many other works of erotic science fiction and fantasy. She is the author of many other books and stories, including the forthcoming novella, Royal Treatment (which tells a story of the youth of one of the \"Telepaths\" main characters) which will be out in December from Torquere Press.",
