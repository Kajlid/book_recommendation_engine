  "description": "Wyoming rancher Caroline Duncan has spent the past few years fighting two difficult battles-maintaining the ranch her family has owned for more than a century, and dealing with the absence of her son Patrick, kidnapped by her ex-husband Todd. Almost three years to the day of her son's kidnapping, U.S. Marshal Slade Taggart arrives on her doorstep, bringing news of Todd's imminent capture. If all goes well, Patrick will be home within twenty-four hours. Caroline struggles to remain strong when she soon receives news that Todd had eluded the authorities once again. In desperation, Caroline vows to pursue him herself. Slade joins her, and the pair head into one of the most vicious Wyoming blizzards ever, facing the rigors of weather, nature, and drug cartel assassins. In the midst of this, Caroline isn't sure she needs a tall, good-looking U.S. Marshal to complicate matters, but Slade knows he wants this strong, righteous, beautiful Wyoming rancher in his life.",
