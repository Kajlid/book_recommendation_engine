  "description": "\"Cosmic Trigger\" deals with a process of deliberately induced brain change... This is called \"initiation\" or \"vision quest\" in many traditional societies and ... a dangerous variety of self-psychotherapy in modern terminology. I do not recommend it for everybody... the main thing I learned is that \"reality is always plural and mutable.\" â€” From the Preface",
