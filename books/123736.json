  "title": "Nurse Janice Calling",
  "description": "Janice Carlisle had come back to New England and Bomfort because she couldn't forget Dr. Adam McBain. As a nurse with the Bomfort Visiting Nurse Association, she would see him often.It was fun living in an apartment of the old carriage house that had been a part of the Wescott Heights estate, the imposing main residence now being used for doctors' offices. And to make things even more satisfactory, Dr. Adam McBain used the garage beneath the apartments in the carriage house for his car.It was in this same garage that Janice first met dark-haired, hazel-eyed Ed Sheldon—and thought him a mechanic. But a mechanic who seemed to run to expensive tastes in clothes. It was only later that she learned Ed Sheldon was living in the beach house, Sea Knight—and that Ed was a surgeon, and a good one. A good one, that is, until the day a patient—a friend—died beneath his knife. After that, Ed had been a crippled surgeon, who depended on another doctor to stand by.But Ed, of course, was none of Janice's concern. Adam McBain was the man she loved. And Adam was making it convenient to stop by her apartment almost every evening.Miss Cabot has peopled her story of a visiting nurse with many interesting characters—including a quite fascinating old Englishman who lives in a ramshackle factory building, but thinks it is an imposing castle. But Mr. Halfax is only one of Janice's patients—all of them of vital interest to Janice.",
