But they do agree on something: how much they love royalty. When they get the chance to travel to exotic locations like London and Paris, where actual princes live, they know this is their only shot to become royalty themselves. Too bad other, non-prince boys keep popping up and trying to ruin everything. Will Helene and Alexis give up their tiara-wearing dreams for their new (ridiculously cute) reality? Or is it really possible to catch that prince?The race is on in this bind-up edition of two novels by McKnight: \"To Catch a Prince\" and \"The Frog Prince.\"",
