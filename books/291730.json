  "description": "Princess Cyra isn't cursed, and she doesn't need Aladdin's wishes to save her kingdom.People are starving in Henjanan but in the palace on the mountain, otherworldly parties continue almost every night. In the middle of the crowd, where colorful veiled ladies dance with young lords and whisper lies and secrets, sits a sultan with a devil on his shoulder--The Grand Vizier--who does far worse than lie, cheat, and kill.Absent from most of these parties is Princess Cyra al-Budur, who seeks to root out the evil inside her country by whatever means necessary--even if it means never marrying or finding love, even if it means donning claws and fur, even if it means giving up everything she has. She doesn't dare fail.In the middle of a monsoon, with the world raging around her, a chance meeting with the handsome son of wealthy merchants leaves Cryra attempting to outwit a kind soul.Aladdin refuses to believe she doesn't need to be saved and tries to prevent the inevitable fallout of wishes three.Never After Tales is a series of standalone novels, that can be enjoyed in any order!",
