  "description": "In the next dimension there is a world very much like ours, and on this world is an island nation much like our own Japan. In Naipon, however, the myths and dreams of the Japanese people are clothed in reality - sorcerers make magicks great and small, creatures out of legend walk the land from sea to sea. In Japan, magic exists now only in children's tales. In the Naipon, the wonder never died....For Tomoe Gozen, the legendary Thousand Shrine Warrior, honor is life itself, and it is for honor that she will unsheath her splendid blade, the Golden Naginata, and defend a weak and wretched village from the powerful and evil shadow of her destined adversary - the priest from Hell, Kura the Darkness.",
