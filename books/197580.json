  "title": "Poetry Changes Lives: Daily Thoughts on Poetry and History",
  "description": "Poetry Changes Lives is a page-a-day of history, poetry and inspiration. The book informs the reader about the historical significance of that particular day, introduces new poems and encourages the practice of daily reflection. It appeals to students, the literary minded, those who are interested in little known historical facts (did you know that Wittgenstein went to school with Hitler?!) or anyone who likes to start the day with a short uplifting text.",
