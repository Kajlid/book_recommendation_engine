  "description": "As a member of a covert army unit, John Davidson isnâ€™t scared of many things, yet one look into the dark blue eyes of Heath Kane and John knew a different kind of fear for the first time. John couldn't be gay, at least not out and proud in his unit, even with Don't Ask, Don't Tell being repealed. He'd never been interested enough in any man to risk the fallout. Heath Kane left home never wanting to return. The army-base town wasn't the best place for a gay kid to grow up, but his grandmother did her darnedest to make it good for him. Now he's paying her back for all her love. Sheâ€™s getting older and needs help with the family restaurant, so he waits tables at the Corner CafÃ© while taking online courses to get his degree. Even though the army base provides lots of buff eye candy, he knows itâ€™s best to keep his eyes to himself. Yet neither Heath nor John can deny their attraction, and when John returns from a visit up North, he seems willing to act on their mutual interest. Are John and Heath willing to risk everything to hold each other?  This book is part of the Why I Love... series.  Gay / Contemporary / Romantic Comedy / Series",
