  "description": "Kelsey Grammer is one of America's best-loved performers—a Shakespearean actor who became an instant celebrity when he joined the cast of Cheers and went on to expand his legion of fans with his own top-rated, Emmy Award-winning show, Frasier. But Kelsey Grammer could never be confused with Dr. Frasier Crane, the uptight, buttoned-down psychiatrist he plays on television. His life has been anything but in control—and in So Far..., his unsparing account of his roller-coaster past, he touches every base, from the deeply tragic to the comically sublime.",
