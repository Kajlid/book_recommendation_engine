  "title": "War in a Stringbag: The Classic Second World War Fleet Air Arm Autobiography",
  "description": "Commander Charles Lamb fought an exceptional war piloting the slow and obsolete Fairey Swordfish. Antiquated as it was, the \"Stringbag\" still outmaneuvered almost any other aircraft--especially with Lamb at the controls. Go with him into the thick of the action--landing on the Courageous just before she sinks; flying 29 sorties over northern Europe; attacking E-boats through the nine days of Dunkirk. Also experience the terror of being shot down...and living to soar again, defending Malta and the Mediterranean. A rare story of courage. 5 X 7 3/4.",
