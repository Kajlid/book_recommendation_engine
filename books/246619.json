  "description": "Barry Trotter is 22 and has never left the Hogwash School of Magic - there's been no need; after all G.K. Rollin's books about him have made him a millionaire and Barry is perfectly happy to while away his days as a perpetual (loaded) student. The hoardes of Muddles who hang around outside Hogwash desperate to see him, touch him, are a bit of pain but he can deal with that. But then comes news that Hollywood is planning a film of Rollin's first book about Barry. And they all know what that loss of creative control; cheap merchandising; millions more Muddles swarming over Hogwash. Barry agrees a plan with Bumblemore; the film must be stopped. BARRY TROTTER AND THE SHAMELESS PARODY is an incisive and hilarious parody of the Harry Potter phenomenon. There are slyly affectionate digs at the books themselves but Gerber's main scorn is directed at the monster that the Harry Potter franchise has become. The book has a creative energy all its own introducing characters and a hilarious take on magic that even J.K Rowling might appreciate.",
