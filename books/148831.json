  "description": "Dead Heat Ranch, #1  Don't forget to read Boots Optional, the prequel to Betting on Grace, before you dive in!  New York Times bestselling author Nicole Edwards is continuing to heat things up with Betting on Grace, a sexy new ménage novel which is the first book in a hot new series called Dead Heat Ranch.  The tables have turned on Grace Lambert. For a woman familiar with long days and hard work, she just recently discovered just how hot the sultry Texas nights can get. Finding time to spend with her two smoking hot cowboys, Grant and Lane, isn’t exactly easy, but she’s forging ahead with what has turned out to be the hottest relationship she has ever been in. The true test comes in standing up for what she wants.  Grant Kingsley has landed his feisty cowgirl, Gracie, and an equally sexy cowboy, Lane Miller, but everything outside of his romantic life has gone from routine to chaos in a matter of days. Unfortunately, he’s become rather acquainted with Murphy’s Law as he is inundated with a string of bad luck. His mother is missing, his father, a gambling addict, is worried about only one thing these days, and when Grant refuses to give in, all hell breaks loose on the ranch.  Lane Miller will be the first to admit that he falls in love easily. And he’s done so again, with both Gracie and Grant. Only this time around, he’s not giving up or giving in. Cowboys don’t know what it means to back down and Lane will ensure that the two most important people in his life get all of him, no matter what it takes.",
