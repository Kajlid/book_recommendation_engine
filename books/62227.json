  "description": "It's the near distant future...and women are tired of being passive, of doting on men. It's time to put the cooking pots away.A group of top-notch woman doctors plan to eliminate the male population one man at a time, luring them to sperm banks, using man's lust and greed against them.By the time they are done, only the good, the kind-hearted, and the easily malleable will be left, allowing the women to form a new, respectful race of men.But when one doctor falls for an agent, can she save him in time, or does it mean going against all she believes?",
