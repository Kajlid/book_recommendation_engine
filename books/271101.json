  "description": "Can there be love at first sight when you've known each other a year?   Mac lost his wife and son but has rebuilt his life, with help from his friends and because of who he is; calm, solid and strong. As chief of police in a small town in the Rockies, he's busy. His friends keep him busy too. And when he feels lonely – well, there are women who aren't looking for commitments.  Beth lost her husband, and as she works through her grief, she finds a friend in an unexpected way. Then she uproots her life, and as an added bonus, she will get to meet the man she's been emailing with for quite some time.   Mac had it once so when their eyes met, he recognized it immediately. There it was, that jittery-warm feeling running straight through his core. Is he ready to do it again? Is she?  Return to Wilhelmine for a final time in the last book in the Brothers series to follow Mac and Beth as they find out who they are, and who they are together. Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
