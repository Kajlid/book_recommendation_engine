  "description": "Judy Baxter is a remarkable woman. She's beautiful, alluringâ€”and a victim of terrorism. This was thrust on her by fate. She certainly didn't plan it, nor did the perpetrators of that terror choose their backgrounds. Can the individuals thrown together when hell visits Earth survive and rebuild? Enter into a world of intrigue, suspense, danger, and surprises at every turn. From high finance to fashion runways, readers will be riveted to the story as it unfolds in twists and turns before them. Ultimately, though, the goodness of humanity and the unity we find together prevails over evil that seeks to destroy.",
