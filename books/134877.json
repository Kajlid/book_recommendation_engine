A deadly fire starts and soon Lost River is separated from her tribe. Confused and alone, she sees movement in the smoke. Maybe it’s someone from her tribe. Desperate, she follows – and finds herself alone with the beast half of the Sun God! But the beast seems afraid too. Maybe it’s not a god at all, but an animal, an animal as frightened as she is. An animal who is also running for its life.",
