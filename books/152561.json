He hasn't been doing a great job dealing with any of it--and all is about to come to a head, whether he likes it or not.His relationship with Sabaan is the only calm and constant thing in his life. His relationship with Lucien is on the rocks, but he still can't get enough of Nikolas. His head is telling him that this between him and Nikolas is wrong, but his heart is telling him otherwise. The only thing Peter knows for sure, is that the jealousy and secrets are tearing them all apart.To top it off, the coven is faced with a series of attacks and murders that all seem to paint Peter as the perpetrator. He knows he's done nothing wrong, but the evidence against him is pretty convincing. He'll need everyone he trusts at his back, as well as the Council--especially since the Council has finally given an ultimatum.All Peter wants is life to go back to normal, but first he must figure out how to mend his broken relationships, find out who is setting him up, and try to keep the coven together in the process.",
