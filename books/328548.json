RED is a Male/Male romance modern version of Red Riding Hood. RED contains dark themes, a Korean Gangster, Opposites attract, Secrets and Twists, Hurt/Comfort, Possessive/Obsessive and Found Family. Oh, and of course spicy times. Please also note there are mentions of off-page child abuse some readers may find uncomfortable.RED is the final book in this series and would be a more enjoyable experience if the other books were read first. If you read it on its own previous plots and storylines do come into play in this book and therefore may be spoiled.",
