  "description": "do they secretly hate us? Could starting a religion allow one to live one's entire life as a tax write-off and are the cost-to-benefit ratios worth it? What if the donut shop around the corner stays open all through the sleepless nights and its only patrons were every person you've ever known? Could this indeed be heaven? What happens when the delivery driver falls in love with one of his customers? Is there redemption for the students who planned and executed their teacher's demise, just to get out of doing their homework? Would you survive the apocalypse if you built the world's most well-planned bomb shelter? Is simply surviving enough, or would you need trustworthy companionship as well? Is cheese the most perfect food? Find out answers to these questions and so much more...Writer Logan Medland shares fourteen absurd stories using his uniquely clever and humorous style in which he created a world that is true (within its own boundaries), however irrational it appears at the surface. We do indeed live in strange times.",
