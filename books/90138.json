  "title": "Creepy Presents Steve Ditko",
  "description": "Making a lasting mark on comics as the co creator of Spider-Man, Steve Ditko veered away from the mainstream and into darker territories at the end of the sixties. His work in Creepy and Eerie proved that this superhero maestro also excelled at short-form horror, collaborating with Archie Goodwin on fifteen tension and terror-filled stories. A must for fans of the enigmatic Ditko, his deluxe hardcover collection not only finds the artist at his pen-and-ink finest, but also showcases some rarely seen ink wash work from a storytelling maestro and features a new introduction from comics historian Mark Evanier. Warring wizards, paranoid goons, persistent heroes, and otherworldly domains dominate the sixteen diverse tales in this handsome hardcover collection!",
