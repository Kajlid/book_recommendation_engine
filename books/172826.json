  "title": "The Silent Hours",
  "description": "An epic, sweeping tale of love and loss inspired by heartrending true events in the Unoccupied Zone of wartime France.  The Silent Hours follows three people whose lives are bound together, before war tears them apart:  Adeline, a mute who takes refuge in a convent, haunted by memories of her past;  Sebastian, a young Jewish banker whose love for the beautiful Isabelle will change the course of his life dramatically; Tristin, a nine-year-old boy, whose family moves from Paris to settle in a village that is seemingly untouched by war.  Beautifully wrought, utterly compelling and with a shocking true story at its core, The Silent Hours is an unforgettable portrayal of love and loss. Praise for The Silent Hours: 'Absorbing and - ultimately - horrifying. A gripping, fictional account of a real event in war-time France, told with a sensuous clarity. A haunting and illuminating debut novel' Wendy Wallace",
