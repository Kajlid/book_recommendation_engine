  "title": "Stories of Scottsboro",
  "description": "From the Pulitzer Prize-nominated author of But Where Is the Lamb? comes a grippingly narrated work of history and \"edge-of-the-seat reportage\" ( Chicago Tribune) that tells the story of a case that marked a watershed in American racial justice.Â To white Southerners, it was \"a heinous and unspeakable crime\" that flouted a taboo as old as slavery. To the Communist Party, which mounted the defense, the Scottsboro case was an ideal opportunity to unite issues of race and class. To jury after jury, the idea that nine black men had raped two white women on a train traveling through northern Alabama in 1931 was so self-evident that they found the Scottsboro boys guilty even after the U.S. Supreme Court had twice struck down the verdict and one of the \"victims\" had recanted.This innovative work tells several stories. For out of dozens of period sources, Stories of Scottsboro re-creates not only what happened at Scottsboro, but the dissonant chords it struck in the hearts and minds of an entire nation.",
