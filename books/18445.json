  "title": "Victoria's Day",
  "description": "Like any other preschooler, Victoria is engaged by the world around her, excited to play with her friends, sometimes happy, and sometimes not. But unlike her peers she has Down's Syndrome. This thoughtful book follows Victoria on her typical day as she integrates into a mainstream nursery school. Young readers can compare and contrast their own experiences with Victoriaâ€™s as she reads a book, paints, bakes biscuits, and plays games. Though she may look a little different, the book shows that Victoria is really not so different after all.",
