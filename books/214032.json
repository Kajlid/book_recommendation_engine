  "title": "A War Against the Cowbird",
  "description": "After a series of cataclysmic events in which the country becomes divided to survive, Rebecca Flora becomes caught between two worlds. Thrust out of her Old Colony and separated from her beloved father, Rebecca struggles to find acceptance in the alluring and dangerously seductive heart of the Pulse, the New Colony city where she is an outcast. But can she survive the devastating sacrifices she must make for acceptance? As Rebecca discovers that all is not as it seems, she opens her eyes to a much greater evil at work and begins to question her father’s involvement. She must find the courage to heal from betrayal and become a part of the underground movement to usher in a new kingdom through a mission that will push her to her limits. A War Against the Cowbird questions the ways we place value on the human spirit, exploit others, and find freedom. Part romance, part adventure, and part science fiction, this dystopia explores redemption and healing, the true meaning of sacrifice, and our continual search for “home.”",
