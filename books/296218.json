Untraceable.I was wrong.Now, there’s only one thing I can do if I want to stay alive.𝘙𝘶𝘯.𝗧𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗿I like to think I help balance the scales of good and evil, one payday at a time. No messy red tape. No long, drawn out legal proceedings. Just me, my mark, and a mountain of sins.Some might ask who I was to play judge and jury about another man’s worth. I would say, piss off. No one asked you.Most of my targets are just another day’s work, but her? She’s different.I feel an unrelenting need to lay my eyes on all of her coveted secrets. To learn the extent of her corruption and see how it compares to my own.She thinks she can escape me.I’ll never let her go.𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝐿𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝐿𝑖𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑒 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑏𝑜𝑜𝑘 3 𝑜𝑓 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝐹𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝐹𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠.
