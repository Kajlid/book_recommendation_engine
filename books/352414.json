Now he's back with the much-awaited follow-up to his first book, Chef at Home , which has sold over 28,000 copies. The Best of Chef at Home is a collection of the recipes that Michael is most passionate about, the everyday comfort food his own family craves. Both simple and easy to adapt, the recipes reflect Michael's belief that making great food is about relaxing, enjoying the process, and losing yourself in the moment. It includes everything from quick recipes for weekday meals, like macaroni and cheese, to fancier fare for entertaining guests, like short ribs braised in red wine. Michael's laid-back approach encourages creativity in the kitchen, with suggestions for altering and adjusting each recipe until it is truly your own. Why not try adding pine nuts to your chocolate chip cookies? Or curry powder to a classic chicken stew? Once you know the basics, you can create flavourful food for your family and friends with a personal touch.
