  "title": "Aunt Harriet and Me: Our Life in the Boarding House",
  "description": "A young girl, spending many of her growing-up years in a boardinghouse with her aunt and uncle, forms a special relationship with her fellow boarders. This extended family of hers can't help but influence the girl's outlook on living, on learning, and on loving. From her youth, she views the characters around her with awe and bewilderment, love and respect, and sometimes even disdain.Her interaction with the group, along with stories of the small town where the house is located, paints a vivid picture--one that is sure to give the reader a real glimpse into basic human nature and embraces the good and, certainly, the not so good. And while the story takes place in ''the olden days,'' there comes the realization that people today are pretty much still the same.",
