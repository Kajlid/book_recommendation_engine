Everything--from the food and wares, to the goblins themselves--is a haunting temptation for any human who manages to find their way in.Determined to save Neela, Lou learns songs and spells and tricks that will help her navigate this dangerous world and slip past a goblin's defenses--but she only has three days to find Neela before the market disappears and her aunt becomes one of them forever.If she isn't careful, the market might just end up claiming her too.",
