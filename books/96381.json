  "description": "Following the disaster that was her last job, Zoë is searching for a fresh start as a travel writer in New York City. After stumbling across a seemingly perfect position, though, Zoë is blocked at every turn because of the one thing she can't take off her résumé - human. Not to be put off by anything - especially not her blood-drinking boss or death goddess co-worker - Zoë delves deep into the monster world. But her assignments turn deadly when the careful balance between humans and monsters starts to crumble - with Zoë right in the middle.",
