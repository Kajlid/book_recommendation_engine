  "description": "Hi, I'm Muriel, the only white sheep in a sea of black ones, and a virgin to boot. I am determined to wait for love, but my Dad, more commonly known as Lucifer, just wants me to stop being an embarrassment. I'm hoping the hunk I met in my bar will turn out to be the one-just looking at him makes my insides melt like marshmallows over the coals of Hell, but trusting is hard when it seems everyone I get close to ends up trying to kill me.Not only am I dealing with an extreme case of lust, there's a new threat in Hell, one my Dad says to ignore. Something easier said than done since it seems everywhere I turn demons are trying to kill me. But I'm okay with that, because one thing I've learned being a princess of Hell is that sometimes I have to grab a demon by the horns and slap it around a bit.A rebellion in Hell, demon assassins and scorching kisses, could my life get any more interesting?Sequel is available : Snowballs In Hell",
