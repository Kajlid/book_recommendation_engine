  "title": "The Devil is an Irishman",
  "description": "A collection of stories recounting Irish encounters with the Devil. Take a night-rambler (Jack Murt in `Jack o'the Lantern' ); a fisherman (Se√°n O Duinn); a gambler (Martin the Cards in `The Two-Rooted Briar' ) or a plain ordinary farmer (Larry in `Larry and the Devil' ). There are certain things no one should do, certain conventions that must be obeyed, such as not fishing on Good Friday or talking to spectral figures in graveyards during the dead hours of the night. But sadly, common sense does not always rule. The only problem is that when the cause of trouble is the Devil, the consequences for the luckless victim are very serious indeed - unless he has the presence of mind to beat the Evil One.",
