Now that the crossroads have been destroyed, she’s redoubling her efforts. It’s time to bring him home, dead or alive. Preferably alive, of course, but she’s tired, and at this point, she’s not that picky. It’s a pan-dimensional crash course in chaos, as Alice tries to find the rabbit hole she’s been missing for all these decades—the one that will take her to the man she loves. Who are her allies? Who are her enemies? And if she manages to find him, will he even remember her at this point? It’s a lot for one cryptozoologist to handle.",
