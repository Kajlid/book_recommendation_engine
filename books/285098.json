  "description": "A new puppy rocks the world of a high-strung dog and a snarky cat in this graphic novel for early readers.Crackers is a rescue dog who's a bit on the nervous side, but pretty comfy at home with Butter, a very plump cat who--like all cats--is all about himself. The two pets have a good life: big backyard, nice couch, good eats, and an owner who goes to work every day so they can pretty much do what they want.Enter Peanut, a brand-new puppy with big floppy ears, unabashed energy, and no appreciation for the quiet life. The little dog is a chowhound who dips into everybody's food bowl. He drools, he chews up stuff, he doesn't get how stairs work, and he's afraid of the dark. Yowl! Not to mention he's hogging their owner's lap. Even the squirrels in the yard are laughing at this goofy little canine.Butter and Crackers have had it! This puppy has to go! But when the backyard gate is left open (the cat's idea, of course!) and Peanut wanders out and gets lost, the older animals remember what it was like to be alone--and lonely. Butter and Crackers to the rescue!",
