  "title": "Richard Parkes Bonington: The Complete Drawings",
  "description": "By the time of Richard Parkes Bonington's tragic death from tuberculosis in 1828, the 25-year-old artist, who was born in England and moved to France as a teenager, was already a seminal figure in the development of modernism in 19th-century French painting. This catalogue raisonn√© of his drawings serves as a companion to Patrick Noon's Richard Parkes The Complete Paintings and represents the next stage in his objective to present the artist's complete known oeuvre. Drawing on more than 25 years of research, Noon catalogues, analyzes, and reproduces more than 400 drawings now indisputably attributed to Bonington. This is the first time many of these exquisite works are appearing in print, among them drawings composed during an 1826 trip through Switzerland and northern Italy.Published for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art",
