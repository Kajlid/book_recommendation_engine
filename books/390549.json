  "description": "Jeanette Connor's struggle to reclaim her life carries her to California-a land of opportunity-and looming nightmares. It's winter in Chicago, 1955, and Jeanette Conner is on the brink of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A contract with the New York City Ballet. But her mother has other ideas for the 16-year-old prodigy, and a tragic die is cast. Thrown into deep depression by her mother's actions, the teenager shifts her trust to the wrong people. This earns her a kidnapping and a violent turn as a teenage prostitute, ending when she is left for dead in a snow-covered vacant lot. Rescued in time by a twist of fate, she must now put her broken body and shattered emotions back together.",
