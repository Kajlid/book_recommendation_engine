  "description": "Zakk Cloutier is young, hot, and likes the ladies that are drawn to his bad boy image. The problem is that none of them make his heart race the way the tall, redheaded widow of his late coach does. She’s the one woman he’d consider settling down for.Tiffany Marcus feels like her life is crumbling around her. A widow with two young children, she wants to find some semblance of sanity again. Focusing on her three-year old twins leaves little time or energy to deal with the aching loneliness after her husband’s sudden death. So she’s shocked when she starts to feel alive again–thanks to the helping hand and broad shoulder of one of the Las Vegas Sidewinders. Skating on thin ice takes on new meaning when the past catches up to them. With more than just love on the line, Zakk has to make an impossible choice: Step in and be the man Tiff needs him to be, or let her go to save himself.",
