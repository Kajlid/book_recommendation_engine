  "description": "The Burb Boys are back for phase four, just in time for a spring movie tie-in! Over the Hedge chronicles the suburban lives of the critters who lived there first. When urban sprawl encroaches on their wild home, mischievous raccoon RJ and his sensitive best-buddy turtle Verne (aided by frenetic squirrel Sammy and a bevy of wacky rodents and marsupials) choose to take this rude incursion . . . with open arms. They critique suburbia's indulgences while exploiting its Dish TV, dishy lawn furniture, and deep-dish goulash of gar-baaage. DreamWorks Animation is bringing the vision of Hedge creators Michael Fry and T Lewis to life in a feature film in Spring 2006, starring the voices of Bruce Willis as RJ and Garry Shandling as Verne. Other star voices in the computer-animated movie include Steve Carrell, Eugene Levy, Nick Nolte, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, and singer Avril Lavigne.",
