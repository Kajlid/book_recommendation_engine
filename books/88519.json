  "description": "Nara is an everyday rubenesque woman who always believed in love and romance. Yet in the wake of a nasty divorce, she doesn’t want much to do with either, choosing instead to focus her attention on her budding career as a Florida based shop owner.The only problem, of course, is that Nala’s Niceties — her newly opened shop that sells antique treasures and collectibles — is enshrouded in a rich and ebullient aura of Victorian-style romance. Her senses constantly tempted and tortured by the beautiful symbols of romance, she has no idea that the most tempting accent lurks in the attic; an ‘accent’ that takes the form of a tall blond, blue eyed hunk who just happens to be a vampire.A native of old London, the dapper Hayden long ago traded a normal life for the lure of eternal love, only to have his life mate ripped away from him in a shocking act of violence. For years he has lived a solitary life in the attic of his stately Victorian manor. But when that building gets an enchanting new owner in the form of shop owner Nala, he gets a second chance at love.Immediately determined to romance and seduce the subject of his fascination, he approaches Nala after hours and treats her to a shameless seduction, sweeping her into a whirlwind romance that renews her spirit and satisfies her body, teaching her once again the true meaning of love.",
