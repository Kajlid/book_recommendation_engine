  "description": "USA Today bestselling author RC Boldt takes us inside the life of Simone King, the \"Ice Princess of Pop\" and her new bodyguard, Kane Windham, who may be the only person to have the power to melt the ice around her heart.\n First Top 40 hit at age seventeen? My first tabloid breakup scandal quickly followed.  Earned my first Grammy? Discovered Mommy Dearest was embezzling my money.  Landed a leading role in a movie? My fiancé called off our engagement the next day.  I might have a multi-million-dollar recording contract, a sold-out world tour, and more money in the bank than I ever imagined, but every time I hit a milestone in my career, my personal life suffers.  Then in steps my new bodyguard, rugged and with a past I connect with. The closer we get, the more powerful my feelings grow, complicating our professional relationship.  I thought Kane would be different. I hoped he’d be the one man to stand by my side, undaunted by the fame and attention that trails me.  The press calls me the “Ice Princess of Pop” because of my unyielding façade throughout heartbreak and betrayal. Perhaps it’s time to show them the real me.  With every syllable, I pour out my emotions and allow them to puddle, forming lyrics from my soul’s breath. And with each word, my broken heart cries out for Kane, begging him to help me break this pattern.  To help me stop being so damn good at goodbyes.",
