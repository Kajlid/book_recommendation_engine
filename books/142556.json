  "description": "Paranoia, fueled by the super-intelligent yet unresponsive aliens in our solar system, has Earth on the brink of dystopian collapse. In the eye of the storm, three characters—a manipulative vixen, a socially awkward nobody, and a special agent for the United States’ eugenics program—maintain their interpretation of order as best they can. But when a psychopath with a hero complex endeavors to end humanity’s silent standoff, these three independently find themselves tiptoeing the gradually blurring line separating integrity and corruption—submitting to theft, surrendering to cruelty, and lastly, mercilessly, welcoming cold-blooded murder.",
