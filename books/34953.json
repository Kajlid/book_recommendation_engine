  "title": "The Conduit",
  "description": "The Conduit is a mystical, YA fantasy tale involving an ancient Irish myth, four special humans with superhuman powers and an evil demon that can morph into any animal including a fire-breathing dragon.Not only is The Conduit of the caliber of the Twilight Series with a teenage love story, it has a sense of humor and characters that come to life on the pages. Here is what one reviewer “Stacey Rourke approaches the superhero story with a nice dose of humor. Her main character, Celeste, shows us from the beginning that the idea of being responsible for saving the world isn’t exactly top on her wish list. In the opening pages of The Conduit Rourke demonstrates Celeste’s reluctance and prepares the reader for a journey that promises to entertain.”",
