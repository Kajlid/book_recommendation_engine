  "title": "Feltboard Revival",
  "description": "Feltboard Revival is the culmination of seven years of my life, quite possibly some of the most potent years of learning about maturity, tragedy, and success on the journey to Everyman. Each work you have in front of you is in some way tied directly to a real event. When you read this book from cover to cover, you have lived a few years of my life. When you read about heartbreak, you've experienced my heartache. When you read about love, you've experienced my deepest feelings. This is part of my life that you find here â€“ with some poetic freedom, of course.",
