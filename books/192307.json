The rumors were true, and everyone knew, a beast resides beneath.When Daphedaenya's sister disappears, everyone is frantic to find her. Unlike her older sibling, who was well versed on fading into the background, staying out of the way, and being careful not to kick up a fuss, Otvla has somehow managed to get herself tangled up with a troll. A big, menacing troll, who demands payment, immediately.Can Daphedaenya get the the creature to see reason? Will he accept the trade her family offers? You don't cross a troll and get away with it. A toll owed will be paid, sacrifices will be made. Those the village spoke about in whispers, long gone but never forgotten, never seen or heard from again, weren't around to tell.Warning: This book contains sexually explicit material, foul language, and subject matter which may make some readers uncomfortable, such as rape, suicide, and violence.
