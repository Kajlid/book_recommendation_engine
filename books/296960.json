  "description": "Theirs was a connection that began and ended in the shadows. Secret moments. Missed opportunities and what-ifs. Wanting more than what they had, but grateful with the bits of happiness they snatched.A bullet stole it away, setting two men adrift. One waiting in the darkness for light to shine once again. The other left with no way to describe just what he needed when he had everything his heart should desire.In the span of time between that gunshot and now, they’ll meet time and again. In dreams and out. One oblivious, the other fighting to earn back the memories they’d made. And the life that should’ve been theirs.",
