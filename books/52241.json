Julie Mathison overcame her rough Chicago childhood to become a pillar in a rural Texas community. A third-grade teacher, she is a lovely, vivacious young woman determined to give back all of the love and kindness she has received.  Zachary Benedict, an Academy Award-winning actor/director, was at the pinnacle of his career when he was convicted of murdering his wife. The tall, ruggedly handsome convict endures his prison time, waiting for the day when he can escape and find the real killer.  When that day comes and his carefully planned break-out goes awry, Zack abducts an unsuspecting Julie and forces her to drive him to his Colorado hideout. There, as she comes to believe in Zack's innocence, Julie's fear slowly gives way to trust and desire, kindling a smoldering, sensual passion between them. But before their new found love can take hold, Zack and Julie must pass a bitter test that will force them to endure the pain of betrayal and separation that could drive them apart forever.",
