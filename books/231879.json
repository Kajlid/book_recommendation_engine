  "description": "Los Angeles is where America’s dreams and nightmares got all tangled up. Sunny days dissolved into noir nights. In this otherworldly place of seemingly everlasting life, death could have an otherworldly quality, too. In a city where anything was possible, even the ghastly could happen. In a land where illusion and reality were inseparable, so are fake immortality and authentic death.It’s all distilled to its purest form in Los Angeles. Where else does a list of a city’s top five most recognized citizens include a mass murderer? Where else are ordinary inhumanities turned to entertainment? Where else is the line between reality and fantasy so razor thin? This book takes you there.Now you can stand in the footsteps of Manson, the Hillside Strangler, the Night Stalker, the Black Dahlia’s killer, and the Onion Field slayers. You can see the crime scenes where Hollywood’s weird history took fatal turns for O.J. Simpson, John Belushi, Ramon Novarro, Phil Hartman, Dorothy Stratten, Sal Mineo, and so many others. You can wander among the graves of victims, criminals, and great lawmen (and -women). It will point the way to the precise location of some of America’s deadliest made-for-TV crimes, like the 1974 SLA shootout and the Christopher Dorner manhunt. And you’ll read about cases you never knew existed but that sent out grim, ghostly ripples that have washed across decades.",
