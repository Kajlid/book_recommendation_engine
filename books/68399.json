  "description": "Christelle is like any other twenty-something living in Sydney – except for one huge secret. She enjoys cocktails with girlfriends, luxury brand launches, gossip and shopping. For an added touch of spice, there's also the sizzling connection she has with her new boss, the gorgeous Jasper. Then Christelle's hapless and naïve younger sister arrives unannounced and things begin to fall apart. Not only does Christelle have to deal with her sister's exploits and embarrassing mistakes, she also has to live with the fear that her escapades will reveal the truth: Christelle and Trixie are half-fairy, half-human. To make matters worse, Christelle has fallen for Jasper, but knows that taking the relationship any further threatens exposure. And no love could survive that, could it?  Cityglitter is a charming, magical romance that leaves in its wake a glitter of fairy dust. With inner-city fabulousness and sophistication, this fun celebration of love will add more than a touch of sparkle to your life.",
