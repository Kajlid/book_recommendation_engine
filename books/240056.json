  "description": "They say that love is blind and marriage is a real eye opener, but what happens when you are forced to open your eyes before the marriage? Will your love survive the test?  Falling in love and getting engaged to Brooke Mathews is the best thing that has happened to Harris Amin, a budding photographer and long time professor at Brooklyn University. Brooke too is over the moon and thrilled at marrying the guy of her dreams, so what if she hardly knows his family or they are 9 time zones away right after the engagement.  The day Harris stops calling her or replying texts is when alarm bells start ringing inside Brookeâ€™s head. Hurrying back to NYC from her business trip, she is shocked to discover that Harris has moved out and gone back to Pakistan. Armed with only the knowledge of his family name, a place of work where his brother works and the name of his city, Brooke sets off on the journey of her lifetime to get to the truth. But when she comes face to face with her love, will it be enough to survive the truth?",
