  "description": "Two dates. Two nights. Two brothers. Jeannie- I could stare at Nick Mercer's face forever, the scruff on his jawline, the curve of his lips, the dark lashes that put a perfect frame around his dark green eyes. I couldn’t wait to see how gorgeous the rest of him was. I pulled my lip between my teeth imagining him shirtless and the rippling, sculpted muscles he no doubt spent hours in the gym to achieve.  The only problem was he was only half the equation. His twin brother Noah was just as hot and he'd asked me out five hours after Nick had. So what's a girl to do? Have both? Yes, please!  Nick Good god, she was beautiful. Even in a crowd of college girls, Jeannie stood out. The things I wanted to do to her—tangling my hands in her long, dark curls, pressing her against the pool table, taking her on it as I worshiped every square inch of her body. Jeannie was a spell I couldn’t break, hell, she was one I didn’t want to break. I was perfectly happy to be ensnared in her.  If only I'd known I'd end up fighting my brother over her.  Thanksgiving for Three is a true MFM, meaning it's all about her in this one. If you like your heroines smart and sexy and your heroes sweet, gorgeous, and delicious, then this is JUST for you. Steamy O's, smutty, dirty fun and two, yes TWO very hot, very naughty guys in this MFM. HEA, no cheating.",
