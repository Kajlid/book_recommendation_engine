  "description": "In the early 2000s, Kingston has many beautiful and amazing features… but it is also riddled with violence.It was a time when Jamaica was less modern than it is now –cell phones were few and unsophisticated, and communication between individuals was very infrequent. The literacy rate of the population was low but Courtney was educated at a prominent high school in Kingston.Courtney has always been reserved, an introvert in fact. He had a loving mother and stepfather, who cared for him deeply. He and his father, Hector, did not have the best of relationships but Hector did care for Courtney.So, why was a bright young man from a good family lying in the street with a knife in his head? What had brought him to that juncture, and what had he done to incite the anger of dangerous men?",
