Foremost among them, Makoto Fujimoto grew up in California, but with a difference--his California is part of the United States of Japan.

His only hope is to pass the military exam and get into the prestigious mecha pilot training program at Berkeley Military Academy.

But with tensions rising between Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany and rumors of collaborators and traitors abounding, Mac will have to stay alive long enough first...",
