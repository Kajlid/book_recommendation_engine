  "title": "The Perfect Woman",
  "description": "In the future, true love is something that can be created to a person's specifications. Meet Denise Merritt - the perfect woman. She is beautiful, caring, emotional, sensitive, smart, friendly, and has the best personality a person could possibly have. She is also not real. Denise is an android (model) and she was made for the man, Steven Adams (mate), who wants to spend the rest of his life with someone special. Once he finally meets her, he had hoped to live out the rest of his life with the only person in the world he truly loves, but he gets swept into an unwelcome adventure when he finds out that certain other models in the world have gone rogue and he must work with the doctor's daughter, the only other person in the world who knows what is happening, to stop a global takeover and the extermination of the human race. What happens is a race against time and, at the end, he must make a choice. Does he choose to put a halt to the subtle takeover that the models are implementing at the risk of also destroying the only woman he has ever loved, or is there another answer? From the author: Most people, male and female have often wondered what it would be like to create their perfect mate for various reasons. This has been a fantasy for as long as there have been men and women walking the earth. I really wanted to answer that question and see what it might be like while striving to make the fantasy as believable as possible.",
