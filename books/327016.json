  "description": "Ex-mercenary Reed Tanner is the kind of protector every woman dreams of...tall, gorgeous and a hundred percent alpha. Unfortunately for the free-spirited Cheyenne, Reed has been hired by her father to guard her not only from a deadly business rival, but from her own rebellious ways. Slapping her in hand cuffs, Reed takes her to a cabin in the woods where she will trade her leather pants for dresses. The two begin a dangerous battle of wills that culminates in a hot disciplinary spanking and an even hotter love making session with Cheyenne shackled to the bed. When Cheyenne escapes and runs right into the bad guys, though, all bets are off. Can Reed claim her for good or is it too late for both of them? By the author of the #1 B&D bestseller Slave of the Outlands.",
