'A Love Like Mine' was born as a result of his rehabilitation and his drive to define a love that was indestructible. His catharsis came from the realisation that his true purpose in the Universe was to help everyone find true love and that his emotions were not unique to him alone. He believed everyone was Icarus, and that everyone deserved a love like his. His philosophies on love and the exploration of the various facets of that phenomenon in society have struck an intimate chord with thousands of his followers.",
