  "description": "For those sick of corporate scandals and underhanded business practices, laughter may be the best medicine. A hilarious parody of the classic bestseller Who Moved My Cheese , Who Stole My Cheese?!! offers a little lift in an otherwise challenging situation. Inside is an insipid tale that reveals profound truths about greed. It's a cloying yet inspiring story of four small characters -- two rats and two \"loyal employees\" -- who are trapped in a \"maze\" and looking for their share of the \"cheese\" to sustain them and bring them happiness.",
