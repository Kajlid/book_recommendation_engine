Skiing, running, karate, cycling, yoga, weight lifting - you name it, she's tried it. \"Oh, to be self-sufficient! Hard as a rock! An island!\"But as she gets older, her body isn't getting any stronger. And in a changing, sometimes overwhelming world, are \"cantaloupe-sized guns\" all a person needs? Maybe the all-important secret is not where she expected to find it . . .In this, her third graphic memoir, Alison Bechdel has written a deeply layered, personal story about selfhood, self-sabotage, mortality, addiction, bliss, wonder, and the concerns of a generation. This is an extraordinary, laugh-out-loud chronicle of the conundrums we all grapple with as we seek our true place in the world.",
