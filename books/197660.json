  "description": "Poetry. Doren Robins calls Devreaux Baker's new book, \"lyrical-emotional meditations on the meaning of existence, family, self-reflection and marriage in time of war and environmental destruction.\" OUT OF THE BONES OF EARTH is a tapestry of interconnected voices that moves with ease from Barcelona to Basra and Tel Aviv to Afghanistan, from the domestic interiors of a daughter seeking reconciliation with lost ancestors to migrants seeking solace in a new land, to reveal the deep and profound truths of our interconnectedness and common humanity. This inspired collection of poems reflects pathos and love, compassion and wry humor, and reminds us how to transform fear into solace and hatred into love in the 'year of the drone.' \"Baker's is a powerful voice, a wise voice. Listen closely.\" Pamela Uschuk\"",
