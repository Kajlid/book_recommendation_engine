When her latest assignment leaves her wounded, on the run, and alone in a foreign country while investigating a potential leak in the Diaz cartel task force, she puts her trust in one man who can keep her alive—even if he cuts corners and the law. He may not shade within the lines, but he’s dedicated and true…Billionaire Milo Davenport walked away from his Delta team and founded Counterstrike to help domestic violence victims who needed help fighting people like his own brutal father. A caretaker of an elaborate underground network, he’s vowed to safeguard its existence from everyone, especially governmental authorities like the FBI. But when the one woman he wants most is in danger, he’ll do anything to protect her—even if she’s someone he has no business trusting.Figuring out who betrayed her is simple. Navigating the secrets between them is a mission neither of them are prepared for but both will do anything to accomplish.",
