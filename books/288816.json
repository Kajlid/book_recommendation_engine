  "description": "At the edge of the old briar-patch sits Peter Rabbit -- staring into the sky, his head tipped so far back it makes his neck ache! Up in the sky, a black speck sails across the snowy white face of a cloud. How could that little speck be alive, way up there? But Peter knows it is -- and he knows who it is: King Eagle, who, by and by, disappears over the Great Mountain. Peter rubs the back of his aching neck. Then he gives a little sigh. \"I wonder what it's like, to fly like that,\" he says . . . not knowing just how much he is soon to learn about his friends in the green forest and meadow -- and the adventures he will have, while learning! Thornton W. Burgess (1874-1965) expressed his love of the outdoors in these delightful \"How\" tales about the ways of animals in the wild.",
