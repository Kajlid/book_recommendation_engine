  "description": "How can one night change the rest of your life?  A choice you can never take back.  Lexi Warren was lost in a world of darkness. A spiraling whirlwind of hate and destruction. When she made a huge mistake. All because of one moment in time, and one bad decision…nothing would ever be the same.  Until he reappeared…  Kole Hartman was a piece of her past that she had always treasured. A time before everything went dark. Before everything no longer made sense. He was also a reminder of the things she needed to forget, and holding on to those memories was toxic.  Only he refused to let her walk away.",
