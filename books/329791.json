  "description": "Lucy’s family thought she married the perfect man: prestigious doctor, loved by all. Yet, no one really knew what happened behind closed doors. After finding the courage to leave, Lucy’s determined to find herself once again. Suddenly in need of a new place to live, she finds herself roommates with the new hunky paramedic. Will she have the courage to open herself up to someone she barely knows? Or will the choice be taken away from her when the man she’s determined to divorce would rather see her dead than with someone else. Derek Murphy always knew he wanted to see the world, and joining the military after high school was his ticket to that endless adventure. That is, until witnessing a tragedy showed him that he wanted more in life. Determined to help others, Derek finds himself with the chance to prove his worth by protecting the woman he’s lusted over for years. The moment she agrees to move into his spare room, he vows to care for her and keep her safe. Will Derek be able to save Lucy from her narcissistic ex, or will he be forced to live with another failure?",
