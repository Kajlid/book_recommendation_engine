  "description": "Bonnie and Kip just want to get married (maybe). Tansy just can't believe that anyone would want to get married. George and Fay just hope that nobody finds out about their affair. Lorraine, George's wife, just has a strange sinking sensation. Bonnie's mother just wishes the bride would wear a more traditional dress.With a wry sense of humor and an infallible ear for dialogue, Jacqueline Carey captures the obsessions of her generation as they discuss relationships, faith, betrayal, and clothes - all while preparing to attend a rather eventful wedding. New Yorker artist Kathy Osborn combines a detective's eye and an exquisite sensibility in her whimsical paintings, which complement the story by laying bare details that the text keeps secret.A delicious combination of Much Ado about Nothing and an Archie comic book, this urbane, witty novel is perfect for people who can't believe they're finally getting married and for people who swear they'll never get married.",
