  "description": "Graham Craig and Darren Sanford have been having an affair for nearly a year, a secret affair. Graham doesn't want anyone to know. When Darren's emotions become too deeply involved, Graham knows he has to break things off, even if it feels like he's cutting out his own heart.When his self-imposed separation from Darren becomes more than he can stand, Graham goes back to beg for another chance. He sets out to prove what they have together is special. Then Graham learns some terrifying news that changes everything. Someone has put a hit out on him and everyone he loves is in danger. Graham knows what he has to do. As much as it pains him, Graham tells Darren they are over, again. He knows that this time, Darren will never give him another chance, but at least the man will be alive to hate him. Graham goes into protective custody, along with other members of the drug task force he works on, and his family.But when well-meaning friends interfere, can Graham save the man he loves before an assassin's bullet gets him, or will he lose Darren before he has a chance to tell him—and the entire world—how much he loves the man?",
