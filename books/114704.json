  "description": "Sammy, a fourteen-year-old fugitive, accidentally discovers he has the powers of a Psion.  The war between the New World Government and the Continental American Government has taken its toll, not only on the two world superpowers, but also on the band of resistance fighters stuck between them. As Sammy's band of operatives and civilians struggle to restore freedom and end the war, the cracks of doubt and despair widen, and the walls of resolve crumble. But there is still cause for hope.  For years the resistance has floundered. Now, after Sammy's successful mission to the Amazon jungle, they finally have the data and weaponry needed to join the war against the CAG. Desperate to tip the scales in their favor, the resistance leadership decides on a bold joint offensive.  Meanwhile the Queen hunts Sammy, emboldened by her new anomalies, and certain that by killing him she can end the war in one final stroke. Both know their paths are destined to collide. And when they do, the world will be changed forever.",
