  "title": "Take Back Your Government",
  "description": "Before the Tea Party, the Coffee Party, the “Occupy” movement, Ross Perot or even the Libertarian Party, there was Robert Heinlein, a prophetic mastermind, calling to the people to organize in a grassroots movement to take back their government and to find an effective voice for their individual selves.Originally titled How to be a Politician, the book was written in 1946 based on Heinlein’s own political experiences, in particular his efforts on behalf of Upton Sinclair to become the governor of California and for Sinclair’s landmark effort to End Poverty in California (EPIC).Though Heinlein is best known for his science fiction work, he always had strong political views and often involved himself with various causes, including personally paying for advertisements in newspapers propagating his views.Here is a fascinating look, both historically and philosophically, at a great visionary’s take on the political landscape in the United States, and what each of us can do to better this country.",
