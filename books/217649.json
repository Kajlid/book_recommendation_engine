  "title": "Amy's Holiday Trivia: 84 Questions from the Class of '84",
  "description": "Amy's Holiday Trivia began on Facebook by Tyrone Area High School alum Amy Emenhiser. She would post holiday-related trivia questions to her timeline while her friends replied with their responses. Correct answers were rewarded with an enthusiastic reply of \"Ding, ding ding!!!\" After Amy's passing, the tradition of hosting the online Christmas trivia game was carried on by Amy's friend and classmate, Matt Swayne. This book is a collection of some of those questions and answers. Proceeds from the sale of this book benefits the Tyrone Area High School Class of 1984's Soar With '84 Memorial Scholarship Award in Tyrone, PA.",
