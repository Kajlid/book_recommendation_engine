  "title": "The Getting of Wisdom",
  "description": "The Getting of Wisdom has been described as a small gem of a work. Richardson said that she wrote it as 'light relief' between two major literary projects, Maurice Guest and The Fortunes of Richard Mahony. The Getting of Wisdom is possibly the author's best known and loved novel. The theme of the story is a young girl's coming-of-age as she collides with the wider world in the form of a middle class Australian boarding school. We must view the account as fiction rather than autobiography, but Richardson did admit that her story contained 'a very fair account of my doings at school'.",
