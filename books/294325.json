  "description": "Riel is a feisty gunsmith’s apprentice with dreams of becoming a Courtesan at the Royal Palacio. Coming from a humble military background with her doting older brother Constantino, this seems like a far-off dream—until a chance encounter with the Continental Ambassador Corrido and his renowned escort Awit at the annual Sagala. This meeting sets off a string of events leading Riel to discover that her past is more entwined in courtly affairs than she could have ever imagined. SAGALA is a Filipiniana fantasy story about gunslinging girls, overprotective older brothers, mythical ambassadors, and conniving courtesans against a backdrop of deceit and guns hidden under petticoats.",
