  "description": "In his stunningly intimate, highly anticipated follow up to Helium, Rudy Fransico has created a collection of poems that savor the day-to-day. Treating it as worship, turning it into an opportunity to plant new seeds of growth. Language so often fails us, but Fransico has found his way around this as he creates his own words for the things our language cannot give name to. \"Felenter (Noun) Definition: Someone who finds joy in things that people believe to be mundane.\" I'll Fly Away  Uses fascinating metaphors to convey common emotional states. These poems are an act of remembrance, and an act of believing that you dear reader, are a celebration waiting for the lights to come up.",
