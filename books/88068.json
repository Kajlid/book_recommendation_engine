  "description": "Singing vicars, baby whisperers, divas, deviants and more! Find out what really happens behind the closed doors of labour rooms, on inpatient wards, during outpatients clinics and inside homes. Special Deliveries is crammed full of stories about life changing moments that will appeal to anyone with an interest in pregnancy and childbirth.Identifying factors and events have been altered so that all the stories within this book, although based on elements of factual midwifery practice, have been fictionalised in order to maintain the anonymity and / or confidentiality of those the author cared for and worked with throughout the years.",
