  "description": "A family picks up a hitchhiker in the worst blizzard in living memory. It's a mistake. Brand is not who he seems, to the mother, the father or the daughter. He is something more, something they fear in their own ways, and soon after the thaw they are all seeing him again. They begin to learn things about themselves, and each other, which perhaps would be best left unknown. And they begin to realise other, more painful truths ... love blinds . Fear distorts . Hate misleads.Devil Walking by Tim Lebbon: A chapbook that came with the signed limited edition hardcover.",
