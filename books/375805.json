  "description": "Ernest Shackleton, one of the great Antarctic explorers in the early years of the 20th Century, set out on his expedition from a whaling station on the island of South Georgia. When, 18 months later, he returned to South Georgia without his ship, and with only two companions, the first people he saw were two whalers’ boys.In Shackleton’s words, from his account of the journey, South ...'Down we hurried, and when quite close to the station, we met two small boys, ten or twelve years old. I asked them where the manager’s house was and they did not answer. They gave us one more informing look and then they ran from us as fast as their legs would carry them.'Thor’s Tale is my account of the lives of those two boys, and of the effect Thor’s meeting with the explorers had on him.",
