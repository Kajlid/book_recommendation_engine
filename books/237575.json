  "description": "Birdie has come such a long way from the shy and introverted young woman who met Geth, Ronan, Matthew, and Teddy on that fateful day in Tokyo so long ago. She’s traveled the world, auditioned for music school, gotten engaged on a world-famous landmark, and been happier than she ever imagined she could be. She’s also endured more suffering and misery than she could have imagined existed in the world. She and Teddy have adjusted and come to terms with the harsh reality dealt to them, and moved on with their lives. Birdie and the boys have, at long last, come to the end of their youth, and are ready to embark on the journey of being adults, of living the rest of their lives. This is the last installment of the UK Crush series, and it is filled with the usual love and laughter and tears, weddings, and surprises. There are dogs, cats, toddlers, babies, honeymoons, and new romances to explore. Come along with Birdie and Teddy as they are finally able to come together and live in happiness and peace, and find the joy they have sought for so long.",
