But her dreams fade to black when her mobster-wanna-be boyfriend is executed at her feet.

Jase Tyler has one goal in life—to exact revenge on the Chicago mobsters who slaughtered his family. But when he rescues Allie, things begin to change. The last thing he wants is to be responsible for a woman who reminds him he has a soul, but there’s a price on her head, and he refuses to let the mob have her. Love and danger are now a packaged deal, and they can't have one without the other. The true test will come when she discovers what he's been keeping from her.",
