  "description": "Fired from a job he hated at a company he loved, videogame designer Paul Reynolds is drowning his sorrows in late-morning margaritas when he meets an alluring, pink-haired conwoman named Chloe. With her gang of techno-pirate friends, Chloe helps Paul not only take revenge on his former employers, but also extort a small fortune from them in the process. What more could a recently unemployed, over-worked videogame designer in Silicon Valley ask for? In return for Chloe’s help, Paul agrees to create counterfeit comic books for one of her crew’s criminal schemes. In the process finds himself drawn right into the center of their wild, seductive, underground world. He falls in for their fun loving, drug fueled \"off the grid\" lifestyle almost as fast as he falls head over heels for Chloe. Wary of the Crew’s darker side, but eager to impress both the girl and the gang, Paul uses his game design expertise to invent a masterful con of his own. If all goes according to plan, it will be one for the ages. But can he trust any of them, or is he the one who’s really being conned? Inspired by author Rick Dakan’s own eventful experiences in the videogame and comic book industries, \"Geek Mafia\", satisfies the hunger in all of us to buck the system, take revenge on corporate America, and live a life of excitement and adventure.",
