In route, an unrelenting urge compels her to stop at a ramshackle roadside antique shop where she buys a mysterious painting; one that draws her into it, transporting her into Andrew’s existence. The key to their escape from this endless time in a bewitched painting is true love. Time, space, and a hundred-year spell will challenge and reinforce what is truly meant to be.",
