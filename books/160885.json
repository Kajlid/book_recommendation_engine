  "title": "Unleashed Poems",
  "description": "\"It’s not always easy to see the light when you’re surrounded by darkness. Sometimes you have to make your own way out of the hole.\"A collection of 23 poems, all written in my youth. I wrote a majority of them when I was sixteen to seventeen years old. This was a really hard time in my life. It was a time of heartbreak, pain, love, betrayal and more. Writing these poems was a dose of sanity when the world around me was corrupting. It was my outlet when I couldn't breathe, and my safety rope when I was drowning. We don't get to pick our story in life. Usually the story picks you. So, with this release I am hoping to show inspiration. You can survive, and you can move on from your dark place.I dedicate this book to all the youth out there going through any type of struggle.",
