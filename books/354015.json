  "description": "Trauma nurse and part–time death investigator Molly Burke is having a pretty normal summer night in her St. Louis Emergency Department. And then a well-connected lawyer is wheeled in, victim of a suspected suicide. One suicide is bad. When one suicide grows to four in a matter of days, and all of them are lawyers, the trend stops being an oddity and becomes a real problem. Were the deaths really suicide? Why would a successful, hot young lawyer throw himself from a twentieth floor ledge? And what did the lawyers have in common besides the bar association? It is Molly’s job to find out.Suddenly, a puzzle becomes a threat. Molly’s investigation unearths secrets the wealthy and powerful don’t want exposed, and Molly is the one who suffers for it. If she doesn’t find the killer soon, she could well be the next victim.",
