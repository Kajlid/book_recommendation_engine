  "description": "\"How do you know it is the real thing. How do you know if it is really love?\" India Jane emails Erin. India Jane is feeling frustrated. She knows that there is a connection between herself and Joe, and yet their relationship isn't working out the way she thinks it should. Perhaps what she feels for him isn't \"love\" after all - whatever that is. Gathering her new friends around her and emailing Erin - who has boy problems of her own- she sets out to find the meaning of love for the first time in her life. Her exploration seems to get her nowhere, but just when she is in total despair, two fit boys surface - does this mean that Joe is now out of the picture?",
