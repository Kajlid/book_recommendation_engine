They have a house near the beach, family close by and each other. This should be the happily ever after of every god's dreams.But lately, strange misgivings have plagued Zack, a sense of something dark and powerful approaching. Since he can't pin down a source, he dismisses his instincts. Why borrow trouble? That is, until Michael begins to have strange mood swings and a dark stranger appears in the garden one night. Zack will need to battle time itself or lose both his hard-won peace and the love of his immortal life.",
