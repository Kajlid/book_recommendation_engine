  "description": "Flying the friendly skies has been more than just a job to me. It’s my home.Ten years ago I ran away from everything I’ve known and vowed never to return. That is until my flight is canceled due to weather, and I’m stuck in San Francisco. Fate is not on my side when I end up in an Uber rideshare with the one man I thought I’d never see again. Zack Hunt was my high school sweetheart, and the boy I walked away from without a note saying goodbye. Except, he’s no longer a boy. No, this man is gorgeous, intense, and heated at the sight of me. The anger searing off him is nothing compared to the way my heart pounds from seeing him again. Words are said. Feelings are crushed. But when he invites me into his bar to hash out our past, I find myself following him in, desperate for more. The line between past and present is blurred when Zack challenges me to a dare—come back home with him to see what I walked away from. Call me a glutton for punishment, but I do. Then I challenge him right back to live a day in my shoes. We drive home to rediscover the past We fly abroad to live in the present.When we stop moving, we realize we may never have a future. Layover Lover is a second chance romance, aligned by fate. Can two lost souls really find love again on a layover? Or do they need to keep flying?",
