Can it be the new mistress of Blackstone, just arrived from over the sea? Duncan has heard that pretty Miss Elizabeth Pudding is no more than a cook --- and she hails from a barbarous land called the Bronx. But she must learn the ways of a lady all the same --- and she must stay at Blackstone for six long months to inherit. 'Tis time enough to teach her --- and time enough to woo her ...AN ENCHANTING LADYBeth has seen the handsome specter from the day she crossed the threshold of Blackstone. Duncan MacDougal is a tall, translucent figure with black hair and piercing blue eyes. Yet a mist separates him from the land of the living ... a mist as strong as cold steel. It is said that only love can dissolve it --- and bring the man of her dreams to warm, breathing life.",
