  "description": "Born on Halloween, Leoanny is a young woman on a mission - to stretch her sexual deviancy as far outside morality as she possibly can. Her older, more experienced boss, Mr. Weller, is more than willing to help her achieve the goal. The exploration leads the couple down a dangerous path of destruction as they attempt to push each other's boundaries to new sensual heights. Afraid he will never be enough, Mr. Weller surprises Leoanny with a special VIP party invite to a brand new swinger's club from New Orleans. The catch? The party is hosted in a haunted house on Halloween night. Together Leoanny and Mr. Weller undergo an erotic adventure filled with sex, power, and mystery that threatens to drive them both insane.",
