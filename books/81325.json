  "description": "Humanity fell, time passed and the Dead still stalked the living, unable to quench the unnatural hunger that burned at the very core of their decaying shells. But among the survivors at a convent hidden deep in the Cornish countryside, a new and fragile hope had taken root, blossomed and grown. Had the mutated virus within Charlie really gifted them the true death they feared forever denied them? Had they finally been left to live in peace, unmolested and unhindered by those who had previously looked upon their existence with only jealousy and hate in their hearts? Only time would truly tell but when some of the survivors return from a foraging trip with worrying reports of burned buildings, ruined crops and an increase in the Dead roaming the countryside Liz, Imran, Phil and the others quickly realise they may just have their answer sooner than they had first hoped.",
