  "title": "A Shot of Faith (to the Head): Be a Confident Believer in an Age of Cranky Atheists",
  "description": "A Shot of Faith to the Head provides Christians with clear and powerful ways to address atheism's most ardent proponents, and it shows that believers can remain calm, confident, and effective in the face of contemporary attacks on faith. But more than just offering defensive tools, the author provides the Christian with powerful means for launching offensive strikes on unbelief. After providing the reader with an update from the front in the war between faith and unbelief, the book presents a fundamental lesson about the very nature of evidence, a lesson extracted from the recent revolution in Christian thought. The book then turns to a handful of the most important specific issues in the debate between belief and unbelief: the surprising implications of naturalism (the view that only the natural world of space and time exists) the universe's remarkable mathematical design the necessary religious nature of science the possibility of good and evil in a purely physical world With this information, Stokes arms readers with the weapons to go on the offensive against unbelief and to be able to use these with kindness for evangelistic purposes.",
