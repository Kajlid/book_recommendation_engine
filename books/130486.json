  "description": "The compelling conclusion of Gene Brewer's acclaimed K-PAX trilogy. The Manhattan Institute of Psychiatry: Prot is back, and patient Robert has returned to his catatonic state. This visit to Earth, prot promises, will be his last. Psychiatrist Gene Brewer is racing against the clock to unravel the mystery of his famous patient, who hails from the planet K-PAX, and to enlist his help in recalling Robert to life. But excitement turns to hysteria as prot's charm and influence on the other patients, and on the world, exert themselves. Prot now claims that he will take one hundred beings back with him to his idyllic home planet. And everyone is clamoring to go. Witty and enlightening, the trilogy also includes K-PAX, which was made into a major motion picture starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, and K-PAX II: On a Beam of Light. The author lives in New York City.",
