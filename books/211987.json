  "description": "Not so lucky anymore…  Civilization is on the brink of crumbling—and this time not just due to the zombie apocalypse. The roads have become dangerous, and what havens have been established are no longer safe. Murmurs of unrest—or maybe even a brewing civil war—are getting loud. No longer are zombies the only thing preying on those that think to brave the world outside the settlements. Yet as grave as things are getting, this is not the main issue that is plaguing Nate’s mind. He has bigger fish to fry.  Books in the series (so far): #1: Incubation #2: Outbreak #3: Escalation #4: Extinction #5: Resurgence",
