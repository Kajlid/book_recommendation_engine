  "description": "When Farhad discovers the bodyguard known as Bulletproof, he recognizes Devron for exactly what he is- an immature gargoyle. Unable to bring such a youth into the fold without his full height, power, and armaments, Farhad guides the whelp into the Scylla, an organization of supernatural s charged with protecting Earth. Praying that Devron will grow stronger with every day, Farhad can only hope that Devron becomes strong enough to endure what is to come.  Devron understands little of what and who he is. He is dependent on Farhad's guidance, but when it comes so sparsely, he suspects that there may be a grave reason behind the elder's avoidance. With the sparks of attraction igniting every time they meet, Devron knows that Farhad is far more than a tutor. How much may be more than both of them can handle!",
