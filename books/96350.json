  "description": "Tattoos is a story about finding hope even when the world feels hopeless. It is a testament to all those who have survived the unsurvivable, lived the unliveable, pushed through just one more day and lived every precious moment of their life knowing that life is a gift. Seventeen-year-old Marilee Mackie has everything going for her, beauty, money and a bright future. But when she’s diagnosed with cancer her world falls apart. Instead of finishing her senior year she begins the fight of her life. Nineteen-year-old Jax, an enigmatic hospital orderly, lives on the Strip, the proverbial other side of the tracks. With his sleeves of tattoos and rocker look, he’s the kind of bad boy that Marilee has always steered clear of. But when Marilee’s illness strips her bare, she searches for meaning in what little she has left of her life. And just when Marilee losses hope in her future, Jax steps in and helps her find purpose, a reason to live another day. From devastation the Peace Project is born. With Marilee’s money and Jax’s knowledge of the Strip, the teenagers embark on an unforgettable journey. Where Marilee learns that happiness is a choice, small acts of kindness can change lives forever, that a little good goes a long way, and that love can grow even in the darkest places of you life. But especially that rainbows can follow storms.",
