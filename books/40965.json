  "description": "The refugees from Fervor have made their escape from the island with Elliot Masterson’s help, only to find that there is nobody waiting on the Mainland to lead them to the sanctuary of Elevation as promised. Now they have to scramble to make their own way there, unassisted. At the same time, Elliot and the ex-Control, Royce, remain on Fervor with the Languorite, searching for Elliot’s nephew, additional children yearning for escape, and more answers to the puzzle that the scholars have created via their strange experiment. Will Sam and his friends reach Elevation and discover what has become of the latents, while evading capture by the scholars? Will Elliot find Malcolm and help others to reach freedom from Fervor, with minimal casualties? Only time will see if they achieve their objectives and eventually manage to reunite. It turns out, however, that time is not on their side.",
