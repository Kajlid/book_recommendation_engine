  "description": "Rules for Seduction:​1. Make sure the boy you are going to seduce is there when you try to seduce him.2. Make sure when you are waiting in his room to seduce him, a totally hot stranger does not walk in on you.3. Make sure to leave the light on, so you don’t mistake the stranger for the one you were waiting for.4. Never see that totally hot stranger ever again even if he was the best kisser you’ve ever had and his incredible body is like something out of an erotic fairytale.5. Don’t fall in love with the self-centered, pompous, unbelievably sexy stranger.Sadly, Mandy has broken all of these rules. Mandy has a plan to move on from her cheating ex by seducing her best friend’s brother. Instead, she mistakenly seduces a stranger with a body from an erotic fairy tale. For Mandy, an art major who only paints in black and white, Brandon adds a dangerous splash of color to her life. Brandon Gage is used to getting what he wants, so he won't give up his pursuit of her despite her telling him she's been in love with his roommate Jake since high school. After a sports injury, he becomes her patient at the health clinic where she works and hatches his own plan to make Mandy forget about Jake and fall for him. He soon learns that pretending to date her only makes him want her more. Who will be the winner in “Operation Mandy”?",
