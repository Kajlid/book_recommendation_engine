  "title": "The Innocence of Father Brown",
  "description": "Chesterton portrays Father Brown as a short, stumpy Roman Catholic priest, with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella, and an uncanny insight into human evil. \"How in Tartarus,\" cried Flambeau, \"did you ever hear of the spiked bracelet?\" -- \"Oh, one's little flock, you know!\" said Father Brown, arching his eyebrows rather blankly. \"When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were three of them with spiked bracelets.\" Not long after he published Orthodoxy, G. K. Chesterton moved from London to Beaconsfield, and met Father O'Connor. O'Connor had a shrewd insight to the darker side of man's nature and a mild appearance to go with it--and together those came together to become Chesterton's unassuming Father Brown. Chesterton loved the character, and the magazines he wrote for loved the stories. The Innocence of Father Brown was the first collection of them, and it's a great lot of fun.",
