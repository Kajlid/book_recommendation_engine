  "description": "One of the key comics of the 1980s - along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns - Howard Chaykin's American Flagg! was a massive-selling hit, breaking new ground in comics storytelling and influencing a generation of writers and artists. America, 2031. TV star Reuben Flagg is drafted to protect the citizens of Chicago as a Plexus Ranger, having pretended to be one onscreen. The inexperienced Flagg must tackle an America blighted by a biased and oppressive media, dubious 'wars', widespread political corruption and environmental disaster...Never-before-collected, this bitingly prescient satirical series is an all-time classic. This debut volume features an introduction by Michael Chabon (Wonder Boys).",
