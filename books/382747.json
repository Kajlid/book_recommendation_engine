  "title": "Beijing Doll",
  "description": "Banned in China for its candid exploration of a young girl's sexual awakening yet widely acclaimed as being \"the first novel of 'tough youth' in China\" ( Beijing Today ), Beijing Doll cuts a daring path through China's rock-and-roll subculture. This cutting edge novel -- drawn from the diaries the author kept throughout her teenage years -- takes readers to the streets of Beijing where a disaffected generation spurns tradition for lives of self expression, passion, and rock-and-roll. Chun Sue's explicit sensuality, unflinching attitude towards sex, and raw, lyrical style break new ground in contemporary Chinese literature.",
