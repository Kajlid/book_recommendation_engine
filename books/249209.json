  "description": "Running away has always been something I'm good at. I've run far away from home and back again thinking that each time would be the last. But things are a lot different lately. I've learned that tides turn, seasons change, and sometimes, people do too. I haven't seen Hoyt Blackburn in a decade because I was so convinced he wasn't worth my time anymore. I guess this is where I've changed since I found out that his execution is one of those inevitable things that life handed him. I can't ever remember him being a bad man, yet I can't shake that something isn't right about what's happening to him. Maybe it's because I miss him.Maybe it's because I wanna lay eyes on the man one last time. Will he remember me? Will he even care? I don't know; the only thing I can honestly say for sure is that there are still some secrets we have left between us that have to be spoken before he draws his last breath. Otherwise, when that day comes, they may have just killed me too.",
