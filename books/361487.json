  "title": "The God We Never Knew: Beyond Dogmatic Religion to a More Authentic Contemporary Faith",
  "description": "How to have faith—or even think about God—without having to stifle modern rational thought is one of the most vital challenges facing many of us today. Marcus J. Borg, author of the bestselling Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time , traces his personal spiritual journey to the discovery of an authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God. In a compelling, readable way, he leads us from the distant, authoritarian God of our childhood to an equally powerful, dynamic adult image of God—\"the beyond in our midst,\" the life spirit that is within us and all around us—that reconciles faith with science, history, critical thinking, and religious pluralism.",
