  "description": "I wasn’t supposed to fall for him.I officially cut boys out of my life.They’re untrustworthy, vicious, and cruel.So, if you told me this past summer that PacNorth University's notorious bad boy was going to become my dark knight, I wouldn’t have believed you.I’m not the same reckless, carefree girl I was three months ago.That girl was naïve.That girl was stupid.That girl was destroyed.I learned my lessons the hard way.I’m still picking up the pieces of the girl I was before.And, I know better than to fall for a sinful smile on a pretty face.So I never should have given him so much as a second glance.Gabriel Herrera can’t be my anything.Only, he tells me I'm his everything.But putting my trust in the boy with questionable intentions is the kind of devastation I may not survive.What am I supposed to do?",
