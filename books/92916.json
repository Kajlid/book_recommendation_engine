  "description": "Brooke Daniels lives life with her head down. This isn't because she's shy, quiet or lonely, she's actually the exact opposite. They say everyone has a secret, Brooke has more than one and will do whatever she can to keep them hidden, even if that means wearing clothes far too big for her and not making any friends.So when the campus playboy, Tucker Lloyd decides to be Brooke's new best friend, everything changes.No longer aware of who her real friends are but perfectly aware of who her enemies are, Brooke struggles to find balance in her new life.Add in two best friends, one who wants Brooke to have fun, the other too overprotective and you have a recipe for disaster.The girl who used to move around unnoticed now finds herself in the spotlight for more reasons than one. It seems everyone wants a piece of her and the ultimate question is...Who do you trust?",
