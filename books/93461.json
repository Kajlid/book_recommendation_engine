  "title": "The Panty Thief of Bridgeport",
  "description": "Its springtime in Chicago 1995 and someone has been prowling the working class/southside neighborhood of Bridgeport stealing women's panties. Jack Squat, a 20 something with a mysterious mechanism that is biorythmically integrated into his very spine has been gliding cautiously through his inner city life until he falls in love and has his heart broken by a beautiful ad executive named Samantha. When his 'mechanism' malfunctions at the worst possible time, Jack is forced to engage in a battle against this mysterious biological system of pulleys and levers that dwells within the depths of his own marrow. In the complex emotional game of cat and mouse that ensues it becomes obvious that what is at stake here is not only Jack's sense of self-worth, but his very soul.
