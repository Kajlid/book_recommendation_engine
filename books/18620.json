  "description": "The Day Satan Called is Bill Scott's account of an excruciating 18-month period in his life.Out of Christian love he and his wife invited a young lady who was demon possessed and the member of an active satanic network into their home. They prayed the sinner's prayer with her and believed that they could help redeem someone who had witnessed and experienced unimaginable rituals and abuses. What happened instead were death threats and the loss of their home as a sanctuary. Voices. Threats. Objects falling and moving. Strange visitors and callers. A loving church falling into turmoil. And yes the voice of Satan. Every day was filled with the dread of nightfall. Once you've invited someone filled with demons that aren't leaving her into your home what do you next? Where do you send her? How do you protect yourself and your family? What do you do after she's finally gone but the demons haven't left? This is the account of a terrifying and incredible phenomenon. But ultimately, it is a testament to the power of God's love, even over evil spirits.",
