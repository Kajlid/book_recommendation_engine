  "description": "See Jane Run… When realtor Jane Harper dated Dick months ago, something was missing. Even now, she knows he was holding back, but what, she has no idea. It doesn’t matter. He’s in her past, and she’s looking for what she truly wants—a Dom. See Dick… Afraid to scare Jane with his real nature, Dr. Dick Anderson hid his dominant side, hoping to ease her into his lifestyle. Little did he know that what she really wanted was the very thing he’d needed most to give her. Jane has been a bad, bad girl… And now, Dick is ready to take care of that problem. Carefully, he maneuvers her to his home, under the guise of wanting to sell it. Jane soon discovers his BDSM playroom hidden behind a lock and key. Before she knows it, Dick has her over his knee and she’s headed down a road toward pleasure she never imagined, with a man she never expected to deliver.",
