  "title": "Wellington: A Personal History",
  "description": "A brilliant general, remembered most for his defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Wellington was also a politician of commanding presence. Elected Prime Minister in 1827, he was an influential adviser to kings and queens, and became deeply involved in all the major scandals of the time, delighting in mixing himself up in other people’s affairs. Celebrated for his sardonic humor and savage rages which alternated with irresistible charm, he concealed a deep humanity behind a veneer of aloofness that gained him the sobriquet, “the Iron Duke.” Filled with fresh insights on aspects of Wellington’s life and character, Christopher Hibbert has shown once again why he is one of our finest popular historians.",
