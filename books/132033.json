  "description": "A hybrid and a wolf shifter join forces across time, across miles against a threat of unthinkable proportions.  Luke tells Kelsey she isn’t his type, but who is he trying to convince—her or himself?  As for Kelsey, she has to admit the hybrid definitely makes her heart flutter and her knees weak, but she knows better than to get involved with a heart-breaker. And she is sure Luke is a heart-breaker.  Besides, they’ve got other problems on their hands as they join a team of otherworldly beings working together to fight the Purple Haze. Will their power be enough against the arcane threat?",
