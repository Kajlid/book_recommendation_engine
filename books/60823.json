  "description": "Divorcee Lisa Fontana, 35, longs for a relationship with someone strong and dominant. When she hears from the teens on her block that rugged Russian immigrant Sergey can get “anything you want,” she asks him to find an appropriate mate for her. But what happens when she discovers that Sergey, as dominant as they come, decides tame Lisa and claim her for his own?\"From the time I lifted my gaze to the second-story window, where the silhouette of a man stood motionless, backlit. He appeared as a shadow, but even my vantage point I could sense the firmness of his broad, square shoulders. I grasped the wrought iron rail of the fence. The man stripped off his shirt and stretched up his arms in a yawn, his back arching like a panther taking pleasure in the strength of its own dangerous body.\"Total 15,000 words",
