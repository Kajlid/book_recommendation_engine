  "description": "The fall of the eleventh city was what shook the earth but it was mankind who brought the world to its knees. In a world over stretched in population and resources, the skies were meant to be the greatest beacon for innovation and freedom. The flying cities were constructed in a time of need driven by hope, and fuelled by ambition. The end results; however, cast an unintentional shadow upon those still making a home below. While the world above flourished the surface where mankind originated decayed into wasteland. This is a story of a wanderer name Wallflower, a package named lace and their journey to move on and confront the echoes of mankind's past. Out there the best way to solve a disagreement is with a good old fashioned bullet. Up in the skies or on the ground, it doesn't matter, one can't clean up a mess without making a bigger one first.",
