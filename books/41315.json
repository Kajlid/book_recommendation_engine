  "title": "Mousie: The Diary of a Coon Cat Family",
  "description": "Mousie is for all ages and to quote my dear, deceased friend, photographer Bert Andrews,\"It's a masterpiece and I hate cats.\" Bert was very allergic to cats but he adored the book, in fact, he rode past his stop on a crowded NYC bus while reading it. (Look up Bert on Wikipedia.) This is the true story of a Coon cat family; the kitties created every moment in the diary. I observed and wrote it down over a period of 8 years.It is illustrated throughout with photos, cartoon-art and poems....yes, illustrative poems. Each kitty has a unique Orie is a gorgeous, loving mom; Duffie, a paranoid-schizophrenic and Mousie is a magical, creative, wonder-boy, whose struggle against cancer is awe inspiring. Mousie has meaning for anyone struggling against a life threatening illness. The spirit of joy he communicates up to the moment of his death is truly extraordinary. Toddlers love Mousie when it is read to them. Multi-levels of consciousness make it appealing to a wide range of readers. Adults find sophisticated humor, metaphysical considerations and multi-thematic developments, while juveniles are fascinated with the non-stop adventures and antics of the threesome. Everybody loves Mousie; you can't help it.",
