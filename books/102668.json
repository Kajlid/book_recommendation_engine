  "description": "Nikki and Michael have been on their own since they were six, scraping by in the worst slums the crippled country has to offer. Fighting for scraps in the free zones of one city after another, most kids couldn’t survive without help.Nikki and Michael aren’t most kids.As twins, they’re as close to identical in appearance as brother sister can be, but polar opposites in every other way. The one thing they have in common is a unique power that’s made two malnourished teenagers the go-to regulators for any zoner with food or lodging to trade. Thanks to careful work on Michael’s part, and blind luck on Nikki’s, they’ve managed to stay under the radar despite their incredible ability—until now. When a high-profile job puts them on display like never before, Nikki and Michael must run from more than just the local cops. They find themselves hunted by the very forces that once broke the nation, forces desperate to control the twin's opposing destinies—one of them could save the world…the other could bring it crashing down.",
