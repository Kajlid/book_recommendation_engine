  "description": "Is this a children's book?Well... not immediately.You buy a copy for your child nowand you give it to him on his 70th birthday.\nWith his unmistakable rhymes and signature illustration style, Dr. Seuss creates a classic picture-book ode to aging in You're Only Old Once! On a visit to \"the Golden Years Clinic on Century Square for Spleen Readjustment and Muffler Repair,\" readers will laugh with familiar horror at the poking and prodding and testing and ogling that go hand in hand with the dreaded appellation of \"senior citizen.\"Though Dr. Seuss is known for his peerless work in books for children, this comical look at what it's like to get older is ideal for Seuss fans of advanced years. In his own words, this is \"a book for obsolete children.\" A perfect gift for retirement, birthdays, and holidays!\nDr. Seuss\n and his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, have been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat' (1957), and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.Edition MSRP: $17⁹⁹ U.S. / $20⁹⁹ CAN.
