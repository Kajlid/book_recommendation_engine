  "description": "Walker Rhodes has never been the typical rock star—one who is happy with meaningless hookups. That’s because he’s been hiding a secret from his bandmates for years. Sadie Emerson knew it was risky to open her heart to Walker, but the man was too hard to resist. And now that she’s fallen in love with Walker, all Sadie wants is to be closer to him. But there’s one small problem. Beck. Neither Sadie nor Walker have shared the truth of their relationship with her brother. Beck has always been protective of his little sister, so it’s only natural for them to fear his reaction. The pair refuse to give one another up, but they’re both worried that when Beck finds out, Walker will have to choose between the woman he loves and the band he calls his family.",
