Did you mistake his forced sincerity for love?Every kiss will fade in time.Every memory will fade in time.Every smile, every teardrop, every wound—it’ll all dry up—in time.But every lie? That shit only gets bigger and more devastating with time.In time... I’lol learn to let him go, but not without leaving my bitter mark on him like he carelessly ruined my soul with his cold, rough touch.In time I’ll learn to forgive this that have wronged me as savagely as they did.In time I’ll rise from the ashes and sour.In time the Blue Boys will learn to take me seriously come hell or high water.But for right now, we’re in the final blue act, playing for hateful truths—our audience of two faced snakes cheering for the hate and the breaking.Resentment, toxic anger, lies and betrayal are the rules of the game.The price? A bitter ending.What will break? My hate or your heart?Because baby, love means absolutely nothing when it falls on broken, shattered souls like ours.",
