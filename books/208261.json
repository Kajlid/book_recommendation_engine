  "title": "My Job: Real People at Work Around the World",
  "description": "MY Real People at Work Around the World is a compilation of vivid first-person accounts of people in unique jobs from a diverse range of cultures and sectors. Never before has such a collection of stories been gathered. Building upon the legacy of Studs Terkel's 1970s bestseller Working , MY JOB goes global and updated, reflecting the daily struggles and successes of working storytellers in their own distinct voices. MY JOB explores the dignity, identity, economic viability, and inherent challenges of each occupation, asking such provoking questions How has the definition and notion of a job shifted in recent years? How does one land in a particular job, and what causes one to flourish or flounder in it? How does our job shape our sense of identity?  As communications and social media, technology and trade, transform our world into a global village, readers are exposed to life and work in other places. Our awareness of countries and cultures far beyond home leads to a natural interest in them. This is a pivotal moment in which geography still greatly impacts employment; yet the experiences of others, even in distant countries, are more accessible today than ever before. MY JOB makes clear the connections between us as global citizens united in the human experience of work. Stay tuned for   MY More People at Work Around the World, Book 2, to come in February 2019.
