  "description": "Christiana's first short story collection introduces you to the life of women who love women. She caters to every label and “no label” across the LGBTQ spectrum: studs, femmes, pillow princesses, no labels, butches, FTM's, bisexuals etc. Meet them all between one cover as your eyes explore fictional stories that will make you laugh and cry and maybe even a little bit angry from heated arguments, fist fights, struggles with religion, heartbreak, closet cases, deception, and passionate sex scenes. Nothing is left to the imagination. There is something for every lesbian from every walk of life.",
