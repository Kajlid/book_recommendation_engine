  "title": "Music: What Happened?",
  "description": "Scott Miller has released more than a dozen albums with his bands Game Theory and the Loud Family, and his music has been described as \"a cross between Alex Chilton, James Joyce, and the Electric Prunes\" (Stereo Review) and \"smart, funny, and instantly memorable\" (Rolling Stone). In this book, Miller writes about each of the past 53 years in popular music-1957-2009- via countdown song lists, blending the perspectives of a serious musician, a thoughtful critic, and an all-devouring music fan. Miller not only tells you why he loves particular songs, but also what was going on in the musical world in which they competed to be heard.",
