  "title": "Lovers' Lane: the Hall-Mills Mystery",
  "description": "The perfect ingredients for a juicy scandal and fascinating investigation are presented in this masterful graphic novel retelling of an unsolved murder from the 1920s. On the evening of September 14, 1922, Reverend Edward Hall and Mrs. Eleanor Mills take a stroll in the New Brunswick town park. Shots are heard and two days later their bodies are found lying neatly next to each other, love letters strewn around them, and a scarf obscures the fact that Mrs. Mills’ throat has been slit. The two had been involved in an affair and the press hungrily devours the story. No evidence is sufficient to lead to an indictment, so the mystery intensifies with conjecture: Was this a dual suicide? Was this perpetrated by a jealous rival? Four years later the case reopens due to new evidence indicting the reverend’s wife, but she is an upstanding member of the community who vehemently denies that her husband ever had an affair. This is a tragic story told with beguiling relish and expert illustration in a distinctive style fitting of the era.",
