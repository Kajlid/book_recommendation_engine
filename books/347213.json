Meanwhile, Mrs. Berry, in the nearby village of Caxley, faces an equally eventful Christmas Eve in The Christmas Mouse when she is awakened by two unexpected a mouse and a bedraggled runaway boy, both taking refuge from a winter storm. Both stories are resolved in Miss Read's comforting style, as warm as the glowing coals of the cottage fire and the spirit of Christmas itself.

As in other books by Miss Read, this volume is complemented by John S. Goodall's delightful line drawings.",
