  "description": "Still bruised from his rough pegging by the anarcho-syndicalist aviatrix Miss Olga Komenevna, Archie Duntisbourne is compelled to visit the family home of his new fiance Miss Alyssa Bucklesham, where he discovers that his mother-in-law-to-be holds even more extreme views as to the discipline required by the male sex than her daughter. There are spankings and floggings galore, and Archie is required to take an oral exam to provide that he is a suitable partner for the Bucklesham heiress.",
