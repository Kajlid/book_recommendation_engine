Once she’s captured, she’ll be examined and then eliminated.But Arista’s struggle is compounded when she learns of the mysterious Quantum Gates: portals that can take anyone across the planet in an instant. Are these gateways her key to escape? Perhaps they even hold the answers to finding out where she came from.Or do they hide an even more sinister secret?SINGULAR is a pulse-pounding adventure set in a world not far from our own, controlled by mysterious forces and where everyone is either unaware of the system, or rebelling against it.",
