  "description": "Dear Author,This Dom is gruff and grumpy. Heâ€™s rough around the edges and hard to please. Many even say he is too rough on his subs. What is his story? Is he too far gone to find love? And will his love be predictable in any way?Photo Description: Dom Daddy: Muscular, in shape, hairy bear of a man who is obviously very dominant. Our gentleman is a little rough around the edges. He wears a cock ring, has a Prince Albert piercing, and a pierced left nipple. He is wearing leather arm bands which partially cover tattoos on both upper arms. With his head lowered, he appears to be avoiding the camera, or is there more to it?This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
