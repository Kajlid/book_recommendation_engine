  "description": "In the new Max Blake Mystery “Raptor’s Ridge,” the mild-mannered college professor becomes an unlikely candidate to hunt down the killer of the town’s richest man and his movie star paramour. And it quickly becomes apparent that every woman on the West Coast has become someone’s idea of the most dangerous game.Called in because of a chance encounter years before, the former newspaper reporter-turned-professor and part-time private detective is forced to form unusual and sometimes dodgy alliances as he investigates the vicious killings with the city’s police chief. The alliance is even more complicated because of a past history between Max and the chief, and the fact that the leading candidates for the murders are members of the chief's own police force.The trail winds through the incredible mansion called Raptor’s Ridge, through the streets and alleyways of the Oregon's state capitol, and eventually spills into the state’s beautiful but deadly High Desert. When the killer is eventually cornered and violence unexpectedly explodes, the novel’s protagonist must use all of his wits and daring knowhow to remain alive during a deadly night of terror ... and eventual reckoning. Fans of the Max Blake Westerns series will rejoice in finding this new, thoroughly modern Max, the great-great grandson and namesake of the legendary federal marshal.",
