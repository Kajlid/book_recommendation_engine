  "title": "The Ghost of Blackstoke Manor",
  "description": "Blackstoke Manor has been empty for years which has been great fodder for urban legend. They say the ghost of Ebenezer Blackstoke roams the halls, desperate to protect his manor from unwanted guests...  The gruesome stories of \"death by ghost\" don't seem to affect Will Lloyd who drags his wife and brother-in-law to investigate the house.  If the derelict house wasn't creepy enough, an old friend of Ebenezer Blackstoke turns up to confirm the tales of terror.  As they finally decide to hot foot it home, they realise their car has been vandalised, leaving them no option but to wait in the house for the rather reluctant police to arrive...  A black comedy in two acts",
