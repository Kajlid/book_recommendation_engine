  "description": "It’s Alice Mongoose’s first Christmas in Hawaii. She misses her family and is resigned to spending the holiday alone. Alistair Rat would love to spend Christmas with his best friend Alice, but he’s afraid that Alice has more exciting things to do than spend time with a solitary rat. Fortunately, the outspoken Cordelia Canetoad knows just what to do! The Alice Mongoose and Alistair Rat stories are classic tales of friendship, beloved to this day by children of all ages. Alice Mongoose’s recent renaissance may be credited to the efforts of Mary Pfaff’s granddaughter, Dorothy Pfaff. A new generation of parents and children have come to appreciate the books’ unselfconscious multiculturalism, sensible life lessons, and positive main characters.This reissue of the Alice Mongoose stories is faithful to the original printing and in keeping with Dorothy’s memories of her grandmother reading to her.Also by Mary Pfaff:Alice Mongoose and Alistair Rat in HawaiiAlice Mongoose and Alistair Rat have a RestaurantAlice Mongoose, Alistair Rat, and the Big Sign",
