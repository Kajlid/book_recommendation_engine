  "description": "Kallen has the opportunity to go back to his realm and bring Xandra with him. The catch? Xandra will be putting her life on the line to stop a rebellion and save the life of the biological father she hates. She has the power to do it, just not the control. Good thing she has him to help keep the collateral damage from getting too high.The bigger catch? He is now going to have to reveal to her the secret he thought died when he chose to stay in the Cowan realm. It just may be Kallen who ends up needing protection. From Xandra.***** Reader Message *****Blood Lines: Kallen’s Tale is meant to be read after Blood Lines. This is a companion book that gives the reader a look into Kallen’s mind as he and Xandra face the dangers that await them in the Fairy realm. In an effort to avoid as much redundancy as possible, I have condensed some scenes, focusing less on Xandra and more on Kallen. This could cause confusion if this book is read first.I hope you enjoy this look into Kallen’s world.",
