  "title": "Frederick Douglass",
  "description": "“A masterpiece….[W]ill rightfully assume its place as the standard biography of a truly great figure in the nation’s past.” ― New York Newsday Former slave, orator, journalist, autobiographer; revolutionary on behalf of a just America, Frederick Douglass was a towering figure, at once consummately charismatic and flawed. His Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) galvanized the antislavery movement and is one of the truly seminal works of African-American literature. In this masterful and compelling biography, William S. McFeely captures the many sides of Douglass―his boyhood on the Chesapeake; his self-education; his rebellion and rising expectations; his marriage, affairs, and intense friendships; his bitter defeat and transcendent courage―and recreates the high drama of a turbulent era.",
