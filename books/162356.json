You sign not only the debt agreement, but another—one that makes me your master until your last breath is taken. You do that, and I’ll give you this.” Nila Weaver’s family is indebted. Stolen, taken, and bound not by monsters but by an agreement written over six hundred years ago, she has no way out. She belongs to Jethro as much as she denies it.
