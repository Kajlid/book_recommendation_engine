  "title": "The Sutler of Petersburg",
  "description": "In 1864, four young soldiers in the Irish Brigade are wounded on the battlefield at Petersburg. On the outskirts of the field is the sutler, a crafty salesman glad to relieve the soldiers of their few remaining coins. He is a giant of a man, frightening in his demeanor, and his name is Tucker D. He carries a gray kitten on his shoulders and instead of taking money from them, he offers help. As he tends to their needs, the sutler forms a bond with the young soldiers, yet they wonder what price this mysterious man will ask for his help. He is, after all, a sutler willing to do most anything for a fee. Nothing he offers is truly free of charge.",
