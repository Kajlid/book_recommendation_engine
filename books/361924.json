  "description": "I live in snapshots and polaroid pictures. Everything will be exposed in time - hues, textures, and motivations like ghosts of the present tense. These memories are embroidered and tinted, complete with awkward pauses and distracted glances but my words are genuine. It's time to let it go. In the end, none of it really matters. It's the way people still try in the face of this fact that makes them so beautiful. We scream our lungs out to feel alive but let's try to speak in whispers, just this once.",
