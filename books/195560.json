  "description": "They say your first love is unforgettable, but Allison Southby would love to forget. Thankfully, she’s always had her work to keep her mind off her non-existent love life. But when her boss and mentor dies mysteriously, and a rival company threatens to steal their customers, her focus should be on preserving her mentor’s legacy and the company she loves…and yet, she can’t keep her mind—or her hands—off her late boss’s son, Adam. Who just happens to be the same man who left her heart in pieces when he ran from her bed after a single night together, and has kept her at arm’s length ever since. Detective Adam Byrnes needs to get back to the life he’s built in Phoenix. Sure, it’s far from his family, but it also keeps him away from Allison…and temptation. But between the questions surrounding his father’s death, and keeping Allison safe, he can’t seem to leave the city of Chicago. With danger swirling around them, can they find the love they once shared?",
