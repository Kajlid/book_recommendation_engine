  "description": "Pulled from her bed by an early morning phone call from her boss, local police reporter Annie Seymour finds herself at a crime scene staring at the naked body of a Yale student. Just the thing her bosses and readers don't want to know about - especially when Annie learns the girl was a student by day and a high priced escort by night.Stonewalled by her cop boyfriend and tailed by overeager but incompetent cub report Dick Whitfield, Annie stumbles onto a network of corruption that even her own mother seems to be involved in. But Annie isn't the only one investigating - a Frank Sinatra look-alike who used to be the biggest geek in Annie's high school is hot on the trail as well. And to top it all off, New Haven, Connecticut is being infiltrated by a parade of ceramic cows. Pulled off the story by her boss, Annie must discover the truth - before she becomes the next big headline.",
