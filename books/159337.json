The isolated valley of Glenn Ceoch is at peace once more but those who survived still bear the scars of that struggle.  Now, new dangers threaten the settlement.  The warrior Liath Luachra has discovered troubling signs of strangers in the surrounding wilderness. Disgraced druid Bodhmhall fears a fresh attempt to abduct her talented nephew. A summons from the fortress Dún Baoiscne sets them both on a perilous traverse of the Great Wild where enemies, old and new, await them. And Muirne has returned to reclaim her son.  Come what may, there will be blood.",
