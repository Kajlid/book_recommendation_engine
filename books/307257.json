Under pressure from a new, more deadly virus, a team of Arctan elites is at work to create the ultimate, computer-connected, Augmented Human. Will they be done in time to help head off the pandemic? Blackmail, sex-slavery, abduction, murder. Will the power of Arctan be turned to evil? How far will either side go to win? Will the pandemic make it pointless? A Final Reminder describes a future coming soon to a reality near you. Ride with a rich cast of characters on a roller coaster of innovation, technology, despicable crime and thrills! Including the brain-machine interface, computer surveillance, sex-trafficking, Big Data, enterprise software, data analytics, space-based communications, international terrorism, Korean cuisine, the dive bar scene in Mission, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, pharmaceutical sleep learning, Polish soul food, hair-raising Ho Chi Minh City traffic, and motorcycle chases through Vietnamese sidewalk restaurants. When you’re not learning, you’ll be dodging bullets, lasers and humorous zingers.",
