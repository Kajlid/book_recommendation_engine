  "title": "Kenny G Must Die!!: A Satire About Music... And Zombies",
  "description": "What do you do if a co-worker won't stop listening to Kenny G all day? If you're Aliester Crewley, you do the obvious thing: You raise John Coltrane as a zombie to kill him. But what if Kenny G won't stay dead? And worse, what if all of this mystical meddling accidentally starts the apocalypse? One thing is for sure, it'll take more than the help of Keith Richards (the most powerful magician on earth) to stop Britanny Spears and her army of flying monkeys from turning earth into a pile of rubble. Don't be fooled into thinking Kenny G Must Die!! is just a funny bit of satire. It could, in fact, be a brilliantly disguised piece of prophecy. Think about it- how can music that bad be so popular?",
