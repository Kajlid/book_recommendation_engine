  "description": "A fine silk custom top-hat is missing from a crooked lawyer who was poisoned by lead alcohol in the Roman theater at the close of the second act, 9:55 pm. Inspector Richard Q, sneezing snuff; a thin, multi-faced, small \"Old Man\"; and the Inspector's large writer son Ellery, puffing cigarettes, investigate. They start with maps of theater, the victim's bedroom, and a list of names appended with flavorful commentary: the finder of the body is \"cranially a brachycephalic\", and Dolly \"a lady of reputation\". The flavor of 1929 costume and culture, with evening attire de rigeur, and hip flasks full of bootleg liquor.",
