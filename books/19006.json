  "description": "The dog did not understand when his people left him behind in the cold and the rain. He did not understand when the sound of gunshots echoed through the air. And he did not understand when the things came into his yard. Things that moved and moaned, and smelled very very dead.With all he has ever known in tatters the dog is forced to forge ahead into an uncertain world where the dead-things roam and danger lurks at every turn. All he has to his credit is a keen nose and an unswerving devotion to the girl who rescued him.Together these two innocents will risk everything for each other in a world where evil reigns supreme.",
