  "description": "Emma Cole has had a rough life. She’s a deaf mute on the run from her family. Rayne Golden’s flower shop is as good a place as any to blend into the background and remain anonymous. In her silent world she has no friends and wants to keep it that way. She especially doesn’t want the attention of the huge handsome man claiming to be her mate. Brock Golden is a Weretiger and the streak’s enforcer. From the moment he sees the beautiful, petite, Em Cole, he’s pretty sure he’s found his mate. He just has to touch her to be sure. When he does his tiger isn’t the only one to respond. His beast does as well. Brock isn’t like his brothers―he harbors a dark beast. A beast he can’t control. A beast even Ryland has trouble reigning in. Brock will do anything to protect his golden beauty―even taking on a nest of vampires. This group is on a killing rampage, and even their friend Peter isn’t sure if the streak is strong enough to stop them. Will the force of the streak be enough to protect Em? Can Brock reign in his beast and not harm the ones he loves? Find out in the fourth installment of the Golden Streak Series―Brock",
