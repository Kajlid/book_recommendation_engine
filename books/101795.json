I’m hungry, thirsty, and I’m tired.The sweet song I heard all night is luring me under. I must be losing my mind, because I believe it. And I let go.Photo Description: A drowned man is held in the arms of a merman. The man looks as though he could be dead, or he could be asleep. The merman is kissing him on the lips. The man’s hands drift in the sea, and his clothes are in tatters.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
