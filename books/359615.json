  "description": "In \"Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge\" Steven Macon Greer provides his own personal disclosure based on years of high-level meetings with over 450 military & government-connected insiders & whistle-blowers & briefings with senior government officials, such as former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, members of the US Senate & senior UN officials. In addition to these disclosures, \"Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge\" unveils the actual contact experiences Dr. Greer has had with UFOs & Extraterrestrial Civilizations, beginning as a young child. In one of the most amazing & moving personal stories ever shared, he explains how after a prolonged near-death experience at age 17, he experienced cosmic consciousness & found the Rosetta Stone of ET contact: the power of the unbounded mind within each of us. Later this led to numerous Close Encounters of the 5th Kind: contact with ETs initiated by Greer & later by larger groups of people through the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence project.",
