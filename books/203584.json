  "description": "You're invited to the sickest party in Sunnydale. DJs will be mixing up somebody- moving grooves, smart drinks will be available at the bar, and we'll be giving up a virgin sacrifice for the blood goddess. An old friend of Spike is in town, and he's getting every teenager in Sunnydale to trip the light fantastic at some very special, underground raves. He has a plan that could mean big things for vampires everywhere, and Spike agrees to help him out. Everyone who is anyone is rolling at these after-hour parties, including a whole posse of vampires. Buffy and the Scooby gang are going out and getting down to put an end to what's become a euphoric feeding frenzy for some of the baddest baddies in town.",
