  "description": "Hide your magic. Never admit that you're a witch. And never, ever trust a hot guy with a gun.  ...This witch is about to discover that some rules are made to be broken.  All sassy witch-in-hiding Mallory Serra wants is to go to work and live a normal life. After all, magic is illegal--not that she can totally control her powers, anyway--and any witch who's been caught casting spells is forced into the elite Academy of the Dark Arts, then drafted into the military after graduation.  Slinging coffee for cranky commuters is bad enough for Mallory, but actually being shot at? No, thanks.  But when a friend needs help, Mallory breaks her rules and performs one teeny, tiny spell. What could go wrong?  Everything.  Matt, a hot-as-sin soldier, catches her in the magical act. Taken by the government, Mallory is forced to enter the Academy, where she's surrounded by three sarcastic, mouth-watering students teachers who are more interested in pushing her out of their special ops program than helping her succeed.  Until she learns their dirty little secret, when they have no choice but to give her a hand. Or several.  This book is part 1 of a 4 book series, and has more than a little steam with the romance. Happy reading!",
