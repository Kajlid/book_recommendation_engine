She does not want to end up as Jake's plaything, his panting cowgirl, at his beck and call for the rest of her life. There's only one weapon that might bring him down, and that's love. Jilly could wield it against him, but she might not like the price she has to pay. It's a battle of wills and libidos as the gorgeous Jake sets about—once and for all—roping his filly.",
