  "title": "Meditation Saved My Life: A Tibetan Lama and the Healing Power of the Mind",
  "description": "Meditation Saved My Life is a moving first-person account of the mind’s innate healing abilities. In 2003, Tibetan lama Phakyab Rinpoche was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured by Chinese officials bent on uprooting Tibet’s indigenous religion. Although Rinpoche escaped his captors and fled to New York, his ordeal left him with life-threatening injuries, including gangrene of the ankle. At Bellevue Hospital, doctors gave Rinpoche a shocking choice: accept leg amputation or risk a slow, painful death. However, an inner voice prompted him to try a non-western cure — meditation. Rinpoche began an intensive yoga routine that included thousands of hours of meditation, and against all scientific logic, his injuries gradually healed. As his mentor the Dalai Lama told him, “You have within you wisdom that will give you the strength to heal.” In Meditation Saved My Life, Rinpoche shows us that we all have great healing powers that lie dormant within us.",
