  "description": "A story covered by Texas Monthly, the Las Vegas Review Journal, and the El Paso Times\n\n\"Jimmy Chagra was a lot of things: a high-rolling gambler who chummed around with celebrities in Las Vegas [like Muhammad Ali, Joe Namath, Redd Fox], the biggest pot smuggler in the Western world and a father to children he arguably adored and unarguably failed.\" –excerpt from the Austin American-Statesmen\nCatherine Chagra and her two sisters, Cindy and Christa, were the darling daughters of Jimmy Chagra, the biggest pot dealer in the history of the U.S.A., and one of the kingpins of Las Vegas casinos in the 1970's. But after their father was arrested and his hundred-million dollars had disappeared, they were left penniless, at the mercy of a Texas society that vilified them. With the help of their principled mother before her tragic death, and haunted by the shadow of their father, Dirty Darlings is a portrait of courage as three women attempt to reassemble the shattered pieces of their lives.",
