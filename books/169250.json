  "description": "Winner in the New Mexico-Arizona Book Awards, Luanne Castle's debut poetry collection, Doll God, studies traces of the spirit world in human-made and natural objects--a Japanese doll, a Palo Verde tree, a hummingbird. Her exploration leads the reader between the twin poles of nature and creations of the imagination in dolls, myth, and art. From the first poem, which reveals the child's wish to be godlike, to the final poem, an elegy for female childhood, this collection echoes with the voices of the many in the one: a walking doll, a murderer, Snow White. Marriage, divorce, motherhood, and family losses set many of the poems in motion. The reader is transported from the lakes of Michigan to the Pacific Ocean to the Sonoran Desert. These gripping poems take the reader on a journey through what is found, lost, or destroyed. The speaker in one poem insists, \"I am still looking for angels.\" She has failed to find them yet keeps searching on. She knows that what is lost can be found.",
