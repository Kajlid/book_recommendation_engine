  "description": "Lord Beaumont Havendish has been thought dead for nine long years. However, death would be a relief from his grinding existence as a white slave in the tropical island of Saint-Domingue. At long last revolution gives him a chance to escape, but he’ll never escape the knowledge that the woman he loved sent him into a living hell. He leaves the tropical sands behind and returns to the gentle shores of England thinking the nightmare is finally behind him, only to find it has only just begun. The traitorous Yvette is comfortably ensconced in his ancestral home, posing as Beau’s bereaved widow. Yet, nothing is what it seems. Yvette is no longer the girl he once adored. She seems more like a ghost than the wicked temptress he believes betrayed him. Can he forgive the past and dare he risk AWAKENING HIS DUCHESS?",
