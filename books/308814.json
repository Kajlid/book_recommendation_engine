  "description": "Matilda Martin, newly single, is having a life change – a new job, a new city, and a new dating outlook. That’s right, she is over smooth men. In fact, Matilda is taking it one step further; she is only interested in Mr Average from now on – a man who doesn’t have women hanging off him, doesn’t know all the pick-up lines and is 100 percent real. Adam Cahill is tall, dark, handsome and a spy for a government agency. And he has just been dumped. Allegedly, according to his now ex-girlfriend, he is “all about work, constantly grumpy, and as much fun as a crisis meeting”. Adam has given up on finding love – from now on, he’s focusing on his career. Luckily Matilda’s been assigned to his next project since neither of them is bound to be interested in each other.",
