  "description": "When Dean was shot and killed in the Arctic north, he was ripped not only from the Iron Lands but from Aoife Grayson's life. Aoife has sworn to bring her love back, even if she must face death to do it. But she can't get to the Deadlands on her own. And even if she can get there, her foe, Tremaine, will surely block her escape; it is his job to hold her in the Thorn Land, the fairie home of her mother, Nerissa. Aoife has never shied away from a fight. She'll do whatever she must to get out of the Thorn Land and to the Deadlands. But to rescue Dean, she must also face the other catastrophe that took place in the north. She must stop the apocalyptic chain of events she set in motion when she opened the Gate to the nightmare realm. Because if she doesn't, there will be no world to bring Dean back to.",
