  "description": "HAMISH:I’ll be honest — I hadn’t been thinking much about love or marriage. I’d met the girl for me and let her go years ago. And until I could make that right? I wasn’t looking.Until my Durnish family reminded me that to keep my place in line for the Durnish throne (and my only real link to my homeland) I needed to tie the knot before I hit thirty.The issue? There’s only one girl I’m willing to marry and I haven’t seen or heard from her in six years.I’ll have to find her fast and hope she won’t be bothered by my lack of… experience. She’s the one. And until I find her again, I haven’t wanted to share my royal scepter with just anyone, if ya get my drift.SOPHIE:I followed Hamish MacEvoy to America six years ago, but what I found there told me right away he wasn’t waiting around for me.Since then, I’ve built my own life — free of kilt-wearing football players, thank you very much. I have a successful business baking wedding cakes for the elite of the San Diego wedding scene.But when Erica Johnson and Fernando Fuerte — who plays for Hamish’s team — came walking through my door, I should have hidden. Well, actually I did hide, but it all fell apart anyway.I’m just not sure I’m ready to give Hamish a second chance.",
