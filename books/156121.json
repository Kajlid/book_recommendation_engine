  "title": "Wasted Words: The College Daze",
  "description": "College is a fountain of knowledge, and the students are there to drink. When unworldly scholar Lucas Lloyd begins his freshman year at a prestigious Midwestern university, he still has respect for rules. He has never drank, smoked, or gotten anywhere worth mentioning with a girl. But he soon discovers that if he's ever going to fit in, he'll have to start making bad decisions. Wasted Words is a satirical look at higher education in the 21st century. Anyone who's ever imbibed in a dorm room is sure to get drunk off its prose.",
