  "description": "“A tremendous talent.”—Lee ChildIn award-winning author Suzanne Chazin’s stirring new novel, Latino police detective Jimmy Vega must strike a precarious balance between the local immigrant community and his hometown’s most powerful and privileged citizens during a dangerous murder investigation... A split-second decision thrusts Detective Jimmy Vega into the epicenter of a disturbing case when a body is found near a gathering place for immigrants in upscale Lake Holly, NY. The cold-bloodedness of the crime and the innocence of the victim torment Vega. In a community gripped by fear of deportation, Vega needs the help of his girlfriend, activist Adele Figueroa, to gain people’s trust. But Adele is acting strangely, consumed by a secret that threatens to tear them apart. When the case takes a personal turn, both Vega and Adele discover that Lake Holly’s tranquil façade hides a terror of monstrous proportions, poised and ready to strike again. To confront the killer and save their relationship, Vega and Adele must forge a new level of trust—in each other, and in their most deeply held beliefs—to expose an evil that threatens to eclipse anything they’d previously imagined.     Written with equal parts passion and suspense, A Blossom of Bright Light takes readers on a journey of stunning revelations to uncover a small town’s most sinister secrets—and brightest hopes for the future. Mystery, sacrifice, and unremitting love converge in this gripping work by a master storyteller.",
