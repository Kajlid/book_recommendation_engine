  "title": "The Marquis De Sade's Elements of Style",
  "description": "This slim volume reads like a textbook at a porno-film version of an English boy's school. Using the Marquis de Sade's writings as example sentences, Derek Pell gives grammar advice such as, \"In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. Thus write, 'young girls enticed into a life of debauchery, children abandoned, wives humiliated, and several suicides.'\" A glossary includes sadistic definitions for such terms as \"bugger,\" \"to beat about the bush,\" \"virtuous,\" and \"enormity.\" Not only is this book consistently funny, it actually offers some decent advice for budding writers.",
