  "description": "Linus Hoppe has always lived in Realm One, an ideal world. Now, at 14, he must be tested by the Great Processor to determine where he deserves to live from here on. If he achieves a high score, nothing in his life will change. But if he scores too low, he’ll be relegated to an inferior realm, possibly far from his family and friends. There’s really nothing for Linus to worry about—unless, of course, he chooses to alter his destiny.",
