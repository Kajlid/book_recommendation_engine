  "description": "\"When everything you desire is strictly forbidden.\"  Everything about Sam’s life since the devastation of Earth and the move to a new solar system is forbidden. She’s fallen in love with her boss, the widowed young overlord and Royal Prince Shihlo of Throm, partly responsible for the annihilation of Earth and fully responsible for being the most intoxicatingly magnetic creature she has ever met, but Shihlo has disallowed his planet from relationships with other beings after his brother Wrexel’s fiasco with Amber and would certainly not cast a glance at one of his employees.  If she had good sense she would return the affections of the powerful, ethereal being who controls peace within her new solar system. The youngest “elder” to ever rule Diogel would like nothing more for her to rule at his side. He is an image of perfection, deeply in love with her and completely unsuspecting of Sam’s adventures with those forbidden to practice magic and sorcery.   Her days are filled with adventure and her nights are filled with longing, but Sam has little time to dwell on her unrequited desires because her secret magical companions reveal she has a role in something far greater than anything she has ever dreamed about.  The return of the Grand Wraith. Father of all prohibited magic and the most feared creature of all time.  (Book Two can be read as a stand alone from Book One)",
