  "description": "Three rules. Two sisters. One big problem.  Sisters Summer and Lia obey the three simple rules of all monster banishers: Never summon monsters. Never make deals with devils. Never feed the fiends. That is, until they start tracking a monster that's been taking college kids in Roanoke--it's always Roanoke. While investigating, the sisters run into a little more trouble than usual when their rescue mission rouses interest from the local police department. And Lia's nemesis. And a god or two. Also possibly an entire legion of demons. Suddenly the letter of the law doesn't seem as important as the spirit of it. Look: sometimes you have to break a few rules to protect the innocent. And sometimes, you didn't know you would have to when you first started the rescue. Now they're learning that there's a penalty for every misdeed, and this one may cost them their lives.",
