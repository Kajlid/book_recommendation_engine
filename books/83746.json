Jade has been entrusted with the keeping of a Vampir known for his ruthlessness. The Embraced need him in the fight against the Dominion, but even his own friends consider him dangerous. As a Priestess of the Morrigan, Jade can handle most anything, but perhaps not Niccolo Romano. Jade looks damn good to Niccolo, but she proves resistant to his charms. Soon bedding her becomes a mission, but he takes one step too far in his quest to possess her and soon she possesses his heart. Jade has secrets she wants to keep, but Niccolo has a way of laying her bare in more ways than one. Every time Niccolo seduces her to his bed sometimes gently, sometimes not he unravels another piece of her history, bringing up long repressed sexual need and emotion. Soon Niccolo is fighting two battles one against the Dominion and the other for Jade.",
