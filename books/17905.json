Maggie has been abused, torn apart by the sins of others and constantly feels as if she's living on the verge of a grand epiphany. Then again, she may just be insane. She really doesn't know if the four bodies she dismembered and placed inside a rusted Volkswagen Bus are the only bricks left to her castle in the sky, but she hopes you'll understand if they're not.Castles is the story of Maggie and how she built her castle, one brick at a time.
