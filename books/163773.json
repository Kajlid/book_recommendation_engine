  "title": "Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling",
  "description": "Founder of the largest indigenous Christian church in American history, Joseph Smith published the 584-page Book of Mormon when he was twenty-three and went on to organize a church, found cities, and attract thousands of followers before his violent death at age thirty-eight. Richard Bushman, an esteemed cultural historian and a practicing Mormon, moves beyond the popular stereotype of Smith as a colorful fraud to explore his personality, his relationships with others, and how he received revelations . An arresting narrative of the birth of the Mormon Church, Joseph Rough Stone Rolling also brilliantly evaluates the prophetâ€™s bold contributions to Christian theology and his cultural place in the modern world.",
