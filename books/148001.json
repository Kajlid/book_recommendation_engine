Philosophy comes in many forms, but until now, we haven't considered it from a tree's perspective. This book showcases their influences on their surroundings and their feelings on the destructive path that is human nature. In these stories, we witness the wisdom and observed reflections of one single, old tree. We, as humans, need to understand how the different aspects of nature must feel, and how they perceive our different emotions, in order to be able to live in harmony. They feel our struggle trying to make a name for ourselves in this world, they perceive the wonderful jitters of first love and first kiss, they emphasize with the need to find companionship.The tree's thoughts and old worldly wisdom are an important compass for which direction the development of humans needs to go in to be in kinship with nature.
