My parents are dead, my adoptive mother is a drug addict, and the mean girls on campus mock me for my scars.So when I end up desperate for money and out of options, I agree to sell the one thing I have left: my innocence.On the night I’m meant to give my body to a brutal Russian mobster, three men storm into the room like dark shadows and kill him before he can claim me. When they drag me from the blood-soaked bed, I’m certain they’re going to kill me too.They don’t… but they don’t forget about me, either.These three dangerous brothers will do anything to make sure I keep my mouth shut about what I saw, even if it means stalking my every movement. I’m a loose thread to them—but somehow, I’m becoming more than that too.I’m becoming an obsession.A temptation.A craving.And no matter how much I try to deny the terrifying attraction that pulses between us, I know if I don’t find a way out of this tangled web soon…Their darkness will swallow me up.Twisted Game is a full-length new adult romance with dark themes, damaged anti-heroes, and high heat. It is book one of four in the series. *RELEASE DATE WILL BE MOVED FORWARD.*",
