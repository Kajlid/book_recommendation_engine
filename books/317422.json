  "description": "Love finds you when you least expect it…KAYLAI came home to Westmount Island, and my two sisters, after a terrifying experience overseas. I miss the confident and carefree person I used to be and the sleepy small town we grew up in is just what the doctor (or therapist in this case) ordered. But I have no intention of staying; my dream is to travel the world. Until Sam and his son Toby come along, and I start to see that falling in love could be the answer to what I’ve been searching for all along.SAMWhen my wife died in childbirth, I accepted that love wasn’t in the cards for me. As a self-employed, single dad, I don't know what I'd have to offer a woman at this point, anyway. Westmount Island seems like the perfect place to start over: a quiet backdrop for my writing career and a slower, more relaxed life for my son Toby and I. But when Toby stumbles into Kayla Michaels on the ferry, that plan goes out the window. She brings fun, chaos, and happiness back into our lives. I never saw her coming, but now I can’t imagine life without her.",
