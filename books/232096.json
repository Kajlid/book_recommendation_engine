The gang's desire for a normal life leads them to start an actual business-a detective agency. But when a drug kingpin hires them to solve a baffling mystery, the gang is driven deep into the Los Angeles underworld-and comes face to face with a dangerous enemy. And the mystery isn't the only thing unraveling-a sexy and forbidden new game is tearing the gang apart. Can they pull back together before it's too late? Or is the world's sexiest four-way doomed to destruction?",
