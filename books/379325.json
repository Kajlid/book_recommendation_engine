  "description": "Washington, D.C., is the sixth installment in Gore Vidal's acclaimed seven-volume series of historical novels about the American past. It offers an illuminating portrait of our republic from the time of the New Deal to the McCarthy era.Widely regarded as Vidal's ultimate comment on how the American political system degrades those who participate in it, Washington, D.C. is a stunning tale of corruption and diseased ambitions. It traces the fortunes of James Burden Day, a powerful conservative senator who is eyeing the presidency; Clay Overbury, a pragmatic young congressional aide with political aspirations of his own; and Blaise Sanford, a ruthless newspaper tycoon who understands the importance of money and image in modern politics. With characteristic wit and insight, Vidal chronicles life in the nation's capital at a time when these men and others transformed America into \"possibly the last empire on earth.\"",
