  "title": "The Cambridge List",
  "description": "With a student-turned-serial-killer stalking Cambridge, professors are cowering in terror, locals are looking fearfully over their shoulders and newspaper editors are rubbing their hands together with glee. Who is the evil genius striking terror into the heart of the sleepy town, and why is he picking-off lecturers one by one? James Connor thinks that killing his former professors in cold blood is actually rather a bad idea. Unfortunately his head has been commandeered by a bloodthirsty family of Greek gods, so he doesn’t really have a say in the matter. With Hera and Aphrodite at each other’s throats and Dionysos failing to keep order, James’s brain has become a cosmic conflict zone, and he’s worried they’ll leave it in ruins. There’s only one way out: he has to go from socially inept young man to slick sociopath fast. If only he wasn’t so squeamish about mass slaughter.Forget the serene deities you’ve seen carved in ancient marble. Forget the quaint charm of England’s most English university. Here in the cut-and-thrust world of Cambridge the rule of the jungle prevails, and nothing is sacred. Follow the world’s least menacing serial killer on his awkwardly murderous journey, where ancient rituals, scheming academics and divine politics collide. And where murder has consequences unforeseen even by the gods themselves...\"This is a Cambridge novel like no other. Taking in academic murder and a clutch of demented Greek gods 'The Cambridge List' is a surreal, knockabout romp.\" (Waterstones, Cambridge)",
