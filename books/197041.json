  "description": "“A resonant story about family, friendship and loss, and the power of hope and unity. Gayton reminds us that small things are sometimes the most important.”— Sunday Times [UK]To protect her village from a giant, Greta recruits a Hercufleas! He may be tiny, but this young flea is certain he’s destined for greatness. Being a hero is harder than it seems, though, and Hercufleas and Greta face unexpected choices—and consequences—in their desperate attempts to save the village, and each other.     Big heroes come in small packages in a superbly imagined tale that is part comedic adventure, part poignant coming-of-age epic, and wholly original.",
