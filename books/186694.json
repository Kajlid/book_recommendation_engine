How Little Sister gets help from the Month Brothers in the forest offers a delightful twist on this Slavic version of Cinderella.A retelling of the Slavic folktale in which the Month Brothers' magic helps Little Sister fulfill seemingly impossible tasks which prove the undoing of her greedy stepmother and stepsister.",
