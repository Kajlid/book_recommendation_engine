Too bad he’s her boss…Marcus has never met a woman as caring, sincere, and beautiful as Laila. There's something special about her…the way she looks at him, touches him, teases him. His icy front is melting. He’s falling and falling hard—for both her and their new addition. Even as they enjoy paradise together, the real world still looms over the three of them, ready to burst their happy bubble.When the holiday ends, can they can build something new, something that can last? Something more than just a fantasy…",
