  "description": "After her last case Clara Fitzgerald, Brighton's first female private detective, embarks on a holiday to relax and recuperate. She takes a trip around the Lake District aboard one of the Brighton Charabanc Touring Company's coaches, but swiftly discovers that her fellow passengers are not all they might seem. Many of them seem to have arrived on the charabanc against their will and are not here for a holiday at all.  But the mystery deepens when Mrs Hunt, a rather unpleasant woman who no one much wants to talk to, seeks Clara out and desperately asks for her help. She believes she is being targeted by a killer, but who aboard the charabanc knows and dislikes Mrs Hunt enough to want her dead?  Clara soon discovers her fellow holiday-makers have plenty of secrets and more than one has a motive for wishing Mrs Hunt out of the picture, but precisely who is the real would-be murderer and how does this connect with a seeming suicide that took place at the Lakes a decade ago?  Clara must unravel the full details of Mrs Hunt's past to unearth a killer, along the way digging up dark secrets and stirring up memories best left forgotten.  The Woman Died Thrice is the eighth novel in the Clara Fitzgerald series and is published by Red Raven Publications.",
