  "description": "A sinfully sexy friends-to-lovers erotic romance – by a USA Today bestselling author.  Previously published by Samhain Publishing under the title Seven Sexy Sins. This is the Director’s Cut edition – featuring previously unseen excerpts from Faith’s blog!  \nSeven Sexy Sins. One Mr. Sinful.\n  Faith Hillman is in trouble. She’s writing an article on ways to spice up your love life for her popular blog, but she’s hit a major snag—she hasn’t experienced any of the Seven Sexy Sins on her list. Luckily, her brother’s best friend, Rusty Thorne, offers to help with her research.  Having had a crush on him since the age of twelve, Faith agrees, on the proviso that he signs a contract keeping their short-term relationship a secret. Her brother once decked him for kissing her on her eighteenth birthday, so Rusty’s happy to concur.  While they work their way through the wicked list, Rusty enjoys showing Faith all the sexual delights he can think of. But it’s only as the sins draws to a close that he understands that, where love is concerned, he’s the student and Faith’s the teacher.  He’s determined to keep to the terms of the contract, but when it comes to the crunch, will he be able to let her go?  Warning: Includes rebellious hero who enjoys inserting Tab A into Slots B, C, and even occasionally D. Also includes highly inappropriate use of a Mars Bar.",
