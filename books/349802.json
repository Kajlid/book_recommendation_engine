  "description": "In the fourth book of this utterly addictive series, magical genius Aubrey Fitzwilliam is heading deep into the heart of enemy territoryluckily, with his friends by his side\n\n \nIt may look like a simple wire device, but the Beccaria Cage could be the cure for Aubrey's condition: a way to reunite his body and soul. But can Aubrey solve its mysteries while Dr. Tremaine's warmongering machinations gather pace? After magical confrontations, near-death experiences, and the appearance of new allies and new enemies, Aubrey decides that there is only one thing to do: carry the fight to the enemy. Thanks to a fortuitously timed symposium, Aubrey, George, and Caroline accompany Lady Rose and Prince Albert to Holmlandinto the heart of hostile territoryonly to find a city infested with ghosts, brigands, and shadowy figures with agendas of their own. Fisherberg is a city on a knife edge. While trying to prevent a war, could Aubrey Fitzwilliam inadvertently trigger one?",
