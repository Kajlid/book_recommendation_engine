  "title": "The Farm Boy and the Fairy Princess",
  "description": "Young Curtis Terrence had lived on the farm with his uncle and aunt since he was a baby. His life takes a wild turn when he enters an enchanted burrow and finds himself in the magical Jewel-Fruit Forest—and meets Princess Minerva Vernalis. Curtis soon finds a new home—and his long-lost mother—in the fantasy land turned real, and makes friends with people and creatures he had until now thought only existed in his imagination. But when the evil Warlock Blightonyx makes a pact with the three Axis powers and World War II arrives, Curtis and Minerva need all the help and prayer they need to save the human world and the Jewel-Fruit Forest’s world. This book mixes fantasy and faith in the same vein as the Chronicles of Narnia.",
