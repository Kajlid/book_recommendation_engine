  "description": "Is it possible to make up for the way we have hurt others? I wonder if it truly is. Can we undo what has already been done?No. We can’t. I know for a fact, we cannot un-say words that have been bitterly spoken by a deliberate slip of a tongue.Words hurt.They sting. They burn. The truth is, I didn’t want to hurt Ellie Wynn, but I knew I would. She was a temptation I couldn’t resist. An addiction that lived in my blood, and I wasn’t about to go in search of a cure. Not when I needed her. Wanted her.Craved her.There are no quick fixes to what I’ve done.No pill to take away her pain.All I have is the cold truth. It’s brittle.It’s brutal.I’ll be damned if because of it, I let her slip away.",
