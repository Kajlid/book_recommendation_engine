  "title": "Engraved",
  "description": "Poetry. Inspired by nineteenth-century Webster's Dictionary engravings, ENGRAVED explores a fantastic land at the edge of obsolescence and loss. The poems teem with whaling schooners, passenger pigeons, a bayonet, cupola furnace, clavichord words and objects at the brink of extinction, placed in and around the death of the poet's father. But these poems also create, or recreate; through illustration, music, and myth, the imagination here allows the dead to reappear, mostly, and sometimes also lets them go. Located at the intersection of art and grief, these poems honor anyone who has set down lines and vanished from the earth.\"",
