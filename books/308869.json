  "description": "‘Damn, I can’t believe that I’ve done [or said] that again!’Do you find yourself saying this fairly often?If so, the information in this book will enable you to identify the situations, people and events that push your buttons and skyrocket you to a reaction you inevitably regret. You’ll understand why you do what you do when someone or something triggers you in ways that up to now you’ve been unaware of or have believed you have under control.Being conscious of who we are, what we do and who we’re becoming is one of the greatest gifts we can afford ourselves and those around us. Finding out what your animal personality type is, discovering your strengths and the areas you need to work on, and recognising these traits in those around you, will enable you to lead a happier and more fulfilling life, in your personal and family relationships, and especially in your work life.\"A beautifully written and insightful book that provides a framework for unlocking that “Aha” moment to find out exactly who you really are. Juanene lays out the context of the Enneagram in a way that is easy to understand as well as what this means to how you can live an even more fulfilled life.”Tessa Graham, International Consultant and Collaborator“Enneagram de-mystified at last! Brilliant way to understand the stories that trip us all up. Juanene has the knack of synthesising her immense understanding of the complex enneagram and making it user friendly! I love the way she helps you 'befriend' your animal type with deeply insightful questions alongside very practical tips.\"Kate Emmerson International author, speaker and retreat leader",
