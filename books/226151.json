  "description": "Eleanor Benton has lived most of her life under the protective watch of her widowed father. A tragic, life-altering event robbed her of the person she could have been. When she is brought to stay with her relatives on a horse ranch in Montana, she meets a man who reaches out to her in ways no one else has ever done.  Lance Taggart prefers being a drifter and doesnâ€™t believe in putting down roots. Together with his canine companion, he finds solace in keeping his distance from those who cannot see past his mixed-blood heritage. When his boss' quiet, auburn-haired niece arrives at the ranch, his priorities are about to change.  Facing the daily misunderstandings and harsh realities of an often cruel, close-minded society, Lance and Ellie fight to overcome what others perceive as barriers. Will their love be strong enough to withstand the truth that links their pasts in a way they never imagined?  **This book contains some mild language, mild violence, and kissing.
