  "description": "It’s been six years since Abigail Byrne laid eyes on Brian Foley, but since then she’s been unable to keep him out of her thoughts and dreams. Determined to try to forget him, she moves on with her life until the day her twin sister disappears without a trace. Abby has no choice but to turn to Brian for help in locating her twin, even if it results in having her heart broken.   Brian’s life as a vampire has consisted of little more than killing and death for the last two hundred years. There’s no room inside of him anymore for kindness and love, or so he thinks, until he hears Abby’s frantic plea for his help. Unable to refuse her request, Brian agrees to help Abby find her missing sister. As the search for Vicky progresses, Brian does everything he can to deny his growing feelings for Abby. However, the further they delve into her sister’s disappearance, the more determined he becomes to protect her from the horrors they uncover.18+",
