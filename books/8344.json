  "description": "Tess Morrow and Jack Wright have always struck sparks every time they're in the same room, but now, after years of successfully avoiding each other, they're trapped together by an unexpected hurricane and striking sparks of a whole different kind. Each minute Tess spends with Jack makes his dangerous kisses--and the mouth-watering way he fills a pair of jeans--more intriguing than ever. If Tess isn't careful, soon she'll be falling for this infuriating man. Just because they're forced to spend Thanksgiving together doesn't mean that Jack has to like being with Tess. Except he's beginning to notice her warm smile, her long legs, and especially how his teasing gets her all flushed and bothered in al the right places. Suddenly, Mr. Wright is being tempted in some very unexpected ways...making him wish the storm would never end.",
