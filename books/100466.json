  "description": "Rebecca Griffin only ever wanted one thing: to be a good wife and mother. Her own domineering Italian-American mother, as well as the rest of her big-hearted, opinionated, wild and wonderful Italian family, had been telling her how to do just that since she was little and wanted to marry Roy Rogers. Now, it’s the 90’s and Rebecca has everything she ever dreamed of. But she suspects her husband is having an affair and fears her daughter, Dana, is going bad; hurtling dangerously out of reach toward a self-destructive calamity. Then Rebecca learns of the mysterious death of a distant cousin long ago at the prison bordering the small, idyllic New England town where she lives. It’s a story she can’t shake. Questions about the young woman’s fate nag at Rebecca as she desperately tries to reclaim the little girl she once knew, while hanging onto the ragged remnants of her marriage. Rebecca, her troubled daughter, Dana, and an enigmatic woman from the past, embark on a journey of discovery both distinctly their own, and shared. Each must wrestle with the demons that nip at their heels propelling them headlong, until all three collide one desperate, enchanted autumn night. Bad Girls, at its heart, is a story about family. The origins, variations and connections that shaped them – even the places they came from – set these women on their path. As the unlikely travelers come to the end of their journey, they find new paths revealed in the most unearthly of places by the most innocent of messengers. --Bad Girls is a mesmerizing story that pulls readers into the lives of three women drawn together by a young woman's mysterious and tragic death. Deborah Doucette's novel is beautifully written with characters that are rich, complex and memorable. A spell-binding read--Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Barbara Walsh, author of August Gale: A Father and Daughter's Journey into the Storm",
