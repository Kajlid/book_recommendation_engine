  "description": "What do you get when your father’s a centaur and your mother’s a powerful magician?A unicorn shifter…You’d think being the only known unicorn shifter in the world would have a few benefits. Like, people treating you kindly or getting special treatment from the council. Not in my case. I'd be lucky to get a piece of bread thrown at me.My name is Celestia Rainbow, and yes, my last name is fucking Rainbow.Shifters assume that I’m kind by nature, but trust I’m fierce, short-tempered and have the mouth of a sailor. Add in my stealthy fighting skills, advanced magic casting, and swift movement, I'm someone you wouldn't want to mess with. But everyone looks at my shifter side – my ditzy, peaceful half, sprinkling magic dust, and on a mission to end world hunger.Regardless of my dual personality, I’ve sworn to become a huntress at Aslan Academy. Now that I’m of age--my lucky twenty-fifth birthday just happens to coincide with the entrance exams--I’m ready to prove my worth.Too bad I’m grouped up with six sinful looking men.Time to prove to my community, classmates and this attractive bunch of weirdos that unicorns can kick ass too.CELESTIA is a new REVERSE HAREM, paranormal series. Recommended for 18+ audiences, containing mature sexual content, violence and strong language.",
