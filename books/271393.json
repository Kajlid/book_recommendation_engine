Strapped for cash, she goes to Old Explorers’ Bay, Florida to sell the house she inherited from her grandmother.

Ethan Parrish is a cop, a single dad, and a firm believer that love is for chumps. He’s got nothing against harmless flirtation, though. Especially if it involves the feisty and adorably cute Kate. As their relationship starts to steam up, he puts his cards on the table and warns her there’s never going to be another Mrs. Ethan Parrish. And that’s okay with Kate because she’s not conducting interviews for the next Mr. Kate Giles-Armitage either, thank you very much.But a trio of nosy matchmakers have their own plans to bring a happily-ever-after to all the town’s singles. Will a couple of amateurs like Kate and Ethan succumb to their machinations, or will the Undercover Matchmakers have to chalk one up on the loser board?",
