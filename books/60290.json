  "description": "Raindrop’s World is a collection of illustrated vignettes that come together as a whole story. The individual stories, which include The Imaginary Armadillo, Raindrop and the Kapok Tree, The Beetle and the Tree Frog, and The Explorer's New Home, tell the tale of two leafcutter ants and one very determined little beetle venturing out into the Amazonian Rainforest. They’re searching for an extremely old, and wise tree frog. Raindrop, the tenacious ant in charge of the expedition, urges her friends on. She has a long list of questions that she wants to ask this tree-dwelling amphibian, but with the onset of night, she might be disappointed. It’s up to Little Clay, the lone beetle among the ants, to carry on and find this enigmatic frog. When at last he does, the advice he gets isn’t what he’d expected at all.",
