  "title": "The Oktober Projekt",
  "description": "For Nick Torr, a senior officer in the Secret Intelligence Service’s (SIS) Covert Directorate CO8, Operation Salvage was intended to be nothing more than a mundane collection from an SIS agent in Moscow. Betrayed, captured, beaten and tortured, Torr’s nightmare has only just begun as Moscow attempts to protect its Oktober Projekt, raising the stakes of espionage to terrifying new heights. Retracing the trail from Moscow, Torr becomes locked in a gritty secret world where blackmail and murder are the standard weapons in personal battles for survival. Drawn into an increasing destructive chain of events demanding high personal sacrifices, Torr’s return to London offers no escape. Accused of being ‘turned’ by the Russians, Torr is forced to ruthlessly clear his name and discover which one of his senior colleagues betrayed him, which of them is Moscow’s asset, which of them ordered the brutal execution of his wife. Only when Torr unmasks Moscow’s agent in London will the spiral of killing finally end.",
