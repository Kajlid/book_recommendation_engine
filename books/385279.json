  "description": "\"From the tremendous hopes for a new century embodied in the 1900 World's Fair in Paris to the shattering assassination of a Hapsburg archduke in Sarajevo in 1914, historian Philipp Blom chronicles this extraordinary epoch year by year. Prime ministers and peasants, anarchists and actresses, scientists and psychopaths intermingle on the stage of a new century in this portrait of an opulent, unstable age on the brink of disaster.\" Replete with deftly told anecdotes and sumptuous evocations of a bygone world, The Vertigo Years brings the wonders, horrors, and fears of the early twentieth century vividly to life.",
