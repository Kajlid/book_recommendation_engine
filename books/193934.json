  "description": "This is a dark, erotic thriller intended for mature audiences. Not a traditional romance, but a love story with a twist, this is book one in a three part series.  The greatest love stories begin with bloodâ€¦  There is blood. There is pain. And there is him. These are the first things I register when I wake up, the lone survivor in an Alaskan plane crash. He carries me to safety over rough terrain and brings me to his cabin in the woods. He has no name. Or none he will tell me.  As snow creeps across the harsh and isolated landscape, he is my only company. My protector, my caretaker. A fascinating enigma, with mysterious eyes, gentle hands, and a rough voice that demands more from me than I ever expected to give. I make up different stories, different names for him depending on his mood, because I know nothing about him except that he is my only connection to the real world I want to return to. So I work to please him, plotting my escape, yet all the while I start to crave him and every touch of his dominating body.  He has saved me from the cold. From death. But in taking me and my body, will he destroy me?",
