  "description": "How do you want to be defined? By your job, your heritage or your social status? What if you were defined by your family and friends? Would that be an appropriate depiction of who you truly are? Or would you want someone to dig deeper if they want to truly know you? Many people avoid artificial labels and want to be defined by their beliefs. They want their faith to be what they see in the mirror. They want their ideals to be on display for all to see. I Am Mine provides a podium for these people to share their stories of who they are, and how they've obtained this identity. We are our ideals, not our 9-5 jobs. We are our beliefs, not our bank account levels. And while we respect each other's beliefs, and each other's personal testimonies, we know that nothing can touch our own. You are yours. And I Am Mine.",
