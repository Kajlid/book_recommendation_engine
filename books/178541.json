  "description": "Biographies can never be wholly objective or comprehensive; for by selecting which facts will receive emphasis, a biographer is bound to underplay those aspects which he considers to be less important. Hence, a volume such as this will allow readers to construct their own biographies of Beethoven, according to those aspects which are of greatest interest to themselves.",
