When her boys decide to take a hiatus, she decides to do the same.Before she can begin her summer off, Gretchen has one last public commitment. There, she meets tall, mysterious, and wickedly handsome Archer Thanos. Archer's company has a video game based on Heaven Sent and he's has been trying to get in touch with her to discuss it. Their first meeting quickly turns into a discussion of another type . . . in a nearby hotel room, sending Gretchen headlong into a whirlwind affair she hadn't anticipated.Only, someone isn't exactly thrilled about Gretchen and Archer's romance. Gretchen's adorable new assistant, Owen, has been pining for his boss since he started working for her but he hasn't had the courage to assert himself and tell her he wants her. As a result, Gretchen is completely blind to his feelings for her. And after meeting Archer, Owen knows he has no chance against the handsome devil. His own attraction to the older man is instant and overwhelming, the bisexual urges he hasn't divulged to Gretchen fully awakening.Owen thinks he's not enough for Gretchen.
