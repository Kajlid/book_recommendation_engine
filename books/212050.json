If the Second Coming is ever going to happen, it needs to happen now.Thirty-three year old Maryam’s increasing anger and horror about ISIS’s actions in the Middle East drive her into doing something crazy. Really really crazy.Maryam’s family and friends are directly affected by the turbulence and political uncertainty in the region, in spite of Jordan’s relative stability. Wanting to make sense of it all, Maryam embarks on a journey, exploring the religions of the Holy Land. She stumbles upon information that shows links between the terrorist organization and unlikely partners. In her quest to save the world from the clutches of evil, Maryam finds herself living a lie—a lie that leads her to unexpected destinations, such as the boarders of Eastern Turkey, post-earthquake Nepal, and eventually Raqqa, the capital of ISIS in Syria. When she finally comes face to face with a leading terrorist, what she finds will shatter her world forever.",
