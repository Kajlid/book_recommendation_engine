  "description": "I could no longer deny what the heat in my cheeks meant when I was around Flynn. I was falling for my sister's boyfriend.There's just something about Flynn. Yes, he's a tall, unbelievably gorgeous, dark-haired football player, but . . . he's also sweet and nice and super easy to talk to. It's lucky I'm the photographer for the school paper, because my camera likes Flynn almost as much as I do. Unfortunately for me, so does my sister, and there's no way I can nab Flynn with her in the picture.But could this be the real thing?",
