  "description": "Not all secrets stay buried.  Fresh from the set of her latest movie, Lizzie Benedict and her closest friends hit the Caribbean for a couple of weeks of partying, and whatever else might happen aboard the SS Dirty Oar. When the luxury yachting trip hits rough seas, Lizzie isn’t prepared for what happens next, a sunken ship and someone else’s boyfriend rescuing her. Waking up on the sunny, deserted island seems like a nightmare at first. Until the ten sexy celebrities decide to make the best of it. Sunbathing and eating fresh fruit off each other’s bodies is not the worst way to spend a week. There are no paparazzi and the weather is fine. But the party only lasts so long. Soon enough the reality of being shipwrecked hits them and the group begins to worry. Only their biggest concern isn’t being rescued. There’s someone else on the island. And Lizzie and her friends have something they want. Or rather, someone. The group has two choices: die at the hands of what appears to be a nightmare, or fight back.",
