  "description": "Greed. Power. Sin. It all comes with the gavel. Blurs the lines between church and state. But the Knightdale Charter of the Satan's Knights MC is my life.And I'd do anything for this club. Like letting the best woman I ever had slip through my fingertips. A sinfully beautiful spitfire, she's my better half in every way. My twin flame. My everything. My biggest regret. But there's no making things right between us. Because I'm the reason she's alone yet again. And if our past wasn't enough to put out the fire in her soul, my crimes certainly will be.",
