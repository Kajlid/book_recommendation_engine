  "description": "Can a woman fall for a man with Multiple Personality Disorder and still call herself a one-man woman? This question plagues Gretchen Tanner as she finds her life inundated with a man who all at once is an assassin, aiding and abetting her in revenge; an FBI officer, trying to nail her for her crimes; and a criminology professor, trying to teach her the basics of the topic. To make matters worse, one of the personalities has discovered her darkest secret (other than homicide). He knows she’s robbing graves in the family cemetery, and he’ll stop at nothing to get what he wants in exchange for his silence. Gretchen’s once independent life has been shattered by the arrival of her unorthodox suitor. And the most pressing problem? She’s not sure she can say no to any of them.",
