Although she inherited the enormous telepathic powers of her parents, her mind is definitely her own.Afra, who has worked closely with the Rowan over the years, falls in love with Damia at her birth. It is he who soothes her baby tantrums and helps her parents hone her brilliance. Damia spends her early life trying to establish her own identity, leaving Afra on the sidelines to wait until she is ready to accept his love. When Denebâ€™s early-warning system detects an incoming alien armada of such strength that even the Rowan and Jeff will be unable to deflect it, Damia and Afra must find the way to save their planet.",
