And the murder spree begins. Hailed as the Son of Satan by the local newspapers, Myth Man uses hidden contacts and disguises as he moves from victim to victim, while Presto attempts to decipher his psychotic mind in order to predict his next move. The serial killer has a plan. And soon the world will come to know him, celebrate him, and perhaps worship him-for he is Myth Man.",
