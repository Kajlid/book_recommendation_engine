Technology has allowed humanity to dramatically alter our environment, how we communicate, and how we experience life. Imagine now what our descendants might experience. What new trials or tribulations will the future of humanity suffer, or overcome? The final frontier won't be out in space but inside our own bodies.Experience the future as imagined via nineteen powerful voices envisioning what we might become. Including stories from: William F.
