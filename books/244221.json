  "title": "The Guerrilla Girls' Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art",
  "description": "Take a romp through the last two thousand years of Western Art with the Guerrilla Girls as your guides, and find out the real who, what, when, and why of art history. Who put all those naked men in the classical section of museums? What were the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" for female artists as \"civilization\" marched across Europe? Why did nuns have more fun in medieval times? This wisecracking but cleverly wise story of art is guaranteed to turn history on its head - and maybe a few historians too. Sprinkled throughout are \"believe it or not\" quotations from so-called experts; useful facts (consider how many prostitutes and how few suffragettes were painted in the nineteenth century); and reproductions of famous art works \"enhanced\" for historical accuracy and revenge.",
