  "title": "Soul of a Dog: Reflections on the Spirits of the Animals of Bedlam Farm",
  "description": "Do animals have souls? Some of our greatest thinkersâ Aristotle, Plato, Thomas Aquinasâ and countless animal lovers have been obsessed with this question for thousands of years. Now New York Times bestselling author Jon Katz looks for an answer. With his signature wisdom, humor, and clarity, Katz relates the stories of the animals he lives with on Bedlam Farm and finds remarkable kinships at every turn. Whether it is beloved sheepdog Rose’s brilliant and methodical herding ability, Mother the cat’s keen mousing instincts, or Izzy’s canine compassion toward hospice patients, Katz is mesmerized to see in them individual personas and sparks of self-awareness. Soul of a Dog will resonate with anyone who loves dogs, cats, or other animalsâ and who wonders about the spirits that animate them and the deepening hold they have on our lives.Â",
