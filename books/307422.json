  "title": "Practical Yoga Psychology",
  "description": "The great mysteries in our lives are the understanding of our personality,how we relate with other people and the world around us,and our place,if any,in the vast scheme of things.The other question we face is how we can improve our personal experience and our interactions with society,so that we live a happy harmonious and helpful life.For thousands of years yoga has been addressing these questions and supplying the answers to them. Practical Yoga Psychology is an attempt to simply blend the teachings of yoga with those of pschology,psychiatry and other branches of western science to give us an overview of the human personality,an idea of where we are going and guidelines to proceed on our journey. A worthy companion to the many other classics brought out by Bihar School of Yoga and Yoga Publications trust,Bihar.",
