  "title": "Out of Mormonism: A Woman's True Story",
  "description": "When Judy and Jim Robertson felt a spiritual void in their lives, they found \"\"the finest people in the world\"\" to embrace them and a beautifully packaged religion to entice them. Once drawn into Mormonism, they quickly climbed to leadership positions and became worthy temple Mormons, only to become disillusioned with the teaching and demands of the LDS church. From her unique insider's viewpoint, Judy shares her life as a Mormon woman, her rediscovery of the Jesus of the Bible, and how she and Jim found freedom as they left the LDS church in the face of persecution and confrontation.",
