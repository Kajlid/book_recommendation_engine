  "description": "Time Travel with a twist!  Veronica McAllister died in 2018.  She immediately opened her eyes again in 1958, all memories of her previous life intact.  She goes from old age, pants suits, and a cane, to poodle skirts, saddle shoes, and Buddy Holly.  At the end of her first life, Veronica said she “wasn’t any good at life.” With the most precious of gifts—perspective and a second chance, can she succeed where she failed during her first life?  What would you do, if you could do it all again?",
