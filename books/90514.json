  "description": "When Nell Bradley discovers a set of dilapidated gallopers – an antique roundabout with carved horses – for sale, she is delighted. She and her brothers, Danny and Sam, run a traditional fair which, so far, has afforded them a good living. But times are changing, and Danny and Sam are keen to expand by investing in more ambitious rides. Nell, more of a traditionalist, loathes the new technology. And she’s also having second thoughts about the man to whom she is unofficially engaged. So Nell buys the gallopers secretly and arranges to have them renovated. But what she hadn’t realised is that the horses come with their own very sexy restorer . . .",
