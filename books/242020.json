  "description": "Pain. It was something Finn “Handle” Kaidion knew well after losing his wife. Pain was what kept him guarded against any further relationships.  Pain was also something Mardella “Della” Kent felt after losing her sister and from being dragged into the pits of hell by a madman. Only he was no longer an issue. Instead, having her parents turn their back on her was a new reason pain kept beating at her door.  Can two people learn to trust and live free from their past sorrows?",
