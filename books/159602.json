  "description": "To generations of children, Dennis Lee is known as a wizard of words, the author of such classics as Alligator Pie, Garbage Delight, The Cat and The Wizard, and the bestseller Bubblegum Delicious. With Jelly Belly, originally published in 1983, Lee created a new Mother Goose. As playful and hilarious as our traditional nursery rhymes, Jelly Belly combines toe-tapping poetry with the beguiling illustrations of Juan Wijngaard (winner of the Mother Goose Award). Jelly Belly is the ideal book-for children ages one to five, for older brothers and sisters, for parents, grandparents and any grown up who remains young at heart.",
