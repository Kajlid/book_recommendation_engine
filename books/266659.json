  "description": "Many women have made significant contributions to the medical field. One such person is Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell. In the late 1840s, inspired by the dying words of a friend who urged her to become a doctor, Elizabeth started her education at Geneva Medical College. What she didn’t know was that the only reason she was admitted to Geneva was because the first-year class was polled and voted yes as a joke. But when she showed up, the joke was on them. It’s ten years after Dr. Blackwell graduated from Geneva College, and now Daniela Burke longs to attend the same school with her boyfriend, Ryan. But Geneva hasn’t admitted another female since Dr. Blackwell. As Daniela sees it, the only way to realize her dream of becoming a doctor is to disguise herself as a male in order to attend the college. Will she be able to maintain her ruse for three years? How will her disguise affect her relationship with Ryan?",
