  "title": "Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil",
  "description": "One of the twentieth century's greatest philosophers, without whom there would be no Jean-Paul Sartre, no Foucault, no Frankfurt School, Martin Heidegger was also a man of great failures and flaws, a Faustus who made a pact with the devil of his time, Adolph Hitler. The story of Heidegger's life and philosophy, a quintessentially German story in which good and evil, brilliance and blindness are inextricably entwined and the passions and disasters of a whole century come into play, is told in this brilliant biography.",
