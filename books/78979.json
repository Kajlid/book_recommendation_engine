  "description": "Bee works as a photo-finishing technician at a one-hour lab in lower Manhattan. To amuse herself, she duplicates (for her own collection) any titillating photographs that happen to pass through her hands. When pictures of a naked corpse are left for processing, Bee's curiosity goes into high gear.\"Shutterbug Follies\" is a comic murder mystery filled with unlikely coincidences, humorous misunderstandings, and hairbreadth escapes. Drawn with wit and imagination, it brings a classic genre totally up-to-date.",
