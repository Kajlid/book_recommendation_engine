  "description": "Rory MacGregon's father is dying and he needs to find the renowned Scottish healer before it's too late. The only problem is the healer defected to England years ago, and she'd rather kill herself than help the elder MacGregon. Just when Rory is running out of options, the healer's beautiful daughter agrees to go in her mother's stead. Darra Berchelaine heard about the ruthless, bloodthirsty savages from the north. When she learns that the devil Scots plan to abduct her mother, Darra must protect her at all cost â€” even if that means feigning co-operation and luring the brutish Highlanders away from the castle. But even as she schemes to escape from her enemies, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to the brawny Highland Chief. Suddenly Darra realizes that the handsome Highlander is neither an enemy nor a savage. And the only thing she needs to protect is her heart.",
