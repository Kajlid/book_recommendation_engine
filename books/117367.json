  "description": "The end of the year, the end of an era...  Lucky Miranda's finished strong. She has what she's always wanted:  Kane. Reformed, relationship-ready, really boring.  Harper has prom queen in the bag -- but sadly, her king has bailed.  Adam's busy tending to Beth, who is fully unable to move on.  It means leaving Reed, who, let's admit, has no future anyway.  Before they toss those caps in the air, there is a surprise or two left.  Have no fear.",
