  "description": "Words - just letters placed in a particular order; innocent and inert; yet how destructive they can become when combined in a certain order and wielded in the hands of the wrong person. As the speechwriter for a popular Senator, Jackie Alhman thrives on the power of words; yet within a matter of weeks, he loses everything important to him; his reputation, his job, his health, and maybe even his sanity... ...All because of the lie a young girl tells about him just for the sake of her own intent. But as the lie explodes into a life of its own, rumors are spawned and mutate, enveloping the liar herself in a nightmare and she too becomes the victim of her own words. Even with the opportunity for vindication, will Jackie's life ever recover from the grievous damage that has befallen him?",
