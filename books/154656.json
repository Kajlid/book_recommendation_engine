Enjoying sensual pleasures as they please, this group of alpha werewolves are the finest when it comes to protecting their hidden settlement. Guardians are the masters of self-control, taking pride in their authority and hard, muscled bodies. That all changes at the first scent of their mates. Their control snaps. The mating heat begins. This is their stories.  Born in the 1500's, Ryker has spent several lifetimes as a Wolf Town Guardian. He's been in and out of countless beds in the pursuit of sexual gratification, but he's all but given up on ever finding his mate. When the King of Wolf Town asks him to be his second in an upcoming challenge for his right to rule, Ryker has no qualms about agreeing. He has nothing left to lose, and he certainly has nothing left to live for... or so he thinks.  Fate knows differently. Ryker meets Amanda, and she captivates him with her big blue eyes, curvy body, and fragile air. Although she's not his mate, he's consumed with the need to have her. And with the upcoming challenge hanging over his head, Ryker is running out of time to seduce her.  But Amanda is harboring secrets of her own. Her life is hanging in the balance, and she's up against an unbeatable foe. It's the biggest fight of her life, and she has zero chance of surviving. She has to experience his sensual embrace... before it's too late.",
