  "description": "A beloved classic continues to reassure children. I Promise I'll Find You is a moving story that parents will love reading to and sharing with their children again and again. The fear of being separated from loved ones is a universal emotion. Consider a child who feels lost -- wandering away from home, becoming separated in a crowd, or feeling frightened in a new and strange place? I Promise I'll Find You is a perennial favorite of parents and children alike; it's like a comforting hug, a warm lap, a reassuring kiss, and the enveloping arms of a parent who pledges, no matter what \"I promise I'll find you.\" In eleven warm and simple verses, Heather Patricia Ward delivers a timeless message of reassurance. Sheila McGraw's imaginative illustrations show a devoted mother and an amusing dog as they search the world over for a lost at sea, in the city, over mountains, and even in outer space. Together, parents and children will enjoy the gentle language and the calm, reassuring pictures of this thoughtful and important book.",
