  "description": "Undercover police officer Zack McIntyre couldn't make sense of the beautiful, mysterious stranger who had saved him from death. She cared for him with skilled, gentle hands, awakening passions within him, but her haunted eyes spoke of secrets, lies and terrible fear. And he knew he couldn't rest unless he kept her safe from harmâ€”and made her his own.Endless months in the shadows, hiding from a killer, had taught Dr. Krystle Maller to trust no one. This strong, compelling man made her long to take shelter, just for a little while, in the circle of his arms. But could she trust even him with her deadly secret?",
