  "description": "Joseph grew up surviving the only way he knew how. Life gave him nothing and a cycle of crime meant he took what he needed. The day that life is snatched from him with a burst of fate, his soul that was bound for the depths of Hell ascends into Heaven. But Heaven comes with its own trials. His refusal to bend to Heaven’s order and the so-called freedom of Bliss leaves him discarded back on earth. Left to walk the streets he grew up in as a ghost, Joseph seizes a glimmer of hope when Sylvia crosses his path. Sylvia sees life for the twisted charade that it is. She’s straddled life and death for so long, she’s forgotten what it’s like to truly been seen and heard. Joseph sees behind the mask that has hidden her, but there is a limit to what Sylvia will reveal. Her painful truth remains guarded. As their worlds become entangled, they find a semblance of peace within one another. Sylvia must choose between burying her dark secrets or claiming Joseph for eternity. When death is not a sanctuary but a curse, Sylvia will not let the promise of a life she can call her own slip through her fingers.",
