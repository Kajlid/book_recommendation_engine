  "title": "Prime Suspect: The True Story of John Cannan, the Only Man Police Want to Investigate for the Murder of Suzy Lamplugh",
  "description": "Before being sentenced to three life terms for the murder of Bristol newlywed Shirley Banks in April 1989, John Cannan was convicted of the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh in 1986. After Cannan's conviction, the Lamplugh case was closed. Yet to this day, Cannan denies his involvement in the Lamplugh case and protests his innocence in the murder of Shirley Banksâ€”his appeal has been dismissed. Drawing on the latest psychological profiling knowledge developed in America by the FBI and, most importantly, an intense three-year correspondence with Cannan, this book provides a chillingly personal and comprehensive portrait of a complex and intelligent man.",
