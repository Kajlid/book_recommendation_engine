The more she navigates the alluring Lunar Realm and experiences the full extent of her etherwalking abilities, the closer she comes to the unseen force that has been pulling their strings all along.On the other side of the Cosmos, the city of Chethra has fallen into autocratic chaos. With the gangs rising to do Oberon’s bidding, Riona is left with no choice but to run for her life while Aramis, Orpheus, and Eirene follow Zephyr on the dark and bloody path to retribution.Find Me Between the Stars is a character-driven dark romantasy about the unremitting chase between fate and agency and a love that transcends them both.",
