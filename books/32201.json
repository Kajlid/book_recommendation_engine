  "description": "A family trip turns into an adventure of discovery for a curious and carefree sister and brother. While the two explore the natural wonders of the seashore, woods, and fields, their parents plant trees as an offering of thanks for all they have received. In Jewish tradition, this is called tikkun olam, or repairing the world. As the children settle down to sleep, they are lulled by the soothing sounds around them that become the refrain: \"good night, laila tov\"â€”the same comforting words in English and Hebrew that their parents recite to them every night at bedtime.Laurel Snyder's lilting poem is both a song of praise to the beauty of nature and a gentle lullaby. Jui Ishida's rich, jewel-tone illustrations illuminate the text and incorporate details that readers will love to discover.Book Details: \n   Format: Hardcover \n   Publication Date: 3/27/2012 \n   Pages: 32 \n   Reading Level: Age 3 and Up",
