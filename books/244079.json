  "description": "Teenager Rod Rodoggio is the sexiest man on earth. Being accosted by beautiful women and having clothes ripped from his body in pure sexual frenzy is a tribulation beyond belief. Arousing every woman who sets eyes on him may seem like heaven, but in reality, Rod is buckling under the responsibility. Above all, he yearns to consummate his lust for buxom beauty, Betty Bunz, but his carefully plotted seductions seem more unobtainable with each date.Rod's mundane life in the small town of Gulpo Plains ends when a vampire attacks him. And now he's blundering through the afterlife, trying to follow the laws of the Kingdom of the Undead. The Kingdom leaders want him to make luscious female vampires for their order, werewolves want him to procreate with mortal women, and just about everyone else wants him dead and gone. It isn't long before Rodney breaks a major cosmic law, which forces the leaders of the Kingdom into a drastic decision about his future.Hilarious and fast-paced, Rodney will have you weeping for the diminishing werewolf population, shouting hosannas over the triumphs of mortals against the undead, and laughing out loud at the loopy population of Gulpo Plains!",
