  "description": "One cool-as-ice veteran player One smoking hot rising star And little old me in the middle All wrapped up in an all-star ménage a trois  I’ve been sent to write a piece on two NHL stars Joel Palmer and Dante Drake On the ice they’re too hot to handle. In the locker room they can’t stand each other. And now it’s my job to get to the bottom of it all.  The rivals might have already dropped the gloves But I’ll give them something to bond over. I may be just a simple reporter, but I’m about to go all-in. Tonight, I’m down to puck.  This is a full-length romance, with steamy love scenes, a beautiful HEA and utterly no cliffhangers.",
