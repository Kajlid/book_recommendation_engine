  "title": "The Myth of Easy",
  "description": "Over the last couple of decades, complexity across work, life and technology has increased. While the emergence of new technologies has simplified life in many ways, it has brought work and life closer together as never before. This leads to surprising outcomes in the way we perceive complex scenarios which impacts our judgments and risk-taking. Now technologist, project manager, and entrepreneur Taz Lake draws on over 20+ years of experience to explore this concept through stories, examples and industry research. Through his thoughtful - and sometimes irreverent - approach he reveals insights into why we may be impacted by this gap in vision and how we may be able to use it to our advantage.",
