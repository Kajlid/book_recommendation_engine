  "description": "Joseph Parker Okay's debut collection of poetry and stories.\"this book made me confront the silently bad things about my relationships with the people closest to me. and then i realized at least i am not the only one who feels these types of things. at least i am not alone. i began to relate to this book so much i momentarily thought i had written it.\" —Sarah Jean Alexander, author of Wildlives (Big Lucks Books, 2015) and Loud Idiots (Second Books, 2016)\"If you feel shitty about America. If you hate cops. If you’ve seen the shine in the wolfish grin of capitalism. If your existence is contributing to the death of every living thing on this planet. If your dad is dead, and your heart is dead, and the future is dead. If you long for death and also for consciousness as the last glimmer of hope blinks out of existence, this book is for you.\" —Laura Theobald, author of What My Hair Says About You (Metatron, 2016)",
