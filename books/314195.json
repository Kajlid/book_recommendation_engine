  "description": "They say no one knows you like your best friend… but she has a lot to answer for with Dune.As I follow a man named Hambone through a biker bar filled with ominous tattoos, impressive beards, and enough leather to cover the Rockies, only one thought is in my mind--I’m going to kill Charlotte when this blind date is over. But once I see Dune, covered in sexy tattoos, impressive muscles, and exactly the right amount of leather, it’s hard to think at all. The man has a bad-boy look that won’t quit and a good-guy job as an accountant. Even I can do this math: him plus me, minus clothes.This good girl is about to get a little bit bolder in search of truth, justice, and a rebellious phase.Episode two of six in Dating Season.",
