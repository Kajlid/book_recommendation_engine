They’d found a better place. Could they move the whole town there, and would it be safer?They have a lead on Terry’s white whale, a secure military facility. What will they find and can they break in?Forsaken, the Vampires of the new world aren’t afraid of a Werewolf or her mate. But Terry and Char aren’t afraid of the Forsaken either.“I enjoy long involved series with multiple interacting characters And the Nomad series fits this to a T! Action, intrigue, insight and a view of post-apocalyptic America will leave you page turning deep into the night. Trust me, give this book and the others a try, it will be well worth it.” Amazon five-star review of the Terry Henry Walton Chronicles",
