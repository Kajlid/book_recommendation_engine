  "description": "A suspenseful, thrill ride with themes of personal sacrifice, dedication, and humility underscoring the action. A dream vacation turns deadly. No one plans to live a nightmare, but Richard Carson suspects that he and his wife Kaylie chose the worst possible location for their honeymoon vacation. Nestled in an isolated village with primitive accommodations, they hope to explore mysterious ancient ruins and learn about an advanced civilization that existed thousands of years ago. He and Kaylie thought exploring the archaeological remains of an ancient culture would provide safe adventure with terrific stories to tell family and friends. Soon, after arriving at the enclave, Richard becomes uncomfortable with the culture and customs of the hamlet and feels threatened by the hard-looking village men and guards. He begins counting the minutes until the exploration is over so they can return home. While experiencing the community and its residents, Richard determines the hamlet hides horrible secrets and concludes that he and Kaylie are not guests—they are prisoners. The village ruler, Adonis, a godlike bronze skinned giant enforces strict adherence to local customs and culture. Richard believes Adonis desires Kaylie and intends to take her as his own. Richard is determined to uncover the secrets of the hamlet, protect Kaylie, and—if possible—escape. The Orichalcum Rod is a suspense-filled adventure that builds in scope and intensity. The plot twists and turns will have the reader turning pages late into the night.",
