A duchess? Her?But when the Duke of Westleigh returns a decade later, he’s serious. He needs an heir, so he’s holding her to their marriage bargain—diamond ring, lavish gown, engagement ball, and more. Nothing Nicola says can dissuade him. When she calls him arrogant, he praises her honesty. When she makes social stumbles, he catches her fall. And when she gets exasperated, the duke can’t seem to get enough. For reasons she can’t fathom, he claims that no other woman will do.He’s betting he can change her mind, with logic and passion.She’s betting she can change his mind, just by being herself.And as the clock ticks down to a wedding day, neither is counting on losing their heart.",
