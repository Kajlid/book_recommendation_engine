  "description": "Twenty year old Harlow has spent the last two years avoiding the advances of club members, much to the annoyance of ‘Hawke’ the President of the Skulls. Harlow thinks leaving the Skulls will be easy after the death of her father but she couldn't be much further from the truth.  Wanting to start a new life for herself she finds her dream job as a tattooist, the only problem is the business is owned by the Aces, a rival club.  Ethan ‘Diesel’ Stokes is the VP of the Aces. He has had a turbulent life and is trying to put back the pieces since the death of his son, Shaun. Diesel doesn't have time for relationships but when he meets Harlow, the beautiful, tattooed, challenging new employee, he can’t help himself!  Harlow has only ever trusted one man but now her father is dead, can she learn to trust another and open her heart, knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken?  Can Diesel keep his promise to protect her and avenge her father’s death?Note to readers: This is not your normal MC series. The Aces are an MC with alpha males but the members do not shy away from the fact that they are husbands, fathers and lovers with feelings. If you don’t like a biker who cares and respects his woman, then this isn't a book for you.I want to take the time to mention that I’m from the United Kingdom and use UK spellings.To receive the full experience of the Aces MC Series it is recommended to read the stories in the following order:Diesel – Book 1Duke - Book 2Paige and Chloe - Book 2.5 Spike - Book 3Amy - Book 3.5Locke - Book 4Jayden - Book 4.5",
