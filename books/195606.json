  "description": "Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN: B00QQS6C9SShaking his 'master' snow globe, Father Christmas searched for a solution to the biggest pain in the butt he’d suffered from in years. The fact that Holly’s personality was completely his fault didn’t help. Everyone at the North Pole was suffering, including Holly because he’d had a few too many sherries before magicking her into existence to help with the Christmas rush.Somewhere on Earth, there had to be someone who had a Christmas wish to spend some time with a cute, pain loving, sarcastic and bolshie blonde girl, who had a significant chip on her shoulder.Father Christmas chuckled to himself as an image of a tall, brown haired man appeared in his globe. Oh yes, Kian Thompson had been a very good boy for quite a few years now, and he deserved a reward.
