  "description": "There’s something about a man in uniform… but there’s something about a woman in one, too. When Hallie McCabe meets Philip Johnston at a picnic, she is drawn to his integrity. He is a gentleman—and an officer. Aware of the code against fraternization between officers and enlisted, Hallie hides her Navy status, hopeful she and her secret will stay hidden on their enormous aircraft carrier, at least until she can figure out a way for them to sail off into the sunset together.Caught in an emotional firestorm, Hallie faces a future without the man she loves, a career-shattering secret from the past, and the burden of being the one person who can prevent a terrorist attack on the ship she has sworn to protect with her life. Prepare to set sail for the Persian Gulf with a crew of 4,999 sailors and officers—and one terrorist in search of his own kind of Paradise.FORGIVE & FORGET is the first book in the Love in the Fleet series by Heather Ashby. Watch for the next one, FORGET ME NOT, December 3, 2013.",
