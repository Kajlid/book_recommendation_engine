Trade lines have re-opened, the city streets bustle with life, and Vexis now sits behind the bars of the most sophisticated magical prison ever conceived.Spurred by the death of their beloved brother, Antherion, the dragons of the north arrive at the Magisterium to issue an ultimatum: turn Vexis over or face destruction.Meanwhile, Taro searches for his sister's whereabouts. With few clues and fewer allies, he travels to the hostile nation of Helia where the use of magic is punishable by death. To survive, he'll require the help of an unlikely (and unstable) ally.However, all is not as it seems, and once again Taro finds himself playing both sides in a dangerous game of lies, treachery, and terrorism. He must decide how far heâ€™s willing to go to protect his family, while preventing a mad tyrant from using an ancient magical artifact to cement his power.",
