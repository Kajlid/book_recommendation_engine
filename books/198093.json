  "description": "Tom Byng and Fred Smith believe that nothing beats a succulent burger with all the trimmings. It's worth getting the barbecue out for, the friends over, the family round, and the apron on. Byron is full of burgers as well as lots of other American dishes like macaroni and cheese, BBQ ribs, meatballs, Cobb salad, cheesecake, and milkshakes. It's for burger lovers, barbecue lovers, hosts and hostesses, family and friends, and for anyone who knows that the key to good food is to keep it simple and do it well.",
