  "title": "Det Sociala Trycket",
  "description": "The Pressure of Social Structure, (Swedish: \"Det sociala trycket\") is the first published work by the Mexican-Swedish writer Jespero Quemar. Its dynamic narrative transcends classical storytelling to produce a highly original work. The narrative arc is the account of the daily life of a student in Stockholm, and the hardships encountered as the student fail in his attempt to move forward with life. (It has been suggested that the story is based on the life of the author, but Quemar has declined to comment on those claims). In addition to describing the people that he sees, and the social intricacies that drives the seemingly unstoppable time progression, Quemar discusses various historical events and their impact on the social relations that he struggles with throughout the book.",
