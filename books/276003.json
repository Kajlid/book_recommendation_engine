  "title": "Crazy for Casseroles: 275 All-American Hot-Dish Classics",
  "description": "Crazy for Casseroles is the final word on American casseroles. Acclaimed food writer James Villas is a man on a mission, presenting all manner of casseroles from every corner of America that feature meat, poultry, game, seafood, or vegetables, plus appetizer, breakfast, bread, and dessert casseroles. All can be prepared ahead of time and popped in the oven for warm-up, which makes them ideal for entertaining, potluck, or weeknight dinners. They can be simple and homey, like Texas Beef Hash Casserole; No-Nonsense Spinach Casserole; or Sunday Sausage, Apple, and Cheese Strata. But they can also be fancy and fabulous like Venison and Wild Mushroom Bake or Deviled Crabmeat Ramekins.",
