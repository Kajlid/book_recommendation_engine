Fast forward years later and she’s established herself as a first-class hacker, working for an elite agency—with benefits.

How dare Antoine think he can walk back into her life? And how will she explain his reappearance to their son?  It would be easier to shoot him, but she can’t, which means, Bad Boy Inc. operative Devon isn’t allowed to shoot him either. Speaking of, why is Devon at the ski resort anyway? Tanya doesn’t believe for one minute that he’s on holiday, and when he needs her to pretend to be his girlfriend for a top-secret mission, she finds it only too easy to imagine the role becoming real.
