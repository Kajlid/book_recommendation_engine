But after encountering Q, she wants to give love a second chance.When Q discloses his resistance plan, it's up to Hilde to choose between her protected life without him or the constant threat of torture if she supports him in his fight against injustice.She has witnessed enough of the Nazi government's violent acts to be appalled by the new political power, but will this be enough for an ordinary girl to do the extraordinary and stand beside the man she loves in a time of total desolation?This World War II story is based on the true events of one couple's struggle for happiness while battling a war against their own leaders.",
