  "description": "Four years ago, after winning Olympic medals gold, Justin retired from swimming, and he's been floundering ever since. For years swimming was everything, but his Coach waved him off once he'd retired. The Fourth of July finds him contemplating doing something stupid, so Justin calls up Coach. To his surprise, Chris answers.When Justin retired, Chris cut all ties with the swimmer he'd fallen in love with, wanting to make sure that Justin didn't stay with him as a lover just because it was the easy thing. He's been waiting for a long time for Justin to come back to him, so when Justin calls, he immediately offers to let Justin back into his life, and into his arms.When he finds out that Justin is lost, drowning in a pool of self-doubt and the belief that his happy years are behind him, Chris realizes maybe he made a mistake letting go so suddenly. He brings Justin to his home, and gives in to the urges they’ve ignored for a long time. Now Chris can love Justin, give him rules and structure that Justin needs. As long as he can convince Justin that it’s really love. Can Justin and Chris put the last four years behind them and find themselves a golden moment?",
