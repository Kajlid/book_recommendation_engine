  "title": "The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders",
  "description": "The title \"The Good Old Days\" (\"Schone Zeiten\" in German) comes from the cover of a private photo album kept by concentration camp commandant Kurt Franz of Treblinka. This gruesomely sentimental and unmistakably authentic title introduces an disturbing collection of photographs, diaries, letters home, and confidential reports created by the executioners and sympathetic observers of the Holocaust. \"The Good Old Days\" reveals startling new evidence of the inhumanity of recent twentieth century history and is published now as yet another irrefutable response to the revisionist historians who claim to doubt the historic truth of the Holocaust.",
