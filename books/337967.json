  "description": "Control. It’s my favorite word because I always keep it at the top of my mind, striving to maintain it in all aspects of life. But she’s taken that from me. Not with a word or an action. Just from the sight of her. She’s gorgeous, with a magnetic pull that tries to guide me right to her. I want to own her, possess her, lie in bed with her on top of me so as much of her skin as humanly possible is touching mine. Keep her in my home and never let her go. But as much of a sick man as I am, something inside me pumps the breaks. I would never hurt her. Never. She is an angel sent from heaven, a gift. And she will be mine. But will I put our budding relationship in danger by continuing my path of destruction? I stalk the night looking for the dregs of society, anyone who would hurt a woman deserves the punishment I dole out. But can I keep her in the dark while I let my dark side roam free?",
