  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves, HEA] Harper Brooks refuses to be anybody except who he is, and who he is shocks most people. When he meets a gorgeous man at a sidewalk cafe, he has no problem telling him exactly what he wants - in vivid detail. When Memphis rejects him, Harper hides his hurt behind flippant words and a flash of indignation, but forgetting the man might prove impossible. Memphis doesn't know what to think when he's propositioned by an imp with dreamy blue eyes and an ass to die for. He doesn't do relationships - ever - and one night spent in the gorgeous man's bed isn't enough. Memphis wants more. He just knows he can't have it. Nights of passion could lead to the sexy little diva dying at the hands of Memphis's beast. When Harper gets kidnapped by a madman, Memphis runs to the rescue, and in doing so reveals his darkest secret. But there is a lot more going on than either of them know, especially when the bond between them creates more than either of them expected. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
