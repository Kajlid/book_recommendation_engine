  "description": "SpencerWhose brilliant idea was it to build university housing next to one of Franklin U’s most notorious party frats?I’m a real student—the kind who actually came to college to learn, not some dumb frat bro who sees Franklin U as a four-year challenge to consume the most booze and throw out the best pick-up line.Their all-hours lifestyle is driving me crazy. Not to mention, the jerks keep taking my assigned parking spot.But the worst offender might be Cory Ingram. Sure, he has a smile that could melt a polar ice cap, but no way will I ever be one of his minions. I’m pretty sure I made that clear when I blew my top at him. So I have no idea why he’s suddenly everywhere around me, turning on the charm like I might actually fall for it.Nope. Not gonna happen.CoryFrom the first day I set foot on Franklin U’s campus, everything has been golden. I have a ton of friends, endless parties to be the life of, and whoever I want in my bed on any given night. Sure, I’m a shameless party boy, but I’m not a jerk. Ask anyone. Seriously.Even the crotchety old groundskeeper waves and smiles at me when I pass.Then there’s Spencer Crow. I’ve never seen a guy’s face get so red over a parking spot. Even when I try to make it right, he proceeds to give me the tongue-lashing of a lifetime—which is about the moment I notice that, in addition to being irrationally irate, he’s also crazy hot.My friends think I’ve finally met the one person I can’t seduce…Bet you I can.",
