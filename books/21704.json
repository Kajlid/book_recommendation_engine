  "title": "Dharma, Color, and Culture: New Voices in Western Buddhism",
  "description": "For the first time ever, the words of Western Buddhist practitioners of color are recognized and gathered together in one groundbreaking anthology. Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, Charles Johnson, Thich Nhat Hanh, and twenty-five other contributors share their unique perspectives on the fundamental Buddhist concepts of suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering. Together they represent the entire spectrum of Buddhist tradition.Thought-provoking and passionate, Dharma, Color, and Culture forges a new path in our understanding of the simple truths of Buddhism and their relevance for all of us. Essays by Latino, Asian, African-American, and Native American Buddhist practitioners, lay people, and Dharma teachers address the connection between diversity, racism, and Buddhism at four the personal, the interpersonal, the institutional, and the cultural. Recognizing that attention to the pain of racism is essential, the overarching theme of this work is how the Dharma becomes an effective antidote to the suffering and a vehicle for healing and liberation.",
