  "description": "\"Hell if I'd let some dead woman get the best of me.\" It was supposed to be a break. A few days in Lightning Cove, Maine -- a very small town with a very old history -- and a chance to get to know Special Agent Calla Frost better. She swore it was just a routine check-in with a research team. No monsters, no magic. But when Gideon arrives in Lightning Cove, things are just a little too perfect. And even before the first dead body -- the one that won't talk to him -- he realizes that nothing and no one is what it seems in this place. Including Calla Frost.",
