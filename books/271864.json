  "description": "When Kate first sees Jarrod she senses that he is special and that like her, he has magical powers. But she also knows he is completely unaware of his gift and will be difficult to persuade. Kate's grandmother realises that Jarrod and his family have an ancient curse placed upon them which they must tackle before Jarrod's life, along with the lives of his parents and little brother, can become happy, peaceful and free of the troubles that have plagued them. He must learn to use his gift, and when he does, Kate and Jarrod find themselves in a time hundreds of years old, and very very far from home pitched in the greatest battle of their lives. A fabulous book with the perfect combination of pace, intrigue, suspense, utterly entrancing characters, and romance.",
