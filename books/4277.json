  "title": "The Elusive Neutrino: A Subatomic Detective Story",
  "description": "In The Elusive Neutrino: A Subatomic Detective Story, University of Chicago physicist Nickolas Solomey takes his readers through the mind-bending world of particle physics, using research involving neutrinos as a navigational tool. Solomey's discussion spans the history of particle physics from the discovery of radioactivity to present theoretical speculation about the mass and origin of elementary particles. He describes the scientific principles relevant to the neutrino search through the efforts of the scientists who discovered them, sharing their fears and triumphs and making The Elusive Neutrino a human story in addition to a scientific one. He also powerfully demonstrates the synergy of experiment and theory that drives modern science.",
