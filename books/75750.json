  "description": "In this engrossing memoir, Christine Berghoef takes us on a journey exploring the simplicity and complexity of faith. Growing up certain she knew what life with God entailed, Berghoef soon found out otherwise. This vivid account, beginning in a conservative religious subculture that valued knowing the \"right\" answers over asking questions, will take readers on a voyage beyond dogmatism. No topic is off-limits, no stone is left unturned in this quest to discover what one really can know about God and faith, life and politics. In her winsome and witty style, the author candidly reveals to us her own doubts and struggles, which will leave you at times laughing, at other times in tears. Cracking the Pot is sure to provoke deep thinking and needed conversation about the substance of faith!",
