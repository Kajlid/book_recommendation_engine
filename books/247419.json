  "description": "Would marrying his best friend to get his hands on a quaint, small-town bookstore really be that bad?  Declan never expected to ask himself that question, but when an inheritance from a distant great uncle offers him the chance at a brand new start in a brand new town—with the catch that he has to marry before he can have it—he’s forced to consider it.  Ash has been Declan’s best friend since college, and he’s the only person Declan can trust to help him. Getting him to agree to marry him is one thing, but dealing with the way it changes their relationship is something else entirely.  New surroundings leave Declan confused by how he really feels about Ash, the freedom of Hope Springs awakening something in him that he hadn’t known was there before. Ash is happy to help him out, but what started out as a simple question soon becomes something much more...  Something New is the first book in a new series set in Hope Springs! It stands alone, has a HEA, and does not end with a cliffhanger. However, it does contain: a room full of second-hand books, a ridiculous will condition, cheating at video games, explicit sex scenes, and doughnuts.",
