  "description": "BRENDAN  I’ve done pretty damn well in hiding my feelings for her over the years but having Meghan under the same roof as me, and only feet from my bed makes it hard to control myself.  The truth is when it comes to Meghan I don’t want to practice self-control. I love her.  MEGHAN  I’ve known him nearly my whole life. He’s cocky, gets under my skin, but is gorgeous and caring, too. And as much as I want to say it doesn’t affect me, I’d be lying.  The truth is I love him, and I don’t know if that’ll end up destroying me.  BRENDAN  She needed a place to stay, and now she’s got a roommate … me. But I’m about to show her that I want more than a friendly arrangement. Too much time has passed, and I’m done waiting. I’m ready to step up and be a man.  I’ve never been good at sharing, and when it comes to her, she’s mine.   Warning: You like short, hot, straight to the point stories? Do you want drama-free sexiness that leaves nothing to the imagination? Do you want a story that is pretty unbelievable, but gives you the warm fuzzies at the same time? Well then, leave your panties at the door because that’s what’s going down in this quickie.",
