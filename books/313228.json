  "description": "ASHER Hockey, studying, and school runs. That’s my life now. After a tragic accident that took our parents’ lives, it’s up to me and my big brother to take care of our five younger siblings. In between burning their meals and keeping them from killing each other, I’m supposed to get a college degree. It’s hard when I don’t have time to breathe let alone study, and if I don’t get my grades up, I’m in danger of losing the one thing that makes me happy: my spot on the hockey team. Which is why when the new equipment manager offers to tutor me, I really can’t afford to say no. Even though I should. He’s Coach’s son and way too tempting. KOLE As this year’s equipment manager for Dad’s hockey team, I’m expected to deal with sweaty jock straps and herding hockey players to their rooms at away games. The job is easy, but babysitting Asher Dalton is not supposed to be a part of it. So why, when his brother asks me to keep an eye on him, do I agree? Why, when he’s struggling in classes, do I offer to help? And why, when we’re studying, do I suggest a reward system that lands us squarely in bed? Asher's trouble, I know he is. But there's something about him that makes it impossible to stay away.",
