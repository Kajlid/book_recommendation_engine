In the dead of the night, Chloe packs her bags and runs for a better life, heading west of Toronto in search of something better.

He is happy and his heart has never been damaged by the choices of others the way Chloe's has. Galen has not lost and loss is all Chloe knows. For Chloe, trust is rare. But for Galen, trust is natural. Never having seen a beaten heart like Chloe's, Galen is determined to break through the walls she holds in place to protect herself and prove that the world is not filled with pain, but that the happiness she dreams of is attainable.",
