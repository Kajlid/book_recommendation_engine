  "description": "Yet another right-on-target collection of comic strips from Dilbert, the world-renowned fictional cubicle worker of engineer-turned-cartoonist Scott Adams. Rarely is there an office these days that doesn't have at least one Dilbert strip tacked up somewhere that employees gather to either laugh off or lament the sometimes inane practices of top-level management. Think you're surrounded by morons at work? Dilbert, and his canine companion Dogbert, are the consultants you should visit next.",
