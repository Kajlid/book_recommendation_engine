  "description": "Eden is an underground, self-sufficient complex that has withstood the zombie apocalypse for over thirty years. Standing in the control room, there to take over the running of it from his father, Mark quickly realises this is more than a handover. He's about to find out that Eden has secrets. Dark secrets.  Secrets that reveal the truth about the apocalypse.  Secrets that change the way he looks at his father forever.  Secrets that change the way he looks at everything forever.      What the reviewers say about Eden:  “Eden is deep, dark, and thought provoking.”  “The plot and pacing are wonderfully constructed, and the characters’ emotions come through incredibly clearly.”  “… stop wasting time reading the awesome reviews, grab this book, and see for yourself. You won’t be disappointed!”  “It ran the gamut of emotions; anger, surprise, shock and heartbreak. I was in tears at the end of the story.”  “Two thumbs up!”  “You need to read this, like, now.”  “I could not have asked for a better glimpse into this under-utilised facet of the zombie apocalypse.”",
