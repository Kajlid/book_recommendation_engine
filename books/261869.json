  "description": "Imagine the bumbling Inspector Clouseau on a farm and you will understand what it was like for a city family that moved to Crooked Creek Farm. From herding cattle with firecrackers to runaway horses, nothing went right for them. Noah would have been proud of the collection of animals that made Crooked Creek Farm look more like a children's petting zoo than a serious farm. Take a hilarious look at farm life like it was never meant to be.",
