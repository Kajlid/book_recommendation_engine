  "description": "“Love had been stolen from me for reasons entirely my fault. But then a miracle happened, and Pim gave me something I thought was lost forever. She gave me a love I’d earned. Love that ruined me. Love that made me hopelessly hers…” Once upon a time, I didn’t think I’d ever be normal. Now, I’m talking and trusting, and it’s all thanks to Elder. He gave me my life back, and I gave him my heart, but love stories like ours are never simple. I did something to protect him. He did something to survive me. We screwed up. And now, it’s no longer just about us. It’s about safety, sanctuary, and sin.",
