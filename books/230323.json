Soon Victor is writing down everything that happens as he tries to solve the mystery of the letters, conquer his fear of jumping off the high diving board at the pool, and figure out what is going on between his divorced parents.Things change when he meets D, however. A good diver and an assertive detective, she helps Victor to stop writing his life and start living it.",
