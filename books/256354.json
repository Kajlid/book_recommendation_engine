  "description": "Business Owner Theo Barnes inherited millions of dollars, stocks, bonds, companies, real estate, and Beskytte Frøet from his grandfather. With a net worth of over a billion dollars, life should be sweet, right? That’s what Theo thought until he learned the same person who murdered his grandfather’s attorney plans to kill him and everyone he loves. It’s a short list. Imani, his lady, tops that list. Even without his inheritance, he’d never tuck tail and run from anyone who thought it was cool to kill an unarmed old man. Imani Randall would love Theo with or without his inheritance. After the hell she went through with her ex-husband, his rough, straight-up, personality suits her just fine. She decides to work alongside him in his newly acquired companies and is swept away by the changes his wealth and inheritance bring. With enemies gunning for them, she agrees to keep their engagement a secret as she falls deeper in love with this complicated man. Theo’s grandfather had his fingers in a lot of pies and there are those who expect Theo to continue in the old man’s footsteps. Except Theo’s not his grandfather and has no interest in doing those things. All he wants is to be left alone with his woman to live an uncomplicated life and he’s willing to fight for that right. This is Book 2 in the Seed Series. Book 1 is Protect the Seed.",
