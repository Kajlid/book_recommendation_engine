  "description": "Gemma Harlow is a full-time Vegas casino cocktail waitress and a part-time college student, living each day like the one before, simply because she has nothing better to do. When Gemma walks into work one Friday evening to find a bachelor party underway, she puts on her apron, grabs her serving tray, and accepts the challenge of being their server for the evening. What she doesnâ€™t realize is how much her life will change by the end of her shift when Daniel, the hottest guy at the party, invites her out for a late dinner. Gemma finds herself in unfamiliar territory as she drops her guard and follows her heart to places she never thought possible, despite knowing very little about Daniel and why he moved back to Las Vegas. When his true identity is revealed, Gemma must come to terms with her feelings and deal with the obstacles that her decisions create. Intended for mature audiences over the age of 18, this erotic and sexy romance will make you believe in true love at first sight.",
