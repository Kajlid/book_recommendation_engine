Life taught her that she can rely only on herself for survival, and in turn, it’s made her cold, calculating, manipulative, and just a little vindictive. She knows they’re out there searching for her. She knows someone will always be right behind her, but a life spent running and hiding is exhausting. A life spent fighting and outsmarting her pursuers takes a toll.Jersey is a soulless hunter. As far as the world is concerned, his identity was erased right alongside his humanity. Now, he works for an organization that pays him to locate and return treasured and sought-after things for questionable people. Giving up any remaining emotional connection to the world was a small price to pay in exchange for becoming the most efficient at what he does. He is assigned the jobs that so many others have failed. There’s no length to which he will not go to find success.Their collision is explosive when Jersey finds himself face-to-face with someone else who’s used to living in isolation, someone else who’s used to surviving by any means necessary.
