  "description": "First the floods consumed the Earth.Then the Syndicate took everything from me.My childhood, my first love—my humanity.Before I was born, the rising oceans consumed the last land on Earth. All I’ve ever known is a fight for survival. But the Syndicate wants to change this, genetically adapting children to fit this harsh new world—no matter how many lives are sacrificed in the process.When little, I was ripped from my home to take part in the Syndicate's cruel experiments. But I broke free. Now, at the age of seventeen, I'm hunted for my unique ability to thrive beneath the ocean's depths, but also because I rescue others held captive by the Syndicate. Every day is a predictable struggle, the same watery grave of fears. Everything changes on a routine patrol of a Syndicate vessel, however, when I stumble across two people—a highly sought-after prisoner who was designed to be more powerful than myself and a young man from my past, one my heart never forgot. These two ghosts from my past will most likely jeopardize all the work I’ve achieved against the Syndicate. But I can’t leave them behind. Even if I lose everything in saving them, including my very life.Reckless is a dystopian adventure packed with action, romance, and wonder.Note: Reckless is a re-brand of the novel, NeverSea with improved editing and adjusted character naming.",
