  "description": "Zelda and Joe have a normal life, a normal house, normal friends…everything is normal. They aren’t unhappy, nor are they truly happy. Their life is like a black and white TV show from the 50’s. Neither of them suspected that a faceless encounter in a darkened theater would change their lives forever.",
