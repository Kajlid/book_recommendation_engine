  "description": "A dark, chilling Psychological Crime Thriller for fans of Paula Hawkins, Graeme Cameron, Gillian Flynn and S. J. Watson.  Even though I've seen the newspapers, read the headlines and watched the television reports, it still doesn't feel real. I still can't quite believe he's so damaged.  A serial killer is terrorising Berkshire. Everyone is hiding something. Kira: 'I could kill that man.' Nathan: 'Some secrets can destroy you.' Jonathan: 'I'm not innocent. We're all guilty of something.'  Each and every one of us is haunted by something. It's what makes us human. We all sleep in darkness. It's not the dark you should fear though, it's the light. That's why some things are better left unsaid. Some wounds are too painful to re-open.",
