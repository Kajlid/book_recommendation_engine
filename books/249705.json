  "description": "In this collection, Audre Lorde gives us poems that explore \"differences as creative tensions, and the melding of past strength / pain with future hope / fear; the present being the vital catalyst, the motivating forceâ€•activism.\" As Marilyn Hacker has written, \"Black, lesbian, mother, cancer survivor, urban woman: none of Lorde's selves has ever silenced the others; the counterpoint among them is often the material of her strongest poems.\"",
