  "description": "Timothy Wright’s life revolves around stories. Ever since he had his accident, books have been his only window to the outside. The characters inside are family—he’s sailed the high seas in quest of a white whale, plunged through rabbit holes, and been scolded by the ghost of Christmas present. But when a cheerful Veridan maid comes into his family’s employment, he begins to remember that life could be more than what happens between the pages of his books. In fact, it may be that of all the adventures he’s called home, the most frightening, exhilarating, and rewarding one is yet to come.",
