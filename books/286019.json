  "title": "Brief Encounter",
  "description": "The simple story of an unconsummated love affair between a suburban doctor and a middle-class housewife, 'Brief Encounter' can claim to be the most romantic film in British cinema. Based by Noel Coward upon his 1936 short play 'Still Life', the screenplay conjures up the drab, emotionally restrained world of post-war Britain better than almost any other literary text. It was nominated for an Oscar at the 1947 Academy Awards. Brief Encounter is perhaps the most moving and fully realized of all David Lean's films. This volume contains a specially commissioned introduction by Coward's biographer, Sheridan Morley.",
