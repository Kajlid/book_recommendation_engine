  "title": "Return of the Christian: Vol I: The Stand",
  "description": "Christians in America have taken a severe beating across the political spectrum in the last several decades. John Feet does not sugarcoat the main reason for this demise. Christians carry the light of the Holy Spirit. Darkness cannot overtake light; the only way darkness can advance is if light recedes. But John doesn’t stop there. Return of the Christian is nothing short of a manifesto, a call to action to all Christian citizens of the United States of America. John details a biblical plan of action for Christians to stand firm against the unbeliever’s onslaught. By standing first, Christians will then advance toward their goal and finally engage in a massive spiritual counter-offensive of biblical proportions.The Return of the Christian series is designed to encourage and remind American Christians of their duty to stand on the entire Gospel at all times as they retake lost territory to restore the nation as a Beacon on a Hill.John Feet holds a BA in Biblical Studies from The College at Southeastern and earned his MA in Christian Studies from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He is a U.S. Navy Veteran and was awarded the Presidential Service Badge for his service in the White House Situation Room under President Reagan’s Administration.",
