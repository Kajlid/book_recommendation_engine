One kiss, and three seconds, and no matter how many boys I kissed, they didn’t make me feel like he did. The problem? He belonged to my best friend. I kissed him first. She kissed him last. He once chose me, and I chose her. When everything in my life goes wrong, somehow he’s always there to make it right. And as my best friend pulls away, he finds ways to get closer. I know that we are just waiting for three seconds before everything changes again. Expected Release  Feb. 2020 For 3 Seconds is an angsty NA forbidden/ sports/ best friends boyfriend romance",
