  "description": "A heartbreaking tale that never loses sight of hope, or our remarkable ability to access and claim our own resilience.Poignant and riveting, Myths of a Merciful God takes us on the unforgettable journey of one woman's quest to overcome unimaginable loss. At the heart of the story is a profoundly difficult question: How does one come back from a tragedy as unspeakable as the death of a child?Through the literal and figurative journey upon which this child's mother embarks in the aftermath of this loss, and the people she encounters along the way, Myths of a Merciful God explores the concepts of divine retribution and intervention versus the gaping silence of an indifferent universe, moral turpitude versus the virtue of well-kept secrets, and whether religion - or its absence - helps, hinders, or makes no difference in one's ability to find a way back toward wholeness.",
