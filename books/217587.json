  "description": "Two brothers...and the one woman who claimed their hearts...Ash Whittier had barely returned to Oakland's harbor, when he was arrested for arson, insurance fraud--and murder.  His only hope was his brother Cabot, the best lawyer in Oakland, and Cabot's young wife, Charlotte, the town's first lady lawyer.  He knew he could count on his brother to rescue him, just as he'd done before.  The last time had put Cabot in a wheelchair...This time there was Charlotte, whose no-nonsense suits weren't doing much to hide her needy heart.All Charlotte had ever wanted was to be a lawyer.  Cabot had given her the chance, and so much more, when he'd married her.  He'd taught her to dress like a lawyer, think like a professional, and act like a man.  But somehow her brother-in-law still saw the lace beneath the starch.  And suddenly being a lawyer wasn't the only thing she wanted anymore.They were his lawyers, determined to save his life.  But as his trial approached, it became clear that if Ash won his case, someone would still have to lose.  .  .  .",
