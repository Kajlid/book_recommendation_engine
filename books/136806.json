  "description": "Here is Staten Island at its liveliest. Through an outstanding selection of images coupled with an insightful narrative, this New York City borough emerges, with friends and families at play, at work, and in between. Staten Island once hosted noteworthy visitors from the Wild West, such as Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley. It served as an arena for politics and prominent political figures, including Kennedy, Rockefeller, Nixon, and Eisenhower. It was also an arena for sports of many sorts--baseball, football, tennis, bowling, racing, and hunting. Within this remarkable collection, these everyday scenes and many others come to life before our eyes, inviting us to experience moments that have been captured in time.",
