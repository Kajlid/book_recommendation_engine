  "description": "bell hook's fourth book crosses disciplinary boundaries in major debates on postmodern theory, cultural criticism, and the politics of race and gender. She values postmodernism's insights while warning that the fashionable infatuation with \"discourse\" about \"difference\" is dangerously detachable from the struggle we must all wage against racism, sexism, and cultural imperialism.",
