  "description": "Albert Corde, dean of a Chicago college, is unprepared for the violent response to his expos√© of city corruption. Accused of betraying his city, as well as being a racist, he journeys to Bucharest, where his mother-in-law lies dying, only to find corruption rife in the Communist capital. Switching back and forth between the two cities, The Dean's December represents Bellow's \"most spirited resistance to the forces of our time\" (Malcolm Bradbury).",
