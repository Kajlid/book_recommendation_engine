Imagine how you would feel to be suddenly shipwrecked on a planet 500 light-years from the Solar System - and to walk into a 19th century, Old West frontier town! And then, to really shake your senses, you find the local citizens - in tremendous red bandanas, ten-gallon hats, chaps, high-heel boots and spurs - are pistol-toting teddy bears!",
