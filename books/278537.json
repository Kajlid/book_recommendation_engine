  "description": "This new release, Child of Promise, is the final book in the series.  Beth MacKay, the daughter of Culdee Creek's owner, returns home after completing medical school to take over the aging Doc Childress's practice. Reluctantly, her life and heart become entwined with that of Grand View's Episcopalian priest, Noah Starr. But Noah struggles with his faith and calling since his wife died and his daughter, Emily, was disabled with cerebral palsy due to the difficult birth.  When Beth becomes embroiled in a spousal abuse case between two of Noah's parishioners, she encourages the battered woman to leave her husband for her own safety. Noah cautions the woman to try to work things out, and when the abuse ends in tragedy, it's the last straw for the already-doubtful priest. Despondent and shaken, he announces his resignation to the church. Only with Beth's faith and love, and a little help from the community, can Noah find his way back to the life and calling God has always intended for him.",
