  "description": "Maria De La Torre is a survivor. Her life has not been paved with streets of gold...but with blood and sacrifice. She may have been there for her soul sister in the Trinity Trilogy but this story is about her life. The life she chooses. The same life someone from her past is trying to take away.  Elijah is the last man in the entire world Maria should be with. He's a dark, gritty, lawless bounty hunter--the exact opposite of the man she loved and lost, the man who gave up everything for her. Only Elijah is not the type of guy to back down. He's used to getting what he wants and he's set his sights on the raven-haired seductress.  Time is not on Maria and Elijah's side. There's a new threat to the soul sister, one Maria never thought she'd have to face again. And this time, of the stakes are life and death.  Maria quickly learns that the things she wants most in this lifetime may just be the things that have the power to destroy her.",
