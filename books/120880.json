  "description": "Everyone in Heston Lake is obsessed with Heston U’s hockey team except me. I’d rather do a live reading from the spiciest romance on my bookshelf  than talk hockey.I could ignore my college town transforming into a sports bar during hockey season, but there’s no escaping the players fueling their obsession. My twin brother…and his best friend on the team.#22. Alex Keller. Talented winger. The handsome hotshot player every girl on campus dreams of.And my fake boyfriend for the next two weeks.His idea, not mine.I doubt he knew I existed—until he stops the football team from teasing me. All it takes is a pet name and his strong arm around me. Playing along is my only option.I’m ready to go back to my side of the divide between nerds like me and athletes like Alex, but he refuses. He’s determined to protect me for real, even if our relationship is fake.\nThe only problem is…he’s too good at pretending. Our act fools everyone—including me.\nNote: Trick Play first appeared in the Billionaires and Babes anthology. This version has been expanded with additional content.For more swoony hockey romances, continue the Heston U Hotshots series:#1 - Iced Out#2 - Switch Off#3 - Penalty Play#4 - Lucky Shot#5 - Line Shift",
