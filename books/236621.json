  "description": "With Rumpole Rests His Case, legions of fans welcomed back the curmudgeonly London barrister they had loved for years and they are eager for more. The six new stories in Rumpole and the Primrose Path find Horace Rumpole despite a heart attack that left him at death's door in the previous volume deftly parrying everything from the admonitions of his wife, Hilda, to the vagaries of his legal colleagues and their new director of marketing, Luci. With her cell phone, corporate jargon, glossy brochures, and plans to give their chambers a new image, Luci presumes Rumpole is soon to expire, and has been planning his memorial service. But the witty and irreverent Rumpole, sharp as ever, is far from hanging up his wig!Contents:“Rumpole and the Primrose Path”“Rumpole and the New Year’s Resolutions”“Rumpole and the Scales of Justice”“Rumpole and the Right to Privacy”“Rumpole and the Vanishing Juror”“Rumpole Redeemed”",
