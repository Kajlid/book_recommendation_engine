Lights sailing across Nevada's desert night sky in fluid and rapid motions that are impossible for even the most technologically advanced aircraft. They have encountered those responsible for the unexplained. Men in black suits, white lab coats, and military uniforms who do not want their secrets exposed.Brought together by fate - or phenomena - heiress Jennifer Quinn, journalist Timika Mars, pilot Alan Young, and ex-Marine Barry Regis are bonded by the incidents they've witnessed, hunted by agents of a wealthy corporate cabal desperate for unimaginable power, and possessed of extraordinary abilities they do not understand, much less control.Now, they're on a mission of their own. As Alan and Barry test the limits of their strange gifts inside the military complex known as Dreamland, Jennifer and Timika begin a quest to locate an ancient tablet that may hold the answers to humanity's greatest question.Are we alone in the universe?Based on the accounts of credible UAP observers drawn from expert sources within the scientific, military and intelligence communities, 'Sekret Machines: A Fire Within' is the second fiction book within a multimedia project that has become part of the most ambitious investigation of the phenomenon in history.Â©2018 To the Stars, Inc.
