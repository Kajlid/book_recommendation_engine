  "description": "The near future is not what you think it is going to be. 100%! New technology will allow the identification, measurement and downloading of human creativity and, therefore, our world will momentarily change for the better, although it will have left many people behind. Under the management of scientists, the bio hard drive Collective Mind runs on human creative energy. It can easily solve the majority of modern problems: it provides new technologies, finds remedies against previously incurable diseases, successfully stops an environmental crisis and does many other useful things. People are willing to sell their creativity to Collective Mind to earn money and make the technology more powerful. Isaac Leroy is one of those who wants to get a lot of money for his creative energy and, thus, solve his biggest problem with getting the funds for his sister's surgery. However, his plans are not going to come true: an unexpected terrorist attack turns him into an avid adversary of this most useful invention in the world. This unfortunate man who finds himself cornered may need to become a desperate criminal. Now his goal is to destroy the Collective Mind technology and eliminate its terrible side effects.",
