  "title": "...and you say you know her?: prose and poetry",
  "description": "'...and you say you know her?' is a poetic representation of the most common feelings that each girl goes through during the different stages of her lifetime.It’s about that dreamer in the crowd of people who struggles hard to take the flight of her dreams.It’s about that silly little girl with whom reality has played a harder part and made her strong like a rock.It’s about that delicate angel who makes a difference in the lives connected to her.It’s about the depth of love that flows with the ocean of her feelings.It’s about that child which resides in the little corner of her matured body who tries hard to mold herself as per what the society expects out of her.She may be a simple woman from the outside but is a thousand pieces of art on the inside. Do you really think you know her?",
