  "title": "HUSH",
  "description": "For Jane, it started with a stolen kiss, a stolen innocence, a false love promised by a “so-called” boyfriend who turns Jane into “Diamond”: schoolgirl by day, teen prostitute by night. And as much as Jane yearns to escape, to speak up, she can’t.  Manipulated by pimps. Threatened with violence. Dependent on drugs will be nothing compared to what Jane unravels: an underground prostitution ring organized by the people she trusted, and an emotional attachment building toward one of her pimps.  **this novel contains material not suited for readers under 18 years of age**",
