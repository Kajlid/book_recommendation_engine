  "description": "Elora Han doesn't believe in faeries. That doesn't stop her reading about them, or writing wild fantasy novels during her day job in a small NYC bookstore. Then suddenly, she finds herself in the middle of a strange world, with no damn phone reception and, worse, no way home. Until now, being adopted was the hardest thing she had to deal with, and the accompanying knowledge that nobody had a clue where she'd come from. When brothers Elladan and Aerin find her wandering around the forest after dark, they take her back to their home for the night before she can learn of the dangers that lurk between the trees. They're beautiful and dangerous and seem like they've stepped straight out of one of Elora's books, and though she's wary, they promise to help her. Except the brothers have no idea how she got there, either, and refuse to let her leave until they figure it out. They insist that she, and her world, are not what they seem. At first, she resents them for trapping her, but soon, she discovers that this strange land feels more like home than New York ever did. He feels like home. But she's filled with questions, and no one seems to want to give her any answers. Caught between a centuries old prophecy that seemed to foretell her arrival and a war she wants nothing to do with, Elora must make her choice: to embrace the strange new powers sheâ€™s spent her whole life writing about, or to get out while she can and let her newfound home, and the man she's damn near fallen for, burn.",
