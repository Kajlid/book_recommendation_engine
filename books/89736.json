  "description": "Suspense and erotic romance abound in this gripping novel of a woman fighting for her very life.Ex-Special Forces operative Chase O'Malley is colossally bored with the tedium of civilian life. When wealthy Hank Keswick offers him a generous sum to kidnap his fugitive trophy wife, Larissa Santos, and transport her from Charleston S.C. back to Southern California, Chase welcomes the opportunity to go on yet another \"mission\", unaware that his new client is really Brian Sparrow, the serial killer Larissa Santos barely survived two years ago.Larissa quickly perceives that she has nothing to fear from her ski-masked abductor although--instinctively knowing that Sparrow is the engineer behind her kidnapping--she is determined to escape at any cost. Warned by Larissa's \"husband\" that she's a compulsive liar and an Oscar-worthy actress, Chase refuses to believe he's delivering her into harm's way.As Chase transports Larissa clear across the continent, neither one anticipates the intense attraction that develops between them despite their mutual antagonism, an attraction so intense that it crackles with sexual electricity.Will Larissa be able to convince Chase that he's delivering her to a man who wants her dead? If not, will she somehow manage to survive a second encounter with serial-killer Brian Sparrow? Will FBI Special Agent Jarvis succeed in sending Chase to prison for the rest of his life?The compelling characters, sexual tension, suspense, action, passion, and intrigue combine to create a rousing, edge-of-your-seat romantic thriller with plot twists that will keep readers mesmerized until the very last page.",
