My little sister secretly sent in an application.  I know I am nowhere near the ideal student for Kingsbury Prep.  But I won't be pushed out of anywhere just because three spoiled brats known as the Royals deemed it so.  Living on the streets, managing to go to school, work part-time at any odd job to take care of my sister taught me how to fight.  And dream of a better life.  I won't let them take away that dream for my sister. I won't let them win.  They declared war on me and the whole school is game.  Well, boys...you're in for a ride. Because you picked on the wrong girl. I'm capable of anything your royal butts can't even imagine. I don't play games. Life is tough enough already. But since you started it, watch your backs because I'm not called Tempest for nothing.  ***TEMPEST is a reverse harem/mature high school bully romance novel. This is book one of six in the series.
