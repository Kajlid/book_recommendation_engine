  "description": "I met the devil in broad daylight. He was cold, dangerous, and nothing I knew I wanted. I should’ve known better. But I couldn't stay away from everything I never thought I’d need. So we made a deal—just our bodies. But the lines blurred without warning, and I soon found myself making another deal. I made the mistake of asking for forever, never knowing just how much the cold could burn. Now, I’m afraid that lies dressed as kisses are all we’ll ever have.",
