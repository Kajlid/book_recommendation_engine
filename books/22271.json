  "description": "Tanner Family Funeral Home and Cemetery is under the gun. Someone is stealing from the dead bodies before they go to burial, and it’s a bit more nefarious than just jewelry and shoes. Gretchen is certain Corbin’s to blame and she’s finally located his hideout. Now if only she could catch him there. But time is short and she’s got a lot on her plate other than the concerns of the family business. A day job, school, and dating three different men at once are running Gretchen ragged. Little does Gretchen know, things are about to go from bad to worse as lies and betrayal infiltrate every aspect of her life.",
