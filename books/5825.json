  "title": "The Economic Way Of Thinking",
  "description": "Primarily for a one-semester survey course in general economics. The Economic Way of Thinking develops the basic principles of micro- and macroeconomic analysis, and employs them as tools rather than ends unto themselves. This text introduces students to a method of reasoning; to think like an economist through example and application. It even teaches by showing students how not to think, by exposing them to the errors implicit in much popular reasoning about economic events.",
