  "title": "Midnight Poems",
  "description": "The inspirations for my poems come mainly at night. In the quiet of the night when everyone else is asleep is when I begin to write. In the calm of the night, the words begin to flow telling stories of things that have happened, my feelings, visions and dreams. Within my poems I travel to fantasy places with people I’ve never met, only dreamed of. In the night, I’ve created a fantasy world of elves, knights, fairies and dragons. A few poems from their world are within these pages, but their story is meant for another time. I hope you enjoy this collection of poems that I have gathered here as you walk with me through my poems and my life.",
