  "description": "Six sexy roommates, all with a sinful secret.I'm Ria, don't ask for my last name, because I don't want to talk about it. Twenty-three years old, and living the glamorous life of my dreams, with the perfect fianc√©, nice car, gorgeous house, and the job I love. Excuse the minor detail of the job I love being taking my clothes off.I had everything I wanted, when suddenly shit hit the fan, and and the fantasy life I had built went up in flames.Now I find myself living in a tiny town, in a not-so-tiny house, with six insanely hot--and just straight up insane--roommates. With everything going all kinds of crazy in this little town, Eliam, Gatlin, Kellan, Gray, Beck, and Rafe seem to think that I am just the girl to help them set everything straight.The Severin brothers are getting me all involved and in danger, and I'm truthfully terrified - not of the danger stuff, but these guys.There's something different about the six of them, something I swear I'm going to figure out.",
