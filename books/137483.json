  "description": "Best friends since birth, Brooke Mead and Savannah Prescott, spend their days working together at top fashion magazine Hourglass, while enjoying all that the Denver nightlife has to offer – but sharing a man – no way.  One of Denver’s most eligible bachelors, Luke Wellington, can have any woman he wants and he knows it. Putting his player skills to the test, he destroys a friendship and makes two women fall in love with him as he sits back and enjoys the best of both worlds.  Brooke Mead is a woman looking for her happily ever after, and the day she literally ran in to him, she thought she’d found it. Charming, charismatic, a true gentleman – what more could she ask for? Things are going perfectly until her best friend struts in the ele-vator and claimed his lips right in front of her.  Savannah Prescott is interested in one thing, having a good time with every single man Denver has to offer. Being tied down is too much of a bore for her free spirited ways. Or so she thinks, but when her best friend starts dating her Friday night fling, she realizes she may be ready to turn in her game card and settle down into a real relationship.  When both girls come to the realization that they are after the same man, it means all-out war. Best friends until the end, or at least until him.",
