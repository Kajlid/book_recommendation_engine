  "description": "Innocence lost is wisdom gained, but for Eugene Law, is the juice worth the squeeze?College isn’t all wild parties and air guitar, there are dark corners in those hallowed halls of education, places where spindly legs stir and hungry fangs glisten beneath the eternal twilight. None of that matters to Eugene Law, a young and naive Magician more concerned with beer and friends than the hard road to Magickal proficiency. Yet when a seemingly chance encounter shows off the true depth of Gene’s power, he’ll find himself in the crosshairs of deadly ambitions.Together with a fiery Yaga Doll and a Magickally well-equipped roommate, it isn’t long before Gene’s misplaced trust lands him neck deep in evil with more than one soul hanging in the balance. Will Gene see the truth in time, or will he be lost deep in the heart of a Gathering Gloom?",
