  "description": "Myra Reed’s life is going great.\n Being a cop is great. Guarding the library of arcane secrets is great. Even dealing with the monsters and gods vacationing in the little beach town of Ordinary, Oregon is great.Then the demon, Bathin, strolls into town and steals Myra’s sister’s soul. So much for great. Luckily, Myra has a plan to evict the demon and save her sister’s soul. * Step one: shut down the portals to hell popping up in town. * Step two: get rid of the pink know-it-all unicorn. * Step three: don’t die while teaching Death how to be a cop. Oh, and there’s a step four. Absolutely, positively, no matter what, do not fall in love with the handsome, charming, jerk of a demon she’s trying to kick out of town.Logically, it’s a good plan. But when it comes to Bathin, Myra’s very illogical heart has some plans of its own.\nGreat.",
