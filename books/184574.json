  "description": "Andy Redfield is a hard-nosed real estate developer, trying to settle his father’s estate and locate the treasure that was mentioned in his father’s will. Bernie Harp is a no-nonsense, private investigator, who specializes in locating lost objects. When Andy hires her to find his dad’s treasure, she anticipates working alone, as was her custom. She communicates this to Andy in no uncertain terms, but Andy was having none of it. If anything, he was determined to lend his assistance. When finding the treasure becomes more than a routine job, and the presence of a suspicious intruder is discovered, tempers flare and sparks fly. While they have difficulty seeing eye-to-eye, Andy and Bernie agree on one thing: They need to capture the intruder and locate his father’s treasure.Kicking and screaming, Bernie is forced to accept his presence on the job, even though it was distracting as hell. With them rubbing each other the wrong way, before they know it, the friction they generate turns to love’s golden heat, igniting a fire neither expected, and neither could deny. So, when Bernie unexpectedly disappears, Andy realizes she was more precious to him than all the treasures in the world, and he’d give up anything to find her—anything, including the treasure, only is he prepared for what he finds?",
