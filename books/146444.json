  "description": "Lizzie Medina’s dreams are about to come true. She’s finally about to marry her true love, the internationally famous movie star Thomas Harper. Her career appears posed for a break out of its own. And, maybe best of all, her family actually seems to have accepted her relationship with Thomas. Just when it seems that it might be possible to actually get everything she ever wanted, Lizzie’s perfectly constructed world starts getting complicated. There’s a rift in the family over a surprise pregnancy. Thomas begins shooting his dream movie—on the other side of the ocean. And the stress of planning a wedding with her overbearing loved ones makes her question how much they’ve changed after all. When someone from Thomas’s past resurfaces, everything Lizzie has worked so hard to build is threatened. Now she must decide, once and for all, what really matters to her—and what she’s willing to fight for.",
