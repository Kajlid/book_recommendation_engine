  "description": "A love controlled by guilt, contained by rules… One summer will change everything.No kissing. No cuddling. No blah, blah, blah. He wrote the rules onto our skin—every ink stroke tragically smeared by the lines we’d crossed. He claimed it was the only way we could be together—the only way we wouldn’t destroy our families.But there was an exception to his rules—one he never saw coming.All I needed was opportunity and a sunburn. The girl who played by his rules is gone. This girl… is not his “friend.”",
