  "description": "Unknown NASCAR driver Adam Drake has some of the best moves Rebecca Newman has ever seen, both on and off the track. But she can't afford to feel anything but respect for the new driver she's hired to pilot her race car. With the financial security of her team hanging in the balance and everyone in the series thinking she's nuts, the last thing she needs is lust getting in the way of logic. Too bad Adam has other ideas.Adam isn't afraid of a challenge, but getting close to his new owner is proving to be a tougher road than some of the superspeedways he's driven. It's going to take a secret weapon--his daughter. Soon his precocious ten-year-old has Rebecca on the run--straight into Adam's arms. But can he convince her to stay with him, and leave behind the ghosts of her past once and for all?",
