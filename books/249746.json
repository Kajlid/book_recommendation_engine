Rhapsody never expected to find her kindred souls. She expected to spend the rest of her life alone, traveling around the country, and singing her revolutionary songs for booing crowds. But then, her kindreds found her and tried to kill her.  Now, she has accepted the bond and finally found the family she always craved. The king hasn't given up on finding her or her assassins, so they remain in hiding.  But it's not a long-term solution and they have to choose a new path.

Before they reach the border, they're attacked by an army of royal guards. There are too many for even her assassins to handle, so they're soon locked up in a prison cart and brought back to the capital. Back to the king who wants them silenced and dead.  When they arrive and are dragged before the royals, Rhapsody realizes the assassins aren't her only kindreds. She has another one here in the palace.",
