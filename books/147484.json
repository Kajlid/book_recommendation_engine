  "description": "The first in a new three book series from Ghiselle St. James:This is not a fairytale. This is not a story of a woman who is perfect. This is not the story of a perfect couple that sails off into the sunset. This is gritty. This is frustrating. This is heartbreaking. This is my story, hard as it may be to tell.**********My name is Sullivan Beal – at least, that’s what I tell people – and I live life by my own rules. Most of my adult life has been spent hiding from my past. That is, until I meet him face-to-face.Ben Hayes is the demanding C.O.O. who is hell-bent on having me for himself. But, I’m wrong for him. I know it, the universe knows it.If he ever found out who I really am, how utterly tainted I am, he wouldn’t waste his time wanting me.There are things in my past that would destroy everyone in my wake.But Ben is relentless, trying to break down the walls around my heart that a messy past has caused me to construct. It’s a pity he doesn’t know…I am too tainted for love.\n“Love isn’t for me, and my kind of love is too tainted, too blemished to share with anyone.”\nFor mature readers ONLY",
