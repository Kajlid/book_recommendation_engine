  "description": "\"Terrific.\" (BEN SHAPIRO) \"Outstanding.\" (DANA LOESCH) The Left is on the attack, and the war for our country is at a crucial tipping point. Liberals know they're within reach of radically transforming America. They don't like the US Constitution. They're allergic to Americans' \"gun culture\". They find our faith and our devotion to family distasteful. And our commitment to liberty positively sends them into a panic. As soon as the Democrats get power anywhere, they stand ready to throw our God-given rights under the bus of political correctness, transgender insanity, and socialism (the economic system that always promises equality and utopia, but somehow always delivers resentment, poverty, and decay). So how can we tip the momentum back in our favor? How can we fight effectively for freedom, the US Constitution, limited government, faith and family, and the survival of the American Republic? Liz Wheeler to the rescue! The popular host of One America News Network's Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler is a brilliant and highly effective debater who shows how we can go on the rhetorical attack against the Left - and win - with a multi-technique program for catching the Left in their inconsistencies and under-handed schemes and skewering them for their bold-faced lies. In Tipping Points: How to Topple the Left's House of Cards, Liz Wheeler identifies the five \"Tipping Points\" where liberals are poised to win, trains you in her proven debating techniques, and deputizes you to take up arms in the fight for our nation's heart and soul. It's training you need right now, today. Our country is at a tipping point. And make no mistake - if the Left isn't defeated, they're taking down America.",
