  "title": "Taylor Swift: Every Day Is a Fairytale: The Unofficial Story",
  "description": "With albums and singles that head straight to the top of the pop and country music charts and a shelf full of awards, Taylor Swift was Billboard’s number one selling artist across all genres in 2008 ― and all before she turned twenty. With her self-titled debut album in 2006, Taylor Swift rose to fame on the strength of her confessional-style songwriting on hits like “Tim McGraw,” and her sophomore album Fearless spent longer at number one than any album had in a decade.Taylor The Unofficial Story provides fans with the first detailed biography of the young from her childhood in Pennsylvania to her early days trying to land a record deal by personally dropping off demos at Nashville record companies to the failed deal that ultimately lead Taylor to her current label ― and international fame. Full of colour photos, the book details Taylor’s songs, albums, and tours; her family, friends (like Miley Cyrus, Kellie Pickler, and Demi Lovato), and boyfriends (including the Jonas Brothers’ Joe); her musical influences, duets, famous performances, acting gigs (on CSI and in Valentine’s Day), and future plans. Taylor The Unofficial Story gets to the heart of this fearless young woman and her rise to the top of the music industry.",
