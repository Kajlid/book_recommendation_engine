  "description": "The bridge of time. The bonds of love. Which is stronger? The locket's latch released, and I held my breath, waiting for eternity. Her smile deepened as her eyes misted, and she drew me near to kiss my cheek. \"Oh, yes, Wren... for always and always.\" Her forehead tipped to mine - her fingers gentle against the nape of my neck. \"Thank you...\" Gentle, sensual, passionate. Jenny-Wren and Annabel. Magic has woven their lives together. Destiny has bridged their worlds.",
