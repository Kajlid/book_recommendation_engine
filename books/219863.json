  "description": "Nestled within the confines of a modern day family, The Little Red Christmas Ball is the last of the colorful breed of vintage ornaments that, once upon a time, shined brightly from within and sparkled tirelessly among the trees of yesterday. Passed down through the years, the Little Red Christmas Ball has become-these days- just a tad insecure as he finds himself more often than not relegated to the rear of the majestic Christmas tree. He fears he's become, well, just a little bit ordinary in this modern age of ornaments equipped with manufactured charm. Nonetheless, the Little Red Christmas Ball is secure in the knowledge-he thinks-his true purpose is to shine bright and provide good Christmas cheer. \"A branch of my own and a home to brighten, what more could a Little Red Christmas Ball need?\" Until one particular Christmas Eve the unthinkable occurs and the Little Red Christmas Ball is unknowingly knocked from his little evergreen home. \"What kind of a Little Red Christmas Ball would I be if I missed a Christmas? I would have no purpose, no purpose at all....\" Soon, with the help of three disparate, late-night housemates, the quest begins to return the Little Red Christmas Ball to his rightful place upon the Christmas Tree before Santa arrives. Along the way, these newfound friends discover and unwrap the innocent gifts of humor, happiness, hope and dreams...but especially the special love of giving. These are the lessons learned by The Little Red Christmas Ball, struggling through this long winter's night, that allow him, still, after all the years to \"shine bright and hold tight\" even in the toughest of times.",
