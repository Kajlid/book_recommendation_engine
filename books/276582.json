  "description": "A murdered vampire. No witnesses. A blood feud ignited.\n\nSome folks say the only good vampire is a dead vampire. But when the murder of a vampire threatens the fragile peace between vampires and ogres, someone has to wade into the fray to sort the truth from the lies.Guess who gets that job.But there's more to this murder than an ancient blood feud. Behind the scenes, someone is stoking the fires of war.And if I can't uncover the truth soon, we'll all be feeling the heat.\n\n\n\nIf you like Jim Butcher, Kevin Hearne, Shayne Silvers, M.D. Massey, or Orlando A. Sanchez, then you'll love taking a trip to the sleepy town of Lost Falls, where not everything is as it seems.",
