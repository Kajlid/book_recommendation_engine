  "title": "Twisted Hearts",
  "description": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud….Yet….Hearts are impulsive and lust borders wickedness. A heart will envy and at times, it will brag. Hearts will do things they aren’t proud of—and all in the name of love. It’s all a game....One that some are sure to lose. Charlotte Reed has everything a girl could want, except passion that once rocketed off the charts between her and fiance, Liam Kelley. A chance encounter with a sexy stranger sparks something that should never have started. What happens when she can't stop wheels that have been set in motion? When secrets are exposed and she realizes that everything she thought she knew was a lie? What will she do when her entire life becomes one big twisted mess?",
