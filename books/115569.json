  "title": "The 1842 Diary of Julia Turnau",
  "description": "Julia Turnau was a 23-year-old German immigrant who came to the United States to marry the young Reverend Wall. The marriage was arranged by another pastor and friend who, along with his wife, accompanied Julia on the sailing voyage from Bremen to New Orleans and then upriver via steamboat on the Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri, Julia's new home. Some of her legacy writings were preserved by her family, first in Germany and later in the U.S., and were translated by her sister's grandson, Armin L. Saeger. He in turn passed them along to his own grandchildren. Now, Armin's granddaughter, also named Julia, is the editor and publisher of several historical family texts, including a journal of reflections on Julia Turnau's ancestry in Germany and a memoir by Armin L. Saeger about his own upbringing in the community of Friedens, near St. Charles, Missouri.",
