  "description": "Told from the viewpoint of Gabriel English, This All Happened opens windows onto a richly textured, fast-pacedly filmic compilation of daily vignettes over one calendar year (if Fellini were a Newfoundlander...). Gabriel's passion for Lydia Murphy leads him into paroxysms of jealousy-but he never abandons his shrewdly witty perspective on the vagaries of modern love. Concrete and delicately rendered, This All Happened depicts a man's descent from love to fury.",
