  "title": "My Shit Life So Far",
  "description": "This book is both funny and refreshingly candid. The story of Frankie's life comes with an undercurrent of racial and sexual confusion, seamlessly blending an atmosphere of bonhomie with one of incest. Occasionally becoming a prose poem detailing the torture of Sky News presenters, it remains witty and engaging. It is the perfect accompaniment to a beach holiday and to the strange metallic taste you often get in your mouth.In My Shit Life So Far there is also an already legendary sequence where Frankie is in a job much like yours and opportunistically murders two women in a motorway service station. This finally allows him to cry about his upbringing. You hold in your hands The Illiad of child murder. This book will make you attractive to hermaphrodites. They will ask you to club them senseless with it.",
