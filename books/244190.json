  "description": "Not even two firemen can put out this fire…  Rescued from the flames by two powerful heroes who now refuse to leave her side, Penny can’t seem to choose which man she needs most. Possessive Nick is old enough to be her father and touches her just right. Zeke is wild and full of passion with a hidden sweet side.  So maybe she won’t choose. Maybe she’ll keep them both.  After all, both men are determined to keep Penny, even if it means sharing…and keep her protected from the danger lurking just around the corner.",
