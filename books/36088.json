  "description": "It was chance, guided by the hands of a god that brought them together. Would their choice bind them, or be the cause of their destruction?Natasha never believed that the fairy tales she read to her niece about supernatural beings were real. She read them to give her niece hope. She, herself, had all but given up on love, until the fateful day when she went scuba diving in the Bermuda Triangle and was thrust into a culture of people that’d change her life forever.On a legendary island, she meets Raif, the shape shifting Warrior Chief of Atlantis, and her soul mate. Their attraction is instant, powerful and foretold by an oracle, centuries before Natasha was born. She struggles with the attraction, unwilling to believe in soul mates, and fraught with the desire to return to the surface where she can continue her monotonous life, free from the intense and confusing emotions she feels around Raif.All his life, Raif’s searched for her. To have finally found her after so long, is a dream come true. Trouble is; this dream’s more of a nightmare that he can’t seem to find a way out of than the haven it’s supposed to be. His people have become complacent, and her arrival is the beginning of fulfilling an ancient prophesy; a prophesy that not too many are willing to see fulfilled, least of all, his king.Together they’re faced with the most difficult choice of their lives: doom a hidden, mythical culture to eternal segregation, or sacrifice their love to reunite Atlantis with the rest of the world?",
