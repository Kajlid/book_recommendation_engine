You cannot avoid reflecting on wisdom from the past and ethics for the future.Thomas abandons his successful legal practice, seeking a new way of living inspired by Francis of Assisi. When his best friend makes him vow to keep a groundbreaking technology away from mankind, his life changes beyond control. He has no clue what awaits him.Thomas is plunged into a web of greed, fake news, aggressive populism and failing political leadership. He sets out to find the truth against a backdrop of intimidation and deceit. Nothing is what it seems. As he finds signs of a high-level conspiracy, a mysterious and deadly virus sweeps across the earth. His tense search leads Thomas to the medieval city of Assisi, back alleys and dimly-lit churches in Rome, dark forces in Manhattan and a former French monastery overlooking the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, he has two women vying for his heart: a sensitive violinist who cared for his father in the final days of life, and an intriguing Parisian he meets by chance in Tuscany. ˃˃˃ What does our future look like? Are we heading for a society without individual privacy and freedom, worse than Orwell’s 1984? Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B01N6JQU44 here.",
