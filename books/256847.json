  "title": "Ferbert Flembuzzle's Most Exotic Zoo",
  "description": "At seven years old, Sophia Flembuzzle discovers she is the most hated child in the town of Vedner, and it’s all because of the name Flembuzzle. It is why she is teased by her classmates, eats lunch alone, and is forced to sit with her desk facing the wall. Worst of all, it is the reason that Sophia doesn’t have the one thing she wants more than anything else—a friend. The town’s mayor, Max Monev, tells the young girl that all her troubles started the day her father, Ferbert Flembuzzle, opened his mysterious zoo. At first, Sophia refuses to believe what she’s hearing, but over time she can’t help wondering if the mayor’s tale is true. When she discovers a tattered, leather-bound book, locked away in her father’s desk, her life is turned upside down as she embarks on an adventure full of marvelous creatures. Along the way, she uncovers the truth about her father, the mayor, the zoo, and what it means to believe. [AGES 8 & UP]",
