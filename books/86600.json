  "description": "Cleo F Ansteth was a multi-talented musician and arranger for Hollywood and Las Vegas stars. His musical life experience ranged from the 1940s and the Big Band Eras, through the 1980s of TV, Rock and Roll, and Disco. In this enjoyable novel, Cleo portrays his life, memories, and times, from the vantage point of Stan, a Hollywood Booking Agent. We follow the Music Industry, through Stanâ€™s eyes, with its ups and downs, its triumphs and tragedies, and how it touched the lives of clients, fellow musicians and celebrities. Cleo Ansteth brings to light the changes in the types of musicianship which have occurred since the WWII Revues, studio bands, one-night stands, club acts with full orchestras which broadcasted live on radio, and their transition into the music of the film industry and TV show 'click' tracks. Cleo Ansteth's scores and arrangements can still be heard in the musical renditions of headliners and stars of stage and screen today. He is part of the great musical tapestry of our lives.",
