  "description": "Beth Summers is a virgin. Starting her Masters degree in a new college, Beth is friendly, open, and, underneath everything, as bad a girl as there ever was. Bored of her small town past, Beth is eager to learn, but just as desperate to experience the wild side of college. All she needs is a strong, wild man for her to tame.Adam Gold is hungry. Hungry for money, trouble, and a chance to make a name for himself as an artist. He's also starved for a challenge in his love life. Bored of co-eds and the controversy stirred up by his artwork, Adam is after the sort of girl who can bring a tough guy like him to his knees.Beth needs a tutor for art history, and Adam needs the good publicity, given the outcry over his explicit art. Soon, the two start to organize some very alternative study sessions. Will the artist be able to show her the ropes, or will Miss Not-So-Innocent tie him down once and for all?",
