  "description": "The Apotheosis has come at last, and it will shatter the world. CAINA is trapped in the ruins of an ancient necromancer's tomb. Unless she escapes the lethal trap, there will be no one to stop Grand Master Callatas from unleashing the Apotheosis. KYLON is desperate to save Caina's life. The deadly Red Huntress is coming for Caina, and only by the sacrifice of his own life can Kylon save Caina from the Huntress's blade. Or the Red Huntress might simply kill them both. CALLATAS is ready to call the Apotheosis and create a new humanity to replace the old. Of course, the old humanity will have to die first...every last man, woman, and child. And he will start with Caina Amalas. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Standing over six feet tall, USA Today bestselling author Jonathan Moeller has the piercing blue eyes of a Conan of Cimmeria, the bronze-colored hair of a Visigothic warrior-king, and the stern visage of a captain of men, none of which are useful in his career as a computer repairman, alas. He has written the DEMONSOULED series of sword-and-sorcery novels, and continues to write THE GHOSTS sequence about assassin and spy Caina Amalas, the COMPUTER BEGINNER'S GUIDE series of computer books, and numerous other works. His books have sold a half million copies worldwide.",
