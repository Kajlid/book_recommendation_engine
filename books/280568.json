  "description": "Welcome to the weirdest day of my life. My name is Jake, and I’m just an average 6th grader that was invited to sit at the cool kids’ lunch table. Now I’ve got to rescue a crazy girl who thinks she’s a princess. Before I can do that, I’ll be chased by an angry monkey, hunted by a hungry dinosaur, and abducted by an ugly alien (and that’s not all)! I should mention that the princess thinks she’s from another planet. Nothing weird about that.The only way I can make everything right is to find out what’s behind the glowing door I’ve dreamed about every night of my life.",
