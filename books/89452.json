A black Mustang lurks in front of her house. But when the car—minus a driver—snatches her off her Albuquerque street, Amethyst learns the unnerving truth: she’s acquired a familiar spirit. And she’s a wizard. But wizards have been disappearing for centuries, hunted by an unknown predator that sucks them dry of power, leaving tormented shadows. Magic, untapped and neglected, grows critically unstable.
