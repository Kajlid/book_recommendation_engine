  "description": "My life is, to put this delicately, a hot mess right now. I’ve lost my job and my home all in one summer. To top it all off, I have a chronic illness and no health insurance.Did I mention that the world now thinks I’m dating one of the Internet’s hottest stars—all because someone snapped a photo of us at our friend’s wedding? Seriously, guys? One dance, and now we’re in love? HA! Isn’t that funny? Weston King, famous YouTuber, would never date me. In fact, when given the chance six years ago, he moved two thousand miles away.Dating Wes is off the table, but…is marrying him? He might just be the only one who can help me get my life together, and after getting hit with some really bad press, he needs me just as much. Marrying Wes just might be the answer to my prayers, but it also opens the door to a whole mess of problems—a door I’d rather keep tightly shut.The whole thing would probably be a huge mistake and end in disaster. Should I just go with it?",
