  "description": "Synopsis A forbidden love. Rival families of organized crime. And one man hell bent on getting what he wants at all costs. Small town Donovan's Harbor isn't going to know what hit it! Jessica Alvarez arrives in the small town determined to stand up to her father and assert her independence. What she doesn't expect is to fall in love with her father's enemy and be made a pawn in a mad man's plan to take back control of the town from organized crime. In this play on William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet theme, will Jessica bring together two warring families in order to be with the man she loves, or will she - much like her Shakespearean counterpart Juliet - succumb to the tug of war between her family, the man she loves, and the man without any qualms to taking her life as a means to an end?",
