If she can control him...Desperate to save her demon-abducted sister, witch Merle MacKenna breaks the law when she summons Rhun, another demon, from the magical prison of the Shadows. Rhun might be a demon, but he'll be able to help her, and then she'll bind him when she's through – at least, that's the plan. But Merle finds it's easier said than done when her new demon is hellbent on charming his way into her pants – and her heart.After twenty years in the Shadows, bound for a crime he didn't commit, Rhun is past caring about anyone but himself. The plan: seduce the sexy witch, steal her powers, and be on his merry way. But when a heinous betrayal in the ranks of the witches forces Merle and Rhun to work even closer together, Rhun's plan backfires – and the witch gets under his skin. With his unbidden feelings for Merle vying with his need for freedom, he struggles with a new torment: Being a selfish jerk is a lot harder when love is involved.Warning: Includes lots of witty banter and snarky humor, as well as a charmingly disrespectful demon hero who's hot enough to melt panties with a look.***This book was previously published as Blood, Pain, and Pleasure.***",
