She cannot refuse him. She must stifle her feelings and never betray that she wanted another. And now she is the sixth wife. Her queenship is a holy mission yet, fearfully, she dreams of the tragic parade of women who went before her. She cherishes the secret beliefs that could send her to the fire. And still the King loves and trusts her.  Now her enemies are closing in. She must fight for her very life. KATHARINE PARR – the last of Henry’s queens.  Alison Weir recounts the extraordinary story of a woman forced into a perilous situation and rising heroically to the challenge. Katharine is a delightful woman, a warm and kindly heroine – and yet she will be betrayed by those she loves and trusts most.  Too late, the truth will dawn on her.",
