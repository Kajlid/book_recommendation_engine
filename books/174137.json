  "description": "An intrepid secret agent...Agent Royce Ree was once the best covert intelligence operative in the Empire. But all he's been able to accomplish lately is screw-up after screw-up. Now, the Emperor has assigned the once-great agent a mission: Royce needs to pull off the biggest heist the Universe has ever seen, or it’s bye-bye cushy government job, hello cleaning toilets in a dive-bar on Baga-V. A ludicrous mission...  With the Empire poised on the edge of chaos, everything depends on Royce's ability to steal another civilization's impeccable sense of style. To succeed, he needs help from the last person he’d ever ask--his aristocratic ex-husband. One last chance...  Along with his career and the Emperor's dignity, Royce is about to get a chance to save a love he thought he'd lost forever... “The Empire has survived wars, supernovae, democracy, and the collapse of a neighborhood universe. Let us hope it survives the good intentions of Agent Royce Ree.” – Author unknown (personal communication to the Emperor). Note: This book was previously published as \"Royce Ree Omnibus, Volume 1\", a compilation of 5 serial novellas. It is now published as a single, stand-alone novel.",
