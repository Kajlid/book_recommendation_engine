  "description": "A romantic comedy with a pinch of sarcasm by Saniya.S.Kohari'Dreams are just a touch away from reality. All you have to is... Put an effort, dare a little and you can have what you dream off... 'Khwaab-I did not stop when I should have...I did not protect my heart when I could have. I dreamt and kept dreaming on until it was too late...Until there was no going back...Until the dream started crashing with reality.Maybe its because we all want a taste of what we can't have, that made me keep dreaming him...Hoping like hell the dream even though forbidden might just come true.I had never really had the best of relationship with fate. It has always been on the spicier side. But the game of life just got a notch difficult, when universe played a masterstroke putting me within touching distance of the object of my every fantasy and dream.Ryan had once said, Dreams are just a touch away from reality..Make an effort...blah blah blah and you can have what you dream off...So does it mean I can really just tell him I dream you..Can I have you? Do people actually do that? Would he mind? Not that I was planning too..Just saying!A love story of living in the dreams and wishing they come true...until they just do!",
