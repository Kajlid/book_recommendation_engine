  "description": "Lilias adores the depths of the sea, but when her skin begins to crack, and scales form on her legs, she discovers she's Changing. Becoming something else. Something otherworldly. The top half of her body is still human, but the lower half is now morphing into that of a fish, and, soon, she'll no longer be able to walk on land. In all her eight-hundred years, nothing like this has ever happened to her or any of her fae kind. She needs answers, and it seems there is only man who can aid her in finding them. His name is Levi Matheson, and he's a fae-blooded shifter from a time far in the future.Never has Levi met a more maddening, stunningâ€¦um, woman/mermaid like Lilias. While undertaking his own mission, he is sent hurtling through time directly into her path. He has no idea what's happening to Lilias, but she seems to be evolving right before his eyes. Is it possible that she's the instrument to uncovering the lost race of the merpeople?Frustratingly, that might be so. And worse? He's also one-hundred percent certain she's his fated mate. Which leaves one gaping problem. How on earth does he complete the bond with her when she has a tail?",
