As the King of England’s youngest son, and thus not the heir apparent, he has more freedom and less royal responsibilities.

And the only woman on his mind is a fiery redhead with an infectious laugh.The one who hates him.Aspen Calhoun is the new owner of Drips & Sips.

She refuses to fall for his charms again.But Callum is determined to stay in Cunningham Falls and make it up to Aspen, no matter how long it takes.
