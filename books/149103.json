  "description": "Duet is a wildly comic story of a beautiful and talented young woman in her 20’s living in New York City and her misadventures as she navigates men’s desires and fears. When most women look into a mirror, they see flaws in their body. Some of those “flaws” can end up being the very essence of what some see as a woman’s true beauty. Duet, a talented, sensitive, gorgeous young woman, has an unusual anatomy…one that might overexcite one man, but terrify another. She has to live with this sexual uniqueness and not see herself as a freak. As her father tells her, “They just found a goat with a unicorn horn and he has nothing to be ashamed about.”Men are drawn to Duet. Her friend, Paula, fixes her up. Most of the men she meets she sees as fools, but one night Duet meets a handsome young man, Oskar, who is successful, sexy, intelligent, witty and seems able to handle her “design.” They fall in love, even though he has an aloofness about him that seems a bit odd. It turns out he has secrets of his own. Paula too falls in love and finds herself involved with the larcenous CEO of a videogame company where he has cooked the books and put subliminal messages into the video games. Oskar is also a wild card and turns out to be connected to Duet in more ways than one.Duet is a romp full of vibrant, unexpected characters doing unexpected things, as they love, move toward and away from each other. It’s also a metaphor for how we must also risk love, no matter what bodies were given us, and no matter what unusual choices of the heart we make.",
