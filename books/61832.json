  "description": "Lose yourself in the Tuscan hills in Linda Lappin’s prize-winning novel,  The Etruscan.  Runner up in Fiction for the New York Book Festival  and short listed for the Next Generation Indie Award  in fiction, this cult novel is now available for the first time in the US in Kindle Edition.  Kirkus :“Lappin elegantly brings the characters, Italian countryside and surroundings to life in vivid, engrossing prose.” In this entrancing novel,the tantalizing love story between American heroine Harriet Sacket and the enigmatic Count Federigo del Re,self-proclaimed Etruscan spirit, is played out in 1922 across the backdrop of eerie Etruscan tombs and boar-infested woods. “The basic pleasure of this book lies in the suspension of disbelief, the heightened emotional urgency, the mystery, the lush and mystical scenery.” – Prairie Schooner",
