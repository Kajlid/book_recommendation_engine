  "title": "Hocus Pocus",
  "description": "This is a very rare signed first British edition of Vonnegut's \"Hocus Pocus\". I acquired the book in 1991 at Harrah's in London, England. A clerk in the book department told me that Vonnegut had signed copies of the book earlier that year during an in-store promotion. I purchased the only remaining signed copy. The book had been published by Jonathan Cape during the previous year.",
