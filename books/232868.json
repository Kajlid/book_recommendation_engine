  "description": "\"They say the Jackal Man lives in that house...\"   Months after a family is forced to flee the beachfront property on 100 Winthrop Road, three young travelers lost outside of Cutler, Maine find themselves taking shelter in it. Strapped for cash, the three of them spend a night in the house, wondering why the lovely old building has been left abandoned.  They don't have to wonder for long.  Strange things take place in the empty house. Noises come from behind the walls, and its occupants feel as though they're being constantly watched. The townsfolk are quick to warn them away from the property, sharing with them bits and pieces of its terrible history.  But by then, it may already be too late. Winthrop House has a mind of its own, and the entities that dwell there won't rest until they have what they want.",
