  "description": "Zach Freeman is a cop with a single obsession. Lee Hastings is a free wheeling, high class prostitute who thinks his life is just fine until Zachary comes along and threatens to turn it upside down. Zach doesn't care about Lee's life or anything else for that matter. He wants to nail the guy who was involved in the death of a little girl, a guy who is one of Lee Hastings' clients. Lee Hastings is about to be given a choice--help Zach put his client away, or face the consequences. Lee realises that the hard drinking, uncompromising Zach Freeman has the power to ruin his life--he also knows that this gorgeous, rough and tough detective is a little too sexy for words, and that he might lose more than just his lucrative career in the bargain.",
