  "description": "\"You are mine, princesa,\" Gabriel muttered roughly into my ear, keeping my hands pinned beside my head to the wall. \"On paper, you are mine. In contrast, you are mine. In public, you are mine. No one else owns your body and soul as I do and they will never get the chance that I do.\"\"I am not a trophy that you believe you have claim over because of that stupid contract, Gabriel,\" I snapped, my eyes trying their best not to flutter closed at the feeling of his warm breath on my neck.Gabriel smirked. \"No, you're more than a trophy - you are my wife.\" He turned me around, picking me up so my legs would wrap around his hips. \"So how about we stop fighting and you let me take you against this wall, s√≠?\"",
