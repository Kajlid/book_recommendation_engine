It aims to give hope to those who have lost a loved one and to those who are about to pass beyond - hope that this is not an end. Written for lay people, rather than experienced spiritualists or mediums, and for anyone who is curious about exploring further, it provides practical tools to help readers find their own spiritual truth and path.",
