Along the way, she discovers dark secrets long hidden by her handler, a mysterious FBI agent and even her deceased grandfather leading to a much larger conspiracy that threatens to pull a dark veil across the face of the entire world. All this while she attempts to deal with the pressures of growing up in a dysfunctional family, social isolation and young love.",
