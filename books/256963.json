  "title": "TOUT COMME ELLE",
  "description": "Just Like Her (Tout comme elle, in French) is a searing and daring work of poetry, written for the theatre, about the inevitability of loss and the enduring nature of love. In four acts Dupr? explores the difficult, painful, yet necessary separation of daughter and mother. In each act, we hear the voice of a daughter speak: of the relationship with the mother, of feeling unloved in her differences from the mother, of giving birth herself to a daughter, and of observing her own teenage daughter, who is? just like her. The poems are followed by a conversation between Louise Dupr? and acclaimed Quebec theatre director Brigitte Haentjens about writing, women, theatre and life. In June 2011, Brigitte Haentjens will be directing the English-language premiere of the play Tout Comme Elle at Luminato the Toronto Festival of Arts ] Creativity.",
