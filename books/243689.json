  "description": "Blister by JP CashlaBlister is the second collection of work by JP Cashla and a follow up to his debut collection Stone Music (2013). Like his prior effort, Blister continues to address aspects of poet's life real or imagined; past and present.Â Cashla's voice is unique and feral. He wields language like a weapon to address his myriad experiences sometimes sliding into the worm hole of an alternative universe where his imagination continues to prey after the truth.\"I have heard family members, whom I love, tell me they hate poetry. They're morons. JP Cashla has distilled life's great ironies & lays them out before you so you, the reader, may reach a place of self-awareness & stop being such a whiny douche bag.\" The Arbutus Assassin",
