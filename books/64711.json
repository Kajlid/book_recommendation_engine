  "title": "We Live in Water",
  "description": "We Live in Water is a darkly comic, moving collection of short stories that veer from comic tales of love to social satire to suspenseful crime fiction, from hip Portland to once-hip Seattle to never-hip Spokane, from a condemned casino in Las Vegas to a bottomless lake in the dark woods of Idaho. This is a world of lost fathers and redemptive con men, of meth tweakers on desperate odysseys and men committing suicide by fishing.In \"Thief,\" an aluminum worker turns unlikely detective to solve the mystery of which of his kids is stealing from the family vacation fund. In \"We Live in Water,\" a lawyer returns to a corrupt North Idaho town to find the father who disappeared thirty years earlier. In \"Anything Helps,\" a homeless man has to \"go to cardboard\" to raise enough money to buy his son the new Harry Potter book. In \"Virgo,\" a local newspaper editor tries to get back at his superstitious ex-girlfriend by screwing with her horoscope. Also included are the stories \"Don't Eat Cat\" and \"Statistical Abstract of My Hometown, Spokane, Washington,\" both of which achieved a cult following after publication online.",
