  "description": "“Delightful, hilarious story that a lot of women can relate to!” “Brilliant for its realism! Rebecca Reilly is one entertaining author!” “Fun, easy, HONEST read!” “Great topic - relevant - you will LOL!” Food is not a great substitute for sex, but it’s all I’ve got. It’s not that I’m not happy in my marriage. I am. George is a good man, and I love him. I love our two children. I love our home. I love our church. And I love my job. I love everything I have. And I’m bored out of my mind. I know God created sex for marriage. And not just for beautiful people, either. Sex is supposed to bind a man and wife; to give them an intimacy they share with no one else. Sex is supposed to be fulfilling. And fun! I think we’re supposed to want to have sex with our spouse. George and I did it by the Book. We are the ones that should be tingling, panting, and dripping with lust. We’re the ones who should be the models of sexual satisfaction. I should feel as the bride in Song of Solomon “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is more delightful than wine….Take me away with you--let us hurry. Let the king bring me to his chambers” (Song of Solomon 1:2, 4). But even Song of Solomon hasn’t helped spice up our boring chambers. And most of the time, I think George would rather have wine. I needed something else. I needed more specific instructions to liven up our life. But where does a sexually uptight, Christian woman (with a reputation to protect) go for help?",
