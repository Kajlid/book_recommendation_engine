  "description": "On holiday with new boyfriend Tom, Mark - the hero from the best-selling novels, 50 Reasons to Say Goodbye and Sottopassaggio - heads off to rural Italy for a spot of camping.When the ruggedly seductive Dante invites them onto his farmland the lovers think they have struck lucky, but there is more to Dante than meets the eye - much more. Tom, all innocence, appears blind to Dante's dark side as their holiday starts to spin slowly but very surely out of control - and it is Mark, alone, who can maybe save the day...Funny, sexy and clever, this is a story about understanding and forgiveness, and an investigation of the fact that life is rarely quite as bad - or as good - as it seems.",
