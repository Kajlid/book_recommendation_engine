Sometimes she even heard them whisper to her. Only instead of calling her Jessica, they always called her Annabelle.Life Like HorrorAnnabelle had come back to them. The dolls had lived for so long by themselves. With no one to dust them off, play with them or love them. But now Annabelle had come back. And everything would be just like it was before. Only this time, they would never let anyone hurt Annabelle. And anyone who tried would soon discover that pretty dollies can have very ugly tempers.",
