  "description": "\"Easily the most innovative alpabet book of the year, if not the decade... Beyond clever.\"â€•The Washington PostPrepare to be amazed. From the lenticular cover that changes with the angle of your hands all the way to the Z, ABC3D is as much a work of art as it is a pop-up book. Each of the 26 three-dimensional letters move and change before your eyes. C turns into D with a snap. M stands at attention. X becomes Y with a flick of the wrist. And then there's U...Boldly conceived and brilliantly executed with a striking black, red, and white palette, this is a book that readers and art lovers of all ages will treasure for years to come.ABC3D is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
