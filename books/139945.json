With total honesty and riotous humor, Mick Foley shines a spotlight into some of the hidden corners of the World Wrestling Federation. From the ongoing controversy surrounding \"backyard wrestling\" to the real story behind his now-infamous \"I Quit\" match with The Rock, Foley covers all the bases in this hysterically funny roller-coaster ride of a memoir.",
