  "description": "THREE HILLS (The Borderer Chronicles)Set on the Anglo/Scottish border in the sixteenth century, a childâ€™s dream of war is shattered, a boy is interned and the man travels a dangerous path not of his own design. This is the first volume of the Borderer Chronicles. Where life leads, someone always suffers.Your own destiny lies over three hills. Three peaks to climb and descend. The first peak is childhood. It moulds your spirit, and its vigour runs you to the top and you ardently descend its fall, eager to reach the next hill. Wounds are taken lightly, scars heal quickly and worn bravely.The second peak is youth, with decision how the rise of the hill should be taken. Easy and difficult paths are there, fortune and ruin. The descent is a path few relish, for it leaves behind the strength and hopes of youth. Wounds are harsh and scars never heal.The third peak is middle age, and is an arduous climb with the burden of responsibility, made difficult by the tally of wounds. Descent leads one to decline, and the finality of the journey. Three Hills is a core of a man's story; poignancy, adventure and wit. Three periods of a life born out of the troubled English and Scottish Marches, where hardship and strife mould the local people. When English and Scottish sovereigns could only pick at each other, only to make their subjects bleed to satisfy their own royal vanity.http://www.ruffthedog.com",
