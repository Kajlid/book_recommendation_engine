  "title": "Doctor Diablo",
  "description": "He is a charming, arrogant genius with wealth, good looks, and a playboy-bachelor lifestyle that any guy would envy. He’s also possibly the world’s greatest super villain. Jonathan Blanc was a nameless, homeless foundling who conquered adversity and his humble beginnings to make something of himself. Unfortunately, what he made was San Francisco’s greatest criminal mastermind, the infamous Doctor Diablo. Life was brilliant and perfect (as he demanded) until Doctor Diablo ran afoul of the Bay Area’s most vicious, monstrous ganglord, the Crusher. Now Diablo must find a way to overcome a lethal, unstoppable madman, bent on putting him to a painful, lingering death. Along the way he just might learn the value of love, friendship, and redemption--if he survives.",
