  "description": "\"Justice’s diary has the potential to captivate thousands, and there’s no question that it needs to be shared to a large-scale audience so that more people know exactly what she did. Her written words resurrect a man whose cause of death was as unnatural as a father and daughter relationship devoid of love, and they speak of her rebirth in the afterlife of that ungodly death.\"Lorna now has possession of the diary. She knows she must relinquish it to her own father, who's hell-bent on capturing Justice before anybody else does.",
