  "title": "The Night of the Hunter",
  "description": "In the haunted and haunting land which lies in the valley of the Ohio River, two small children find themselves saddled with a dark and dreadful heritage: a bloody treasure, the shadow of a hanged father and the fateful pledge they made him one afternoon in a windswept meadow by the river. Soon into this arena moves the shadow of another: a hunter with the words Love and Hate tattooed into the flesh of his fingers--a man with Jehovah on his tongue and a quick knife in his fist. The boy knows the hunter for what he is, with that fine certain knowledge of which some children are capable. But the little sister and the mother seem wholly won by the stranger; the boy stands alone in agonized certainty of the doom that moves towards them all. Yet to whom can he turn? Who is to save them?",
