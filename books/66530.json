  "description": "The Six-Degree Conspiracy is a roman a clef drawn from the Bernie Madoff fiasco, but with a big twist: Calling Bernie's alter ego and surrogate, the criminal investor Manny Granov, a Ponzi would be like discovering a new continent and calling it an island. Granov uses his $65 billion fortune (about the amount Madoff was said to have controlled) to boost his foreign policy agenda. He's an attractive asset for CIA, but more often he free-lances, loan sharking fortunes for black operations. Granov kept the coltan market stable in 2001 by capitalizing the assassination of Laurent Kabila. When Lockheed's \"Skunk Works\" ran out of cash building the F-117, Granov put up a stunning $7.5 billion, at 20-percent interest. He gave the night stalker its wings and talons. Some of his best \"customers\" were Russian mobsters, but when his Moscow partners turn out to be Chechen terrorists, a Soviet-era nuclear weapon vanishes down a rabbit hole. When it surfaces in the arms bazaar, a press aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a flack named Jackson Guild, stumbles into a duel with the bomb's highest bidders. The hunt for the weapon comes down to this one flawed man. A former journalist broken by a murder during the first Gulf War, Guild's the hard-drinking, self-medicating man-who-knows-too-much. He has no intention of playing hero as the warhead is about to be triggered back of Union Station, right in the heart of Washington, DC. But Guild finds himself hung out like bait, chum in a feeding frenzy of power brokers and killers.",
