It still doesn't change how I feel a family should be run.And you …You’re always so quick to believe the lies of children.Honestly, it makes me laugh.If what they told you makes you sleep better at night, feel free to imagine that it's true.Anyway, let me tell you what happened before he went off to find his sister.And if you still want to find some comfort in what he’s already said, then by all means--continue believing their lies.They’ll fight me; I can already see it in their eyes.But you know what they say.You can’t keep a good man down.",
