  "description": "When it comes to luck, I’m on the wrong end of the good side with more mishaps than I care to remember. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a happy guy: single, decent looking, wealthy, with a waiting list of people who want me to make their kid’s dreams come true with my custom-designed playhouses. My life was exactly how I wanted it to be. That is, until Saryn Night walked back into my life with the intention of firing me. Good luck with that. One strong-headed, opinionated woman with a three-year-old little girl had turned my world upside down within five minutes. The moment they stormed into my office — bright blue eyes, curly brown hair, and a smile that would make any man fall to his knees, and that was just the daughter — I knew I was in for one wild ride that was guaranteed to turn my luck completely around. Now, for once in my life, I found myself thinking that maybe, just maybe, I could finally be Lucky in Love.",
