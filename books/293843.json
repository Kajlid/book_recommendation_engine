  "description": "The thrilling conclusion to the bestselling series is here.  I made it through senior year.  Barely.  I thought that would be enough.  Get to the end and move on.  That's what you do, right?  Fight through it and move on.  That should be enough.  But it's not.  Because I want more.  And the one thing I want the most?  It may be the one thing I lose.  WARNING: Summer is the fourth and final book in the bestselling Sunset Beach High series. It's the conclusion you've been waiting for! It contains mature themes, sexual content, and profanity. If you're not a fan of those things, this isn't the book for you. But if you like serious stuff mixed with lots of bad words and some sweaty sex, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. Find out what happens NOW!",
