  "title": "Inhuman",
  "description": "Inhuman not only ties the first four books together, it also broadens the mystery, introduces a new villain, one that has been lurking in the background throughout, and that will trump any villain in the history of suspense literature, film, or science fiction. V-SINN is its name, and, and in this epic thriller, it may just be too much for the post-humans to handle.",
