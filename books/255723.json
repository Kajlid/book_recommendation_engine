  "description": "They call him a deadly sociopath. For years he was that man. Without emotional sanity. The little bit of a thing changed him. Seventeen, his president’s sister and too innocent for what Hawk craved.  With forbidden love came great stalking. Can he fight the stains left by his demons?  The VP of the Renegade Souls MC will do anything for Gia Marinos. Including walking away from his club, best friend and his treasured leather cut. But just when he thinks he can have it all… His past reminds him how unworthy of her he is.  Sometimes the hero needs rescuing by the princess.  Disclaimer: A sociopath will do almost anything for his old lady. So, this book is intended for those 18+ who can handle a VP at his sexiest.",
