  "title": "Seven Journeys End",
  "description": "Fascinating composite novel, unconventional and full of black humor, about various people who no longer see the raison d'être and then decide to end it all.The journeys, seven episodes, are stories a mad writer from the Bronx suffering grave blockage has written about people in situations in which they no longer see the raison d’être and then act to end it all, with only an angel beside them guiding the way. Seven stories about diversified people who end their lives by their own choice. Destiny, doom, fate, fortune, hate, boredom spiced with humor, sauced with sarcasm, words of wisdom from a decrepit sage or a shrieking angel.If the existentialist questions the rationalization for suicide, Andy Zimmerman, a cosmic cynic, delivers on seven good reasons. Or is a mad writer trying to convince himself, trying to justify himself to finally go? Is this the suicide note, a death waka, a death poem, an elegy the writer is leaving the world?",
