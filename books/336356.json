  "title": "A Bride for Harley",
  "description": "“I would have preferred to choose my destiny rather than have it thrust upon me. I’m not sure what I wanted out of life, but it wasn’t being a proxy bride to a man I never desired to marry. While others flock to the west to hide their past sins and start a new life, I killed any hope for a new life and live in my transgressions.”“My name is Mrs. Harrison. The story I am about to tell you is not my own. Neither is my past.”Set in the wilds of Montana above the Yellowstone River in Assiniboine Indian territory, the realities of life in 1868 come alive in this sweet, heartwarming coming-of-age story.",
