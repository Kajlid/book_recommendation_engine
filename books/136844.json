He’s the one man she can never trust. Former spec ops soldier-turned-DEA agent Thomas Mann lives every day with the guilt of having let a killer hurt Ronni. Now she’s on his SoCal turf…and he’ll risk his life in order to protect her. But can he ignore his fantasies about his sexy new partner and do his job? When their passion ignites while undercover, the truth Ronni’s hiding puts their mission in jeopardy and tests their partnership. Can they learn to trust each other while deceiving the enemy? Or will their cunning foe lure them into a dark and deadly trap?",
