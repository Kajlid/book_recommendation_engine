  "description": "I wanted to fall for a man. Instead, I fell for a legend... Jax and Haley’s addictive, emotional rockstar romance trilogy is in ONE PLACE for the first time! Books 1 and 2 contain cliffhangers that build to book 3’s explosive, unmissable HEA. Immerse yourself in more than 500 pages of smoldering tension and enthralling romance that promise to leave you “dazed and a little crazed.” GOOD GIRL (Wicked #1): I wanted to fall for a man. Instead, I fell for a legend... The month I wrote my first piece of code, Jax Jamieson launched his third platinum album. The week I drank my first beer, he spent in jail. The day I got under his skin, I wound up on his tour. And the night he gave me his hoodie… I fell in love forever. BAD GIRL (Wicked #2): Rockstars don't chase college students. But Jax Jamieson’s never followed the rules. I thought I knew Jax's secrets. I was wrong. When the fans go home and the lights fade to black, it's just me and him and the people we left behind. I want to escape, until I realize... We can do a lot in the dark. WICKED GIRL (Wicked #3): He was a legend, until he walked away. I was nobody, until I was dragged into the light. I was never supposed to be part of Wicked, but it was always part of me. Now it's my turn to do something that matters. Even if the man I love hates me for it. A Rockstar Romance Series",
