  "description": "The Sexiest Dragon of Them All Adopted at birth, Ivy Morales always suspected she was more than human. Still, she keeps the outlandish thought to herself-even though she can't ignore her powerful dreams of an ancient blood feud . . . or the darkly erotic turn of those hallucinations. Kidnapped in Mexico for her visions, Ivy has only one chance to find the wickedly sexy man in her dreams. Welsh dragon shifter Ian Madoc doesn't understand the strange dream connection he shares with an unknown, beautiful woman. Yet after the seductive images turn into pleas for help, Ian rushes off in the middle of the night, hell-bent on rescuing her. But will she turn out to be the soul mate he's always longed for . . . or the downfall of his entire clan?",
