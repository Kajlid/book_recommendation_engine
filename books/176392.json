  "description": "A BBW in search of love + a sexy panther shifter = Alpha Romance  Maya Zara is a curvy woman sick and tired of men who think she should settle. She loves her curves and wants to find someone who will love them too. When she meets Gerri Wilder and signs up for a date with a shifter, Maya has no idea what’s in store for her.  Noah Wright has had the hots for his curvy neighbor for months. Too bad she’s got a boyfriend. When he allows Gerri to set him up on a date, he never expected for her to get him the woman he and his panther have lusted after.  A stalking ex and a crazy family make Maya’s life a living hell. Both will try to tear them apart. She’ll have to figure out what she wants with Noah before losing a chance at love with the lonely panther.  Reader Note: This book contains panty-melting sex (the kind that makes you need fudge and a cold shower), adult language (we like some freaky dirty talk), and possible violence. If this is not the kind of stuff you like to read, skip this book. However, if you like dirty, raunchy sex with a sexy panther on one curvy sarcastic girl, then this is right up your alley. Enjoy!  Can be read as a standalone",
