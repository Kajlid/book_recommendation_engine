The background is one of blitzed ruins, 'bommies', surrounding a lonely mile of The Highway that runs alongside the docks. Here, where the sense of destruction is ever present, live Kate's mother and brutal stepfather. Here Kate and Jon, two school kids deeply in love but too young to date, meet secretly. Here too lives Bobby, leader of the Alleycats, sworn enemy of the Hellcats, Kate's tender-hearted protector and Jon's rival. And always at Bobby's side is Adam, enigmatic Shadowcat, prophet, warrior and soul brother.'Bobby's Girl' is a story of love, and of different loves - tragic, compelling and masterly in its recreation of an epoch.",
