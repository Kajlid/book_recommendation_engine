  "description": "Lexi Brooks has overcome adversity to build a successful real estate business that will enable her to enjoy life on her terms. She envisions travel, fun, and excitement, not marriage, kids or commitment. But will Trey's sexy bodyguard, Josh, throw a wrench into her plans? Being a cop taught Josh Cooper to take calculated risks, but he's tired of living with the daily threat of danger. He's ready to settle down with someone who wants to be a step-mother to his two teenage sons. Too bad Lexi isn't that woman. She's sexy, smart, head-strong, and they're totally in sync in the bedroom, but she isn't willing to settle for a life of domestic bliss. Or is she?",
