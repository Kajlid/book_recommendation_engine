  "title": "An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis",
  "description": "Jacques Lacan's thinking revolutionised the theory and practice of psychoanalysis and had a major impact in fields as diverse as film studies, literary criticism, feminist theory and philosophy. Yet his writings are notorious for their complexity and idiosyncratic style. Emphasising the clinical basis of Lacan's work, An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis is an ideal companion to his ideas for readers in every discipline where his influence is felt. The Dictionary features:* over 200 entries, explaining Lacan's own terminology and his use of common psychoanalytic expressions* details of the historical and institutional context of Lacan's work* reference to the origins of major concepts in the work of Freud, Saussure, Hegel and other key thinkers* a chronology of Lacan's life and works.",
