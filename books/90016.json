  "description": "A four book series about a girl named Prissie Pomeroy, who discovers that she is able to see the angels that live among us---including her own guardian angel, Koji. As she becomes aware, she discovers an invisible world, and while parts of it are too beautiful for words, there are unspeakably terrible things as well. As a spiritual battle unfolds around her small town, over the course of the series, it becomes evident that there is a much larger war being waged, and Prissie has a large part to play. Prissie is awed by her glimpse of things to come. In the face of God's greatness, she feels very small indeed. As the series reaches its resolution, Prissie's burgeoning faith receives the support it needs to grow straight and strong... from both expected and unexpected quarters.",
