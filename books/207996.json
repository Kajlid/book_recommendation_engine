  "description": "Francesca is a confident thirty-year-old who dances through life and relationships at her own rules, as free as the sea and as light as the wind. She has always lived for her art and without any ties save for her two friends but when Margherita moves to Japan and Sabrina keeps at a distance, Francesca suddenly finds herself alone.Itâ€™s by chance that Francesca meets Leonardo, a young man who faces life with joy despite a terrible accident that has forced him on a wheelchair. They immediately fall into an easy friendship, but perhaps the tenderness between them can turn into something more and together they will find the courage to love each other.",
