  "description": "Yau's comic and cutting poetry collides with the work of Nozkowski, whom the New Yorker has termed \"the Chardin of contemporary abstraction.\" The end result is a dazzling and vibrant concoction of visual and written imagery. All the poems in Ing Grish are new, as are Nozkowski's paintings and illustrations, which he created expressly for this collection.Ing Grish was named \"Book of the Year\" by Small Press Traffic in San Francisco.",
