The connection between them is undeniable, and for the first time in years, Nico starts to consider the possibility of trusting his tattered heart to someone again.But when a secret is revealed that shakes him to his core and threatens to tear his family apart, Nico runs, so far and so fast that no one, not even the man who was making him believe he could love again, might ever be able to reach him.This gay romance is approximately 95,000 words in length. It is the tenth book in the Firsts and Forever Series, but each book is written to stand alone, so jump in anywhere.Please note: Contains adult language and graphic sex.
