  "description": "Light Bird gave little thought to danger: she was the only daughter in a family of men renowned for courage. She spent her days in the pleasant company of her mother, grandmother, aunts and cousins, and evenings listening to stories about The Creator. Only one thing marred her happiness: a tall warrior who was determined to have her. Each summer he visited her village and each summer her father turned him away, but in the Spring of 1839 he brought an altogether different threat ... Seeking vengeance for the murders of his wife and son, her father's fiercest enemy trailed the prints left carelessly by their attacker - and followed them straight to Light Bird!",
