  "description": "Crenellations is a marvelous collection of poetry that will enchant and inspire the reader to the greatest of human emotions. This is a seamless journey from the mist-enshrouded hills of Scotland to the peace of the Cathedral at York, from the mysterious Stonehenge to the sparkling vision of a fairy bower, and from dragons and wizards to the simplest of Earthâ€™s creatures. May this journey be but the first step as we stride the path of greater knowledge, embracing all that we are and all that we may some day become.",
