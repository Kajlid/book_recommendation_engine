  "description": "I’ve made lots of mistakes.But never one like this.Back in high school, the girl next door spent a serendipitous night in my arms. But she wasn’t my type or really up to my level.So I walked away not knowing her secret—our secret.Years later, I’m still at the top of my game, ruling my own chunk of the world.She walks into my office a different woman. Strong, sexy, and dead set on revenge.I need to walk away again, but I can’t. She’s a different person, and yet, all the things that first had me taking a chance with her pull me back in—deeper this time.She’s going to wreck my life, one bad decision at a time, and I’m going to let her.The fact that the little man who calls her mom acts like me stops me in my tracks. He even loves the same things I do.Surely not.No damn way I’ve been a selfish bastard and haven’t considered the possibilities of our night together so long ago, but it’s true.He’s mine, and I’m instantly in love with both of them.I need one more chance, and I’ll do anything to get it.Every good girl deserves a bad boy. ~ Weston",
