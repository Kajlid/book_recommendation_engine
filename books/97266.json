  "description": "I am Maggie Maddock. Some call me a wilder - a woman with untamed magical powers. Others just call me a witch. My childhood was spent dreaming of a world beyond my hometown of Dark Root - a world where I could be whatever I wanted to be, and not the coven-leader I was slated to become under the tutelage of my mother. When I finally got the opportunity to leave I jumped at it, never looking back. Now, seven years later a call from my beloved sister forces me to return to Dark Root and I'm unprepared for what awaits me: a mother with a mysterious illness, a renewed sibling rivalry, and a town that's fallen into disrepair and has lost its magic. I never wanted to be a witch but it seems I have no choice. I only hope it's not too late to set things right again.",
