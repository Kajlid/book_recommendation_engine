T-Rex Head Hands.\n  After the Wolfman nation is shattered, Jaxon has enough spare time to advance his skills and specialize into a better class. Since Joe and his other teammates are either incapacitated or on a mission Jaxon does not believe in, the misunderstood chiropractor turned gamer strikes out on his own.  The issue with creating your own path is that you have no idea what awaits you, especially when low charisma guarantees legendary misunderstandings. For Jaxon, thatâ€™s half the fun.  Rexus is a Completionist Chronicles side quest focused on Jaxon and is meant to be read following Regicide.",
