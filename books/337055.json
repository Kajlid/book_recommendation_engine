  "description": "Nothing’s real on reality TV—or is it?Everyone knows Kell Simmons manages the Matthew brothers, the three hottest stars in Hollywood: action hero Ryan, romantic lead Ash, and sports star Jonah. But no one knows that she’s hopelessly in love with one of them.When Ryan’s surprise engagement to a fan just about breaks Kell’s heart, Ash, himself unhappily in love, lends his shoulder to cry on. All this is great fodder for a reality TV show, one for which the brothers sign on for, and soon the days of their lives are filled with scripted dates, fake drama, and real heartache—all in front of a camera.As the brothers’ popularity skyrockets into the stratosphere, Kell finds herself wondering how much, if any, of the spotlight she wants, if it means foregoing real love for fun and games on TV.",
