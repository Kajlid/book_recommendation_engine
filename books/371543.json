  "description": "MOLLYMoving to Seattle is supposed to be all about getting a fresh start and leaving the bitter man I was becoming behind.I have new roommates–quirky, sometimes strange, roommates–a nosy, next door neighbor and a grumpy kitty for company, but even surrounded by people, I still don’t feel like I belong. Plus, it turns out the men in Seattle are exactly the same as the ones I left behind, and my string of romantic disconnections continues.It’s not until one of my roommates, Seven, hits me with some hard truths that I realize where I was going wrong.Maybe the men aren’t the problem.I am.And there’s only one way to fix that.SEVENBeing found tied up naked to my bed by my cute new roommate isn’t an ideal way for us to start a friendship.But apparently a quid-pro-quo is.He keeps his pretty lips zipped about the compromising position, and I step in as his dating coach. We go out, I point out where he’s going wrong, and he magically becomes dating material.The problem is, between my codependent brother Xander and a new best friend I can’t get rid of, Molly and I are the target of a matchmaking scheme. My life is way too busy to add another person to it, and Molly is the kinda guy who needs to be made a priority, which I just can’t do. Xander’s medical anxiety takes up too much of my time, and I’ve never found a partner who doesn’t resent it.I’m determined to help Molly find his ever after.But that guy will never be me.",
