  "title": "Dinner with Mr. Darcy: Recipes Inspired By the Novels of Jane Austen",
  "description": "Food is an important theme in Jane Austen's novels-it is used as a commodity for showing off, as a way of showing kindliness among neighbors, as part of the dynamics of family life, and-of course-for comic effect. In Dinner with Mr Darcy, Pen Vogler takes authentic recipes from the period, inspired by the food that features in Austen's novels and letters, and adapts them for contemporary cooks. The text is interwoven throughout with quotes from the novels, and feature spreads cover some of the key themes of food and eating in Austen's time, including table arrangements, kitchens and gardens, changing mealtimes, and servants and service. Whether you are hoping to beguile a single gentleman in possession of a substantial fortune, or you just want to have your own version of the picnic on Box Hill in Emma, you will find fully updated recipes using easily available ingredients to help you recreate the dishes and dining experiences of Jane Austen's characters and their contemporaries.",
