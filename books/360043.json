  "description": "#4 Callum Duquette. Placekicker for the Boston Tomcats. Former underwear model. NICKNAME: Duke. I thought the most annoying thing about being a single dad was that my friends were always trying to find me a date. Until a sassy British ray of sunshine bumps into me at a bookstore. One accidental butt grab, a viral photo, and a lot of misunderstandings later, I find myself in a fake relationship with a movie star. Now I’ve got my friends off my back, but the cheeky Brit has complicated my life even more. She calls me the Duke of Grumpville. I call her movies the end of civilization as we know it. She calls my job “the wrong kind of football.” I call her the one thing on Earth that can make me lose focus and control. It’s getting harder to pretend I still want this to end after my team’s game in London. I thought we were only faking it. But getting to know the real Millie Darden changed everything.",
