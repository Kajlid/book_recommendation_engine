  "description": "How do you protect the girl, when the most dangerous threat in her life is you?   Kane Bishop is a professional enforcer, smuggler, all-around law breaker, and the latest resident of a tiny town hidden by mountains and forest.  His job is to keep his kingpin boss safe and off the local law enforcement's radar.  But when Jessica Lenaghan - immediate family to the police that just won't mind their own damn business - steps into Kane's world, his protective instincts take a wild one-eighty and his focus shifts to someone other than the man he works for.  Jess is months away from sitting the bar exam, but she has a point to prove: she doesn't always have to be the good, dependable girl in the family.  But dipping her toes into Kane's world turns into something she never anticipated.  When drugs, guns, and wh*res are involved, all bets are off.  Join the crew on a nail-biting ride of adrenaline, murder, and one good-girl shooting at her bad-boy because he annoyed her one too many times.  SHELTER is book 1 in The Checkmate Series, and can be read as a complete Standalone.",
