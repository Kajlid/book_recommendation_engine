  "description": "When you have dreams of pandemonium on earth, it’s hard to ignore them. That’s all Sophia LeClair thought they were until a strange meeting with a tall, dark, and extremely hot vampire changed her life overnight.  Soon Sophia realizes that there are parts of her past that have been kept hidden from her, and only now have come to light. She must work with the mysterious vampire and the Inner Sanctum. A council that rules over the supernaturals and keeps humans safe in order to come to terms with who she is and most importantly the powers that now belong to her. For she is an Illumini, a witch that has been granted special powers in order to fight against demons and evil alike.  Problems arise when a black coven gains knowledge of her existence. Sophia and her friends must fight against the coven who has been aided by other supernaturals looking to open the Gates of Hell, in order to let out the higher castes of demons.  Together they must stop at nothing to keep Sophia’s visions of the future from coming true. If they don’t then all hell will break loose. So much for having a normal everyday life.",
