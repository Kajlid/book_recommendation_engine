  "description": "Free-spirited ballet dancer Quinn is sure he made a terrible mistake by agreeing to be Duke’s roommate. The big cop is the most uptight person Quinn’s ever met, and both men begin driving each other crazy from day one.  Before long though, an undeniable spark of attraction ignites between them. But do opposites really attract? Or will their differences prove to be more than either of them can handle?  This gay romance is the fifteenth book in Alexa Land’s best-selling Firsts and Forever Series, but each novel is written to stand alone, so jump in anywhere. Note: contains adult language and graphic sex and is only intended for adults.",
