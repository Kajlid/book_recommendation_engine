  "description": "How much would you endure for your best friend? Would you plan an elaborate event that you don't believe in? Put up with a woman you never wanted to see again? Fake enthusiasm for an unrealistic pipe dream? Skye MacKinnon is forced to answer these questions when she's asked to be her best friend's maid of honor. As a cynic, she rejects the notion of marital bliss, but for a friend, she'll give it her best effort. That becomes more difficult the moment she learns that her old college nemesis, Ainsley Baird, will be playing an important role in the wedding. Brilliant, beautiful Ainsley has many talents, chief among them is irritating Skye. Knowing how easily Ainsley pushes her buttons, Skye just hopes to get through the wedding without needing someone to post her bail.",
