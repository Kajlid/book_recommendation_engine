  "description": "Since they had told him that he was the seven billionth child born on earth and since he was at that age when everything is taken seriously, he could not get those words 'seven billionth' and 'world' out of his head and he did not really know if he was the number or the world or even both.Anyway, he opened up his eyes and took at heart the numbers and facts of the world.He grew up like no other child had done before.His mother would take him to the park and instead of playing ball, learning to bike ride, throw pebbles in the water, give breadcrumbs to the goose, go down the slides, or go on the swing like all the other children did, he would simply lay down on the lawn and count how many flowers and how many strands of grass there were and, amazing as it may seem, he knew it!",
