  "description": "Once again, Donna Cooner (Skinny, Can't Look Away) taps into the zeitgeist to bring us a searing story about online bullying and superficiality. An addictive new app is all the rage at Linden Wilson's high school. Worthy ranks couples, determining via votes and user comments if one person is \"worthy\" of the other. Linden is happily dating Alex Garcia, and can't imagine the app will affect them. Until Alex is labeled \"worthy,\" and Linden \"unworthy.\" Suddenly, everything changes. Linden must struggle under this newfound scrutiny as her relationships—with Alex, with her friends—are put to the ultimate test.",
