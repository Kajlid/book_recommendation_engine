  "title": "Keeping the Faith: Daily Reflections to Build Strength, Serenity, and Passion in Your Life and the Lives of Others",
  "description": "THE TRUE FAITH THAT MUST BE FOUND AND KEPT IS THE FAITH IN ONESELF Each day you give a part of yourself whether it is at work, at home, or in your daily interaction with others. How do you give of yourself? Do you hold back or go at life half-heartedly? You need to give of yourself with heart, mind, and soul all the time. You never know what interaction with a person will make a difference in their life -- or yours. If you don’t believe in yourself and don’t have the confidence to grow each day, then you are missing out on what life has to offer you. This simple book will inspire you to help others. Or, at the very least, you will make another person’s day -- and, therefore, your day -- better.",
