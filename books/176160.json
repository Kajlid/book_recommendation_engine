  "description": "Falling Water: Stories & Poetry may give you a new perspective on life! It is a book to be savored, a unique gathering of stories and poetry that offers an insightful look at life in all of its highs and its lows, its joys and grief. The poems were compiled especially for this book from handwritten journals I’ve kept over the years. They balance the stories and help explore the realities of life we all face, from hope and happiness to the inevitable suffering that must accompany the good. These are tales of love, and loss, hope, strength, acceptance and the courage to carry on, with a greater understanding and appreciation for the good in life. There is sadness in these vignettes, but woven through them all is hope in the redeeming goodness of life. Wander into this book and you’re sure to find something you forgot, something you care about.",
