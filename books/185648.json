  "description": "Madison Falls is heating up this summer … and things are about to get hotter when Keith Sutton makes it his mission to make Sabrina O’Malley his. Too bad Sabrina can’t stand the sight of Keith! Welcome back to Madison Falls, where love is in the air and gossip is ripe on the vine. Made for Me, Book 3 of Susan Behon’s contemporary romance series, will be a great addition to your romance library.  Sabrina O’Malley can’t stand the sight of Keith Sutton.  At least, that’s what she keeps telling herself. In all honesty, she loves sneaking peeks at the gorgeous, golden-haired construction foreman. It’s easy to forget how arrogant and irritating Keith is when she admires him from afar and can’t hear him talking.  The problem is, he’s always talking. Keith won’t let Sabrina forget her drunken and failed attempt to kiss him. He’s determined to get a do-over and she’s determined to avoid him at all costs. If he has to rile her up to get her attention, and that kiss, Keith is all for it.  Sparks fly when trouble comes to Madison Falls and they are thrown together in an effort to stop it. When Sabrina is targeted and comes under fire, Keith is resolved to keep her safe. To do that, he needs to get past Sabrina’s defenses.  Will Sabrina put her pride aside and give Keith a chance before it’s too late?  Content Spicy, Contemporary",
