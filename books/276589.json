  "title": "Healing from Emotional Traumas: Release the Pain Sabotaging Your Happiness",
  "description": "Life as we know it can be tough and often it is because of hidden memories that haunt us even when we do not remember. From childhood abuse to a pregnancy loss, domestic violence to post-traumatic stress, our lives are full of baggage we find hard to let go or unload. Healing from Emotional Traumas is therapy, coaching you through identifying the traumas that have affected your mood, your outlook on life, and your relationships with others. The goal is healing, and the process demands a commitment to change. We all have remnants of our past trapped in our subconscious, and unless addressed, they will keep sabotaging our future.",
