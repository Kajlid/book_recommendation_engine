  "description": "I’ve been many things in my life.A liar.A cheater.A thief.And I’ve never had a problem with any of it.I knew my path, knew which direction I was heading when it was all over—straight to Satan’s lair.I accepted it, reveled in it, and always asked for more.Nothing would change me, no one could sway me.Or so I thought. I knew I was a monster.I just don’t know how to convince Cara Gibson that I’m her monster.",
