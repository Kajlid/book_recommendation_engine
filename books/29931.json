  "description": "It wasn't right. She knew it. It wasn't a lack of love or affection that drove her to step out on the only man she had ever loved. It was loneliness. Then her husband, John, discovered her infidelity. He was furious. Why wouldn't he be? He was deeply in love with her. �Get out!� he ordered. But she couldn't leave, she loved him, and she begged to stay. �I'll do anything...anything you want, she begged.The PVC skirt and bustier made her look ridiculous and all but put her breasts on public display. But there was no choice in the matter, not if she wanted to save her marriage. Before long she was acting the part of a perfect, sex-starved, and brainless, bimbo wife. She had no way of knowing her act would become reality.",
