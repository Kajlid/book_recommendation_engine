  "description": "KaiThere is nothing I care about.No attachments.No connections. Outwardly, I’m a perfect gentleman.Until my target sees my knife.I fear nothing, not even death.In my world, death is considered a privilege.But my life comes with unbreakable cruel strings and when I met her, I should’ve walked away. I didn’t. I was too selfish.And that sealed her fate.Because one week with me led her into the hands of ruin.LondonWe all have unique layers that make up who we are. What makes us vulnerable or strong.What we fear and what excites us.But peel back those layers and you’re left naked and exposed.They did that to me. Each piece was slowly stripped away then burned.I merely existed.But there was one layer they overlooked.The most important of them all—the tie to one man.The man responsible for me being this way.The man who found me.And the killer who would do anything to protect me.Perfect Ruin is the story of Kai and London.
