  "description": "Richard Reeves's acclaimed account of a presidency solves the puzzle of Ronald Reagan -- a man of limited breadth and knowledge who was perhaps the most effective superpower president.Using the techniques he employed in his bestselling books on Presidents Kennedy and Nixon, Reeves takes us inside Reagan's Oval Office, where we find a charismatic, crafty, focused politician. Astonishing in its intimacy, authoritative in its sourcing, President Reagan is a portrait of modern presidential power that will stand as the definitive study of Reagan in the White House.",
