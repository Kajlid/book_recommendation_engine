  "description": "Ashton Archer has it all. He's the biggest man on his campus, he's got a family fortune waiting for him to transfer into his own account, and his closet and garage are full of the coolest accoutrements available, from flash suits to swank shoes to a zippy Vespa scooter. It appears that nothing can go wrong for this hard-hearted hottieâ€”that is until the sexy and fashionable Margaret Sheldon motors by on her Lambretta. At that moment, Ashton's life takes a turn for the worse. Everyone at school hates him, his father declares bankruptcy, and his scooter gets run over by a truck. Even high-tailing it out of town does him no good, because wherever he goes, Margaret follows. How can he get out of the black curse this woman has placed on his life? By getting her to fall in love with him, of course!",
