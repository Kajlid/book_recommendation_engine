  "title": "The No-No Bugs: Back Yard Nature Kids",
  "description": "The No-No Bugs are bugs that kids should not touch because they sting, bite, or cause a rash. These scary or bad bugs are shown in vivid color photos set to a rhyming poem. Meet assassin bugs, robber flies, scorpions, spiders, caterpillars, centipedes, hornets, and red velvet ants which are actually wingless wasps. Other imposter bugs include flies that look like bees, and assassin bugs that look like spiders. Facts are fun when they're in a rhyme, and your child will learn that the lime green and brown Saddleback Caterpillar can sting, the very pretty White Marked Tussock Moth caterpillar can give you a rash, and that the Unicorn Caterpillar can burn you. Color words yellow, red, brown, green, blue, black, white. Every page in The No-No Bugs is a full color photograph with a four-line poem. 15 story pages â€” suitable for kids of ages 3 to 8.",
