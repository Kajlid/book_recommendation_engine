  "description": "They say opposites attract, and that could be the only explanation for Johanna's attraction to Paul. Wherever Paul goes, laughter follows, and Johanna longs to be a part of his inner circle. Getting Paul into her life turns out to be the easy part. Keeping Paul happy is tough, even for an overachiever like Johanna. And keeping Paul happy is a must, because when he's not, Johanna becomes his target. But can she find the strength to change her life when Paul's happiness becomes more important to Johanna than her family, her friends, and even her own safety?",
