When her long lost sister - a prostitute - is won in a card game by a brutal drug cartel, Zelda knows what she has to take her place. Save her. Focus on infiltrating the shadowy group on behalf of the Associates, and try not to think about why she left the spying game years ago. She’s slept with dangerous criminals before; she can do it again.  Hugo Martinez is one of South America’s most lethal and wanted men, a legendary mercenary living on a windswept mountain. Even at the height of the war he wasn’t in the habit of taking women captive, but the American whore has seen his face. And he and the orphan boy need a cook. He shouldn’t want this woman, but there’s something so unusual about her…  Little by little, Zelda finds herself falling for her captor…but is he the killer she’s been hunting all these years?",
