  "description": "“You want to fake date me?”   Music is my life, my band is my heart and soul, and it’s all falling apart before my eyes.  A plan hatched from desperation as we both watch our careers burn down around us. Dating my best friend’s twin brother, Paris, who just so happens to be a gay icon at the moment seems like the perfect plan. And if we have a little fun along the way, where’s the harm in that? The band is spiraling, his football career is going up in flames, and the more the world falls down around us, the easier it is to get lost in each other.  But are stolen moments during our own busy schedules and hurried kisses hidden behind social media posts the basis for a real relationship, or is this just another thing that’s going to turn to dust in our hands?   **Strike a Chord is the fourth and final book in the Replay series. This series can be read in any order.",
