Until she ruined me. Guinevere made her choice and it wasn't me. So I sought out a way to fight the pain of losing her...of losing them both. Eternally languishing in purgatory was not what I had in mind. But now, hundreds of years later, I've been returned to life for a reason. The end times are here, and I'm the one chosen to help stop the apocalypse. I only wish the woman I'm bound to wasn't the very one I'd tried to forget. My Gwen had a secret she never shared in our past life together. She's a witch, cursed to live forever, and she's never forgiven me for what happened between us.I am Lancelot du Lac. I was her champion once, I will be again, and this time, I wonâ€™t so willingly share. Note: This is book 1 of a duet.
