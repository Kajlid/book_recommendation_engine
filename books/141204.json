  "description": "Submissive wolf shifter Levi has met his mate, the one he wants to call Master. The problem is the Master concerned wants him for nothing more than a regular Saturday night scene and thanks to the rules the man has put in place there is nothing Levi can do about it.  Thanks to the war Steel is a damaged wolf. He knows Levi is his mate and wants nothing more than to claim him. But to do that means spilling more secrets than Steel has ever been willing to share with anyone. Does he have it in him to tell Levi what is going on, or should he release him to another Master at the club?  Two men who want each other - rules and secrets standing in their way.  Warning - this book is based on BDSM concepts and contains graphic scenes of M/M sex, strong language in places and a small amount of violence, plus an HEA. Please do not buy if you find these concepts objectionable.  28,000 words plus a sample chapter from the next book of the series.",
