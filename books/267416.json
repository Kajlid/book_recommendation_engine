  "description": "Witch detectives really shouldn’t date vampires. We should stick to nice, sensible, fang-free guys… Yep -- I’ve got a friend who happens to be a vampire… and he just asked me over for dinner. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be a date. I mean, he said “we’ll light some candles.” Sounds pretty intimate, to me. I’m going to be in his apartment -- alone with him. What should I wear? Should I go home and shave my legs? How should I do my hair? I think I’m hyperventilating. And I really can’t concentrate on this new case. A few days back I practically stumbled over the dead body on my way home from the bar, and it’s up to me to connect the dots and catch the killer. I must focus… time to really get down to work. But first maybe I’ll go home and shave my legs. The Case of the Desire Spell is a laugh-out-loud, clean cozy mystery featuring Penny Banks, an amateur sleuth and budding witch. Enjoy the third book in the 13 book Hillcrest Witch Mystery series and get to know Penny, her quirky friends, and their lovable familiars.
