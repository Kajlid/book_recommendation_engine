  "description": "When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. She’s too smart for her own good, and it’s going to get her killed. Against my better judgement, I put her under the protection of my powerful Russian mafia family. So imagine my anger when the little minx ran. For three long years I’ve been on her trail, always one step behind. Finding and claiming her had become an obsession. It was getting harder to rein in my driving need to possess her… to own her. But now the chase was over. I’ve found her. Soon she will be mine. And I plan to make it official, even if I have to drag her kicking and screaming to the altar. This time… there will be no escape from me.",
