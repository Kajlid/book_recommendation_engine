  "description": "Centuries ago, the planet Rades was nearly destroyed when nuclear weapons brought by human colonists exploded. The native Endemi people have never forgiven the invaders for the holocaust that followed. As a result of the radiation, some male humans developed enhanced physic abilities and established the order of mystics. Now, the mystic Ghyle realizes an old enemy has found a cache of the ancient weapons and is threatening to use them. Unable to risk open confrontation, Ghyle gathers a team to help him defend Rades from a second nuclear holocaust: Rayl, a master of disguise; Dain, a martial arts expert; Chand, a healer; and Captain Tallock, a battle veteran. He even secures the aid of Delph, the Endemi crown prince. Ghyle's hope for their survival rises when his team gains one final member: Vitora, a mysterious woman with magical abilities unlike anyone else.",
