  "description": "Logan Lockwood, with his parents in tow, came home to a house in disarray. His favorite chair is broken and the scent of a stranger permeates through the house. Chasing her scent to his room, he sees a beautiful blonde laying in his bed. All can be forgiven because she’s his.  Grace Harper got into a world of trouble simply because she had to use the bathroom. Always the good girl, she’d never before thought of entering someone’s home uninvited, but desperate times and all that. Things go from messed up to extremely confusing with just a quick nap.  What happens when she wakes to find three large people staring at her, one with possession on his mind and desire in his eyes?  Can she accept Logan's claim or will he be forced to let her go?",
