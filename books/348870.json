  "description": "Every day, 2,600 Americans die of cardiovascular disease—and despite remarkable interventional and surgical procedures, over 650,000 new heart attacks occur annually.In The Heart Speaks, Dr. Mimi Guarneri reveals groundbreaking new research that the heart is a multilayered, complex organ, possessing intelligence, memory, and decision-making abilities independent from the mind—and that healing the heart can have more to do with healing the mind and soul than we ever knew.From childhood in a family riddled with heart disease to a medical career facing the pounding heartbeats of cardiac emergencies, Dr. Guarneri draws us into the intimate moments of life and death, and leads us on a riveting exploration of the heart's many mysteries. Through her compelling memoir we see that it is only by knowing the whole heart—its mental, emotional, spiritual, and universal aspects—that we can truly heal.",
