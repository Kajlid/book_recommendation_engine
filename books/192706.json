A book of poems and ballads.Poems written to preserve memories, explore moods, emotions, art, myths, real events and dreams, together with some attempts at light verse, even nonsense.Ballads that tell tales, reflect on the seasons, time and its passing.The poet enters the mead hall, un-lids his word hoard, recites. He shares his gift.Those who attend to his works, he hopes to entertain.",
