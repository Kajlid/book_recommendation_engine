  "description": "Since her divorce a year ago, Susan Caraway has gone through the motions of life. Now she is finally coming out of her shell. Just when she decides on a makeover and a new career, her family members call on her for crisis assistance. First there's her sister DeLorean who has returned from California with a baby, a designer dog, and no prospects for child support or a job. Susan's son Christian comes home from college trailing what Susan's mama refers to as \"an androgynous little tart.\" Then there's Mama herself, a southern lady who wrote the book on bossy. A secret from Mama's past threatens to unravel her own peace. But not before Mama has to move into Susan's home with her babies--two Chihuahuas with attitude. Susan would like to start her new job as a ghost tour operator. She would like to renew her relationship with Jack Maxwell, a man from her past. But Jack isn't going to stand in line behind her needy family.",
