  "description": "When a shady character offers him $25,000 to steal a thousand-year-old pot from the Valle del Rio Museum, Hubert Schuze knows he should turn it down. His pot digging may be illegal, but it s a big step from that to robbery. But he figures it can t hurt just to visit the museum and assay his chances. He figured wrong. After deciding the museum is impregnable, he returns to his shop to find a BLM agent who accuses him of stealing the rare pot. Theft charges escalate to murder, and Hubert must solve the crime to clear himself. His powerful deductive skills and weak nerves are put to the test as he creates a hoax to get the pot out of the museum and solves both the first murder and a second one whose victim turns out to be the person Schuze thought was murdered to begin with!",
