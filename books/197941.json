  "description": "One of the biggest challenges teachers face is also the most essential skillset to Classroom Management. Tons of techniques and strategies exist, but most are doomed from the start. The Child Classroom Management Through Calmness and Consequences shows teachers how to keep student disruption and their own stress level down to a minimum. The program uses a simple, consistent, no-nonsense approach that incentivizes kids to behave according to the teacher's expectations, not how loud she yells. Throw away your color charts and behavior contracts, and stop pulling out your hair. Become the teacher you've always wanted to be. Become the Child Whisperer. About the Author Alexander Zwick is an elementary school teacher in Los Angeles who has been called \"The Child Whisperer\" by parents, colleagues, and administrators. His class is structured, yet inviting, and his students are extremely well-behaved. They do not talk out of turn, and whisper when working in small groups. On top of all that, he never yells. After years of being asked for the secrets behind his success, he is finally telling all.",
