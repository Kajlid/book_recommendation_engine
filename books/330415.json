  "description": "Julian Malono loves his job as conditioning coach for the university football team. When he meets incoming freshman quarterback, Koby McIntire, he's instantly attracted and offers to help with Koby's conditioning regime. Koby is thrilled when his all-time favourite player agrees to help him. Not only can they work on Koby's upper body strength, but maybe on the growing attraction between them. What Koby doesn't know is that a lifetime of abuse has left its mark on Julian. When shadows from the past threaten their growing relationship, Koby helps Julian fight back by getting him the help he so desperately needs. But will therapy be enough when the past comes back to threaten Julian in person?",
