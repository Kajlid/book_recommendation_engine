  "title": "Mad Love",
  "description": "Mad Love has been acknowledged an undisputed classic of the surrealist movement since its first publication in France in 1937. Its adulation of love as both mystery and revelation places it in the most abiding of literary traditions, but its stormy history and technical difficulty have prevented it from being translated into English until now. \"There has never been any forbidden fruit. Only temptation is divine,\" writes André Breton, leader of the surrealists in Paris in the 1920s and '30s. Mad Love is dedicated to defying \"the widespread opinion that love wears out, like the diamond, in its own dust.\" Celebrating breton's own love and lover, the book unveils the marvelous in everyday encounters and the hidden depths of ordinary things.",
