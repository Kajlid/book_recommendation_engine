  "description": "Ireland, 1830s. It was a time when English landlords held power over Irish tenant farmers and seeds of bitterness were sown that would last for generations.In an endeavor to eliminate all influences of Irish heritage, the English forced an intellectual and spiritual bondage on Ireland as well as a bitter physical bondage of servitude. Freedom had become so rare that the Irish coined a saying, \"In Ireland only the rivers run free.\" Yet one poor, befuddled old woman speaks of freedom, truth, and hope. Mad Molly Fahey promises the priest and villages that a miracle is on its way.",
