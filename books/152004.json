  "title": "Howard Nostrand's Nightmares",
  "description": "Howard Nostrand's brilliant horror comics art was done during the height of the criticism against comics that resulted in government investigations and the Comics Code. Nostrand's style was an incredibly skilled, perfect mashup of the EC artists Wally Wood and Jack Davis. Nostrand assisted Bob Powell (the subject of the popular book Bob Powell's Terror), but these comics are pure Nostrand, the very best of his fearsome comics! Like Powell, Nostrand could be as innovative as Will Eisner, another influence on the artist. Featuring five stories painstakingly reproduced from rare, original art, Nostrand's Nightmares includes a profusely illustrated Introduction by Eisner-winner Craig Yoe.",
