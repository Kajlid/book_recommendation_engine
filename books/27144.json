  "description": "What’s worse than playing a fake girlfriend to the all-pro defensive end for the Seattle Phantom? When the same infamous playboy is my ex-husband’s best friend. I’m normally great at keeping my distance from him—pretending like he doesn’t get under my skin. But after he punches a teammate over me, we’re stuck faking a relationship to save his career and mine. If we play the game well, we could both get out ahead. I just have to remember everything about this is for show, including the reformed player act. A few blurred lines and crossed boundaries won’t change things. Because falling for your ex’s best friend is wrong, right?",
