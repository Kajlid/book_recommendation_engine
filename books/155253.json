  "title": "Mini Myths: Brush Your Hair, Medusa!",
  "description": "The Mini Myths board book series puts a modern spin on ancient Greek mythology for preschoolers.* MEDUSA refuses to care for her hair, her long locks getting knottier and wilder with each passing page. Her hair rebellion elicits frozen expressions of shock from her family, but nothing will convince Medusa to brush. Only her hairdresser approaches Medusa with bravery and a blade, successfully solving the problem . . . with a short haircut! All are pleased with this drastic yet adorable solution.* Leslie Patricelli’s depictions of this physical comedy bring a lively visual narrative to Joan Holub’s expertly focused text.* Includes a short summary of the original Medusa myth at the end.",
