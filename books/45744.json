  "description": "In the early 1960s, four girls, as part of a 7th grade, nationwide school program, become pen pals. They have little in common but become lifelong friends who confront together the challenges girls confront in the world they confront them. Through their letters, we share their lives--their hopes and dreams, triumphs and defeats, joys and sorrows--and for all their differences, we discover that they are stronger and wiser for having and being friends.",
