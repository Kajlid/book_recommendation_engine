  "description": "These are three short stories by Amazon best-selling author, Tom Winton. Both his novels published this year (Beyond Nostalgia and The Last American Martyr) have been on several Amazon best-sellers lists.All three of these short stories are filled with the emotion and drama that has become a trademark of Tom Winton's previous work. In each of them, he delves deep into the human condition.The title story, The Voice of Willie Morgan, is about a thirty-nine-year-old oil baron who is constantly at odds with himself. It is his job to continually lead big-oil to higher and higher profits, yet he's constantly lambasted by the words of his long-dead, blue-collar father for what his industry is doing to the planet and its inhabitants.Squandered Prayers is an embellished version of a single chapter from Winton's first best-seller, Beyond Nostalgia. It touches on a young, under-class son's struggle to deal with his mother's escalating mental illness.The third story, Movin' On, is a best-seller on Random House's Youwriteon community for writers. It's the story of a dysfunctional family's trip to Florida where they hope they will find enough sunshine to save the parents' failing marriage.",
