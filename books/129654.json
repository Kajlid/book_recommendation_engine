  "description": "Kaden is a carefree fun loving individual, but ever since his death he has been a little stressed. He discovers an old war between good and evil that is quickly approaching a climax, and evil definitely has the upper hand. He learns he cannot be reborn because his soul has awakened his hidden powers. He is going to have to become a Guardian of Life, and on top of all that, he might have a crush on one of the Governor’s top advisors.  After Kaden’s death, he goes from one of the youngest most inexperienced Guardians of life, and he becomes the most powerful Guardian in over a millennium. Unfortunately, he still might not be strong enough to help the Guardians of Life defeat the demon army that the world of Malum has gathered.",
