  "description": "A heavy burden rides the shoulders of young Gregory Hilliard—to discover the fate of a father he never knew. Did the elder Hilliard die with Hicks Pasha’s army at El Obeid in 1883 or, as his mother fervently hopes, did he somehow escape the massacre there by the fanatic Mahdist Dervishes?His greatest support comes from the Ja’alin Zaki, the love of his young life, his friend, and soul-mate.In a world that refuses to recognize the right of men to love men and in an era that looks down on the “inferior” natives, Gregory faces his most difficult battle for personal happiness. Success will bring him and Zaki fulfilment but also unravel a tragic and at the same time life-enhancing mystery with its roots in far away England… and in the solving of it, one which might yet rip the two lovers apart.The 145,000 word novel Gregory’s Story is the companion to A Life Apart. While Gregory’s Story stands alone as a novel, some of the characters from A Life Apart appear in this completely new story taking place ten years later.",
