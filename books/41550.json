  "description": "The adventure you’re about to embark upon is one of discovery and hope, as humanity comes to terms with its ‘First Contact’. When a fleet of spaceships arrives in orbit, it raises a number of compelling questions. What brings them here? Are they friendly? What will happen to us? The visitors from space do not behave exactly how we expected them to. But then, what did we really expect to happen? With the intentions of our visitors not being fully known or understood, we are powerless to do more than become bystanders to our own fate. As the series unfolds we discover that many answers simply raise even more questions.Earth's history is replete with examples of what happens when a powerful civilization meets a technologically inferior culture. The less advanced culture never comes away unaffected, at best they survive.‘First Contact’ follows events around the world as we get to learn a little about the individuals that eventually form an intrepid core group. Through design and luck, these varied individuals find themselves working together. Some are military, some civilian, others we are not so sure what their roles are, just yet. Some of these people work with these alien visitors, others against, as is our way when faced with uncertainties.The Terran Chronicles saga, with its twists and turns reveals humanity’s fate one step at a time. I do hope these words provoke your interest, as you take that first step with me and explore 'First Contact'.",
