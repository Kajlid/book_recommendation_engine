  "title": "The Olive Branch",
  "description": "This collection of Christian poetry by the author, coincides with a dedication about his auntie Olive, and the early part of his life spent living with her, and how he was influenced by her love of God, her morals and the Elim church she was a member of in Caerphilly for many years, in the South Wales valleys.Kelvin’s poems are echoes of his past spent in church, and especially Sunday school, and the inquisitive thoughts that constantly niggled away in his mind.Perhaps some of you may recognise your own thoughts and emotions about some of the thought provoking subjects mentioned.This book is full of delightful poetry that I think any Christian reader of any age would enjoy, as well as those who may be a little hesitant or unsure about their faith, or indeed any reader who enjoys graceful poetry.It’s hoped the content will bring comfort and hope, and a little laughter too, because going to church or reading the scriptures and stories can be fun, otherwise I’m sure the author, with his sense of humour, would never have gone to church in the first place.",
