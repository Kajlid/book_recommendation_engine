  "description": "For thousands of years, women have asked themselves: What is the deal with guys, anyway? What are they thinking? The answer, of course, is: virtually nothing. But that has not stopped Dave Barry from writing an entire book about them, dealing frankly and semi-thoroughly with such important guy issues as:- Scratching- Why the average guy can remember who won the 1960 World Series but necessarily the names of all his children- Why guys cannot simultaneously think and look at breasts- Secret guy orgasm-delaying techniques, including the Margaret Thatcher Method- Why guys prefer to believe that there is no such thing as a \"prostate\"",
