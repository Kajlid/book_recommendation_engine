They decide to join BUST, Belwood United to Save the Trees, a group of people who are trying to save the final few trees that are still standing. But what’s a girl to do when no one is listening or seems to care? When your favorite tree in the whole world, Luna, is about to be hacked to the ground, and you kind of like your friend Josh as more than a friend and have some stiff competition from the pretty, shiny-haired Hailey, another girl who has joined the group to get closer to Josh? Josh is ready to chain himself to the trees in protest, but how far is Alex willing to go to save her beloved Luna?Leanne Statland Ellis wrote Tree Huggers because, as a teacher for many years, she has encountered countless students who care deeply about the environment and want to take action to help in any way they can. As a teacher in Los Angeles, Leanne and her students studied the environment and became citizen foresters, often volunteering their time to plant trees with a local nonprofit organization. Many of the events in this book are true.She has seen firsthand the force of children’s passions and actions, and she wrote this book to remind children everywhere that they are powerful people who should never be told that they can’t make a difference because they are “just kids”.Buy it here: http://rfwp.com/5211.htm",
