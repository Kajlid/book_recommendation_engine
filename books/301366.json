But someone else is just as intrigued by Taylor’s unique condition as Eagle is…and his intentions are downright deadly.Soon, Eagle and Taylor are too caught up in each other to see the danger that’s approaching. But as time runs out, they’ll discover their love isn’t the only thing fighting to survive.",
