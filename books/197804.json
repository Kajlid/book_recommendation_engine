Alex Winter, a struggling London playwright and teacher, is trapped in a depressing life with only one spark of happiness, his fianc√©e. When he arrives home to discover he has lost her to his rich cousin it is almost more than he can bear. Filled with rage, he storms out of the house and walks along the canal path that leads to the nearby train station. On his approach to a short tunnel, he spies his cousin coming from the opposite direction. The two men enter the tunnel, but only one emerges. Under a false identity he flees to America, but instead of lying low as commonsense would dictate, he becomes involved with a famous theater actress. When diligent detective, Silas Mortimer, picks out the man on his criminal radar, he begins to investigate and one by one unravels the clues. As he feels the noose growing ever tighter, the fleeing man soon discovers there is nowhere he can run where his past won't follow. A story of deceit, false identities, the theater, stolen money, revenge, murder, people trying to escape their past and an unexpected twist.
