It’s the only one that didn’t turn me away when learning about my criminal record.After being screwed over by my ex, I vowed to never let another man close, but when my sweet, nerdy friend Mason asks for my help improving his skills in the bedroom, I can’t resist.And then there’s my gorgeous yet grumpy parole officer who has made it his mission to save me. They both seem determined to test my resolve, and it’s getting harder and harder to remind myself why it’s so dangerous to trust.** Heart is an MMM romance and the third book in the sexy, emotional Ballsy Boys series. It can be read as a stand-alone, but it’s more fun reading the series in order. Contains one dorky nerd, a sexy parole officer, and a man who learns he’s worthy to be loved.",
