  "description": "From bestselling RAINBOW AWARD winning authors Clancy Nacht & Thursday Euclid. Trust fund baby Blake Brooks is many things to many people--doting father to his precious Bitsy, discreetly gay husband to lesbian Daisy, tolerant son to his godawful father--but most important to him is his role as best friend to sexy attorney, Tyrone, with whom he's been in love since boarding school. When Daisy falls for Bitsy's nanny and throws Blake out of their mansion, he looks to Tyrone for a place to crash while he picks up the pieces...and finds so much more. Not only is he welcome at Tyrone's, there are rooms for Blake and Bitsy plus a closet full of designer clothes. And Tyrone, who's never had a real relationship with anyone, shows him such affection that Blake wonders if his best friendâ€™s stoicism hides more than just his softer side. Is Blake succumbing to wishful thinking, or has the mysterious, emotionally unavailable Tyrone been waiting for Blake all this time?",
