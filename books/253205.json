  "description": "Release Date - September 20, 2018When a case of mistaken identity leads to a naked make-out session with my hot new employee, I decide to do the sensible thing and stay far, far away to save both our jobs. Trouble is, all the whiskey and women in the world can't burn that memory out of my brain. She's everything I'm not: a happy, non-swearing, ray of sunshine. She's positively annoying, but I can't deny the burning attraction that sparks every time we're near each other. When a state-wide tsunami warning puts my crew of lifeguards in a life or death emergency, Sunny and I have to set our feelings aside to work closely together. Crazy enough, the tsunami and tenuous job situation are the least of my worries when she starts digging around in my dark past.",
