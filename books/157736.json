  "description": "For his sixteenth birthday, Asher Price gets a date and a death threat. No one believes he’s in danger, but when Asher’s relationship with Garrett is revealed in his small Florida town, he’s certain he will be destroyed. Still haunted by guilt over his brother’s death and his mom’s breakdown, Asher can’t tell the truth. Instead, his best friend’s practical advice to deny everything wins out. When Asher’s mom announces they’re moving to Chicago, it seems like the perfect out, but how can he leave the only place that holds memories of his dead brother? Asher must choose between staying in a town where people know too much or escaping to a city where no one knows or cares, but either way, he can’t hide from himself. In the final book of this award-winning series, Asher exposes his greatest fears and finally develops a clear picture of his true self.",
