  "description": "TOP 100 BESTSELLING SERIES IN HORROR AND POST-APOCALYPTIC SCIENCE FICTION - In the zombie apocalypse, a stable life is often fleeting, but for the citizens of Tazewell, Virginia, they have done just that, and Joe and his crew of rescuers have decided to make it their home. While not an unfamiliar place, it has changed over the years. The walled-in town keeps the living in, and the undead out. Like most safe havens, it is not without its flaws, and the good-natured people within the walls often forget that, but unfortunately, they get reminded that the world outside the walls is harsh and unforgiving. When a good natured gesture turns tragic, they must put aside petty differences and band together to save their town. In the fifth book of the Six Feet From Hell series, Joe and his comrades will not only try to keep the citizens safe, but they must also prepare for a possible showdown with an old enemy.",
