  "title": "Jake's Redemption",
  "description": "At the age of twenty-eight he had seen and done it all, enjoyed a few of the perks, but mostly regretted every experience. He was a man he had sworn he would never become–an enforcer, just like his father. His father had pulled all the strings, and had all the control. Sex, drugs, and fighting. Stealing, lying and cheating. That wasn’t the life he wanted. He wanted better. Then, betrayal from family turns his life upside down and the only source of scenery he has for the next seven years is from behind bars. Now on parole, Jake Green wants to start over. New. Fresh. He wants to learn from his mistakes and fix his broken past, especially with his family. He will do anything to have it all. Until he sees Devon–the one woman who sees Jake, the real man inside. With Jake’s screwed up past, and a family so torn apart, can he and Devon work through everything together? Is Devon the angel he seeks, who can give him the redemption he craves and deserves?",
