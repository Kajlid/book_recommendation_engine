  "description": "The Freeman's Oath is a novel about history, love, and not understanding either. Meet Jonathan Gray, 27, a struggling Boston rare book dealer. The accidental death of his parents three years ago has him casting about, trying to uphold his father’s bookselling legacy. Meanwhile, Jessie, the one girl Jon has ever loved—whom he dumped with spectacular quickness after his parents’ death, but who can blame a guy stunted by grief?—has suddenly reappeared. Jon’s in trouble. He needs to grow up, fast, or lose everything. When an old customer shows up with a long-lost and exceedingly puritanical document, the Oath of a Free-man, the hope of a huge sale gives Jon one chance to save his father’s business and redeem himself.",
