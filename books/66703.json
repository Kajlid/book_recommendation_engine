  "title": "The Prostitute",
  "description": "The Prostitute first appeared in 1937 and created an immediate stir in Thai literary circles, both for its sympathetic portrayal of prostitutes and because its author was a young lady from a respectable family. It tells the story of Reun, a young girl from up-country who is seduced by a city pimp and tricked into working as a prostitute in a Bangkok brothel. For the reader today, the novel offers a fascinating Thai reaction to the problem of prostitution in an age long before the American miliatary presence or mass tourism.",
