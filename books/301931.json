  "description": "Thirteen-year-old ambitious Cassie needs only three things to make her life great: to earn enough points to be Children’s Hunter Seat Equitation Champion at the end of the show season, to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance with the new cute kid, Tommy, and to own a second horse to start competing in jumper classes. But someone’s been leaving threatening notes in Cassie’s show trunk, tanking her confidence; there are only two weeks before the dance, but she’s losing her nerve to ask Tommy to go; and her dad made it very clear they could only afford one horse for her. How will Cassie pull it together to make all of her dreams come true?Gray Horse at Oak Lane Stable is Book 2 in the Oak Lane Stable Adventures Series, but can also be read on its own. For middle grade readers ages 8 to 13.",
