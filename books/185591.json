  "description": "A hilarious, irreverent and unforgettable romp through the afterlife. You’ll never look at death the same way again. A quick and easy read! Della’s life had never been what one would call exciting. As she approached her forty-third birthday, she had all but given up on the hope of romance, the prospect of starting a family and the possibility of anything out of the ordinary ever happening. If not for her job, her beloved dog, her best friend Penny, her love of Barry Manilow music and cold Chardonnay, she may never have chosen to get out of bed. However, as Della learns, nothing will make you appreciate your own life more than your own death! Her unforgettable experiences in the afterlife are sure to make you laugh out loud as well as to reevaluate what death and life really mean.
