  "description": "Cassiopeia \"Pia\" Alexander is just your typical college student. She can't pick a major, her love life is virtually non-existent and the only thing good in her life seems to be her job as an Animal ER Nurse. Even that doesn't feel like enough, though. Beylin Callaghan is one of the Brotherhood tasked to give souls a winged-ride from one life to the next, and to remove the memories from each soul so that they can start with a fresh slate in their new incarnations. But he's keeping a secret-- a secret that when exposed, will bind Pia's fate to his own. For better or worse. Crow: Episode One is novella length (approx. 9,000 words) and is the first installment in this new adult fantasy series. Subsequent episodes will be released on a monthly basis and fans are encouraged to visit Alex's website to influence the outcome of the overall story.",
