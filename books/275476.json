  "description": "Smart, likable, Bernie Fine was the wonder boy of  Wolff's, New York's most glamorous department  store. A senior VP moving up, he arrives in San  Fransisco to open a West Coast store. His career is  skyrocketing, but his life is lacking a center.  When he looks into the wide, innocent eyes of  five-year-old Jane O'Reilly, and then into the equally  enchanting eyes of her mother, Liz, Bernie knows  he has found what he has been looking for. Bernie  thought he had found love to last a lifetime, but  when Liz is stricken with cancer shortly after the birth of  their first child, time becomes  painfully short. Alone with two children, Bernie  must face the loss and learn how to move on. New  people, new experiences, a new life alone with two  kids. He meets it with courage and humor, and  learns some of life's hard but precious lessons as he  does.From the Hardcover edition.",
