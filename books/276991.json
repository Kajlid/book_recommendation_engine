  "description": "Juliet Manchester is America’s best-loved movie starlet. But when a nasty divorce and a sex-tape scandal threaten to tarnish her spotless good-girl reputation, she turns to co-star Ryan McDonnell to help distract the media with a passionate (and completely fake) new romance. The only problem? They’re both in love with other people. Going home for Gran’s 90th in Maryland was something I normally would’ve been looking forward to. But the timing is terrible. My ex is dragging me through a media scandal (even though he’s the one who cheated. Spectacularly. On the kitchen island. With my personal chef), and if I had my way, I’d stay out of the spotlight entirely. But America’s Sweetheart has to be okay, and my agent is positive the best way to convince America that I’m not in the midst of a breakdown is to date my latest co-star. He’s hot. He’s sweet. And he’s willing. But he’s not the man I’m in love with. The former Marine bodyguard who’s been stationed inside my house by the private security firm I employ is nothing like a movie star. He’s rough around the edges, from the wrong side of the tracks… and one-hundred percent exactly my type. But the two of us together? Could cost us both our jobs. I just need to remember that Jace Morgan is here to protect me. Not to love me. But when he comes along to Maryland? Lines get crossed, and I’m not talking about the Mason-Dixon, y’all. Happily Ever Hers is a full-length laugh-out-loud romcom with narcoleptic pugs, cursing Grans who drink too many Manhattans, and a stoic ex-military hero who just might break your heart. (Standalone and no cliffhanger!)",
