  "description": "2nd Edition. Illustrated. “I am three thousand, four hundred and ten years old,” the Dragon told the man. “And for every single night of every single year of those three thousand four hundred and ten years, I've slept on my treasure. It’s how dragons sleep. It’s how dragons have always slept.” And he closed his eyes with a snap. Then he opened one eye cautiously. “What’s a bed?” Brave princesses, grumpy dragons, princes competing for a kingdom, and children seeking answers to age-old questions. These six modern fairy tales include stories for pleasant dreams, and stories for stirring thought. They are just the right length for bedtime reading. Each is a gem that will delight the entire family. Suitable for age 5 and older.",
