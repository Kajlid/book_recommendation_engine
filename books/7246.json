  "description": "Zakk, a charismatic young athlete from Texas, visited his cousin Kevin in the quiet town of Sunnyville as his parents vacationed in Europe. Immediately following his arrival, an H5N1 viral epidemic swept through the unsuspecting town followed by a massive federal cover-up. Not a soul in the world was aware of the horrors unveiling in Sunnyville as the vulnerable citizens remained quarantined without communication with the outside world. The virus swiftly proliferated to the borders of town and Zakk and Kevin, both immune, found themselves alone within a merciless H5N1-infected population. The infected ones seemed almost normal, somewhat rational but with an insatiable urge to consume non-infected human flesh. As the infected ones transformed the town of Sunnyville into the living nightmare they called Zombie Town, Zakk and Kevin struggled to achieve a monumental goal - get out alive at all cost.",
