  "title": "I Saw the Lord: A Wake-Up Call for Your Heart",
  "description": "When we call ourselves Christians, we expect that our love for Jesus, our hunger for His presence, our urgent longing to see Him again will be a constant, motivating force in our lives, writes Anne Graham Lotz. Yet sometimes ...in the busyness of our days or the duties of our jobs or the familiar habits of our worship or the everyday routine of our homes, the longing becomes complacency, and we sleep through opportunities to be with Him. Anne knows from personal experience that it's then, as we're drifting in comfortable complacency, that we most need a wake-up call---a jolt that pushes us to seek out a revival of our passion for Jesus that began as a blazing fire but somehow has died down to an ineffective glow. The revival we need now is not a tent meeting or a series of church services designed to save the lost. It's something completely authentic, personal revival. In I Saw the Lord, Anne shares the revival lessons she has carried to audiences throughout the world, showing you how you can experience an authentic, deeper, richer relationship with God in a life-changing, fire-blazing revival. It begins here. Now. Open this book and hear the wake-up call. Then get ready for the fire of revival to fall ... on you!",
