  "description": "I’ve made a mess of things again. Not that anybody is surprised. After I’m politely asked to withdraw from college for my antics, I return home to my family’s cattle ranch. The sweeping views, the towering pine trees, and the whisper of the wind remind me I belong on this land. My heart is in the alpine air, my soul mixed into the soil. All I’ve ever wanted is to run the ranch alongside my oldest brother, but my family refuses to see me as anything but a walking disaster. If I’m going to show them what I’m capable of, I have to prove myself. Lucky for me, I’m a Hayden through and through. I’ll dirty my hands in more ways than one. That includes the man who showed up in town again after all these years. Sawyer Bennett. I’ve heard the stories about his family, and they don’t scare me. Our attraction is undeniable, and the best part? Sawyer looks at me with fresh eyes. When I’m with him, I get to be the woman I’m fighting to become. And I’m learning just how much I want to be that woman. But then I make the ultimate mistake: I utter the word perfect. I should've known better. There’s nowhere to go but down after that. And down we go, until we hit rock bottom. Sawyer unearths a long-buried secret, and challenges everything my brothers and I grew up believing. Nobody is surprised I’ve brought disaster to our doorstep again, but it’s not over. Because when it rains out on the ranch? It pours.",
