  "title": "Lug, Dawn of the Ice Age",
  "description": "A hilarious middle-grade novel about a misunderstood caveboy perfect for fans of Ice Age , Happy Feet , The Time Warp Trio , and Platypus Police Squad .Lug is a caveboy who would rather paint than club other caveboys. The clan even mocks him, calling him \"Little Slug.\" Like all the other caveboys, Lug must enter the contest to become the clan's next Big Man and attempt to catch the Biggest Beast--even though he would much rather spend his days painting in his secret art cave. When Lug is banished for failing to catch a jungle llama, he thinks he is alone in the world but finds others who believe in his clanmate Stony and a new friend, Echo, a girl from a rival clan who can talk to animals and just may be prehistory's first vegetarian/animal rights activist. Together they face even bigger challenges--Lug discovers the Ice Age is coming and he has to bring the warring clans together to save them not only from the freeze but also from a particularly unpleasant migrating pride of saber-toothed tigers. It's no help that the elders are cavemen who can't seem to get the concept of climate change through their thick skulls. With both funny, anachronistic humor, charming characters, and strong themes, Lug, Dawn of the Ice Age is sure to be a hit with many readers.Illustrated with black and white line art throughout.\"A great combination of humor and powerful insight.\" — Al Gore“Lug makes the Ice Age sizzle.”—Gordon Korman \"Fred Flintstone would feel right at home.\"— Kirkus Reviews \"Suspenseful and smartly humorous.\"— ForeWord Reviews",
