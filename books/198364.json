  "description": "Demon's and Deanna's baby boy was born prematurely but Ty is getting better. He was so small, like a little doll in her arms. She slowly rocked back and forth, feeling that warmth, that immediate affection, that instant connection to another soul, fill her so completely, she couldn’t even breathe.This was what it meant to be a mother. To love someone so much, from that very first sight that everything else dimmed in comparison.Deanna looked down at her son, at the dark hair that covered his little head and the way his little fingers wrapped around her thumb. He was so small and had fought hard for his life. It had been a month and a half since she’d gone into preterm labor. The end had looked so grim, her worry and fear, her devastation that she’d lose this perfect little person before she’d even gotten to meet him, had weighed so heavily on her.But her little man had pulled through.",
