  "description": "Destined for a Padded Room opens a window into the life of Elle Wilson, an average teenager bumbling through her high school days. She involves the reader in her world via diary entries which equally detail the wonderful and the horrifying, her voice as clear as if you were listening in on her telephone conversations.Elle’s story begins with her ex-boyfriend, Shane, appearing in the hall at school after being away for a year. While she’s trying to understand where she stands with him now, someone else comes into the picture to further confuse her. With Elle’s three best friends as her supporting cast, her older brother as an ever-present annoyance, and two guys vying for her attention, Elle finds it hard to believe that the men in white coats aren’t coming to take her away.",
