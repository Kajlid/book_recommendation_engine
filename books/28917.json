  "description": "Donick Walsh: king of the school bullies, secret dancer, closet-case. What's to be done when a football injury means he can never play again? Dance in the school musical, of course! Not like he has a choice. Fingers crossed his father doesn't find out!Enter Michael Penrose: theatre-kid, and Donick's former best friend. For years Michael has been the object of Donick's ridicule simply because Michael is out and proud, and Donick is afraid.Suddenly confronted with his old friend, Donick sinks under the weight of the guilt of his past. How can a bully make amends for all the hurt he's caused? How can a closeted ex-high school football player make peace with the very real crush he suddenly has on a boy? And what in the world can be done to hit the reset-button on an entire life? Donick Walsh and the Reset-Button examines the confusing nature of what it means to forgive, the discovery of living one's authentic self, and yes, even the joys and pains of first love.",
