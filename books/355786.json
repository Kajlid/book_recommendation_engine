  "description": "Jake Samson is a bitter, frustrated teenager who has almost everything a person could want: money, brains, good looks, friends, and family. Yet, it's Christmas Eve again and Jake is haunted and upset as he always is during the holidays. This evening is even worse. All day, he's felt edgy and nervous as if he's being watched. And no matter what he's done, he can't shake those feelings. Finally, he's invited his friends Clem and Jorge over to play computer games. What Jake doesn't know is that he's going to play a virtual game this Christmas Eve - the most important game of his life.",
