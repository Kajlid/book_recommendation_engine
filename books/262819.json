  "description": "Love like you'd never say goodbye. Weep as though you'd never love again. Let these poems speak the deepest longings of your heart. Poignant, timeless and true. This book is a personal collection of poems about love and letting go. Whether it be a newfound love, a love that endures a lifetime, or a love that will soon be saying goodbye, one can find in these pages something like a mirror that tells the story of one's own heart. My Heart's Deepest Wound I guess you will always bemy heart's deepest wound.The kind that aches terribly.The kind that time could never heal. I glimpse a memory of youand I feel it!I feel both the joy and the painof loving you.Yes, loving you. For I have never really forgotten.How could the heart forget?Had I not loved you,I'd have moved on already.Had I not loved you,You wouldn't have been ableto cause me pain. But I did.I loved you then, and I love you now.You will always bethe deepest wound in me.That's how stronglyyou are etchedupon my heart. \"I see now that no person who has ever loved has ever been spared from tears. Tears of joy and tears of sorrow. Of the most intimate union and of letting go.\" To love is to be rapt in bliss, to be torn asunder and to be healed and made whole again.",
