  "description": "Ignotia is a magical world—at least for some. Those with magical abilities attend Magden. There, the students learn how to use their various realms of magic to prepare them for important roles such as members of the Royal Guard, or even future rulers themselves. Students are taught to use their magic for good, but when word spreads that a few students have left the school on a murderous mission, those that are left must join together to stop them. However, they will soon discover there is more to the devious plan than they originally thought.This adventure follows Magden’s rag-tag team of students which includes a loyal best friend, determined to save his buddy from irreversible consequences, Magden’s dynamic duo of star students, the quiet kid, and Ignotia’s rarest wizard in decades as they fight to save Ignotia as they know it.",
