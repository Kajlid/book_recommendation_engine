  "description": "For Meri and Alice, moving thousands of miles away has had little effect on their friendship. After all, they can share dreams with each other, so distance has never been an issue. Even better, they can change their dreams to include anything they want, and can even peek into the dreams of others. Their secret world is a private playground; that is, until a large, black bird shows up and begins observing them as their dreams begin to get darker and more unnerving. It soon becomes clear that something – or someone – is in there with them.",
