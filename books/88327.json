  "description": "The body of a U.S. soldier reported AWOL during the Korean War is found encased in a concrete pillar. Clasped in his hand is a gold pin shaped like a lightning bolt. What secret did he carry to his grave and why is someone hell-bent on keeping that secret buried? The puzzle pieces pile up. A state representative owns a pin identical to the dead man's. And Sam discovers another pin in her father's jewelry box. What story had her father, an investigative reporter, been working on at the time of his own death years ago? Detective Sergeant Samantha Casey has an advantage over other cops. The dead speak to her, tell her secrets about their life and death. But sometimes what she learns can get her killed. When the Dead Speak is a fast-paced, tension-filled joy ride sprinkled with humor, plot twists, romance, and a touch of Native American culture. This is Book 1 in the Sam Casey series. Previously released in hardcover and mass market paperback (1999/2000), currently out of print, it is now being re-released in trade paperback.",
