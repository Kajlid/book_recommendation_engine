There's just one problem and that problem is named Danny Rhinehart.  It seems like every thing Marc does, Danny does better. Danny runs faster, can do more pull-ups, has jiu-jitsu moves that Marc can't solve, and is even awesome in school. On top of all that, Danny is too nice--he smiles at everything and it drives Marc CRAZY. Marc doesn't know what to do.
