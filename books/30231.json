  "description": "'It is of the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hawsers. A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.'So Melville about his masterpiece: and into his tale of Captain Ahab's insane quest of the white whale he poured all of his own youthful experience and a minute study of the literature of whales and whaling: but into it also went other experiences, other reading, other insights ... into the 'power of blackness' and the deepest dreams and obsessions of mankind.For the splendours of Moby Dick are complex, a rich mixture of sea-time and book-learning, full of allusion, parody, pun and verbal echo, the kind of learned playfulness we associate with Joyce and Nabokov and Borges. In the intestines of this 'whale of a book' lie the seeds of the modernist movement.For this editon Harold Beaver has supplied a lengthy commentary to guide the reader through the labyrinth of Moby Dick to a deeper understanding of the mysteries.",
