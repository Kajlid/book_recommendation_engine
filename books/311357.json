  "description": "Life is about checks and balances. People hurt people, and often, they die. Even as a paramedic, I can’t save everyone, but that doesn’t mean I’m not gonna try.My baby sister was a sick child. Her illnesses were the reason I chose the career I did, but her innocence and fragility also made me a man who refuses to let her live her life without my guiding hand.My overbearing protectiveness wasn’t an issue until Nadia Reynolds pointed out my toxic ways.Nadia is honest to a fault, independent to the point of giving me heart palpitations, and so blindingly beautiful, she tempts me to let my sister live her life so I can pursue my own happily ever after.But to do that, I need to let go of the grievances of my past. Unfortunately, they don’t center solely around my sister’s cancer. With secrets, lies, fortunes, middle-of-the-night intruders, and meddling families abound, I’m left with only two choices: let go of the past and trust, or push on, knowing I could lose those I love the most.Trigger Warning: The hero of this book is a medical professional, and there are mentions of traumatic injury and death due to his profession. Reader discretion is advised.*****The Gilded Knights Series takes place - chronologically - after Checkmate, but before Stacked Deck. But this book and series can be read as a complete standalone.",
