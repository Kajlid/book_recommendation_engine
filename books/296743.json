Me.Tattooed, foul mouthed, bad boy.I told one little white lie hoping to meet someone different. And I did.Danniella Abbot.She wasn’t who I was expecting, and I guess she could say the same, because Danni made it very clear she wasn’t interested in me or my reasons for lying.The fact that she was my best friend’s little sister only complicated an already impossible situation.I didn’t intend on tricking her. I just wanted her to give me a chance, to discover who I am underneath the ink.She can fight me all she likes because we both know that I’m exactly her type. She just doesn’t know it yet.What happens when you wake up married to the woman you tricked into a date?You kiss the bride and prove her wrong.Dear Readers,Trick You is the second book in my angst-filled, emotional and steamy Rebel Ink series.",
