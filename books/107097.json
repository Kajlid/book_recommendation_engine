You'll see the difficulties and share the joys of parenting children who have never experienced \"normal\" home life. From the adopted rescue animals to the adopted children, life is always surprising at Homestead Ranch, the Steele home. Parents, pastors, teachers, social workers, and anyone who has a heart for vulnerable children will glean from the spiritual truths, blessings, and lessons Dana imparts as she shares their journey with the family God has uniquely given them. ﻿ ﻿",
