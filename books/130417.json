  "title": "Flowers for Grandmother",
  "description": "Kendahl is looking forward to visiting her grandmother, and wants to surprise her with a present for her flower garden. When Kendahl and her mother go the local garden store, Kendahl sees a picture of a gladiola and tells her mother that that’s what they should get for her Grandmother. Told to choose five bulbs, Kendahl picks what she thinks are five different colored gladiola bulbs—but she’s in for a surprise. Flowers for Grandmother is a charming story that not only reminds us of the special love between Grandparents and grandchildren, and nurtures that love and bonding. And, this lovely little book tickles that special funny-bone in children...teaching that not everything is what it appears to be, but also that when it comes to gift-giving, it’s the thought that counts most. Fresh from the mega-best-selling “KENDAHL GETS A PUPPY,” Kendahl’s pup “Apple” has a special appearance in this delightful book for children and their grandparents.",
