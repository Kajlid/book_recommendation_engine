  "description": "Breaking the curse will break her heartGandrett can no longer hope that she has a dying chance to save the Prince of Ulfray nor the friend the Dragon King has taken from her. But she won’t give up—even if it means she has to travel to the forests of Ulfray first to help the Prince of Fae to wake his people.Gandrett leaves behind the ruins of the future of Sives and embarks on an adventure of her own—where she gets more than she bargained for.Venturing into Ulfray with brooding Nehelon is a challenge in itself, now that she has seen what lies beneath the harsh and cold shell he so very much likes to wear. But waking up the Fae is a whole different thing—especially when the path to lifting the curse is woven from secrets.Gandrett can only pray to Vala, the goddess she no longer serves, that she look over her friends and brother until she can get out of Ulfray. And she needs to act fast. Because in Neredyn, forces are brewing that will change the course of history.",
