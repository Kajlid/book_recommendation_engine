  "description": "Ambition. Revenge. Love.  RITA® Award-winning author Kennedy Ryan delivers the gripping conclusion to the All the King’s Men Duet.  Raised to resist. Bred to fight. Survival is in my blood and surrender is never an option.  Though surrender is what Maxim Cade demanded of my body and heart, I had other plans. We were fast-burning fascination and combustible chemistry, but the man I trusted with everything was a trickster. A thief who stole my love. If what we had was a lie, why did it feel so real? The man I swore to hate will have it all, and wants me at his side. But power is a game, and we’re the pawns and players.  Facing insurmountable odds, will we win the world, or will we lose it all?",
