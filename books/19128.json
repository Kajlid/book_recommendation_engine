  "description": "Engineer, single mom, weekend warrior\n\nHannah Stanton is all three—until she's called to active duty by the Navy. Then she becomes a warrior full-time. But that means she has to leave her baby behind while she flies helicopters in support of the Navy SEAL team that includes Mike McCaffrey—her old friend and colleague who also happens to be the onenight stand she never told about her pregnancy.Hannah always meant to tell McCaffrey about the baby, but when was she supposed to do that? A year ago he'd been sent in to a war zone half a world away. Jeopardizing his mission—and his life—with news he could do nothing about wasn't possible. And now… Now it seems too late, especially since he just announced that he likes kids—as long as they're not his. Walking away isn't an option, though, once the Navy sends them on a mission…together.",
