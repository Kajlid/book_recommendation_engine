  "description": "Want to escape to a place where the sun always shines? Where passionate music, magic potions and drama of Africa are cooled by the genius of Arabic culture?Miranda Innes and her partner were lured into buying a beautiful long-neglected riad in the heart of the magical pink-walled city of Marrakech. Only after they'd begun their restoration work did they find that nothing in this place of smoke and mirrors was quite what it seemed.With her talent for lyrical and evocative descriptions of swirling colours, flavours and aromas, Miranda Innes takes you beyond the tourist track, behind the bolted doors and deep inside the romance that is Marrakech.",
