  "title": "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street",
  "description": "Dr. Seuss's very first book for children!A plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street grows into a story that no one can beat! In this tale, Young Marco allows his imagination to run riot as he travels home from school one day. From a mere horse and wagon, young Marco concocts a colorful cast of characters, making Mulberry Street the most interesting location in town.The signature rhythmic text, combined with his unmistakable illustrations, will appeal to Dr. Seuss fans of all ages, who will cheer when our hero proves that a little imagination can go a very long way â€” Who wouldn't cheer when an elephant-pulled sleigh raced by?Now over seventy-five years old, this story is as timeless as ever. And Marco's singular kind of optimism is also evident in McElligot's Pool.With his unique combination of hilarious stories, wacky pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat', and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.",
