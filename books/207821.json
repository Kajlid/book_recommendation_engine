  "description": "From 9-time New York Times bestselling author Katy Evans comes her sexiest standalone novel yet. TAHOE ROTH. Irreverent, cocky, playful and naughty. He’s not the guy you date. He’s the one night stand. The one your mother warned you about. The one your body craves. You’d think the man who called me succulent would want to strip me down and spread me out on his bed—like he’s done with countless others. But he passed on my offer…. Just like I’d once passed on his. He’s wary, like I am. He’s broken, like I am. And everyone knows two broken parts can’t ever make a whole. Tahoe and I are strictly friends. So I distract myself with other men. He doesn’t think my new man is good enough. This blond blue-eyed beast doesn’t think any man is—himself included. But the more time we spend together, the more confused I feel. I'm trying to open myself to love. Yet I'm quickly realizing that the only man I want is Tahoe Roth. The one man who will surely break my heart. ** LADIES MAN is a standalone; some characters from the Manwhore series make an appearance. **",
