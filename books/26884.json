  "title": "Understanding Your Dog: The First Guide for Humans written by a Dog",
  "description": "This guide was written by a Border collie named Rocky. To write this book he channeled his ultimate wisdom through his owner and was able to take control of her subconscious (it really wasnâ€™t that hard). This book will provide all humans with a clear understanding of how their dogs think and why they do the crazy things they do like crotch sniffing, barking at lawn mowers and digging holes in the carpets. If you have just purchased your first dog this book is a must. If you have shared your life with a dog or two then this book will provide answers to the questions you've always wondered about.",
