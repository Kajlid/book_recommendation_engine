  "description": "Meet Gilbert Applejack, an ordinary Joe with an extraordinary camera. His camera opens the floodgates to an entire new reality after he discovers a dead body. Quirk takes place in Boise, Idaho a place known for its beautiful rustic great outdoors. Boise, where the sky is purple and melodramatic, the color of tranquility. Boise, where a preponderance of ducks descend amethyst incandescent skies. But underneath the thin façade of jade rhododendrons and singing larks lies a few unsettling occurrences. Quirk takes a look into the worlds of five people whose lives are indirectly connected through a labyrinth of strange and coincidental dealings. When Gilbert Applejack finds a woman’s milky body lying limp and lifeless, overcome by galaxies of bacteria, a series of events unfurl. Only because Gilbert Applejack’s special camera has the mysterious ability to peer into a man’s soul is he able to piece together the intriguing death. Make no mistake; this is not science fiction by any stretch of the imagination. Based on a true story, Quirk is an unusually dark account which has never been told.",
