  "description": "When twelve-year-old genius cartographer T.S. Spivet receives an unexpected phone call from the Smithsonian announcing he has won the prestigious Baird Award, life as normal-if you consider mapping family dinner table conversations normal- is interrupted and a wild cross-country adventure begins, taking T.S. from his family ranch just north of Divide, Montana, to the museum’s hallowed halls.      T.S.’s trip begins at Coppertop Ranch and the last known place he stands is Washington, D.C., but his journey’s movement is far harder to track: How does one map the delicate lessons learned about family or communicate the ebbs and flows of heartbreak, loneliness, and love? There are some answers here on the road from Divide, and some new questions, too.",
