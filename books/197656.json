  "title": "Paul Up North",
  "description": "Rabagliati continues his award-winning semi-autobiographical Paul series in this coming of age story. The action takes place in 1975-76 just before and during the summer Olympics in Montreal. Remember gymnast Nadia Comaneci or Canadian high-jumper Greg Joy? Paul is now 16, a teenager, and he finds new experiences, changes schools, hitchhikes, falls deeply in love, gets dumped, smokes pot and drinks beer. All of this over a Peter Frampton musical soundtrack. Paul travels \"up north\" to the Laurentian cottage country of Quebec where he gets to know himself better. Another epic graphic novel from a master of the form at the height of his powers.",
