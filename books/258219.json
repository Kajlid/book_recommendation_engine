The men in the doctor's life are Mike Angells, Ross Whitmore and Raith Balan, who Phil grows closer to each day.Phil is troubled. Is his patient in the UK legally? Who has caused his injuries? Is trafficking involved? As the foursome struggle to find out, hampered by the fact that Mike is no longer a detective, cracks begin to appear in their relationship. Can four men be equals? Meanwhile, there are cracks of a different sort to deal with--and the job of doing so seems to fall exclusively on Mike's broad shoulders!This second tale about Mike, Ross, Raith and Phil can be read as a standalone or as a sequel. As in the first story, Badge of Loyalty, comments about living polyamorously are interlaced with events. This time, it's Mike who offers readers an opinion.",
