  "title": "66 Love Letters: A Conversation with God that Invites You into His Story",
  "description": "The story of God written in intimate love letters just for you. Dr. Larry Crabb knows that if we could see the larger story of Godand humanity, our world would never be the same. That story is found inlarge part in the sixty-six letters of the Bible. Written in a conversational first person, as if God is speakingdirectly to us, Dr. Crabb looks at each individual book in scriptureand boils it down to a one- or two-sentence message to us from thatparticular book. He then unpacks each sentence in a short chapteranswering the question, What does God want me to hear from this loveletter? The book's epilogue then fits all sixty-six pieces of thejigsaw puzzle together into one coherent paragraph and reveals thebeautiful picture of what God has been about since the creation of theworld. Far from being comprehensive, this is a personal approach tohelping readers know God and his great love for them, his message forall mankind, and how their lives fit into His larger story.",
