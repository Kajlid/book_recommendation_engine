  "description": "\"...considerably more wit and pizazz than the legendary Georgette [Heyer] herself.” —Kirkus ReviewsLady Laura consents to give her hand to Thaddeus Grey, a man she has known all of her life. Perhaps there is some romantic ingredient missing from their relationship, but Thad is still an attractive man and a dear friend…As the wedding festivities were set to begin at Harkness Abbey the wedding gifts came pouring in, and the Baron Nathaniel Lowland, an old friend of Laura’s father, sent the most surprising gift of all—his son Ashley. A painter of exquisite talent, Ashley has been sent to paint Lady Laura’s portrait. It could hardly be expected that he would come to capture her heart as well.",
