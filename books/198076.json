  "description": "“I’ve met someone. I’ll be moving out on Sunday.”  When Suzanne Perry-Jackson is ditched by her husband of almost twenty years, her comfortable, uncomplicated world is turned upside down and inside out. Two months after the traumatic break-up, the sophisticated blonde meets Angelo Azzurro, a captivating stranger who takes full advantage of her vulnerability and introduces her to the decadent world of sadomasochistic sex. As much as she enjoys the amazing, liberating encounter, she is adamant that this needs to remain a moment of madness – never to be repeated.  Then a chance meeting with orthopaedic surgeon Sebastian Black rocks Suzanne’s world all over again. It’s love at first sight as she senses a deep physical and mental connection with the breathtakingly beautiful, blue-eyed doctor. After meeting in a professional capacity, Sebastian orchestrates a chance meeting with Suzanne. It is obvious that something extraordinary is unfolding between them. But things aren’t as simple as they seem: control freak Angelo, still angered by Suzanne leaving him, can’t help wanting to teach her a lesson she will never forget...  When Suzanne vanishes, Sebastian is frantic with worry. He has no doubt that her disappearance has everything to do with Angelo. Will he find Suzanne? And will he be able once and for all to move on with the woman he has fallen head over heels in love with?  Sweeping across Surrey, London and Rome, Every Shade of Blue is a tale of love, lust and outrageous, climactic sex that will leave the reader out of breath and begging for more. Linzi’s writing style is Jackie Collins meets Sylvia Day.",
