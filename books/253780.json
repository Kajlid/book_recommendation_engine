  "description": "For ten long years, I stayed away to protect her.I thought I’d successfully subverted my wolf’s instincts where Bethany was concerned.But when I saw her on that dance floor, my inner beast took over. I told myself it would be just one dance. One dance and I’d let her go. I didn’t mean to bite her. Or f*ck her in the middle of a crowded dance club.Or kidnap her… again.***Read an excerpt here ➜ https://bit.ly/2J8GuktNOTE: \"Just Like Animals is a fast-paced dirty ride\" (to quote a reviewer). The romance between the main couple was written to work as a first read in the series for readers new to the Werelock Evolution world. However, please note that this is book number 5 within the Werelock Evolution series, so it also continues elements of the overarching storyline of the world.",
