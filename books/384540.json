  "description": "New author, Lâ€™Mignon, takes pride in bringing the girl next door character to reality for her readers, creating a story that many can identify with in some fashion. In her first novel, Skeletons in Her Closet she introduces us to McKenzie Johnson. Over the years McKenzie had become so involved in work she neglected having a social life. As a New Year begins, McKenzie is convinced by her friends to trade in her conservative business attire for some more sassy club attire and finally let her hair down. All work and no play is never any fun. Not knowing when she would get out again she was determined to make the most of this night. Unbeknown to her, not only would she enjoy a fun night with the girls but also meet the man she would soon marry, Milton Williams. Ordinarily, she would never go for a man that she met in a club, but there was something different about Milton once she took the time to get to know him. He was everything she always wanted and felt she needed to make her life complete. But as with all things in life it's never always that easy.",
