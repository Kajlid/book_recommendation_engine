My family name is full of pomp and prestige, and I want nothing to do with it.I’m a witch that knows how to set a goal and I have one in mind.\nI want a real family.\nDating is a travesty. All the suitors I meet are looking for a connection to the family name I left behind. I need help.Enter the matchmaker. It seems too good to be true that I can give her the list of traits I want in a partner and have my deepest desire answered, but I’m out of options.\nLove comes along in the most unexpected ways.\nFrom the very first moment I meet Elliot Bramblewick, I have hope. But he’s tricky.I’m not expecting him to be hiding two other mates. Mates who are as alarmed and intrigued by my presence as I am by theirs.He thinks I’m a perfect fit for them, but can I open my heart and discard my list long enough to see if this is the family I’m looking for?\nNone of my lists and plans prepared me for being courted by three gargoyles.\nDeceived by the Gargoyles is a standalone monster romance in the same world as Stalked by the Kraken with multiple love interests who are in relationships with each other. There will be no choosing among the love interests.Content Warning: This book includes breeding, knots, and size difference",
