Something was always missing—and I don't mean physically.When I moved to a different city, got a new job with these two, I gradually started to realize I wanted them. Both of them. They're so in love, so fucking in love, that it hurts to watch them when I want them so much.This is so unexpected. This was not an option. After all, I'd never risk breaking them apart, because I really lo—shit. I'm in a bit too deep, aren't I?Photo Description: NSFW—an M/M/M ThreesomeThis story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is Always Write\" event.
