  "description": "Intelligent life on other planets: it's the brass ring of space exploration. Do extra-terrestrial species exist? Will we ever make contact? Perhaps, have we made contact already?  In the latest addition to the Future Chronicles series of sci-fi anthologies, the answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes. From first contact to last stand, these original short stories range from quiet tales of personal connection to adrenaline-infused inter-species space conflicts. Each tale promises to present you with a different look at what intelligent alien life might be like -- and how we Earthlings might respond to it.  The Alien Chronicles features stories by bestselling authors Hugh Howey (WOOL), B. V. Larson (the Starforce series), and Jennifer Foehner Wells (Fluency), plus twelve more of today's top authors in science fiction.Content: Guests of the Chitterer Liberation Force - Blair S.
