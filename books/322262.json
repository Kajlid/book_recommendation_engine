  "description": "An imaginary hedgehog fairy made me famous.A blizzard made me fall in love.When I was a kid I used to doodle pictures of my best friend.Well, my best imaginary friend: Harley the Hedgehog Fairy.Turns out that making up stories about her catapulted me into children's book stardom.Now I'm living my dream and working from home.I’d rather spend my time creating stories than face the real world.Except, my agent has other plans. He's booked me on a signing tour across the country.Six weeks outside of my comfort zone.I thought that was painful - until I saw Morgan Bradford entering a bookstore holding the hand of a little girl.He told me he didn't want commitment.But I guess he didn't want commitment with me.After five painful minutes, I see him off and hope we never cross paths again.I’m not that lucky.A blizzard, a car accident and a concussion send me back to Winter Valley...And under Morgan's care.Maybe I am that lucky.",
