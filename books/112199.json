  "description": "Drake Bauer is a man who believes the world owes him. And he has a deadly plan to collect. Jumbo Good Shot is an American Indian who refuses to concede to the tyranny of racism. Alvie Kincaid has just finished an overseas tour of duty in the Army and wonders about fences and green grass. His highly respected father, Wooster, is the foreman at the cemetery and lives by the credo that the good life is the simple life. Maralou Bauer is an accomplished pianist shackled by motherhood, family, and the persistent sameness of small town life. Lakeside is a town where these people and their ideals collide with the steamy impact of a splitting atom.",
