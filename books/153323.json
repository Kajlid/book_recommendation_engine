  "description": "Two men named Merrick Delmar separated by more than one thousand years. One was the very first King of Isola di Squalo, and the other will be the next. Their lives are so different, yet they are very much the same. Each struggles with the position of authority into which he has been thrust. Neither feels qualified, and neither knows where to go for help. What does it take to be a good King? Can one man do it alone? Through struggle and storm, each will make a journey of self-discovery to assess whether he truly can rule, involuntarily or not.Sometimes the calm in the eye of the storm must come from within.",
