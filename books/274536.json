  "description": "My life changed in an instant, altered by fire, irreparably damaged. Just like me. I’m a broken, damaged soul on the run from a very real sort of darkness.  My father, a notorious mob boss, either wants me back or wants me dead. I find solace in the arms of his enemies. Five deliciously dark men that tempt me to do things I shouldn’t.  Arsen, Colt, Weston, Mace, and Hawke. They’re just as dangerous as the men they’re hunting. So, will they save me, or burn me to ashes?  Either way, in their arms, I catch fire. I burn. And I love every second of it.  **NOTE: This book was originally published as Five Fathers by Kate Morgan. It has undergone a rewrite but the core story remains the same.**",
