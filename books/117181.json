  "description": "This is a true story which chronicles the life of one of the oldest survivals of the Stonewall Inn Raid on June 28, 1969.This historic occurrence, 43-years ago, was the beginning of the Gay Rights Movement and Revolution.This was the first time that Gays, openly, resisted Police arrests and assaults. A year later, Gay Demonstrators celebrated the Anniversary of the resistance and riots with the first Gay Pride March by walking from Greenwich Village to the Sheep Meadows in Central Park.The Founders of the Gay Liberation Front and the LGBTCommunities united to sponsor a Gay Rights Parade each year in June to commemorate this momentous occasion. This was the first instance in American History when people in the homosexual community fought back against a governmental system that persecuted the Gay minorities who have since become the defining force behind this event, and who is credited for the beginning of the Gay Uprising and Revolution in the United States and around the world.",
