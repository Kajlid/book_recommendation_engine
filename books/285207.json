  "description": "Alessandra “Ale” Ridley, lawyer extraordinaire, attentive best-friend, cool aunt, Star Wars expert, Fortnite guru… is lonely.Life has left her feeling vulnerable, unworthy of her own love story. At this point, she’s ready to fade off into the background of life.That is, until Nathan Prescott shows up.With his ridiculously blue eyes, dark hair, tanned skin and a body so close to perfect that it's hard to believe he is not the poster boy for Photoshop, he could have anyone. Ale can hardly believe he wants her.Nathan is more perfect than any fictional character she ever pinned on, and he isn’t running away from her quirky traits like so many others before him have done. In fact, he encourages Ale to become her true self, helping her to see that she deserves to be romanced, to be someone’s first choice.When a heart-shattering secret unravels what Ale thought was her shot at the love of a lifetime, she runs… but maybe she's run too fast this time?",
