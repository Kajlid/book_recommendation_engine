  "title": "Free Country: A Tale of the Children's Crusade",
  "description": "For the first time ever, the two-issue miniseries The Children’s Crusade, written by Neil Gaiman, Alisa Kwitney and Jamie Delano (Hellblazer), is collected – and with them, a new chapter written by Toby Litt (The Dead Boy Detectives), with Rachel Pollack, that completes the tale as Gaiman originally envisioned it. When several children go missing in a small English town, the Dead Boy Detectives are on the case. A series of strange and unexpected twists takes them to Free Country, a place that dates back a millennium, where children never grow old and are free from the abuse and tyranny of adults. But Free Country is failing, and what it needs is the strength of five innately powerful children – including the young sorcerer Timothy Hunter – to restore their uncanny world to what it once was.Collecting: The Children’s Crusade 1-2 & new material, never before published",
