  "description": "After years of Malekith's plotting, the War of the Realms is raging full force - and for Loki, that means it's time for a family reunion! Fatherly love is not something that the God of Lies is terribly familiar. Having been adopted by Odin as an infant and raised in the Asgardian royal family, Loki never had a chance to bond with his birth people - the fearsome Frost Giants. But now, the Giants have invaded New York City as part of Malekith's war on Midgard. And you'd think that Loki would take the opportunity to find some quality time to spend with dear old deadly Dad! And he will. But not in the way you'd think...Collecting: Thor (2018) #12-16",
