  "title": "America's Deadliest Export: Democracy – The Truth About US Foreign Policy and Everything Else",
  "description": "For over 65 years, the United States war machine has been on auto pilot.  Since World War II, the world has believed that US foreign policy means well, and that America's motives in spreading democracy are honorable, even noble.  In this startling and provocative book from William Blum, one of the United States' leading non-mainstream chroniclers of American foreign policy and author of the popular online newsletter, Anti-Empire Reports, demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth.  America's Deadliest Export is the in-depth exposé of the many contradictions surrounding the nature of US foreign policy.",
