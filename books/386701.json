  "description": "There's only one thing Zeus, the king of the Gods, is afraid of. It isn't the many-headed Hydra or the towering Gigantes. It isn't his powerful, jealous brother Poseidon, the god of the seas. Monsters, gods, Titans—none of them make the mighty Zeus blink an eye.The only thing Zeus fears is his wife: Hera. Goddess of the air, the sky, and the heavens, patroness of the cunning Jason, and scourge of the mighty Heracles, Hera rivals Zeus in power—and surpasses him in wrath.",
