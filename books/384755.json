  "description": "A thirteen year old girl unleashes a murderous nightmare on a small Kansas town.A Hollywood policeman sacrifices a strange and beautiful young man for his own dark needs but finds himself the victim.Horror comes to a sheltered mountain village - but from within, in the form of its own savage children who attack and devour in swarms.The last people on Earth are mature at 5, bear children at 8, and are usually dead by 30.These and other haunting visions come from the imagination of John W Campbell Award winner Tom Reamy. A transplanted Texan who lived in Kansas City (and later Independence, Missouri) before his premature death in November, 1977, Tom sent the science fiction and fantasy world reeling with such tales as \"Twilla\", \"Under the Hollywood Sign\", \"Beyond the Cleft\", \"Dinosaurs\", and the unforgettable Nebula Award-winning \"San Diego Lightfoot Sue.\"He was a writer with an extraordinary understanding of the dark things that walk in daytime as well as the light that shines despite deepening shadows. Whether he was writing about a young man's coming of age or life at the end of the world, he brought not only a sense of realism to his stories but a transcendent beauty and sensitivity. Within these pages you will find terror and love, desire and innocence, dreams and death, as only Tom Reamy could present them.",
