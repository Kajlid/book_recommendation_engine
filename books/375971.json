  "description": "A young woman who is in Mrs. Roosevelt's employ is suspected in the murder of her boyfriend. Mrs. Roosevelt is certain that the young woman (Pamela) is innocent and with the help of a few officials, sets out to prove it. This is not an easy task, since the murdered boyfriend is the son of a Congressman who doesn't take too kindly to Mrs. Roosevelt's involvement, especially since her investigations reveal a few not-so-nice details about the young man's personal life and hobbies.The plot involves a jewel theft and false identities. You'll get to meet a few seedy characters from the gambling world. Mrs. Roosevelt mingles with these people in an effort to get information, and it's rather amusing.",
