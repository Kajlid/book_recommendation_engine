  "description": "Book 1 of the bestselling series, Sector Guard.Living life on Kaddaka station was predictable and profitable. Mala's talent for undetectable repairs has made her quite wealthy and the station quite popular. When a Reflex ship comes in hot, out of control and unable to stop, she is the woman for the job. The job itself is an audition for the Sector Guard, but unless Mala is successful the passengers of the ship will never be able to tell her the good news. Isabi has been less than enthusiastic about meeting his new partner, until he sees her. Suddenly his interest is peaked. She doesn't seem to notice the pheromones that he exudes and she certainly doesn't fawn all over him. This woman may be worthy of her position as his partner, and he will not have her working with anyone else. Their talents make them the perfect team, now he just has to prove it to her.",
