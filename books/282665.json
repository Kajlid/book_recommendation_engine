  "description": "The enemy proved himself capable of blending improvised bombs into the local landscape and detonating them for maximum effect. But IED attacks left forensic evidence, and Zachâ€™s soldiers were on a mission to search every building in their sector, looking for signs of enemy activity while talking up the civilian non-combatants, trying to win them over. In the summer of 2007, an infantry company deploys to Baghdad, Iraq, as part of The Surge, the U.S. Army's effort to defeat the growing insurgency. The infantry company is led by Captain Zach Davis, who leads his soldiers on foot patrols in search of the enemy. He's also in charge of a ragtag group of tankers that got rolled into his company just before shipping out to Iraq. With an IED seemingly on every street in Baghdad, it's a battle of attrition between the Army and an invisible enemy as they both vie for control of Iraq's capital city.",
