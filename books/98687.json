  "description": "Get ready for the sequel to I Represent Sean Rosen, the original and very funny debut novel that has the New York Timesâ€“bestselling creator of Big Nate, Lincoln Peirce, proclaiming, \"Sean Rosen is my hero!\"The stakes are higher, the funny stuff is funnier, and the completely original and individual wunderkind Sean Rosen is balancing middle school and his career in ways never before seen. The adventures of Sean Rosen and his fictitious manager, Dan Welch, continue as Sean works on his screenplay, deals with seventh grade and track practice and a dog-walking job, records his podcasts, and tries to keep his brush with stardom a secret from his parents. Meanwhile, a major Hollywood movie studio has sent a private detective to Sean's town to find out who this Sean Rosen kid is, and what the nature is, exactly, of his big idea. Featuring another original Christoph Niemann cover, this is perfect for fans of Jack Gantos, Jeff Kinney, and Carl Hiassen.",
