  "title": "The Sacred Band",
  "description": "With the first two books in the Acacia Trilogy, Acacia and The Other Lands, David Anthony Durham created a vast and engrossing canvas of a world in turmoil, and of the surviving children of a royal dynasty on quests to realize their fates â€” and perhaps right ancient wrongs once and for all. As The Sacred Band begins, one of them, Queen Corinn, bestrides the world with her mastery of spells found in \"The Song of Elenet\". Her younger brother, Dariel, becomes a mythic figure in the Other Lands, while her sister Mena travels to the far north to confront an invasion from a brutal race intent on conquering the Known World. Their separate trajectories will converge in tumultuous battles, all rendered with vivid detail and in heroic scale.",
