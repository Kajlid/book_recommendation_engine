  "title": "House of Dolls",
  "description": "In a little house from another time, with lace curtains in every window and paintings hung in gold doily frames, Wildflower, Rockstar, and Miss Selene live a warm and cozy life. They wear fancy dresses, bake play-dough cakes, and spend their days enjoying one another's company. For the three dolls, life is small but good. But life is not good for Madison Blackberry, the owner of the dollhouse. Her grandmother pays more attention to the dolls than to her. The dolls have one another, but she is lonely in her big, empty apartment. Then one day, as things always do—even for dolls—everything changes. This beautiful story from the acclaimed team of Francesca Lia Block, author of such novels as Weetzie Bat , and Barbara McClintock, author and illustrator of many picture books, including Adèle & Simon , brings to life the power of love, family, and friendship.",
