  "description": "She extended her hand. \"Cheyenne Durrant. I'm a summer intern from BYU. Who are you?\" She had an enthusiastic grin and a milkmaid's handshake. \"I'm B. D. Morelli.\" Long pause. \"Your name is Beady?\" she asked. \"B period, D period,\" I said. She fought back a smile. \"Would you like me to call you B period or D period or Beady?\" This girl definitely had an attitude. Ben Morelli is a brash, up-and-coming New York City ad agency executive. He's just landed a huge account, and his future looks bright. The last thing he needs is to share the spotlight with some hick from Idaho. Bright, outspokenly moral, and unfailingly honest, Cheyenne is everything Ben thinks he dislikes in a woman. She's also a Mormon, whatever that is. It doesn't help, either, that his most important client thinks Cheyenne is terrific. And so does Ben's family. In Cheyenne in New York, Jack Weyland introduces us to an intriguing pair of strong-willed, seemingly mismatched characters whose family backgrounds, interests, and ambitions are worlds apart. A contemporary love story played out in the aftermath of a horrific national disaster, this latest Jack Weyland novel reaffirms in an unforgettable way the power of love, faith, and family ties.",
