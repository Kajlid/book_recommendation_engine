  "description": "Scott Nicholson's short stories have drifted on the wind, across deserts and dead seas, and now have found a final resting place. In Scattered Ashes, the best of his award-winning work is presented together for the first time. Scott Nicholson is the author of seven novels including The Skull Ring and They Hunger, and has stretched the genre to embrace peculiar pregnancies, supernatural mysteries, unorthodox creatures, and sinister psychology, exploring questions of faith and despair, love and loss. Gather around the campfire. The flames are intense and the ashes are still warm... \"Scott Nicholson writeswith a mixture of H.P. Lovecraft, Manly Wade Wellman, and Clive Barker, stirred with a liberal dose of his own originality, to tell an effective and atmospheric tale.\" -- Kevin J. Anderson, co-author of the Dune series. \"Keep both hands on your pants, because Nicholson is about to scare them off.\" -- JA Konrath, author of Whiskey Sour \"In a literary and geographic sense, Scott Nicholson explores the dark legends of the southern end of the Appalachian mountain chain, a nightmare country that ends in Stephen King's yard.\" -- Sharyn McCrumb, author of The Ballad of novels",
