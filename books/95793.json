  "description": "The Kincaid Ranch, near Red Horse, Wyoming...Ethan Kincaid - He's got a rough-and-ready sense of justice; he's a man who makes his own rules, a rancher who wears his authority with confidence. He's a widower and a loner - and the loving father of a five-year-old girl. Maggie Deaton - She's a rancher born and bred - but a rancher without a ranch. Framed by her stepbrother and convicted of livestock theft, she's spent the past two years in jail.Maggie arrives on the Kincaid Ranch because she's been promised a job - a job that may not materialize. Not surprisingly, Ethan doesn't want a convicted cattle rustler working there. He also makes it clear that he doesn't want a woman as attractive and appealing as Maggie anywhere near him!",
