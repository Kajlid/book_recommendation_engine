  "description": "I came to this mountain for market research.\n\nNow I’m sheltering from a storm with a bearded grump.\n\nAiden McCrae has an attitude problem. Hey, maybe that’s why he can’t keep a mail order bride—but when I lose my cool and suggest that to him, waving my clipboard on his deck, he sends me away without another word.I don’t get far, though. Not when my car won’t start as a storm lashes against the mountainside. It’s dangerous out here, and I’m about as nature-proof as my skirt suit.Let’s face it: I’m doomed. I’m gonna be struck by lightning, or eaten by a bear, or washed away by this torrential rain.But insult or not, Aiden lets me shelter in his cabin… and my research has just begun.\nLonely Beard is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a reclusive mountain man and the skirt-suited answer to his prayers.",
