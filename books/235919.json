  "description": "A time travel Romance for those who like their reading super hot...  Recently laid off and dumped by her boyfriend, Pauline San Martin figures life can’t get much worse – until she is hurled back in time to one of the bloodiest battles in the American Revolution.  A gentleman by nature, British Army Captain Kerry Bradford doesn't know what to make of the odd woman who manages to excite in him a wicked desire to possess her, but he suspects she might be a rebel spy. His commanding officer tasks him with wrangling the truth out of her, and Bradford may just have to seduce it out of her.  Pauline needs to find a way back to her own time, but first she must escape from the British, and seducing the handsome Captain Bradford might be her ticket out—as long as she can do it before the British deem they have enough incriminating evidence to hang her as a spy.",
