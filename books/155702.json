  "description": "A close friendship between two struggling women writers evolves into a passionate love affair. What could go wrong? Well, pretty much everything... San Francisco in the mid-to-late 1990s and two women are trying to build a successful lesbian relationship. But issues of self-image, love, sexuality, and intimacy somehow seem to push them apart just as much as bring them closer. They say opposites attract, and on the surface it could even be true. But relationships are about going deeper, and all too often finding out that the things we see and like to begin with are only a thin layer of the person we want to get to know.A love story minus the happy ending, It's Not You, It's Me is a bittersweet memoir of 14,000 words in the tradition of Blake Bailey's The Splendid Things We Planned.",
