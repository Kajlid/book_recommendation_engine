  "description": "Dear Author,He’s been my Master for a long time, the day he collared me was one of the happiest in my life. But lately I have the feeling that there’s a distance between us, that he’s withdrawing and I don’t know why. I’m doing my best to be his perfect boy, I need him to be happy, and serving him and being there for him whenever he needs me are one of the most important things in my life. But why is he so cold? Why isn’t he happy anymore? What did I do wrong? Should I ask him? What if I don’t like his answer? What I can do to help? Losing him would break my heart; if I lose him, I have nothing… But I know it’s within his rights to send me away, to take my collar back… but that would kill me. I love him. He knows that. Does he?Photo Description: One man kneels in front of another man, leaning to his midsection. It looks like a submissive pose, but also like they’re maybe comforting one another? Both men are dressed casually, and you can’t tell if the kneeling man is wearing a collar or not.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
