  "description": "Poppy Jones doesn’t date. She’s too busy taking care of her younger sister and managing The Gents, a coffee kiosk at the Arches, a legal graffiti space in South East London.Street artist, Gabriel Morrone is exactly the type of person Poppy despises. He lives life on his own terms. All he cares about is what he’s going to paint next. That all changes when he comes back from getting coffee one morning to find the three-year-old son he never knew about abandoned on his doorstep.A rookie parenting mistake immediately puts the reckless artist on a collision course with Perfect Poppy and it’s hate at first sight.When Poppy and Gabriel are forced to spend time together by Poppy’s meddling teenage sister, they realise they’re more similar than they first thought. Living in the moment with Gabriel gives Poppy the chance to reclaim her lost youth while Not-So-Perfect Poppy might be the ideal person to help Gabriel navigate his way through the rocky terrain of fatherhood.Amidst a backdrop of growing tension between two rival street gangs at the Arches, Poppy and Gabriel’s relationship will face the ultimate test when his son’s biological mother makes a surprise return, setting off a devastating chain of events.After the paint’s dried, can Gabriel prove to Poppy that he’s no longer the rakish, irresponsible artist she first met at the Arches? Will Poppy be brave enough to give Gabriel another chance even though life with him will never be safe and predictable?",
