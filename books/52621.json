  "description": "Little Halla lives in the land and time of myth and misty antiquity. A king's daughter, she is cast out by the new wicked queen. But Matulli, her nurse, changes into a black bear and carries her unharmed into the woods. Halla is brought up by bears and dragons, thinking dragonish thoughts and speaking the dragon tongue. In time this world dies away and she meets a strange figure, All-Father, the Wanderer. Setting her on the back of a unicorn he cuts a fold from his night-blue cloak, lays it over her shoulders and sends her on a long journey. Strange and fabulous adventures ensue as Halla takes up the cause of the men from Marob and travels with them to the fabled city of Micklegard where she will learn to do as All-Father bids - to travel light.",
