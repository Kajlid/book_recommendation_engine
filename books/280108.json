  "description": "Surprisingly dangerous and sexy as hell, Ashe delivers in his finest collection yet. Using simple, lambent language and bridging the world of missed opportunities, aural pleasures and secret passions, Haunted By Ghosts of Past and Present Love places the poet within both cell and sanctuary. Acting at times as a confessional and other times as a love letter to Generation X, the pages within are remarkably strong, demonstrating just what poetry is capable of when it's maker is vulnerable enough to transcribe his truth.--Slash Coleman, best-selling author of The Bohemian Love DiariesAn observant mind, a lovable memory haunt and inform these quiet heart-wrenching poems by Ashe. He possesses a rare gift--a profound empathy, deep respect and deliciously layered perspective of love. The poems are sharply etched vignettes (on a bus, the Metro, etc.) and they present a world of dreamy familiar, authentic, surreal hope. I was lucky enough to read Mr. Ashe's poems in Explorations. I'm so glad to continue the journey with him in Haunted by Ghosts of Past and Present Love.--LB Sedlacek, author of Words and Bones",
