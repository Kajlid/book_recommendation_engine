And while most of the town and her family accepted Buzz's disappearance, Hannah remained steadfastly convinced of his imminent return.More then twenty years later, Hannah's new life in San Francisco is unraveling. Her marriage is on the rocks; her business is bankrupt. After a disastrous attempt to win back her husband, she is shipped to her mother's home to \"rest up,\" and she is once again sucked into the mystery of her missing father. Suspecting that those closest to her are keeping secrets -- including Palmer, her emotionally closed, well-mannered brother, and Warren, the beautiful boyfriend she left behind -- Hannah sets out on an uproarious, dangerous quest that will test the whole family's concept of loyalty and faith.",
