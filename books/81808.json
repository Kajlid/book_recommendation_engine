  "title": "Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer",
  "description": "Henry Morton Stanley, so the tale goes, was a cruel imperialist who connived with King Leopold II of Belgium in horrific crimes against the people of the Congo. He also conducted the most legendary celebrity interview in history, opening with, “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” But these perceptions are not quite true, as Tim Jeal shows in this biography. With unprecedented access to previously closed Stanley family archives, Jeal reveals the extent to which Stanley’s public career and intimate life have been misunderstood and undervalued.Few have started life as disadvantaged as Stanley. Rejected by both parents and consigned to a Welsh workhouse, he emigrated to America as a penniless eighteen-year-old. Jeal vividly re-creates Stanley’s rise to success, his friendships and romantic relationships, and his  life-changing decision to assume an American identity. Stanley’s epic but  unfairly forgotten African journeys are thrillingly described.",
