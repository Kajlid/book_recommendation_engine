  "description": "Darkroom Saga book #4Imagine a church where nudity is embraced and sex is a form of worship. It seems so unlikely, so alien and risqu√©, but it exists. In the wilderness of Texas hide the Sons of Cain, their compound shut and protected from outside infiltration, and behind its walls they worship in ways you could never imagine.Sermons are an education, and their creed is bone chilling. When crime and Christianity join with a nefarious agenda, the victims are in orgasm, rapture, and wrapture. Candace is kidnapped but isn't even aware of it, manipulated and inducted into the wrapture culture, subjected to carnal heaven and hell.Love has a way of freeing the soul, but an indoctrinated mind can be a dangerous weapon in the boudoir. The path of duplicity is steep and treacherous, taking Candace Caine deep into the erotic heart of Christian bondage, BDSM, and biblical porn.Warning: This novel is rife with misogyny, sadism, perverted scripture, eroticism, explicit sex, gender abuse, and contains a traumatizing rape scene. Please do not purchase this novel if any of these offend you.",
