  "description": "My brother and I are businessmen we loan people money but if you don't pay us back well things don't go well for those people. My brother and I are also apart of the Riverfalls MC. I might not be a great person but I sure as hell hate people that just give away their child so they can survive and that's one of the reasons why I will keep Nicole and I donâ€™t plan on giving her back to her father even if he pays me back she belongs to me and I won't give her up for anyone.",
