  "description": "In The Boys, Vol. 3: Good for the Soul, everyone has something to get off their chest: Frenchie and the Female are up to something nasty with the Mafia, Mother's Milk goes to see his mom, Annie January wants a word with God himself, and Butcher enjoys yet another ghastly tryst with CIA Director Rayner. The Legend, meanwhile, offers to tell Hughie everything he wants to know about The Boys - all Hughie has to do is take a walk with the dead. And in \"I Tell You No Lie, G.I.\", the beans are spilled: sixty years of Vought American's superhero agenda for America, with every dirty trick, shady deal and black operation since World War II revealed at last. The Boys, meanwhile, confront the Seven on the site of the superheroes' greatest failure. The worst secret of all is what really happened early one September morning, not so long ago in New York City. The Boys, Vol. 3: Good for the Soul collects issues 15-22 of The Boys by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson!",
