  "description": "Betrayed by the love of her life at sixteen, causing her to flee her home, Amber Daniels’ taste in men hasn’t improved over time. With a bitter divorce under her belt, she returns home to support her sisters and dying mother. It takes one day before she finds herself in trouble with the local werewolves—and being rescued by her childhood crush. One hot look and the pain returns…overshadowed only by the desire. But Amber’s older, wiser, and unwilling to be burned yet again.  Desmon Nightwind was an angry youth the night his world exploded and he lost his mate. Now pack alpha, he’s no longer an untried teen, but still wholly unprepared for Amber’s return to Hollow Mountain. He lost her once. No amount of pack politics, family strife, or alpha obligations will make him let her go a second time. He’ll do whatever it takes to claim and protect his human mate. Even battle neighboring wolves using anything at their disposal to start a war.  They don’t fight fair…and neither will Desmon.",
