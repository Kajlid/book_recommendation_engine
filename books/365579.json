  "description": "Mark Tully and Satish Jacob , who ran the BBC's bureau in Delhi, here trace the long build-up to the storming the Sikh stronghold, the shifts of power within the Sikh community and effort of central government both to utilize and control them. The book captures rise of Bhindranwale whose extremism played wedge between Sikh and Hindu, Sikh and Sikh and Punjab and India, the indecisiveness of Indira Gandhi who paid for the catastrophic aftermath with her life. Tully and Jacob bring tragedy of Sikh from many arresting angles. They met Bhindranwale and many other central characters in the drama. They gathered eye witness account from every quarter to fill in this remarkable picture of what occurred and present their thought provoking analysis of what happened.",
