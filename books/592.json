  "title": "Skis Against the Atom: The Exciting, First Hand Account of Heroism and Daring Sabotage During the Nazi Occupation of Norway",
  "description": "The exciting, 1st-hand account of heroism & daring sabotage during the Nazi occupation of Norway. The outcome of WWII could very possibly have been much different if Knut Haukelid & his small, but courageous band of Norwegian soldiers had not been successful in sabotaging the Nazis supply of heavy water. The heavy water produced at a facility in occupied Norway was vital to Hitler's race with the USA to develop the atomic bomb. Skis Against the Atom gives the reader an intimate account of the valiant & self-sacrificing service that the not-to-be-subdued Norwegians performed for the whole free world.",
