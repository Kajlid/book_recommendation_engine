  "description": "Lost, but never forgotten. Completely unaware of her own loveliness, there is nothing common about a simple laundress named Rima. Gathering strength from a family she didn't know she had, she finds purpose in sacrifice and duty. Two nations, only three centuries old, are testing the stability of their governments. The fruit of their decisions are upon them. The destiny of Callidus Minor now lies in the choices of the people, the goodness of their leaders, and the tender hearts of a couple bound by trust. With the help of a wise knight and a certain handsome young man, can Rimarnia bring hope to the people of Callidus Minor? Will she find a way to help a nation before it crumbles under the evil leadership of a corrupt judge?",
