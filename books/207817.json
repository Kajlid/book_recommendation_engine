  "description": "As a Bracadyte Princess, Naura is forbidden to visit the surface. Until an explosion near her home in Aukrabah, leaves her injured and in the arms of a land walker named Anthony Vaughn. Recognizing him as her mate, Naura will stop at nothing to be with Tony. Even if it means her life. Anthony Vaughn doesn't exist. Having his family tortured before his eyes, and his past erased by the CIA, he no longer has a soul. The last thing he wants or needs is the responsibility of protecting the beautifully naive Naura from a ruthless Government that wants her head. Danger and seduction become a constant companion in a world of intrigue, conspiracy and a deadly epidemic that threatens to destroy them all.  Recommend reading the books in order. This is not a serial, and it does have a happy ever after, but the story moves forward with a new hero and heroine in the next book.",
