  "description": "Reapers.We think they’re cruel. But we don’t know the half of it.Yet.MY ship was raided. And now I’m owned by a monster.He saw me. Felt me. And claimed me.I became a pet.His property.I never broke under the lash.The pain only made me stronger.I’m determined that I will win.He will yield to the desire I bring out.His will is my command.His words are my truth.Some may think that he broke me.Other’s will think I’ve tamed him.You know what?I don’t care.All I know is this.I’ve won the love of this monstrous alien warlord.He makes me feel like someone treasured.Rather than something used.This giant brutish beast…Who has stolen a little piece of my soul.Has merged it with his own.Monster explores a much darker and grittier side of the Athenaverse. It can be read as a standalone, but it still shares the same universe that you’ve found in other books. Themes in this book should be approached with caution.",
