  "description": "A boy, a girl, an ancient puzzle, and a House of Answers, Artefacts, Miseries and Mysteries.From the moment Horace F. Andrews sees the sign from the bus - literally a sign with his name on it - everything in his normal little life changes. An encounter with the House of Answers, a magically hidden warehouse full of mysterious objects and even stranger people, only leads to more questions. These people think he's special - a Keeper of an incredible gift - although scientifically-minded Horace isn't so sure he really believes in that kind of thing. But then a confrontation with an impossibly tall, thin, creepy and undoubtedly menacing man makes him think twice...Horace must now quickly begin to unravel the mysteries of this hidden world and his new gift, as he finds himself immersed in a battle between ancient forces, where the bad guys don't pull any punches, even the good guys have their flaws, and where friendship, loyalty and trust turn out to be the greatest powers of all.",
