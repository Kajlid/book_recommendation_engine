  "description": "The Royals are dying and Evil is poised to conquer the Earth. The time has come; evolutions are in order. Five teens from five different continents receive the same gift at the same time. Each gift giver is a special person in their lives, who will later reveal they are actually their Luminaresâ€¦ their guardians, sent by the Royals of Arazi Crossing to watch over them. Traveling magically across time, the teens are brought together and their destiny unfolds. As their journey begins, each one has a quest to fulfill in order to become a full-blood Ace. If they succeed, they will take the place of the existing Royals who are dying quickly. As the teens travel back in time to complete each quest, they must also come to terms with the sacrifices they have to make in order to become a Royal, an Ace, a sorcerer for Good; watching over and protecting all of humankind. Can they make the ultimate sacrifice and leave their families forever to join the fight in Good vs. Evil? Can each go back in time and complete their life-altering quest before the Royals expire? Quinn, April, Maya, Juina and Janus will have to work together to complete their quests to evolve into the next Royals of Arazi Crossing.",
