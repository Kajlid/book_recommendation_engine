  "description": "The rules were simple . . .Keep my hands off his daughter and stay out of trouble.But now I’m stuck with her . . . And there’s only one bed . . .Oh well, rules are made -- to be broken . . . aren't they?I’m the face of professional bull riding -- the golden boy. Or at least I was, until it all blew up in my face. Now my agent says I have to clean up my image, so I’m stuck with his ball-busting daughter for the rest of the season as my “full-time supervision.”But I don’t need a goddamn babysitter -- especially one with skin-tight jeans, a sexy smirk, and a mouth she can’t stop running.A mouth I just can’t stop thinking about . . .Because Summer isn’t just another conquest. She sees the man behind the mask, and she doesn’t run -- she pulls me closer, even when she shouldn’t.She says this means nothing -- but I say this means everything.She says there are boundaries we shouldn’t cross. That my reputation can’t take any more hits -- and neither can her damaged heart.I say I’m going to steal it anyway.",
