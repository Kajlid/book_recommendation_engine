  "description": "Forty-something Beverly Brown, who feels as common as her name, embarks on an insightful, and often humorous journey of self-discovery. Along the way she meets Grant, a paraplegic French Canadian, who relights her passion for music and helps her discover things she never realized about herself. But they both know right from the get-go that they only have six weeks before he moves back to Montreal, and he does not believe in long distance relationships. Is it worth the risk to open up her heart again knowing it will soon be broken? Or can she make him change his mind? There's also Jack, the part-time judge she works with. There is a bit of sexual tension in their friendly relationship that Bev tries hard to ignore. Now Jack has offered her a job in his law firm in the city. It sounds exciting, but also seems a bit more change than she is ready to make. Throw in her needy adult children, her narrow minded family and her manipulative ex-husband and it is easy to see how Bev has locked herself away in her self-made cocoon for so long. This is not a romance, but there is love. It is not religious, but there is spiritual confl ict. It is not a comedy, though there is humor. It is, however, a life changing story of confronting guilt, regret, and unfulfilled dreams, and rediscovering passion and hope for a purpose filled future.",
