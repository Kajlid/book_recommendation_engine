  "title": "Backstage: How I Almost Got Rich Playing Drums in a Christian Hardcore Band",
  "description": "Nothing could have prepared an ambitious group of college dropouts for what awaited them on the road to potential rock stardom. Suicide, depression, extreme poverty, injuries, broken down vans and nervous encounters with supermodels. This is the story of “Christian Hardcore” band, As Cities Burn.Aaron Lunsford, drummer, takes readers behind the scenes, sharing his unique, and sometimes harsh, perspective on what it was like to attempt to \"make it\" as a band in the early-to-mid 2000’s. Aaron’s comments on the ins and outs of the music business, as well as the moral pressures of the “Christian” music scene, are eye-opening. Backstage gives fans of any genre of music a chance to put themselves in the shoes of those who dare to dream, and often fall short in the end.",
