It is revealed that both Amos and Jack are part of a special breed of humans called Mind Breakers, and over time Denni learns that every second within the last two years of her life has been controlled by their influence. Soon, she realizes that the people she thought she knew and the life she has most recently grown accustomed to might not have ever been real in the first place. Her thoughts, emotions, and physical actions are all at stake. So who can she trust? This, of course, is Denni’s past. Now she is forced to retell her story from the beginning in hopes that the worst of it will never happen again.",
