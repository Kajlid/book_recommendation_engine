  "description": "Can veteran Rock Casualty and unwitting National Treasure Geordie Selwyn save the world from the invisible foe that is threatening humankind? Fast paced and rich with period detail and unforgettable characters, APPETITE FOR CORRUPTION takes the reader from the gritty music scene in 1960's North East England to the corporate multi-million dollar Mega-Festivals and glittering Awards Ceremonies of the Twenty First Century. It travels from the sleazy glamour of Hollywood's Sunset Strip in the late 1980's to the gracious stately homes of the English countryside where unbreakable bargains and pacts are made in exchange for undying fame and adoration. In the late 1960's Geordie Selwyn and his band Church unwittingly set into play a series of events that will have repercussions on the world of rock music and on humanity in general. Geordie Selwyn doesn't realise that a ruthless and mysterious force with an insatiable appetite has cast its eye on the hearts and minds of his fans until it is almost too late to stop them. In the end it's down to the battle-scarred old rocker, together with his unlikely band of brothers-in-arms - a burnt out 1990's rock idol, a traumatised teenage survivor of a shattering rock tragedy, a powerful rock impresario and a rock loving middle aged tattoo artist to save the world for rock and roll and humanity. Ride with our characters on the Rockline and you will discover that there is no success without heartbreaking sacrifice, no hope of a happy ending without shattering secrets being revealed.",
