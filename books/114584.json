  "title": "Heart to heart(s) Communication @ work.Universal values of Buddhism to inspire open, compassionate and effective communication",
  "description": "In our increasingly fast-paced, competitive and individualistic world, dialogue is giving way to fragmented exchanges through electronic messages. People rarely make efforts to have meaningful conversations and build relationships at work. This often results in loss of motivation, weak team spirit and mutual indifference. The goal of this book is to give readers the means to bring back sincere, effective and engaging oral communication in their work environment. Tapping into the universal values of Buddhism, the book motivates readers to reconnect to their personal religious or philosophical beliefs, as well as to their ‘Core Values’, thus activating the ‘Intelligence of their Heart’ when communicating. They enlarge their awareness, while becoming natural self-confident speakers as well as good listeners. They learn how to create a ‘Constructive Dialogue’, an ‘Exploring Dialogue’ and how to use many other tools, among which the ‘Nine Compassionate Facilitation skills’ to lead meetings, large and small, with flexibility and wisdom.",
