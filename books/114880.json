Robby Palmer, a 12-year-old boy with autism, witnesses the “Miracle on the Hudson” from a sightseeing ferry and becomes obsessed with the birds that caused the plane crash. Passengers Deborah and Christopher are trying to escape their infertility struggle when Flight 1549 plunges them into the icy river.Preacher’s wife Brett Stevens has hidden a secret for years. She’s aboard the ferry, too, where the eye of a TV camera threatens to expose her.Their lives intersect in Sparrow Migrations, the braided narrative of ordinary people transformed by an extraordinary event — and by each other.

In a review of contest manuscripts, Publishers Weekly said: “The plot lines are sophisticated, the characters intricately drawn, and the book has a remarkably strong voice… brimming with humanity and grace.”Cari Noga is the author of Road Biking Michigan and the mother of a child with autism.",
