  "description": "Rauliax Moonsilver is an engineer, mathematician, professor, and lover of good food. He's also rather adventurous, a rare quality for a dragon, and actually likes to travel beyond the dragon realm of Noriath.This, of course, leads to trouble when he decides to perform a scientific experiment in the forests of Windsgate. A strange human boy runs into him and rescues him from his predicament, and from then on they become best of friends.Unfortunately, they become entangled in a war between the two great kingdoms of Valeria, Wesar and Elemar, and must fight to prevent the utter destruction of their homes.And beyond the chaos of war, something older and more sinister seems to be festering in the heart of Elemar.Dragons, massive airships, mages, elves, and fancy tea meld together to form this lighthearted tale of strife, wizardry, and all sorts of aeronautical nonsense!Paperback available on Amazon.",
