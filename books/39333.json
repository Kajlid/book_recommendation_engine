  "description": "Stewart returns home to face his past and make up for his mistakes, but he soon discovers that everyone wants something from him. In particular, he doesn't trust the motives of his ex-girlfriend's flirty attention. *** \"Leah was already there. She was leaning over the bar, wearing a mini skirt that didn't quite cover her butt and a sport's bra. Her warm honey skin glistened, still wet from swimming. The few patrons inside were all riveted to her. As Stewart's wheels rumbled onto the wooden floor, she turned and fixed him with her well-honed siren smile.\" ***This is a 30 page story based on characters who appear in the novel (W)hole, as well as the novel Breath(e).",
