  "description": "So what happened after the Vote? Well, I kept forgetting to write in my diary, but I did record the important stuff! • Lunch with a former Facility guard (interesting!). • Meeting Lucas’s sister - that was INTENSE! • Bane’s parents visit - that was OUT of the BLUE! And lots of political developments! Plus Vatican State births, marriages and deaths. After 6 years, I just filled it up with fun • My Underground Latin Primer • My favorite Psalms and Prayers • A few Maps • A diagram of a ProCamera Mass kit (like the one Fr Mark used to use!) • Bane’s Story! (‘Squire Thane and the Dragon’ - my proposal!) Mustn’t forget that. And a few drawings & things... A Companion Volume to the I AM MARGARET series including the novella 'Visitors'. LIBERATION, Book 3 in the I AM MARGARET series, has been nominated for the CILIP Carnegie Medal Award 2016. All the I AM MARGARET novels have been awarded the Seal of Approval from the Catholic Writers Guild, guaranteeing their moral, doctrinal and editorial quality.",
