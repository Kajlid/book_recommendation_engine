  "description": "Beautiful and high-spirited Caitlin Gallagher has no desire to be married. But her parents thought they were doing the best thing for her by marrying her off to a man with money, position and a secure standing in the United States, even though he happened to be English. His social standing would protect her while they were deported back to their war-torn homeland, Ireland. It wasn't just Caitlin's vow to hate her new husband that drove them apart, but the plotting of jealous women and the politics of dishonest men. Can Caitlin work through her anger, finding faith in God and love in Dillonâ€™s arms? Gentle Dillon Cade has lived a quiet life for thirteen years in Norfolk, Virginia. But that is all about to change. As he juggles treasonous acts with his newspaper, fights against President Adams' unfair sedition acts, and tries reconcile with his estranged father, he must also, now, deal with an unwilling bride who disturbs his peaceful life. Can Dillon tolerate her behavior long enough to win her trust?",
