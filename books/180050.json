  "title": "O.K. Is Great",
  "description": "Follow a 7th grade boy, Otis Kalshwonkee, on his quest for greatness. Otis, more commonly known as O.K. on account of his initials, moves to a new house and starts at a new school. His goal is to be great, but at what, he's not so sure. O.K.'s father suggests working hard at running, but there's no fun in trying hard. O.K. figures he will find something that he is great at naturally. Standing in the way of greatness are the mean girls who bully him, his jock of a brother, his perfectly perfect sister, his naughty dog, a no-nonsense teacher, and probably his biggest problem, himself.",
