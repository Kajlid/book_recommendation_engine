  "description": "A Poverty of Words, by Frederick Pollack (Prolific Press Inc. 2015), is an important and relevant publication of American Poetry by one of the finest living poets today. \"In his rich new collection, Frederick Pollack has opinions and observations about everything. Pollack is 'didactic' in the very best sense of the word- and learn I did from his unflinching, never ingratiating poems.\" ~Jane Shore (Professor, George Washington University) \"If you've never read this poet, prepare for one of the greatest breakthroughs in your reading life. Yes, Frederick Pollack is that good.\" ~Robert McDowell (Co-Founder and editor, Story Line Press) \"I enjoy Fred Pollack's poems, and consider them necessary because they do what poetry should do, grapple with the important. When I dwell on his poems, I can see the images leave the page and come to life.\" ~Daniel J. Langton (Professor, SF State; winner, Edgar Allan Poe Award) \"Pollack has a talent for lines that will draw you up short. It's the kind of thing you might think couldn't be sustained through the sheer volume of poetry in this collection, but you'd be wrong. Every poem deserves a second look.\" ~Krishan Coupland (Editor, Neon Literary Magazine)",
