  "title": "Katch: A Kat Tangren Mystery",
  "description": "Best Mystery Writing - 1987 Santa Barbara Writers ConferenceKat Tangren, entrepreneur by choice and sleuth by misfortune, appeared in my imagination years ago, 1986 to be exact, back in the olden days before eBooks were a popular medium. Only friends and friends of friends read Kat’s first mystery, Katch, in laser-printed paper form. Now that eBook publishing is little more trouble than a bit of reformatting, a few hours of paws on keys, I am introducing Kat to a broader audience. That would be you.Although technology has overrun Kat’s meager, mystery-solving tools of nearly two decades ago, I hope you will enjoy this, her first trek into the world of murder.Also included is the first chapter of Kat’s second mystery Bishops of Opposite Kolor.C.
