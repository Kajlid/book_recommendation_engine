Now she’s inherited the mantle… and there’s trouble around every curve.Bay isn’t just a witch. She’s a necromancer with the power to command the ghosts around her. That means that each battle is somehow more fraught, and each day is somehow more magical as she slides toward happily ever with her FBI agent love.The fights are bigger. The love is more encompassing. The hijinks are more hysterical.Welcome to Hemlock Cove, Michigan, where magic and snark are about to collide.Note: This three-book omnibus includes To Love a Witch, The Witch is Back, and Prelude to a Witch.",
