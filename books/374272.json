  "description": "This is the story of how Negro slavery caused the American Civil War. The first permanent English colony at Jamestown Virginia became a landed aristocracy with founding fathers, legislators, and slaveholders; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. The slave statutes enacted by the Virginia House of Burgesses show how the Negro was enslaved and the justification for the enslavement was incorporated in the documents of democracy. Slavery was the divisive issue; which led to the secession of states from the United States, the Confederate States of America, a Constitutional conflict, and Civil War.",
