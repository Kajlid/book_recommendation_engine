  "description": "At the turn of the twentieth century, Henry Simpkins is a valet at Taverslow, the Earl of Wayshaw's Somerset home. When the Earl's younger brother, Rafe, arrives from his villa in Italy, Henry is given the task of caring for his mischievous dogs, Pepe and Paolo. As part of his valet's duties, he also goes to Rafe's room each night to tidy away his clothes.  One night, Rafe tentatively asks Henry to go beyond his valet's duty to relieve Rafe's sexual tensions. Henry enjoys their increasingly intimate encounters, but he's soon disturbed to find he feels more for Rafe than mere physical attraction. Henry faces a difficult decision, as he knows he cannot remain in the same house as Rafe if his affections are not returned.",
