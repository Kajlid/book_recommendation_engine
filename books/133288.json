  "description": "The “Evolving Door” series details the heartwarming and often surprising transformations of the title characters as their lives are rocked by crisis and turmoil, often of their own making. The first book in the series, “The Making of Matt” is the springboard for the rest of the books. Characters that the reader meets in “Matt” are featured in the other three books of this sexy, sweet and sometimes tragic romp through the human psyche.The Making of Matt – “The Making of Matt” is a touching narrative which exposes the seamy underbelly of one man’s transformation from wayward husband to soul-searching single and beyond. Its pages are steeped in the poignancy, awkwardness, despair, titillation and hope encompassed by real life, and the story presents the eyebrow-raising nitty-gritty of the male mind without shame or compromise. The evolution of the main character is one from which men can draw hope and encouragement, and about which women can breathe a sigh of heartfelt relief. You’ll hate him, you’ll love him, you’ll laugh and cry for him, and eventually, you’ll forgive him.",
