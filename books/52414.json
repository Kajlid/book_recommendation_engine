For the first time since the accident she knows what it means to be happy.So who cares if Lucas is a little odd. It isn't that strange that she's never met his parents, or that teachers never seem to notice when he's late for class. Evie tries not to care, but on top of all his peculiar behavior she's been feeling kind of sick lately-- ever since she met Lucas actually.When Lucas decides it is time to come clean with all his secrets Evie has to make some hard decisions. Vol. IIAll Evie wants is a little bit of normal in her life-- is that really too much to ask?Lucas isn't normal, but he makes her happy. That should count for something. Evie thinks she can find a balance that will let her be normal and also be with him. Of course she hadn't counted on adding his family into the mix, or his ex-girlfriend.Life with an elf is never boring. Vol IIILucas and Evie were finally at a place where Evie was comfortable with her mix of normal human teenager and fantastical elf boyfriend. Then she went and got herself crushed by a tree.Evie wakes up with a whole lot of extra issues to deal with. Not the least of which is a trip inside the Veil to see Lucas's home. She never would have agreed to go if she'd known she was going to have her own secret to hide.",
