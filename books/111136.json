He wakes to find himself in a new century and a new country with the world at his fingertips. This is part of the Bloodletting series, an ongoing vampire story that takes place over the course of at least a hundred years. While each book is its own self contained story, characters intertwine and stories overlap in a way that ties all of the volumes together into a broader tale.",
