  "description": "Escape to the country with this fabulously funny tale of Lords, Ladies, and lessons in love. Can you find a prince without kissing a few frogs? Sensible schoolteacher Sarah Gordon used to think so. But now she's so over her ex-fianc√©, childhood sweetheart Ian, she wishes she'd never been under him. Besides, she's too busy for love. Until tasty toff, Good Evening Ireland presenter Rupert Glass shows up at the Farmers' Club barbecue and all of a sudden Sarah's struggling to keep her cool. And when her sister's wedding to a local farmer unexpectedly throws them together again, it looks like romance could really blossom. But Sarah's about to discover it takes more than a four-leaf clover to be lucky in love.",
