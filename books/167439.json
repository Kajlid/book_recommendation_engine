  "description": "Single mom Laurie Payne was just looking forward to a nice summer morning in the park with her boys. She wasn't expecting to meet the gruff but too sexy for his own good Billionaire Brett Cantone who seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. The two butt heads on first sight until Brett's body has a very telling reaction to her nearness when she gets in his face. Now this over possessive alpha is hot on her tail, and doesn't plan to let up until he gets what he wants. The hot young mother under him.",
