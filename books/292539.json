  "description": "I made my career on my own terms and ended it at the top of my game.Retirement should have been easy except the one person always in my corner walked away, taking my heart with him. The opportunity to host a satellite radio show gave me a new lease on life and everything was great…until I was forced to interview a ghost from the past.I guess what they say is true…some ghosts are meant to haunt you. He was always my ultimate dream but instead he became my devastating heartbreak. With his interview over, I was ready to move on with my life. However, he had other plans. While his focus was getting reacquainted in a way he said was meant to be, I just wanted him and the memories he brought gone. He challenged me. I built up my walls—my heart was closed to him—but I forgot he was ruthless in the pursuit of what he wanted.They say there is a fine line between love and hate and I skated it until I couldn’t fight it anymore.",
