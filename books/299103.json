  "title": "An Eye of Another Color",
  "description": "In his first collection, Curbside Assistance and the Benefit of Mistakes, Jacob William Watters set his poetry to the cadence of modern rock and rap musical influences. In his sophomore debut, An Eye of Another Color continues with those core influences of rhythm and beat, but seasons the work with the spice of maturity and refinement by reflection. His first work was heavily influenced by the natural surroundings of his adolescence, the Pan Handle of North Florida and the rural parts of Middle Georgia. In his second collection Dr. Watters borrows from those earlier yearsâ€™ experiences and progresses through his successes and failures of his busy medical career and private life.",
