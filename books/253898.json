  "description": "Strange and wonderful - Sunday TimesMervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy ranks amongst the most haunting works of twentieth-century literature, yet is was just one facet of his wide-ranging creativity. Peake's Progress includes sketches for the Titus books, short stories, love poetry, nonsense poetry, The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb, a satirical drama, and a radio version of his novel Mr Pye. Caricatures, far darker drawings, stage designs and marvellous illustrations for Treasure Island and The Hunting of the Snark reveal his equal talent for the visual arts. Peake was a true original, by turn witty, whimsical, nostalgic, grotesque, savage and disquieting.For me, Peake is the presiding English genius of the 1940s...[his] art throve in the abnormal, heightened sensibility of the war - Duncan Fallowell, IndependentCover Illustration: Mervyn Peake",
