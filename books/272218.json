Despite his frightening appearance, she is drawn to the massive alien - but is what she feels only gratitude?  Mikaroz has been waiting his whole life for the perfect mate but he never expected her to be a condemned prisoner, let alone a small human female. He cannot allow her to die for defending her honor, no matter what he has to do to save her.  With their lives on the line, can Greta risk trusting him—with her life, and her heart?  A standalone romance set in the Alien Abduction universe, the events in this story overlap the events at the end of Cam and the Conqueror. For mature readers only.",
