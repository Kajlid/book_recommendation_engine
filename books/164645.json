  "description": "From #1 Bestselling author, Alyssa J. Montgomery, A Spanish Seduction is the tender yet passionate romance between two strong individuals who learn that love can help them face the trauma from their pasts and ensure a stronger, happier future.Spanish heart-throb, Ricardo Garcia, is through with his Formula One racing days and playboy ways. The former world champion is now determined to succeed in the corporate world. But, his reputation is being deliberately and maliciously blackened, threatening to destroy his chances at a new life. He needs Jessica Harris to help him achieve his corporate goals. She's an extremely unlikely candidate for the position, but only she will do. He doesn't bank on Jessica's ability to draw out emotions he's guarded against, or to challenge his views on love and commitment. Jessica is instantly attracted to Ricardo and knows if she helps him, she can attain her own goals and move forward with her life. But, if she agrees to his plan, she'll be forced out into the public spotlight when she'd prefer to remain hidden in the shadows. Can she take the risk of becoming involved with Ricardo when it will certainly expose her to the world's judgemental media and may mean that her heart is broken in the process?",
