  "description": "In 1984, during L.A.'s frenetic Summer Olympics, conservative co-ed Eden von Eiff befriends young gay man Noah Baldock and his boyfriend, Ronnie. Though they become fast friends, Eden feels like an inconvenient third wheel until she meets Ruben Acosta. Little does she know that Noah has also cast his eye on the handsome Cuban. After a wild summer, Eden's pregnant and struggling to keep this secret from her politically powerful family back east when Noah offers a solution to her problem. Twenty-five years later, these two Boomers must come to grips with choices they made long ago. Eden's son Louie is now a social media star with his ambitions set on reality TV. Noah struggles with job loss and his odd \"friend\" Jivan, who holds a mysterious power over him. Eden regrets not being part of Louie's early life and wants to change that, but finds mothering a 25-year-old a daunting challenge. Thinking their troubles have mostly to do with middle age, the wrecked economy and professional failure, both Eden and Noah find themselves tested in ways they could not have predicted. In the process, they discover what it is that's essential, and what it is that lasts. Jim Arnold is the author of the award-winning novel Benediction.",
