  "title": "The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World",
  "description": "A spell-binding quest for the one algorithm capable of deriving all knowledge from data, including a cure for cancerSociety is changing, one learning algorithm at a time, from search engines to online dating, personalized medicine to predicting the stock market. But learning algorithms are not just about Big Data - these algorithms take raw data and make it useful by creating more algorithms. This is something new under the a technology that builds itself. In The Master Algorithm, Pedro Domingos reveals how machine learning is remaking business, politics, science and war. And he takes us on an awe-inspiring quest to find 'The Master Algorithm' - a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge from data.",
