  "description": "The course of true love never runs smooth. For Daniel and Mace it runs red with a river of blood…The world fell apart after a virus killed billions. Those men who didn't die... changed. The media called it Werewolf Syndrome. Life as we knew it pretty much ended. Those of us scrounging for survival in the post-apocalyptic devastation have one chance left -- learn to work together, or face extinction.It wasn’t much of a choice. Return to Mace’s den with him, or stay here, alone, with the women -- and the most bigoted redneck in the world. I didn’t count on getting attacked by rabids -- violent, crazy rabids -- or rescuing two slightly less crazy wolfmen and a blind woman. Or ending up back at my mother’s compound.My mother’s a surgeon. With any luck she’ll be able to save Derek. And convince our two factions not to kill one another. And maybe -- just maybe -- find some common ground between us that offers some hope for the future. Because where Mace is concerned, I kind of like the idea of us staying alive…",
