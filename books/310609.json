  "description": "My name is Ava McCann...I'm a quirky, socially awkward hairdresser, who is undeniably single.I enjoy long walks to the fridge, anything from the '90s, and nightly Netflix marathons.Oh, and I'm completely and utterly, not in love with my best friend, Danny.I figure it's past time I get over my teeny tiny — okay, huge — crush, and join the world of online dating. But one lousy date after another has me ready to give up on the game of love.Could my hot-as-hell, MMA fighting best friend be the reason Mr Right seems so far out of reach? What If It's You is a hilarious, sexy, and most definitely sarcastic, best friends to lovers, standalone romance.",
