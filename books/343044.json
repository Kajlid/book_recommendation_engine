Mating needs are not something he can control, not any more than he can control his transformations, but so far, Lachlan’s been right there for him after every full moon.But what happens when Lachlan’s not there, and Cedric, Adair’s ex-lover, the werewolf who turned him, shows up instead? Will Adair be able to resist the pull of his instincts, going against his own nature, or will he succumb to Cedric’s advances and risk everything he and Lachlan have fought to build together?",
