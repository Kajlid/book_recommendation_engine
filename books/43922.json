  "description": "New to the Nightfury pack, dragon-shifter Mac cannot understand the bond between his brothers-in-arms and their human mates - until the moment he spies Tania and the energy bond between them blazes to life. Driven by a primal instinct, Mac will stop at nothing to find Tania, to keep her safe, to possess her. He has no time to waste: Ivar, leader of the rival Razorbacks, hunts her, hungry for a new high-energy pawn with which to destroy the human race. Caught between the warring factions, Tania finds herself immersed in a world she never knew existed - and bound by a love stronger than time.With Mac, her safety from Ivar and the perils of the human world is assured, but still she is left with a terrible choice: forsake the independence she's fought so hard to achieve and reclaim the life she loves, or abandon the man who now holds her heart.Â©2012 Coreene Callahan; (P)2012 Brilliance Audio, Inc.",
