  "title": "Undaunted: The Best of BC Bookworld",
  "description": "Nonfiction. Literary History & Criticism. For over a quarter century, many readers have agreed with legendary publisher Jack McClelland who said, \"I have never before encountered a book journal as engaging as BC BookWorld .\" But over several decades, the populist style of BC BookWorld has tended to overshadow its literary value and its essentially educational agenda. Here in THE BEST OF BC BOOKWORLD is a sampling of articles that entertain, enlighten, educate and provoke. About half are by Alan Twigg, who has written the majority of the newspaper since its inception in 1987. Other contributors include Jane Rule, George Woodcock, W. P. Kinsella, Stephen Vizinczey, broadcaster Mark Forsythe, biographer Joan Givner and BookWorld 's designer and cartoonist David Lester. There is something for everyone from early explorers of the Pacific Slope, to essays about literature, to BC authors who have written about the Holocaust.",
