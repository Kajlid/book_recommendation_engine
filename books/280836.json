  "title": "Images from the Holocaust: A Literature Anthology",
  "description": "Selecting literature to convey the essence of the Holocaust is difficult because there was no standard Holocaust experience. Each person who experienced the Holocaust - whether victim, witness, resuer, or descendant - has a unique story to tell. Selections for this anthology include fiction (both short stories and excepts from novels), poetry, historical accounts, biographical sketches, and drama. Each entry is preceded by a brief biographical note about the author and an introduction. In addition, each chapter opens with material that provides historical context for the selections that follow.",
