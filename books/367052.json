  "description": "'The World's Richest Man' is the never-been-told true story of Jerry Wolman, the Cinderella builder from the coal mining region of Pennsylvania, who came from nothing and made it big. Capturing national attention in 1963 when he purchased the Philadelphia Eagles, he became the youngest owner in the National Football League. Wolman s rapid success, along with his boyish charm and legendary generosity, made him an icon of his day. However, in attempting to build one of the world s tallest buildings, the John Hancock Center in Chicago, he ran into severe construction problems, causing his $100 million dollar empire to topple. 'The World's Richest Man' is the remarkable tale of one man's heartfelt meteoric rise and fall, and the thousands he touched throughout his larger-than-life journey.",
