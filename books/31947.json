He finally has saved enough to buy a little tree all his own, one with scrawny limbs and very few needles. But the boy's love for his first Christmas tree is not affected by its diminuitive stature. His love and the magic of Christmas combine to make a strange and wonderful thing happen to the town . . . Told in rhyme and with retro illustrations, The Scrawny Little Tree is sure to become a favorite holiday tale!",
