  "description": "THE DOUJINSHI CODEThe Genshiken has long been famous for its remarkable record of inactivity. But now that Kanji Sasahara has stepped in as the new club president, it looks as though things may change. Kanji wants the club to produce its first fanzineâ€”and when the Genshiken members are accepted as official vendors at the summer Comic-Fest, they are forced to create a real doujinshi . . . and fast!

Meanwhile, Kousaka is about to reveal a secret side of himself that nobody has ever seen. . . .",
