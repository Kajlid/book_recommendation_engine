  "description": "On the storm-wracked ocean world of Aquasilva, the priesthood of the Fire-God Ranthas holds supreme religious power.Cathan, reluctant heir to the clan leadership of Lepidor, has never questioned the teachings of Ranthas’s priests and has little interest in politics, preferring to escape into the more orderly world of oceanography. But when a valuable iron deposit is discovered, Cathan must travel to a clan congress to inform his father – and in doing so discovers just how far the Domain is willing to go to secure absolute control, and how much they have distorted what he thought of as the truth.Sent to a heretic citadel in the outer reaches of the rebellious Archipelago for training, Cathan learns a very different version of Aquasilva’s history, and makes contact with dissidents from across the world – but all of his skills and influence may not be enough when the Domain turns its eyes towards Lepidor . . .",
