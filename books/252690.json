  "title": "Magically Blended",
  "description": "Case closed? Maybe not.  I’m a protector of the ley lines, and I’m also the direct link to warlock magic. No wonder I’m amazingly amazing right now. Although, this amount of magic is making me shaky. Is any paranormal creature built to hold so much?  Fighting the urge to use my magic every waking hour, I throw myself into the unfinished case of the Scottish mob coven and their poisoned drugs. My ignorance led me to believe that I’d wrapped everything up with a bow. And, yet, when our original culprit throws blame on the mob leader, we have to find evidence. Do we release our enemy to get our proof? Even at the risk of losing him?  Either way, his fate, and mine, will be decided on the day of the solstice. Will I be magically blended or magically broken?  This is the final book in the Hunted Witch Agency series. Devon is going to miss you.",
