  "description": "Brooklyn has done everything she can to prepare for her nuptials with Derek and simply can't wait to start her new life with him. But things don't go as planned when Brooklyn's former college friends, Heather and Sara, show up at her bridal shower. Brooklyn is touched, however, when each woman gifts her a rare first edition: The Blue Fairy Book and The Three Musketeers, respectively. When one of them is found murdered and one of the rare books is deemed a forgery, Brooklyn can't help but wonder if the victim played a part in this fraud or if a murderer is still out there scamming and killing. Wedding jitters, counterfeit books, and a killer on the loose could ruin Brooklyn and Derek's big day. Can they make it down the aisle before more bodies start stacking up?",
