  "description": "Since she was a teenager, Chloe’s had one goal—to track down her sister’s killer and bring him to justice. Chloe never believed that her sister had run away, she knew that Leah had been killed, there is no way her sister would have left without a word. What Chloe hadn’t planned for was falling in love with the emotionally shut off detective who was put in charge of re-opening her sister’s case. Marcus had always needed control in all areas of his life. He has no time for a relationship and no need for the feelings that Chloe was evoking deep inside him. But once she gets under his skin, all bets are off. Marcus thought he could control it. He thought he could protect her. He was wrong. When their worlds are turned inside out, and all hope appears to be lost, will their love for one another persevere and heal them … or will it be too late? Chased Beyond the Tide is the third and final book in the Beyond the Tide trilogy. This series needs to be read in order. Chased Beyond the Tide is a steamy romantic suspense book which contains violent scenes that may be a trigger for some readers.",
