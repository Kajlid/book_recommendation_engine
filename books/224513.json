  "description": "Historical romance, Regency eraAlexander Murray knows one cannot exist without a brain, yet Daphne Farnham may be the exception. Her head contains nothing but rainbows, shoes, bonnets, pink frills and butterflies. Even her fluffy dog is useless. But the war with Napoleon is finally over and the surgeon is sure he can put up with a couple of months of cloth-headed Miss Farnham until they reach England.Did that naval officer have his sense of humor surgically removed? It is bad enough Alexander Murray has no fashion sensibilities at all, never smiles at Daphne like other men do and doesn't adore her darling pup Pompom. He had the gall to proclaim her \"useless\" when everyone knows it's Daphne Farnham who's the best at picking out just the right ensemble for any social occasion. Fortunately, she only has to put up with the sour Scotsman for a couple of months until they reach England.But when their ship goes down, the dour doctor (after a fashion), the dizzy damsel (more or less) and the darling (and potentially delicious) doggy are about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime as unlikely companions, castaway on a desert island. One of them may have fleas, but it's the two humans who will find themselves wanting to scratch a certain itch.",
