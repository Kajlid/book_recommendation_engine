Soon she becomes tangled up in the civil war that has inflamed the country. Leading the Four Banners Army is the rightful king, Prince Colan, supported by his brothers. Challenging these heirs to the throne is their own cousin and foster-brother, the Lord Marius. An ambitious young man who has inspired ardent devotion in his soldiers, Marius has taken control of the country and is preparing to crown himself king—unless Colan can defeat this man who, as a boy, was his dearest friend.",
