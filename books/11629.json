He surreptitiously enlists the help of the French, who appoint Le Chasseur (the Hunter) to do the dirty work. Assisting him will be the world’s most wanted terrorist, HAMAS’s Ravi Rashood, arch-enemy of the United States. With the French and Muslim fanatics on the verge of controlling Saudi oil, and the world economy and oil industry nearing collapse, America must act. Admiral (Ret.) Arnold Morgan faces an unparalleled challenge, not to mention mounting international opposition, as he marshals the forces to discipline a wayward “ally” and crush the terrorist menace. Failure is not an option.",
