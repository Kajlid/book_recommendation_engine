  "title": "The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club: True Tales from a Magnificent and Clumsy Life",
  "description": "Introducing Laurie Notaro, the leader of the Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club. Every day she fearlessly rises from bed to defeat the evil machinations of dolts, dimwits, and creepy boyfriendsâ€”and that's before she even puts on a bra. For the past ten years, Notaro has been entertaining Phoenix newspaper readers with her wildly amusing autobiographical exploits and unique life experiences. She writes about a world of hourly-wage jobs that require absolutely no skills, a mother who hands down judgments more forcefully than anyone seated on the Supreme Court, horrific high school reunions, and hangovers that leave her surprised she woke up in the first place. The misadventures of Laurie and her fellow Idiot Girls (\"too cool to be in the Smart Group\") unfold in a world that everyone will recognize but no one has ever described so hilariously. She delivers the goods: life as we all know it.",
