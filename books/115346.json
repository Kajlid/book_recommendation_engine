  "description": "\"Does that mean you don't have a boyfriend?\" I narrowed my eyes at him but he still figured out the truth. He gazed at me for a moment then asked, \"Have you ever had a boyfriend?\" I blushed again. Even deeper than before. My lack of response answered the question for me. I think this was the reaction Seth was hoping for since he leaned in really close. I instinctively tried to back away from him but seeing as how I was lying in bed, and he was blocking my escape, the only thing I could do was sink down into my pillow. \"I wonder…\" he said when I could sink no lower. I was flat on my back again, ignoring the discomfort the pressure was causing my stitches. He leaned completely over me, trapping me between his hands and hovering at arms length directly above me. His eyes were still quizzical, and yet they burned, almost wild, as he stared down at me. When he spoke again, it was a whisper. A velvety-smooth, dangerous whisper. \"Have you ever been kissed, Ellie?\" I sucked in a deep breath and then held it while the blood drained from my face. I was frozen, completely terrified by this beautiful boy and what it looked like he was about to do. When Seth leaned in and brought one of his hands to my face, I flinched so violently it startled him. Instead of kissing me—which I'm pretty sure he wanted to do—he sat back up and whispered, \"Okay. Relax.\" He brushed the hair away from my eyes, and then ran the backs of his fingers down the length of my cheek. \"When you're ready.\" It sounded like a promise. … Ellie’s Sweet 16 is a summer of firsts. First car. First kiss. First boyfriend. First serial-killing stalker…? Hockey-obsessed tomboy Eleanor Westley has never been the object of a guy's affection before. So when the hottest boy she's ever seen moves in across the street and starts treating her like she's the center of his universe, naturally she's going to be a little skeptical. But everything starts to make sense when girls who look just like Ellie start dying all around the city. Obviously the new guy is the killer, and of course he only likes her because he wants to slice her into tiny pieces. Right? The more Ellie gets to know Seth the more she's convinced he's a psychopathic killer. Problem is, he's the sweetest psychopathic killer she's ever met. Not to mention he's brutally hot. No matter how hard she tries, she can't help but fall for him. From the best selling young adult author of The Avery Shaw Experiment and V is for Virgin, comes a lovable, quirky, and wildly funny coming of age contemporary romance about a girl, her strange but hot neighbor, and the crazy summer that changed both of their lives forever. Will Ellie find true love? Or will her summer of firsts turn out to be a summer of lasts?",
