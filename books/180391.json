  "description": "He's driving her crazy...Piper West is finally on her own, and it's time to get crazy. Except that her overprotective big bro has enlisted his ex-cop best friend to keep an eye on his baby sister. With every move monitored and reported back, Piper's life has gone from \"going crazy\" to \"being driven crazy.\" But a searing-hot kiss with her sexy and scarred watchdog is just the game-changer she needs...Cole Black owes Piper's brother big-time, but there's nothing easy about his new assignment. Piper is all feisty sexiness and curves meant to tempt a man beyond reason, and Cole can't stop himself. Now he's caught up in a hunger like nothing he's ever known, and he can't get enough...Even if Piper's the one girl he's not allowed to have.",
