But living this way was always bound to catch up with her, and now, as refugees living in the forest on the outskirts of the kingdom, Violetâ€™s enforced misdemeanors are about to bring her whole world crashing down around her. The King has had enough of her lawless ways and sends Ryland, a skilled and fearless bounty hunter, to track Violet down and return her to the kingdom where she will face execution. But when Ryland and Violet become lost in the forest, their own survival becomes their only goal. As each realizes that they must rely on the other to get out of the forest alive, they begin to grow closer as an unexpected bond forms between them. What perils will they face as they seek a way out? Is anywhere safe? Will they ever reach a place of safety? And what of the relationship they have formed? Will Violet still be led to her death for the sake of a bag of money?",
