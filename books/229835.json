  "description": "Lady bug wondered why her wings were a different color than others. Eventually, realizing that the color was not important, she learns that her wings help her fly so freely. She lands on a hairless roly-poly Bear, and he too begins to embrace his uniqueness. The two become friends and wander off happily to find a crooked old tree, and a Robin with an unusual song. Ultimately, the four thrive on one another's company, offering hope and cheer, while embracing their specialties. The message revealed is that ones appearance on the outside has little to do with who they are on the inside.",
