  "title": "My Father's Business: 30 Inspirational Stories for Discerning and Doing Gods Will",
  "description": "What does it mean to discern God's will for your life? How can you hear His call? The word discernment comes from two Latin words: discernere (to perceive) and discretis (to separate). To discern God's voice and will is to converse with Him. In both Hebrew and Greek, the word will means \"to yearn.\" When we say, \"Lord, Your will be done,\" we are asking God to infuse His deepest yearnings into our spirit and alter the circumstances of our life in order that we may grow.Devotional Stories Featuring: Jeremy Lin, Bruce Wilkerson, George S. Patton, Walt Disney, Jim Valvano, Mother Teresa, Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Sanders, and others with selected quotes from Oswald Chambers.",
