  "description": "IRON FURY MC, BOOK 4  People, in my opinion, don’t take happiness seriously enough. They go through life, constantly trying to please other people. I do, however, take my happiness seriously. Very seriously. But, when things in my life, go suddenly south, I am left with more than one choice. Do what’s right, or do what’s wrong? That, on any normal day, would be an easy choice for me. I’ll do whatever I need to keep my life flowing with happiness. But when it comes to love, everything changes. And him. I love him. Which means I have to correct my wrong doings. I need him to forgive me. I need money. It’s the only way. When a job for a live-in maid comes up, with excellent pay, I jump at the chance. When I realize it’s for the member of a Motorcycle Club, I still don’t back down. Even if it means I have to live with and work for, one of the hottest, broodiest and most difficult men I’ve ever met. I’ll do whatever it takes. Only, I don’t expect to actually like him. The mysterious biker. The one who I seem drawn to. And now I have a real problem. Do what’s right, or let my heart take me where it wishes? Two men. Once choice. Things are about to get very, very complicated.",
