  "description": "The outrageously intimate memoir that became a media sensation... F rom the author of four New York Times Notable The Surrender is a shocking story of sexual and spiritual awakening, inspired by what is perhaps the last remaining sexual taboo. Toni Bentley was a ballet dancer. Intensely disciplined, rational, and self-absorbed, she had experienced plenty of sex with both men and women but remained, at her core, an emotional virgin—that is, until she met “A.” The Surrender is Bentley’s tale of finding “the joy that lies on the other side of comfort”—a compelling, startlingly personal story of one woman’s obsession.",
