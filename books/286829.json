  "description": "All’s fair in love and blogging...or is it?\n Bookshop owner, Georgie Jensen, is done with shallow jerks. Her Own the Eights blog dishes out advice on how to steer clear of egotistical creeps only concerned with looks and status. Her focus is finding one’s true soulmate—not the superficial ten but the solid, reliable eight. Jordan Marks is the city’s top fitness trainer who won’t settle for anything less than the best. His blog promotes working hard, playing harder, and striving to always be—you guessed it—a ten. \nWhen these two opposites are forced to team-up for an online competition, opinions clash and mouse pads fly.\n \nThe twist? There can only be one winner, and if Georgie wants to keep her shop open, that winner needs to be her.\nBut the more time this eight and this ten spend together, the more they learn that, when it comes to love, a number might not be what matters the most. \nGeorgie and Jordan’s story begins with Own the Eights, the first book in the Own the Eights Series. While this book can be read as a standalone, the series follows Jordan and Georgie as they navigate the ups and downs of love with sizzling chemistry and witty banter.",
