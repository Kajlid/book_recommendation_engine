  "description": "She showed him how to love… The lead guitarist of Sole Regret had always walked the world alone, until he opened his heart and his world to his sweet, reserved rehab counselor. Adam Taylor normally shirks responsibility and lives in the moment, but the foreign, tender emotions that Madison draws to the surface has him considering his future for the first time in his life. But how can a woman as good as Madison be happy with a train wreck like him? He showed her how to live… Since Madison Fairbanks started dating Adam, her entire life has been turned upside down and while his impulsive, reckless side causes her passion to burn bright, it also tends to put her in extraordinary situations—including a night in a very risqué sex club that's guaranteed to satisfy her most forbidden fantasies. He encourages her to try new things, step out of her usual boundaries, and experience a lifestyle she never considered. But how can a man as wild as Adam ever be tamed enough for a serious relationship? In book 7 of the best-selling One Night with Sole Regret series, Adam and Madison seem to have everything working against them. Is their love strong enough to withstand every challenge thrown their way, or is it time to call it quits?",
