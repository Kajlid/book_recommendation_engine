She shares and goes to secret places that most authors dare not go!She takes us in a maze of her imagination to the deepest depths of her being. Her life-long compassion for young love flows in her writing like that of Ann Tyler, and the subtlety of Alice Munro.Springsteen offers us a raw look at her life in this, her debut novel, which feels like it came from a seasoned novelist, and she is not only a gifted portraitist but also an author to watch in the future.",
