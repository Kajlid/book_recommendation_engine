  "description": "Love and hate collide when Greg Rodwell spills his secrets to two women, torching all three worlds.Yeah, I did it. In pouring out my heart to my married best friend, fate handed me an opening along with my unzipped fly, and I flung it against a wall before setting it on fire. What I did… I should regret it, but the only lesson I learned was I should’ve done it sooner. Still, I know this will haunt Hadley and me forever.On the other hand, living with Simone’s betrayal—mocking me and setting me up just like they did to me over a decade ago—I’m a live wire of animosity. My darkness was never supposed to see the light of day, but she gift-wrapped it for the world to tear open. She trashed our friendship. I hope that fact haunts her forever too.Ditching Richmond, that life-changing night, and both chicks, I try to restart or take a breather—something my sister never had before she died. Unfortunately, and uninvited, I’m not the only passenger on this displeasure cruise. My recent screw-up is a roadblock in every way imaginable until I discover her weakness: guilt. I grab on to that sucker because to ease her conscience, she wants to make it right with me. Which she will. To rebuild my life, I need a tour guide to show me the ropes, in a bedroom and with a woman. While I lack the experience, she’s skilled in that department. And before I cut her loose, she’ll make me one too. She owes me. Restraint be damned.Unscrewed is the start of a new series, but you'll achieve maximum shock and awe if the Wild Sparks Series and The Keys to Jericho are read first.",
