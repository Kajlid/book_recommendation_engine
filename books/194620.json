  "description": "After a not-quite-peachy year apart, three Georgia peaches come home to Darlington Orchard  When Murphy chose New York City, she left her first love behind. Now, a summer in Bridgewater means trading subway trains for pickup trucks and facing the boy she turned her back on. Leeda expects her trip home to be over faster than her new Manhattan boyfriend can hail a cabâ€”until a surprising inheritance saddles her with a huge responsibility.  Birdie's heart led her all the way to Mexico, and heartbreak brings her back to the orchard. But when the Darlington family decides to leave peach trees for palm trees, Birdie gets a crash course in letting goâ€”and learning when to hold on. Together for another juicy summer, carefree Murphy, perfect Leeda, and big-hearted Birdie return to the place that allowed them to bloom. Brimming with all the charm, humor, and heart of Peaches and The Secrets of Peaches, this satisfying conclusion to the series reunites three unlikely best friends for a final sweet farewell.",
