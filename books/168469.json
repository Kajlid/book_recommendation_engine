  "description": "The Ironsite cybernetic mercenaries go back after the escaped aliens and cross paths with the heroes. In the wake of the numerous murders by the group, the heroes actively seek to confront the enhanced humans.  A low-rung thug in Nightmonger's operation is symbiotically merged with a creature created by Rayna. His powers grow, and he becomes a person to be reckoned with in Nightmonger's forces.  A group of men decide to join the swelling ranks of heroes in Metrocity ... but these men have no powers, and are not supers. They slowly learn why super is part of the term \"superhero.\"  Rayna creates a new pet, but its personality doesn't mesh well with the other pets.
