  "description": "Jennifer Lozano was hoping a few days on the sandy beaches of Costa Rica would help ease the pain of a broken heart. Little did she know when she walked into the airport terminal with the Dallas businessman she'd end up a hostage for a group of Colombian rebels after a botched kidnapping attempt. It doesnâ€™t take long for her to realize that one of her captors has plans to dump her body on the side of the road after they use her to escape. But the rebel leader has been wounded in the battle, and as long as Jenny can keep him alive, she lives another day.",
