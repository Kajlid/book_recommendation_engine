  "description": "Pour yourself a scotch and fire up your kindle. Jessica Wildfire dishes on all the things professors want to talk about but can't. If you ever wondered what your teachers got up to when you weren't around, here's your chance to find out. Anyone who works at a university will find themselves smirking and nodding along. As a bonus, this book contains a short novel that was a finalist for the Pirates Alley Faulkner Prize. Yeah, you've never heard of that prize. But it has a famous author's name in it, so you know it's worth something.",
