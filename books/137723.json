William Booth (1829-1912) was a British preacher who founded The Salvation Army and became its first General in 1878 until he left this earth in 1912.Booth and his \"Salvation Army\" would minister Jesus Christ as savior to the poorest and neediest, including alcoholics, criminals, and prostitutes.Visions is Booth's powerful account of heaven. This is not merely a depiction of the glory and splendor of heaven. Rather it is a convicting challenge to all believers. This is a plea from God to leave the trivial pursuits of this earth and begin to pursue the eternal rewards of heaven. It is a call to arms for Christians to begin to rescue the lost that are drowning in an ocean of sin and bring them to the safety of heaven's shores.WWW.REVIVALPRESS.NET",
