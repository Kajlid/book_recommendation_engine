  "description": "Gina hasn’t been feeling very positive about men lately and certainly hasn’t been looking for a new one. Yet, when she watches her neighbor from a perch in her upstairs bedroom, her body does tingle a little at the sight of him. So much so, that she always seems to be at a window just at the right times of day.So, when said neighbor catches her spying, in a most titillating way, she finds herself all aflutter with nerves over him. Then when he lays down a challenge to her, a dare, to open up and be free and wanton she cannot help herself but to want to.Travis asks her to be bold and hopes that she will trust him enough to step out of her shy shell and join him in a game of tit-for-tat.",
