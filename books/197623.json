  "description": "The Feral Breed Fight Club series kicks off with one heck of a fight . . .After a long year of tragedy and battles, Cahill of the Southern Appalachia pack is hoping to spend a little time alone on his mountain. But with no mate to worry about, the safety of the pack falls on his shoulders, as does paying off the guards he’d hired to keep the mountain safe while he was away. Protecting the pack means heading off to participate in an underground fight club where shifters take to the ring for fame, fortune, and debt repayment. A ring some don’t make it out of alive.To the owners and fighters at The Pack House, Trinity and Piers seem like any other mated couple. And that’s exactly what she needs them to think. Years of running from the truth has set Piers on a path headed right into the fight cage, and Trinity has followed, even though the violence and the noise are something out of her nightmares. But the two have plans, and a handful of fights is all that stands between them reaching their dreams and banishment . . . or death.When Cahill sets his sights on Trinity -- nothing can stand in the way of the fighter getting his fated mate. Not the heavy debt his pack must repay, not the other fighters out to show him who’s stronger and more skilled in the ring -- not even the possibility that she may be mated to another. Once a fighter, always a fighter -- and Cahill’s more determined than ever -- to throw a knockout punch for the chance of a real win with the woman of his dreams.",
