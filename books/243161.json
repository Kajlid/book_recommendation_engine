  "description": "If magic could kill, it would. Or, at least it would kill Devon Jinx.  Half warlock, half... well, it used to be half witch, but I’m not so sure anymore. Ever since I defeated a powerful witch, my magic isn’t what it used to be. And, yet, I still hunt the ring leaders of the witch slave trade.  Until a more unsavoury plot appears. Gerard, my handsome agent partner, works with me to unravel the mystery of the warlock and witch gatherings. Apparently, they want to do a lot more than party. They’re prepared to create half-breeds, like me, to keep the warlock coven safe from the witches who threaten it.  And yet, from my own experience, being a half witch, half warlock, isn’t all fun and games. If I don’t stop the rogue supernaturals, the poor beings that are born into the world will face the same ultimatum as me: To choose just one type of magic… or die.",
