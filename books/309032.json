  "description": "A quirky Asian high school story fused with sci-fi, romance and mystery....Komoreby is the metropolis of the futureâ€”an eco-city brimming with stylish urban life, where dreams are forged into reality. It's everything Evanna Zeller's quiet, old town was not. Nerdy in mind and whimsical at heart, Evanna is a lonely girl with dreams far bigger than herself. She's darkly inclined with sunshiny kawaii, and she's herbivorous with a taste for video game blood. Evanna's adventure of a lifetime is her move to Komoreby, where she reunites with her childhood bestie at the city's most prestigious high school. When she expects a brilliant new start, pranks and betrayals sink the very first day to rock bottom. As if that isn't bad enough, a school tour of the city's high energy physics lab, home to a gargantuan particle collider, takes a bizarre turn.Now she's trapped in a parallel universe of draconian rules and warped versions of everyone. As she spins down a rabbit hole of mind-boggling quantum physics, can she find her way home through the murk of the unknown? All the while weaving through a social web of potential friends, foes and a mysterious rocker guy she's relentlessly drawn to.....Shortlisted for the WATTY AWARDS 2022 This tale is loosely a sci-fi Alice in Wonderland. The strict school in the parallel universe is based on real Asian schools. The ban on romance, classroom raids and shadow education are real. Expect shoujo/kdrama vibes, slowburn ship, gaming (MMORPG), rock music, real science and veganism.",
