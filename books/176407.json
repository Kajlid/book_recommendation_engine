  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Walter Mosley introduces an \"astonishing character\" (Los Angeles Times Book Review) in this acclaimed collection of entwined tales. Meet Socrates Fortlow, a tough ex-con seeking truth and redemption in South Central Los Angelesâ€”and finding the miracle of survival.\"I either committed a crime or had a crime done to me every day I was in jail. Once you go to prison you belong there.\" Socrates Fortlow has done his twenty-seven years for murder and rape, acts forged by his huge, rock-breaking hands. Now, he has come home to a new kind of two battered rooms in an abandoned building in Watts. Working for the Bounty supermarket, and moving perilously close to invisibility, it is Socrates who throws a lifeline to a drowning young Darryl, whose shaky path is already bloodstained and fearsome. In a place of violence and hopelessness, Socrates offers up his own battle-scarred wisdom that can turn the world around.",
