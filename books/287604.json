  "description": "Bull riding is all Gavin’s known for years, but when it’s time to retire, he can’t let go of the reckless lifestyle. He finds a job that brings him to a small-town Texas ranch and face-to-face with the woman who snuck out after their one-night stand.She can pretend she’s over him, but he’s not letting her go that easily.  Maize Bishop spends her days cooking and baking for her family’s bed and breakfast. The last thing she has time for is a relationship, especially when there are no single men within a hundred-mile radius. When a mysterious newcomer flirts with her over drinks, she gives in to his mesmerizing green eyes and goes home with him.Now that he works for her family’s ranch, she’ll avoid him at all costs.There are only so many places to hide, and keeping her distance is easier said than done. After months of giving her space, Gavin’s tired of waiting for Maize to admit what he knows they both want—a second round between the sheets. It may only take eight seconds to win a championship, but he’ll prove to her that he can go all night long.She’s too young, he’s too arrogant, and together, they’re electric—the perfect recipe for disaster.**Wrangling the Cowboy is a complete standalone and can be read without reading any of the other books or series, but if you prefer to read in order, start with Hitching the Cowboy as the characters and families do interconnect.**",
