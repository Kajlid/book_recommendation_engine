  "description": "“Come on, Pipsqueak, job’s done. It’s time to grab a pint, drown our sorrows, and prepare to die tomorrow.”As a rallying cry it leaves something to be desired, but when you’ve been dropped into the middle of a war, in a world you don’t know and a body you don’t recognize, at least someone is offering a drink.I’m not sure who I am or what I’m doing here, but I’m pretty sure we’re setting off for the final battle and I’m here for a reason. After all, my kind are only called forth in times of dire need and we always have a gift . . .I just need to figure out the who, what, when, where, and why. Then, I’ll sort out the how. I mean, how hard can it be?I’m pretty sure I’ve ridden dragons and wrestled giants . . . or was that the other way around? Either way, those skills will come in handy in a world filled with fae, shifters, vampires, and witches.Now, if I can just stay off the radar of the four kings as I change their world, everything will be just fine.",
