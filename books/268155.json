  "title": "Horsing Around with Murder",
  "description": "Abby Foster, a retired accountant, is astounded when she and her two sisters inherit a dude ranch in the Alberta Foothills. The last thing she and her sisters expect is a killer on the loose.  Facing financial ruin, the sisters host a week-long horse breeding symposium to attract more guests. Hours into the symposium, a cowboy’s sudden death appears accidental. When the Mounties dismiss Abby’s notion of murder, she convinces her sister and a hot cowboy to help her conduct a covert investigation without alerting the guests. Problem is, their quirky guests are the main suspects.  Chaos ensues when the senior sleuths tangle with one seriously amorous gelding (yes, it happens), a runaway stud, dwarf goats and their guard llama, a cranky stallion, drug abuse, deceit, and more danger. It doesn’t help that late-life romance ups the ante.  Will the senior sleuths finger the killer or will Abby end up as another victim?",
