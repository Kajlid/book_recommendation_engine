  "title": "Until Proven Safe: The History and Future of Quarantine",
  "description": "Geoff Manaugh and Nicola Twilley trace the history and the future of quarantine methods and tactics.Quarantine is such a simple, profound, and effective idea that it's almost hard to realize that it is in fact an idea--a concept that needed to be discovered, figured out, refined, and, of course, applied. We are now all too aware of how it is applied, but we know far less about how the idea came to be--and where it may yet go.Until Proven Safe  tracks the idea of quarantine around the globe, through time and space, chasing the story from the lazarettos and quarantine islands of Venice--built before communicable diseases were really understood--to the hallways of the CDC, NASA, and the cutting-edge labs and conference rooms where the future technology of quarantine is being developed. The result is a tour of an idea that could not be more urgent or relevant, a book full of stories, people, and insights that is as compelling as it is definitive.",
