Angelica Grace, a sixteen-year-old girl from Michigan, is forced to move from her home to the suburbs of Chicago. She loses everything while continuing to suffer from the depression of losing her mother. Her father doesn't seem to understand and buries himself in work to cope with the pain. As Angelica moves into the mansion, she hears the gruesome tale of the Wales boy. Unfazed by superstition, she begins to invent ghost stories to gain popularity, but the more stories she invents, the more real her stories seem to become. Angelica soon realizes that there is something to these ghost stories, and she herself becomes a character in her own tale.",
