  "description": "MAD ABOUT TRUMP: A BRILLIANT LOOK AT OUR BRAINLESS PRESIDENT is an all-out comedy assault on the most idiotic idiot to ever reach the White House (George W. Bush and visitors included)! In these 128 pages, President Trump is mercilessly mocked, relentlessly ridiculed and savagely satirized. The book features MAD's best reprinted material with the sharpest satiric shots at \"The Donald,\" comically chronicling his rise from obnoxious businessman to really obnoxious reality show host to uber obnoxious \"Commander-in-Tweet.\" Please note: MAD will not offer refunds on this book when Trump is impeached!",
