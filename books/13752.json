  "description": "For over 11,000 years they have secretly ruled the earth through an ancient society known as the Rominus Empire, bringing death and order to an already decadent world. Yet within this kingdom, is an ancient prophecy that foretells of an imminent civil war between clans fated to spark the end of the human race and of the king destined to stop it. There are those clandestine few who believe in the coming of this new ruler and have conspired to find him only in vain, but now after centuries of searching and waiting, it is he who seeks them, not for peace or power, but for revenge.",
