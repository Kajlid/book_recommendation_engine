Many of these young men went under the radar socially which enabled Nilsen's shocking killing spree to go undetected for years. This true crime book lifts the lid on his sinister story.From his early upbringing in Scotland, through to his final act as a free man, this story weaves its way through the darker recess of a disturbed manâ€™s psyche and his compulsion to murder.This book delves into the details of the killings and what triggered Nilsen to commit them. From his reliance on alcohol and his loneliness, to the extraordinary reasons behind why he bathed the dead bodies and kept them in his apartment for extended periods of time.Caution: The material in this publication has a strong adult theme and is intended for an adult audience. Reader discretion is advised.",
