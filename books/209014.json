During a mission to a small mining town, she makes contact with an ancient creature thought to be long extinct and is broken free of the chains binding her mind. Having no memory of her past or identity, Terra finds herself on the run from the imperial army and by fate, is rescued by a young resistance fighter named Code. Together they set out on a quest, enlisting the aid of rebels, defecting soldiers, and warn-torn citizens, to battle the empire and a sadistic general who wishes to eradicate all who oppose and enslave the world to his control.",
