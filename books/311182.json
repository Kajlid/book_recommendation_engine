  "description": "It was supposed to be a simple favor for my very important boss, Frank Kaminsky of the Salt Lake Slammers professional basketball team—go to his good friend Tex Jameson’s luxury ranch and provide personal medical care for his recently injured teenage son.I thought it’d be a working vacation of sorts—a chance for my city-girl self to experience something I would never otherwise do—but everything is upside down, and absolutely nothing is as I thought it would be.For one, this patient is not a teenage boy.Not. Even. Close.He’s a real-life, blue-eyed, tough-as-nails, thirtysomething cowboy who is so darn strong he looks like he could lift a car just for the heck of it.He’s also stubborn, rude, and we don’t get along…at all.Add in the heart-melting vision of him as a single dad to the cutest little girl on the planet, and I’ve found myself in a whole different dimension of trouble.Lust. Feelings. A whole lot of enemies-to-lovers-style complication.Please help me. If I’m not careful, this Grumpy Cowboy might just be the death of me.",
