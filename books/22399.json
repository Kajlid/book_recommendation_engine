  "description": "The Marquis takes his young wife to a magic castle in the sea, where his embrace will mean her death. A lion, beautiful but strange, bargains for love. Puss, the finest ginger tom in the world, brings his master good fortune more by judgement than by luck. In the freezing winter woods, a wolf howls; but a wolf may be more than he seem...These glittering stories are also more than they seem. The work of one of our most original young writers, they are not so much retellings of fairy tales as meditations on the imaginative content of such tales. Here, the Sleeping Beauty becomes a lovely vampiress; Red Riding Hood subdues the wolf to become, at last, a wolf herself. For under the sensuous and precise language, a complex argument on human nature and man's relationship to his animal nature is being conducted. Penetrating, witty, polished, each tale casts its spell over the reader who emerges dazzled and enchanted.",
