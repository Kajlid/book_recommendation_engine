  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling Author.  *This is a two part series, both parts are now available. This is the second part**  You know how it went for me. You know what he did. You know the fire he left inside my soul when he crushed me into a thousand tiny pieces. Since Marcus, my life has been a blur of emptiness. Since Marcus there has been nothing. I’m alone, my Mom is dwindling and I feel nothing but emptiness. I work long, I work hard, but why? There’s no longer anything to fight for. I know I have to face him. I know I have to go back. To fix my life, I have to break my ties to him. Seeing Marcus again will destroy me, but it’s time to finish this. I don’t expect the bitter, twisted emotions I’ll feel when I see him again, and when I lose everything once more, because of him, the only thing on my mind is revenge. But how do you hurt someone you still love so deeply? How can I still care for a monster? How can he still make me feel? Our story is the most complicated of them all, it’s far from beautiful, it’s far from perfect, it’s just a twisted mess of emotion that neither of us knows how to fix. But we will fix it. You’ll see.  Contains Adult Content. No Cliffhanger. HEA.",
