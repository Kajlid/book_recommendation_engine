  "description": "From the outside, everyone believes that Laura Hart is a woman who has it all. The Hartstrings Adoption Agency, which she started on her dining room table, is now thriving. Her husband Martin is the Chief of Internal Medicine at the hospital where has worked for well over a decade. And Katarina, their adopted daughter, on the eve of her sixteenth birthday, has grown into a beautiful young woman.  But things are rarely perfect for very long….  When Katarina starts acting up, Laura is concerned, while Martin chalks it up to typical teenage angst. Laura wants to deal with it and Martin wants to ignore it. But then Katarina starts asking questions—typical questions that all adoptees ask—and Laura is faced with one of the most difficult challenges of parenting and in her marriage.  In the midst of the chaos with Katarina, Laura discovers a devastating secret. One that turns her life upside down and shatters her perfect family and her idyllic life—and on the same day, life throws her another curveball she never imagined would happen. Confused and heartbroken, Laura turns to the only person who could understand what she is going through: Adrianna. Can her dearest friend help Laura make sense of her life and put things back together?  And...is Adrianna ready to tell Katarina her secret?  Deepest Desire of the Heart is the second in a three-book series and explores the relationship between mothers and daughters, how to heal a marriage that has been torn apart by infidelity, and how difficult it can be to share a secret that has been kept hidden for so long.",
