  "description": "Kitty Cat, Kitty Cat, the day is almost done. Not yet, Mother, I still can see the sun. Kitty Cat should be getting ready for bed, but instead she’s playing peekaboo, imagining she’s in outer space, tickling her toes, and more. Will Kitty Cat make it to bed on time? Adorable pastel illustrations rendered in watercolor paints and colored pencil from Laura J. Bryant bring Kitty Cat so close you’ll want to reach out and hug her!",
