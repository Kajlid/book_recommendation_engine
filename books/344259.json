  "description": "Second in a hot and naughty trilogy from the author of Nauti Boy. Angela Knight says, \"When I'm in the mood for steamy romance, I read Lora Leigh.\" So do readers who devoured the author's first novel in the Mackay Cousins trilogy, Nauti Boy. Now, in Nauti Nights, Leigh delivers an even hotter tale of a Kentucky marine who'll anything to get the woman he wants. Luckily for him, she wants it bad. James \"Dawg\" Mackay has lusted after sweet Crista for years. Just as many as she's spent running from him-and from a dangerous attraction. But for Crista, running isn't an option anymore because Dawg's got a plan to get her and keep her. It's kind of low-down-but completely hot.",
