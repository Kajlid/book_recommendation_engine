  "description": "Getting your act together is easy . . .\n\n\n\n. . . so long as no one expects too much.\n\n Now that Vix is determined to straighten up, the temptation to revert back to old habits grows when mysteries surrounding her paranormal college swell. Not that she's shoplifting again or anything, but when pushed into a situation to trust her new found friends in this band of misfit classmates and be honest with them and herself, she's not one hundred percent on board. Worse yet, the more she learns about Pent College and the magic world surrounding the town of Moon Bay, the less involved she wants to be. What's this magic school hiding from its students? How can they get stronger if they're being held back? And why can't she tell the truth to her friends when something horrible happens to her which has the potential to change her life forever? The magic school for rejects is back in session.",
