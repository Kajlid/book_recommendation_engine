  "title": "The Shrinking of Treehorn",
  "description": "\"If you want to pretend you're shrinking, that's all right,\" said Treehorn's mother, \"as long as you don't do it at the table.\" But Treehorn wasn't pretending. He really was shrinking, and that didn't make life easy for him as he become smaller by the moment. Treehorn's teacher said, \"We don't shrink in this class,\" and sent him to the Principal. Poor Treehorn spends an unhappy day and night until he discovers a magical game that helps him solve his problem. With his usual tongue-in-cheek approach, Edward Gorey glorifies the many imaginings of the story in witty pen and ink drawings.",
