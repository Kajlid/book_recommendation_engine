  "description": "This edition is no longer available.Kade has been a slave for too long. When he passes to yet another owner in a game of chance, he goes without a fight. He's still as proud as he ever was as a warrior of his people, but he has no hope left in him. Or so he thinks. Surial doesn't keep slaves. He's not a native of Azize, the land where he serves out his banishment from his family. He doesn't believe in their customs. So when Kade comes to him on a bet, he's not sure what to do with the big, quiet man. Kade goes to work in the stables, and soon an uneasy friendship begins to grow between the unwilling slave and the unlikely master. Even Surial's servants disapprove of the relationship, but Kade and Surial have more to worry about that a few raised eyebrows. In a world where magic exists in the everyday, Surial and Kade have to face their own fears, their own dreams, and a danger that might well overtake both of them. Sean Michael builds a world full of amazing characters and places in Windbrothers, where the fragile friendship of two men is tested and tried again and again, until ultimately, they find something more precious than anything either of them has ever dreamed of.",
