  "title": "Poetry from the Heart",
  "description": "This is the first part of the author's journey from disconnection to self-empowerment in poetic form with many as yet unpublished works. Tirza's words are deeply touching in their simplicity and expression of feelings and emotions which we can all relate to. It is also a great motivational work to shine the light on the path of others who may not feel aligned with their highest expression yet. Her authenticity, depth of feeling, loving personality and positively applied spirituality endears her to the reader from the first page onwards. Foreword by Marilyn Holzmann.",
