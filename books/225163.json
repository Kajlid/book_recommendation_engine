  "description": "“I want you to tell me how much you want it Ava. I want you to beg me. Beg me to give you, your release. Beg. Me.” I growled against her p#ssy, her juices coating my tongue. -Professor Caldwell  All I needed was a passing grade. I never expected to sleep with my Professor for it.  When Ava told me she couldn’t fail my class or she would lose her student aide I made her a deal that would benefit both of us.  One night of off the wall hot sex in return for an A in my class. Neither of us expected it to be more than one time, until it happened again, and again, and pretty soon we were blurring the lines between student and teacher.  If anyone found out I’d lose everything, but maybe Ava was worth losing everything for.  -This is a STANDALONE instalove with a HEA. It contains hot sex scenes, and a dirty talking professor so get out your text book out and get ready to earn your A.-  There is also a bonus novella called Dirty Deed's included in this story, free of charge for J.L. Beck fans.",
