  "description": "When 38 year old Conner O’Rourke returns to Ireland after an absence of 30 years, he is on the verge of suicide and running from his demons. His advertising agency in Australia is bankrupt, his marriage is falling apart and he’s hearing poetic voices in his mind telling him to return to Inis Mór. His Irish grandmother, whom he hasn’t spoken to in years, has contacted him saying she's critically ill and must speak with him before she dies. When he arrives on Inis Mór- a wild, windswept, rocky little outcrop some 30 miles off the West Coast of Ireland - she has already died, leaving him a cottage and a dilapidated old sailing boat that was built by his grandfather. A mysterious old seaman appears offering to help him rebuild the boat and as they work together the old man tells Conner stories and legends of Ireland; stories of adventure, courage and passion. Conner is intrigued and inspired by the old man’s stories; but will he find the courage to follow his own heart?",
