  "description": "BDSM Contemporary Diablo Blanco Club; Previous Under ControlWhat’s a Dom to do when the submissive he wants runs from the feelings between them? From the moment he met Lyssa Lawrence, Mike knew what he felt was love -- not lust. Convincing her has been an uphill battle even after the two steamy hours they’d shared at the Diablo Blanco Club four years earlier.Lyssa Lawrence wished the man who claimed to love her wasn’t so damned appealing. Twelve years of denying the pull of her submissive nature almost went up in smoke four years ago, but she’d gathered the nerve to tell him 'no' when he asked for more. She’d have stayed away for good if her biological clock hadn’t hiccupped, threatening her dreams of motherhood.In the same way she’d strategized her success in fashion design, Lyssa worked out a plan to get the baby she wanted. The Diablo Blanco Club’s annual Midnight Masquerade would provide a number of potential donors to choose from. What she hadn’t bargained on was Mike’s interference through an arcane Club rule.When Mike invoked Rite of First Claim, Lyssa finally became his. Now, he had one month to prove that the role of his submissive was one she was born to play.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find BDSM theme and elements.",
