  "description": "If you can't stand the heat, don't walk into the fire. Danny knew his sophomore year would be stressful, but he didn’t expect his school to burn down on the first day. To make matters worse (and they were about to get a lot worse), he — and his three best friends — each receive an email from the principal of their rival, King’s Academy, offering full-rides to attend the town's prestigious boarding school. Danny wants nothing to do with King’s Academy and says no. His mother has other ideas. So off he goes to be bullied and picked on for not being part of the popular and rich crowd. From day one at King’s, Danny encounters hazing, mocking insults from girls at the \"popular and pretty\" table, and cafeteria food that, for such a prestigious school, tastes as if it was purchased from a military surplus supply warehouse. If he survives, Danny will have to overcome his fears of failure, rejection, and loneliness—all while standing strong in his beliefs and walking into the fire.",
