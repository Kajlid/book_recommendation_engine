  "description": "The highly-anticipated second book in the Here and Now trilogy and is intended to be read following Lost in Me. The series concludes in All for This, available now.  Torn between two men… When I woke up after the accident, I couldn’t remember anything from the last year—including my relationship with Max Hallowell or anything about Nate Crane. Now my memories are returning, but instead of answering my questions, they’re leaving me with more.  The man who broke my heart and wants to be my future… Max is all I ever wanted, and now he wants to marry me. He’ll do everything he can to fill my life with love, family, and security. I need those things now more than ever. But can I trust him?  The man who stole my heart and wants to let me go… Nate never made me promises, and I never asked him to. I’d been on the rebound, looking for a distraction, and he made me feel beautiful and wanted when I needed to feel those things most. He says he has to let me go, but what if I can’t let go of him?  With every revelation and every passing day, I feel more like Alice down the rabbit hole. I’m falling. Who will catch me?  **This book is not a stand-alone and is intended to be read following Lost in Me. Hanna’s story concludes in book three, All for This, available now.
