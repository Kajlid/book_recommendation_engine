  "description": "Crowned as the first Hybrid Queen, my battle with Light and Dark has only just begun.Destroying the portal to the Light Fae Realm should have solved all my problems. No more pompous jerkwads telling us what to do, how to dress, how to live and how to die.Little did I know that by closing one door, I opened another, one that let the gorgeous King of Malice waltz right into my world…And into my heart.Steel has been with me all my life as a voice in the back of my mind, guiding me and helping me stay alive in this dying world. Sure, his methods are a bit unorthodox, but who am I to judge? It’s not like I have a flawless track record, given my history as top Malice Caster from the Dregs.Lucas, however, is my sexy fae Prince of Light. He stayed behind when I closed the portal to his realm, knowing that it meant he’d never see his family again, all because he had to make sure I survived my ascension.Now he wants to stand by my side and face the Darkness together.Just like my heart, my body is split into two directions, one seeking the Light, and the other seeking the Darkness I’ve known all my life. I’m a Hybrid Queen, the first of my kind, and if I can’t learn to make Light and Malice coexist, I won’t be the only thing torn apart.",
