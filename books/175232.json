  "description": "Reaper Colson has run the Blue Bird Strip Club for the Blue Bandits MC for ten years. He's seen all types of people in and out of his club, but when Sarah Banner walks in he can't seem to find either his balls or his manners. Because she's tying him up in knots and pissing him off to the point when he'd usually say screw it and walk away. Only she's under his skin and walking away might not be an option for him anymore.Sarah Banner is desperate. She and her son are going to be living in her car if she doesn't find work. Walking into the Blue Bird was the hardest thing she'd ever done, but for her son Josh she'd do anything. Only the owner wasn't what she expected and giving up cardigans for leather skirts is going to be hard. Unleashing Reaper is going to be even harder.",
