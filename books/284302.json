  "description": "A Paranormal Retelling of Little Red Riding HoodRose  I was on my way to my grandmother’s house when my car broke down and I found myself stranded in the middle of nowhere. It was late, dark, and I swore I hear something in the woods. And then he came along, this towering beast of a man who claimed he wouldn’t let anything hurt me, that he’d protect me at all costs … because I was his.  Deadly. All male. But the one thing on my mind was who would protect me from him?  Logan  Rose thought she was lost, but the truth was she was exactly where she was supposed to be. With me.She needed my help and I was happy to oblige. But I wasn’t being a Good Samaritan. She was my mate and I was going to claim her. The only obstacle I saw was her willingness to see that she was made to be mine, that giving herself fully to me was exactly how fate had written our story. But I had all the time in the world. When it came to Red nothing else mattered.",
