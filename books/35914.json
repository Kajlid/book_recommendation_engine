  "description": "Colin and Connor’s grandfather could not make it to their funeral. Breakdowns come with a price. After his release from the Happy Hotel for Naked Old Men he worked hard at healing, at facing the terrible loss he and his family suffered. At moving on. That was the goal. Head doctors always have goals and Grandpa was doing well...until one unexpected slip, an accident really, sent him spiraling in an entirely different, decidedly darker direction. He became obsessed with “making things right”, with fixing things. Somehow he understood that only he could do that. Only he could make things right...and the cost didn't matter.",
