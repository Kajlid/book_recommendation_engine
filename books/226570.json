  "description": "\"AMERICA RETURN TO GOD: REPENT FROM SIN, REBUILD THE WALL, REPAIR THE GATES, RESTORE THE DREAM\" One reason that America borders on the brink of economic disaster and constant violent upheaval is that we have turned blind eyes and deaf ears to the plight of our brothers and sisters. Like Cain who killed his brother Abel, we have despised good and have turned away from caring about what happens to our brothers and sisters. We must humble ourselves as Nehemiah did: 'When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of Heaven' (Nehemiah 1:4.). Yes, there is hope, and there still may be time to return to God and rebuild God's wall of protection around our Nation. If we sincerely desire to rebuild our Nation, there is much to be learned from the lessons in the books of Esther, Ezra and Nehemiah. May this book be a landmark in the history of 21st century America, chronicling the REPAIRING THE GATES, REBUILDING THE WALL, RESTORING THE DREAM, and RETURNING TO GOD.",
