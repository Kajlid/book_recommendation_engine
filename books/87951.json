  "description": "What would you do if your medication cost $7,861.00 a month? Where would you turn if your insurance company stopped paying your doctor in the middle of your lifesaving treatment? Would it make a difference if you weren't yet thirty years old?One percent of the human population is born with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Seventy-two thousand young adults in the United States are diagnosed with cancer every year. Countless patients are forced to fight with their insurance providers to receive the care their doctors prescribe.Welcome to the world of Erin Havel, who was born with an AVM, began having prescribed treatment, and halfway through those treatments was denied coverage by her insurance provider. In her new book, \"The Malformation of Health Care,\" Erin bravely tackles the American health care system and reveals how all too often it literally turns the lives of patients—ordinary people just like you—upside down. This informative and eye-opening book about a young adult with both an AVM and CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia) clumsily navigating the American health care system in order to survive and ultimately become an advocate for others battling for affordable health care is a must read. No matter whether you agree or disagree with the current U.S. health care system or whether you loathe or love “Obamacare,” it’s important to put a face on why this topic is in the headlines. This book's main purpose is to expose some of the loopholes and pitfalls in the system and offer concrete tips on how to navigate through and around them. Readers are sure to appreciate Ms. Havel’s indomitable spirit and engaging style, as well as the care that has gone into the editing and formatting of \"The Malformation of Health Care.\"",
