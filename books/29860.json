  "description": "With an introduction by Peter S. BeagleAn old woman who spends her days scrubbing the floors might be an unlikely damsel in distress, but Lord Dunsany proves once again his mastery of the fantastical. The Charwoman's Shadow is a beautiful tale of a sorcerer's apprentice who discovers his master's nefarious usage of stolen shadows, and vows to save the charwoman from her slavery.Praise for The Charwoman's Shadow“Lord Dunsany is the great grandfather of us all.” —Jane Yolen, winner of National Book Award, Nebula Award, and Wolf Fantasy Award“Lord Dunsany is the fountainhead of all twentieth-century fantasy. He was certainly the finest inventor of titles ever to grace English Literature.” —Dave Duncan, author of The Gilded Chain“How wonderful that Del Rey is bringing back The Charwoman's Shadow and The King of Elfland's Daughter  for readers, new and old alike, to discover them anew. It will be a delight to read it for the first time again.” —Dennis L. McKiernan, author of The Hèl's Crucible duology“These two novels have as much of Wonder and Faerie in them as you'll find anywhere in English, and the prose itself is remarkable both for its richness and its simplicity. Dunsany can entertain any reader and teach any writer.” —David Drake, author of Lord of the Isles",
