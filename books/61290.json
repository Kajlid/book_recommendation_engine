  "description": "Born to be nobody. Destined to be king. Doomed to be a villain. What matters? Loyalty matters. Loyalty Binds Me.Artist Hans Holbein receives a summons to the home of Sir Thomas More for the commission of his lifetime, but he will leave with a secret that puts his very life at risk. What he will learn is the truth about the life of King Richard III, from his return from exile with his brother, King Edward IV, through his rise to become the king's most powerful subject. From his flourishing personal life to his seizure of the throne. The unfashionable truth about the man the Tudor dynasty has worked tirelessly to villify will be as nothing compared to the reason for it, as Holbein will discover. He is about to be asked to hide the greatest secret in England. A secret that could tear the fragile Tudor regime apart at its seams.Show More Show Less",
