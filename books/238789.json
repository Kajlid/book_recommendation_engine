  "description": "“Why do you like to hurt me so much?” “I won’t hurt you. Not anymore. So please, don’t run away from me.” With a devil-may-care attitude and a naughty reputation, Jason Brown is Raven High’s resident Casanova. Bookish and reserved, Samantha Simpson is the school’s ‘unofficial’ Book Nerd. Now, what happens when two people from completely different worlds are thrown together? When Sam’s name appeared on Jason’s secret list, just like the rest of girls listed, Jason is certain she will be crazy in love with him in a week. But there's no way a smart girl like Samantha Simpson could ever like a womaniser like Jason Brown. Is there? As Jason goes the extra mile to win Sam’s heart and crosses her name off the list, he has no clue that an eye-opening truth is about to unravel before his eyes, pulling him out of his carefree world to see past her shyness and thick books. After a shocking discovery, regret, and a change of heart, Jason soon realizes Sam needs help, and he is willing to go to greater length this time to save her from the violent life she struggles to survive. But with the weight of his reputation and bad decisions fending him off from being the knight in shining armour, could Sam really trust him with her life? Grab a copy now and fall in love with Kay S.H’s Playing the Field. A beautiful story of self-discovery, a second chance, and love that all starts with a List, a book club, and The Notebook.",
