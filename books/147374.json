  "description": "When Ryan Wingate sees his ex-fianc√©e Lisa Wilde again, he wants nothing more than to wrap his fingers around her beautiful, tempting throat and shake the living daylights out of her. Her only salvation are the customers at his motorcycle repair shop. When Lisa sees Ryan again after running away from him five years ago, she wants nothing more than to jump his bones. He grew up, grew a beard and grew even hotter. He sees red and wants nothing to do with the woman who humiliated him. She only sees the color of love and wants a second chance. After getting some wildness out of her system, she grew up as well. He tries to run, but there are only so many places one can hide in a small mountain town. She knows every crook and cranny of the old place and is determined to raise hell to win him back. Will her determination make him love her again or will his determination send her running for the hills?",
