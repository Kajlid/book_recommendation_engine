  "description": "When the body of a handsome, fleshy man is found on the Newcastle to Edinburgh train with the livid mark of a garotte round his throat like a lethal necklace, naturally the first port of call is Leith Police Station and Inspector James McLevy. The corpse is discovered to be one ‘Count Borromeo’, a ruthless seducer and amoral bigamist; it soon emerges that Jean Brash’s coachman, the ginger-haired giant Angus Dalrymple, was also aboard the train and is the number one suspect, a fact that sets Jean and the inspector once more at daggers drawn. When McLevy and Constable Mulholland finally unravel this case, the murderer is confronted in a deadly encounter on the girders and high gantries above Waverley Station. This is an adaptation of an episode of the BBC series based around the Victorian detective James McLevy, developed for Radio 4 by David Ashton.",
