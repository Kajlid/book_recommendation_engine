  "description": "Surviving my mother's death was hard. Surviving the next four years in foster care was even harder. Surviving Blaze Abbott was going to be impossible.In my life there were three inexplicable truths: My world revolved around my job at House of Hope and the five foster boys who lived there, the past was like a ghost always lurking in the shadows, and fairy tales were a crock of sh*t. Then I met Blaze Abbottâ€”the tall, dark and dangerous owner of the brewery that one of my boys just set on fire. He ripped through the walls of my world and made himself a home. He pulled me close and became my shelter. I saw the light in him when all he felt was darkness. He made me feel like everything when I'd always been nothing. Until it all crumbled. With my job came certain obligations. Obligations that meant the boys came first, even if it meant lying to Blaze. Even if it meant risking my life for theirs. With Blaze's last name came great responsibility, incredible power and an ultimatum that would set our world on fire no matter what choice he made.  It was never a matter of if Blaze was going to break my heart. It was only a matter of when. Delaney Foster's Blaze is an intense, emotionally driven, steamy contemporary romance written in K. Bromberg's Driven Worlds project.",
