IN A BATHTUB???When Viveca Stanhope fled a scandalous past in San Francisco to make a new life for herself in Victorian Savannah, little did she know she'd be landing in a Southern Gothic version of Spook City. From the sexy ghost in her bathtub to the werewolf howling outside her window, Hangman's House is indeed a fright! And Viveca's Nightmare on Lost Lane comes complete with a half-crazed housekeeper, a mysterious houseboy with a fetish for knife-throwing and numerous other odd bedfellows.Still, Viveca is determined to find her place in Savannah society and pursue a prominent local clergyman. But two sexy rogues stand between her and her goals: the bawdy ghost of Alexander Fremont, haunted Savannah's answer to a rubber ducky; and Maxwell Beecher, Viveca's devilishly handsome, arrogant new neighbor, who deems himself the answer to her prayers. Both would know all her dark secrets; both would unmask the passions she struggles so hard to repress. Will one of them claim her heart and soul before she loses her mind?",
