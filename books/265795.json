  "description": "We set our scene in Damask: A kingdom that couldn't get ransacked if it tried...But now tha the king is dead, that's exactly what his brothers have in mind. All they need is a bad king to take his place. The population will rebel, the neighboring kingdom will be \"invited\" to restore order, and they'll be in business. . .Bad Prince Charlie will do. His reputation for \"badness\" preceds him, and everyone knows that he wouldn't spit on Damask to save it from drought. At the mention of Lady Cathering (Va-va-voom) Durace, he's in on the scheme.But his father's ghost has been skulking around the castle, and we all know that means trouble. If Charlie ever gets around to hearing the old man out, he may learn that his uncles' mildly sinister scheme is actually a bona fide evil plot. Ransacking Damask is just a cover for the real game:Weapons of Magical Destruction.",
