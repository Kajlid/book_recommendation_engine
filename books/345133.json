  "description": "One of the greatest gifts parents can give their children is the assurance that Mom and Dad love them just as they are, apart from anything that they do. But telling them once won't make it sink in. Kids need to be reminded of it over and over, until those words get inside their hearts. In the same way, children need to hear again and again that their Heavenly Father loves them and wants to spend time with them—even if they're not wonderfully talented or extremely smart or exceptionally popular. That message of God's unconditional acceptance and deep desire to enjoy a friendship with His children is at the heart of this book. Just the Way You Are , originally published by Crossway Books as Children of the King, has been newly illustrated to enchant a whole new generation of youngsters. At the same time, it gives parents and grandparents fresh opportunities to write God's never-changing desire on tender souls. Combining the warm narrative of best-selling author Max Lucado and the classic illustrations of award-winning artist Sergio Martinez, Just the Way You Are will entertain young readers as it teaches them a truth that can open their hearts to Christ. That truth—the assurance of God's delight in them—is a blessing that has eternal impact for all children of the King everywhere.",
