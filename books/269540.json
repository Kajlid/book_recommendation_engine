  "description": "Some girls don’t like pretty things.Some girls like things that are destructive, and toxic. Things that fuel our bodies with adrenaline and bring our demons to their knees. They say magic isn’t real, but it’s it the closest way to describe love? It doesn’t exist physically. It merely exists around us, within us, possessing our souls and making us do stupid shit. Shit like falling in love with a boy who knows how to rip my world apart and raise hell with a simple flick of his wrist. Their secrets are now mine. I’m not just in the middle of this game, I’m helping orchestrate it. Can the cries of my aching soul be enough to drown out the burning embers of my mistakes?The mind strengthens the heart, roughing the edges to prepare it for war. This is a war I will not win.This is a war of fate.𝑆ℎ𝑒’𝑠 𝑔𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘.𝑆ℎ𝑒’𝑠 𝑔𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑓𝑎𝑙𝑙.𝑆ℎ𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑒, 𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑓𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝐵𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠𝑛’𝑡 𝑎 𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑦 𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑒𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑛𝑜 𝑘𝑛𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡.𝐼’𝑙𝑙 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑓 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑙𝐴𝑛𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑒.𝑁𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡.𝑁𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡.𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠, 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑣𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡.𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠𝑛’𝑡 𝑎 𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑦-𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑒.𝐵𝑢𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑒𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝐵𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑡’𝑠 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛.𝑆ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ 𝑚𝑦 𝑣𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑠.𝑊ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑚𝑦 𝑓𝑙𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑇𝑢𝑔𝑠 𝑜𝑛 𝑚𝑦 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠𝐿𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝑎 𝑝𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑊𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑚𝑦 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑏𝑒 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑇𝑜 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑡𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑒𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑊𝑎𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑚𝑂𝑟 ℎ𝑖𝑚𝑂𝑟 𝑚𝑒𝐼𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 ℎ𝑎𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑 ℎ𝑒𝑟, 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑦.𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠𝑛’𝑡 𝑎 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑒.𝑇ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛’𝑡 𝑚𝑦 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑠𝐼𝑓 𝑠ℎ𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑒𝑠𝑛’𝑡 𝑜𝑏𝑒𝑦𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒’𝑠 𝑎 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟…86",
