  "description": "The Crown Princess of Zyria was born to wear the crown….but what if she wants more?My life was organised since birth until the carefully constructed plans exploded like a supernova. The lick of flames began when I decided to sacrifice myself for my planet and my people.Abducted into the stars I dreamed of, I have no choice but to embrace the part of me I have always hidden—the fighter, the warrior, and the imperfect, crass woman who doesn’t resemble the impeccable princess I am expected to be. Instead of using my silver tongue to fight my battles, I now hold true weapons, and for the first time since the crown was placed on my head, I feel whole.Evil is flooding the galaxy, and for some reason, destiny has chosen me to stop it. The only problem is, I don’t know how. Luckily, I meet some men along the way who are willing to follow me on this mission. If the king could see me now, draped in leather and wielding pistols and knives rather than wearing ballgowns and reading old scrolls, he would collapse onto his golden throne.Now, I fight my way across the cosmos to try and stop the destruction of everything we know.I was ready to give up my life, my future, and my body, but I never expected to lose my heart along the way.Stars, don’t let me fail now.Please Note: This book contains explicit content and darker elements, including mature language and violence. It is not intended for anyone under 18 years of age. Crown of Stars is a Reverse Harem read complete with a HEA.",
