With the atrocities at Three Zero still fresh in the public conscience, and dissident groups threatening the authority of the Union, this dangerous figurehead cannot be allowed to re-establish her terrorist networks.As the president invokes the controversial Indigo Protocol, recovery forces move into the territories of the maligned Kamdo regime. However, the blood lust of an ambitious commander promises to escalate tensions and destabilise the delicate peace held under the terms of the Cairo Accord. Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, scientist Pike Macey knows little of McGann. He has no idea that her escape will be devastating for his peaceful family life, and that he is just a pawn in the games of the politicians desperately clinging to power.The Cairo Accord is the first episode in the Hadrian’s Gate series. It introduces the reader to the author’s vision of the future, where the affluence and comforts of first world planets sit at odds with the struggles of frontier worlds. Lose yourself in a galaxy of gritty characters, some touched by love and hope, but many riddled with hate and fear.Look out for the next installment, Three Zero!",
