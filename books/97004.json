  "title": "Hello God Are You There?",
  "description": "In today's difficult time when we seem to be losing everything, have we lost God too? A sunrise...Are thoughts from yesterday bringing you down? A daffodil growing among rocks... Are obstacles blocking your way? A boulder tumbling out of control... Are you teetering on the edge? A cloudy sky... Are you lost in the shadows of others? A stagnant lake... Are you drowning in boredom? All around us nature is not only mirroring our lives; it is there to offer us its gifts: comfort, encouragement, strength, and wisdom. There is no cost, we only need to open our eyes and accept life's greatest gift; nature. Vickie Fisher lives on a nineteen acre farm in Westminster, MD. It was on this farm she was inspired to write this book. She enjoys spending time with her children and grandchildren, whom she believes are God's greatest gift. Vickie Fisher's HELLO GOD ARE YOU THERE? is page after page of inspiring words and photographs showing us how God uses nature to speak to us. A genuine treat for the eyes! (Best-selling author Loree Lough, author of nearly 100 award-winning books, including reader favorite A MAN OF HONOR.) The photographs and inspiring words of Vickie Fisher's HELLO GOD, ARE YOU THERE? filled my heart with joy and reminded me to look for the blessing of each day. (Susan Meier...bestselling Harlequin author of A FATHER FOR HER TRIPLETS)",
