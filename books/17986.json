  "description": "The saga of Amrie Emrys, daughter of the Pendragon House of King Arthur, continues in the third install-ment of Seeds Of Legend. Reeling from Arthur's death, made worse for knowing it would come, Amrie struggles to find her way as the world she has always known seems to fall apart around her. Her fears for kinsmen in battle, Merlin's health and his grief over Arthur's death, and the growing power of the dark goddess push Amrie to test her her skills of might and magic, in ways no one could foresee. Dark forces gather around the goddess Cailleach as she works her evil on the land, and a bloody war with the Eastern Empire sap the Isle of Britain. Seeking alliances with both Cerdic of the Saxon Shore and Ielfie, King of the Old Ones, the embattled Pendragon House struggles to rebuild after losing Arthur. Waging war with both the might of armies and the magics of faith and enchantment, Amrie and her family face foes unlike any ever seen before in Britain.",
