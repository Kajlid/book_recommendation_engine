  "description": "All in all it was a good day to die. If there really is such a thing. You hear characters in movies say that all the time, but does anyone really believe the words “good” and “die” belong in the same sentence?Still, it could have been worse. It could have been dark and spooky night instead of a beautiful Georgia morning in late October, with a light wind whipping across the Peachtree High School football field, making zombies seem like the last thing anyone needed to worry about…Fifteen-year-old freshman, Karen Vera, is well on her way to ruling her school when a freak cheer leading accident turns her into, well, a freak. Much to her Horror and Dismay, Karen learns she is a genetic mutation, one of the Death Challenged--a politically correct term for a zombie!Now she has to go to a top secret zombie school, eat brains for lunch, and take courses with names like \"Secrets of Successful Morticians and their Uses for the Undead: Foundation and Beyond\". And to make matters worse, her roommate is the most reviled girl at DEAD High, a complete head case, and maybe...a murderer.Can Karen find out who's offing the nearly un-off-able Undead before she becomes the next victim? Can she convince the super-cute captain of the swim team that a girl can have a pathological love for pink and still carry on an intelligent conversation? Will she ever pass remedial Algebra for the Death Challenged?",
