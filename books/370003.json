As if that's not enough, hottie Dominic Bianco is showing more than a little interest in her. Even her impending motherhood doesn't seem to faze him. In fact, he's acting as tender and protective as if she were carrying his baby.But something seems to be keeping Dom from fully committing to her. If Lucy could only know what it is, she might understand. Or maybe she'd tell him it doesn't matter. Because she knows he's a good man and he'd make an ideal father.",
