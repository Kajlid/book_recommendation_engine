  "description": "Dear The Underground Guardians was originally published through Ellora’s Cave many years ago. As time passed, though readers asked for the next book in the series, I knew that there were things I should have done differently, that I wanted to do differently. More time passed, and this series stuck with me. I WANTED to write more stories. So finally, I sat down and said – how do I write more? How do I get from where I started to where I want to go? There was only one option. A spinoff series. So I wrote a new series -- THE ZODIUS series -- which debuts in May 2011 with Sourcebooks Casablanca with the book THE LEGEND OF MICHAEL. But these books – The Underground Guardians – inspired the Zodius series. Without them, the Zodius series would never have taken form. So here is a look into the young writer’s vision into a world that later became the more mature writer’s world. You will actually meet my inspiration for the Zodius version of Michael (LEGEND OF MICHAEL) in this book. In fact, there will be many things in the Zodius series that you will find familiar to the Underground Guardians series, but you will also find many things very different. I hope this free look into the world of the Underground Guardians will intrigue you enough to make you want to read the Zodius series, starting with LEGEND OF MICHAEL. Thank you for your support!
