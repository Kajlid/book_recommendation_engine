Even a well rounded, educated, successful CEO at a Fortune 500 company, has trouble with the answer. Over the years, she has faced the challenges of lies, cheating, and heartbreak, from the men she believed, loved her.

Three men will cross her path, all who have confessed their love for her and is willing to do anything to be with her. Treating love like a business deal, she realizes the wall she has built has become more of a problem than a defense.

The only thing that is saving her from a nervous breakdown is the fact that all three men live in other states. It is then she discovers that her rules restrict her from the genuine love; she is seeking. Is it possible to love three men at the same time? Or will her complicated situation cause her to give up her quest for happiness?",
