  "description": "When I went into cryosleep on the way from Mars to Earth, I never expected to wake up in a cage.When our captor’s ship crashes on an ice world, I’m rescued by a fierce Mosauran Dragon warrior.He and his people are stranded here too, along with several other races—all of them enemies and each of them dangerous.Markus is the Commander of his people, and his species is one of the most feared in the galaxy.He claims that I’m his fated one—his Ashaya.He’s fiercely protective and possessive of me, and I cannot deny that I’m drawn to him in ways I don’t understand.The more time we spend together, I begin to wonder: what would it be like to be fated to a dragon?",
