  "description": "Fleet Commander Alden Slater came to Gothon to recuperate and found himself on the side of a minority . in a full-scale civil rights battle. All he did was come to the defense of a pretty girl named Aldatha Te - who happened to be a colly. And collys, the original human settlers of Gothon and worshipers of a god called Dromm, had always been treated as slaves by the Terran representatives. Slater learned, soon enough, that he was making powerful enemies in the monolithic Interplanetary Development Corp. who \"ruled\" Gothon, and wanted lands that the collys held sacred to Dromm. But he couldn't understand why so much fuss was being made - until he discovered that more than racial prejudice was involved, and Dromm was more than a myth.",
