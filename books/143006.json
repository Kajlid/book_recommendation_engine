  "title": "Memories of a Trip to Sicily",
  "description": "A timeless description of the beautiful island of Sicily by one of the great writers of Italy. After forty years Edmondo De Amicis returns to Sicily for a grand tour of the island. Keen observer of both places and people, De Amicis gives us flowing accounts of its landscapes, history, and people. At each point in the journey, Messina, Palermo, the interior, the coastlines, Catania, Syracuse, and Taormina, he combines social and historical information with just enough detail to make you feel as though you are his traveling companion. Filled with rich metaphors, you will smell the fresh Sicilian air, feel the Sicilian sun on your face, and hear the Sicilian chatter on the busy streets. Step back in time and tour the island as it was in 1908 with a master narrator as your guide.",
