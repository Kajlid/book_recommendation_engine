  "description": "Andraste, the daughter of an elfin prince and fairy queen is Fate's Beloved, blessed with an incredible prophecy naming her as the one who can vanquish the Abatu Empire. She has spent her life preparing for the day when she would leave her homeland and fulfill her destiny. That day has come, but there are a few things Andraste doesn't know. Her prophecy is a carefully-constructed lie, and beneath the beauty and civilization of her mother's fairy country, there lie ancient prejudices and secrets. Traitors live within the castle walls, but Andraste can't help but wonder who's the vampire empress conquering the world, or the deceitful fairies she's fighting to save.",
