  "description": "When Beth Michaels hightailed it out of the hole-in-the-road town she grew up in, she only had two goals. One—get as far away as quickly as possible, and two—never set foot in her parent’s home again. But when she receives a heart breaking call from her childhood best friend, Jen, she has no choice but to turn her ’56 Ford pickup back in the direction of Salem, Missouri to attend a funeral.There’s a new local in town when Beth arrives, and suddenly, it ain’t all that easy for her to remember her rules for dating.#1. Cookie-cutter-perfect guys ain’t her type.#2. Tie wearin’ and church frequentin’ is an automatic dismissal.#3. Most importantly, never date anyone from small minded, conservative, Bible-thumping towns like Salem.Unfortunately, Matthew Wright breaks all her rules and then some.Matt might be from a small town and have small town values, but that doesn’t mean he fits into a little slot of Beth’s preconceived notions. After all, ever so often good guys are good. Now if he could just convince Beth to let go of her past and give him a chance, he’s pretty sure there’s a whole lotta sweet under that prickly exterior.His own … Sweet Contradiction.",
