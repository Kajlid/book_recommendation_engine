  "title": "Marquis de Sade: The Genius of Passion",
  "description": "Among the numerous works on the Marquis de Sade, Ronald Hayman's revealing biography is one of the few that presents the reader with an idea of the real de Sade--the man rather than the monster. Hayman has immersed himself in the true character of this widely misunderstood man, excelling where few others have in dealing with de Sade with sympathy. This work is a much needed antidote to the general misconceptions surrounding de Sade and his life.",
