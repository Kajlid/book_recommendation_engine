  "description": "It is after the hour of prayer but not yet the hour of money. Istanbul, Queen of Cities, wakes with a shout.The explosion goes almost unnoticed in the greater roar of the waking city. A flat crack. Then silence.In the sleepy Istanbul district of Eskikay stands the former whirling dervish house of Adem Dede. Over the space of five days of an Istanbul heat wave, these lives weave a story of corporate wheeling and dealing, Islamic mysticism, political and economic intrigue, ancient Ottoman mysteries, a terrifying new terrorist threat, and a nanotechnology with the potential to transform every human on the planet",
