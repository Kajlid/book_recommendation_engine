Into a small garrison town comes Captain Richard Fortune, a political officer tasked with investigating rumors of sedition at the court of the local potentate, Nana Sahib. While stories of mutinying garrisons multiply, the British residents refuse to believe their loyal native troops could turn against them. Worming his way into Nana's confidence, Fortune falls for and recruits Shobha, a dancing girl in the household. Together they begin to uncover the conspiracy against the Company, but will they be in time to stop a mutiny?",
