  "description": "Book 5 of Song of Acadia. In their own incomparable style, Janette Oke and T. Davis Bunn paint a portrait both lavish and poignant of the colorful, chaotic world of the American Revolution, where danger is rife and political views run deep. And once drawn into that world, readers will be reluctant to reemerge until the last triumphant chapter has drawn to a close. Learning of their beloved father's precariously ill health, Anne and Nicole make separate plans to visit him in Georgetown, in spite of the dangerous instability of the times. Nicole travels from Massachussetts with her fianc√©, while Anne and her husband must brave an arduous transatlantic crossing from England. But the hazards of travel are not to be compared to the events or struggles with which each of these \"sisters of the heart\" must ultimately come to terms.",
