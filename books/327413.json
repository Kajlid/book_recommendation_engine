  "description": "ReaganIt was meant to be a date of convenience. I received an all-expenses paid trip to Italy in exchange for signing one hell of a non-disclosure agreement. Ty Landon, drummer in the chart-breaking rock band Scarlet Shadow, needed a wedding date and made me an offer too good to refuse.But it turned out that I signed my heart away when I signed that contract. There was something about Ty that made every single warning bell go off inside my body like a fire alarm. I welcomed the heat, despite knowing that this little arrangement of ours had an expiration date. Pity that neither of us believed in fairy tales. TyI was taken with Reagan from the moment we met, but I wasn’t a believer in relationships or love. Whatever this was, I convinced myself that it couldn’t be more than just physical attraction. But somehow, she crawled under my skin and she lingered.I was trying to break free from my past. The last thing I expected was to meet my destiny. She made me change every rule, and I started believing again. But that was my mistake because it turned out that I was always destined to break her wings.",
