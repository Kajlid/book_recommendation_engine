  "title": "The Great Brain at the Academy",
  "description": "Everyone knew that Tom Fitzgerald, alias The  Great Brain, would get into trouble when he went off  to school at the strict Catholic Academy for Boys  in Salt Lake City. But no one--including Tom--knew  just how much. His tongue got him into fifteen  demerits worth of difficulty the very first day, but  his great brain refused to be defeated as Tom set  out to outwit the eighth grade, the  superintendent, and finally the bishop of the state of Utah.  Whether it's running an illegal candy store or  earning a reputation as the fastest potato peeler in the  world or introducing the newfangled sport of  basketball at the academy, Tom's great brain never  falters. And his money-making schemes rise to new  heights--or depths--faced with the challenge of  rigorous boarding-school life.",
