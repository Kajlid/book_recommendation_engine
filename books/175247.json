  "description": "Everything changed the moment he found her… Cal Remus is in love. But the object of his affection barely acknowledges his existence. Worse: She acts like he’s the dirt sticking to the bottom of her shoe. Weaker men might give up. But not Cal. Hell no, he loves a good challenge and Ariana Skyee has made this the most intriguing challenge of all. Having read his father’s confidential military files, Cal should be concerned about the seemingly fragile new world order on Planet Novo and the events back on Earth. But he’s distracted. Securing Arianas love is his number one priority. He’s going to win her heart, or die trying. *** Special note from the author:This short story is narrated solely from Cal Remus’ point of view, and it depicts the events leading up to the introduction of ‘The Calling.’ That is; the events that pre-date True Calling, Book 1 in the series. This can be read as a stand-alone story. However, if you are planning on reading the True Calling series, I recommend that you read the titles in the following sequence: True Calling – Book 1 Lovestruck – Short Story Beyond Reach – Book 2 Light of a Thousand Stars – Novella Destiny Rising – Book 3.",
