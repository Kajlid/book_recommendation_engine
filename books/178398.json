  "description": "Caz hasn't been outside in nine years, not since a poisonous star locked the world in ice and destroyed all life. No birds, no beasts, no nothing. One small pocket of humanity survived in a department store, but food is running short and tensions are running high. Caz takes her chances outside, along with her friend Will, hoping against hope that they're not the last ones left. A punchy dystopian read particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant and dyslexic readers aged 12+",
