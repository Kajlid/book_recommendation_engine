  "description": "Jason is not the kind of guy you would want to take home to Mom. He’s foul tempered, a bit of a womaniser and has a conscience that has been collecting dust for years. All that is shaken up when he unearths a package of carefully preserved love letters and a portrait while diving off the coast of Africa. So many unanswered questions, the letters snag something inside of him. Intrigued despite himself, he begins to unravel the mystery caught up in pages. He finds himself tangled up in the life of a woman he’s never met... a woman who is in desperate trouble.",
