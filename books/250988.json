This leads him to Stonewall, where he meets Zane for the first time and instantly feels himself falling for the mysterious and stone-cut detective.

When fate insists on pushing them together, Zane and Enzo give in and start exploring their feelings. They’ll need to balance their budding relationship with the stress of Enzo’s case, which takes them both on a twisting journey toward the truth, all while a bigger threat looms on the horizon. _______________  A Hard Call is the first book in the Stonewall Investigations series.
