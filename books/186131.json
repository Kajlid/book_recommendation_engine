  "title": "Playing for Keeps",
  "description": "Living in LA and dating celebrities wasn't what it was cracked up to be. I found out the hard way many had a lifestyle I wanted no part of. Then David Taylor forced his way into my life. A sledge hammer breaking down my well crafted walls. He was gorgeous and sexy and intimidating. I was drawn to him in a way I had never been to anyone or anything. And I knew I couldn't have him, I was too damaged, too flawed to really connect. David saw what I was from the beginning. A broken scared girl locked away inside an aloof woman. And he was determined to free me. To make me his. WARNING: THIS IS AN EROTIC NOVEL. If you do NOT like dominant, possessive, very Alpha-males, Playing for Keeps is not for you.",
