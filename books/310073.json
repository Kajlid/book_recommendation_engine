They’re excellent for that.Vampires are demanding, arrogant and too focused on mating. I realize this sounds odd, considering I’m a vampire, but I like to explore. I need my freedom. Even if it means staying in this hellish situation orchestrated by my father.But lately, there’s a bright spot. My senses are pulling me toward a delicious human doctor. I don’t know what it is about him, but I’m intrigued. In a way that I haven’t been in a very long time… if ever.",
