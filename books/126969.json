  "description": "What happens when the fairy tale ends before it even begins? Three years, two graduations, an engagement and a move to another, Emogen and Ryan are more in love than ever. He’s the one man she never expected to have and the only man she’s determined to keep. He’s her forever, and there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for him. Almost, that is. Ryan announces that he’s accepted a job offer that requires yet another move. Angry he didn’t discuss his decision with her first, Emogen refuses to pack up and follow. She has a career, too, and she’s not ready to give it up. Although determined to make the long distance thing work, their lives and careers begin to take a toll on the relationship, leaving them to wonder if they’re doing the right thing. Sometimes love isn’t enough. When you lose the one thing you are certain of, will you fight to get it back? Or will you let it go?",
