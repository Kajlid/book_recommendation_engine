  "title": "Doctor Who: Timeframe - The Illustrated History",
  "description": "To celebrate 30 years of Doctor Who TV programme, and 20 years of the novelizations, this book takes a look back at the history of both through a collection of book cover art, reproduced as poster-sized prints. It is also illustrated with photographs, artwork and merchandize connected with the cult programme. After a short summary of each decade of the series, there is a four-page feature on each season. This includes two full-page reproductions, a photograph from each series of the season, and a short history of the Doctor's travels. Favourite scenes are illustrated with photographs and text extracts from the books, and Doctor Who exhibitions, plays and press coverage are also covered in text and illustrations.",
