  "description": "The contract says I have to get fake-married to a Witlocke. It doesn't say which Witlocke. Apparently, any stuck-up jerk whose last name begins with W and ends with E will do. Oops, was that my out loud voice?Enter my nemesis, sinfully sexy tech mogul Donovan. We’ve been mortal enemies since third grade, but he’s all too willing to meet me at the altar, for reasons he refuses to share with me. Whatever he's planning for me, it can’t be good. The last time I saw him is when my family let loose a bunch of attack geese at his sister’s wedding. And he’s only gotten hotter – and grumpier - since then.Deep breaths. I can do this. Sign on the dotted line, and I’ll save my aunt’s vineyard. We just have to stay married until the end of the summer.But a lot can happen in a summer.A dropped towel can lead to unexpected consequences. Snarky sparring can end in steamy kissing. Hidden truths can be revealed under an ancient oak tree. Hearts can melt. And someone can fall in love with the last man on earth who’d want ‘forever’. Wait, that wasn’t in the contract…",
