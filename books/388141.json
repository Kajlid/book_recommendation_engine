  "description": "Monster bones. They were the stuff of Indian legend, which warned that they must not be disturbed. But lovely, golden-haired Dayanara and her father were on a mission for the Smithsonian Institute to track down the mysterious bones and uncover them, despite the danger. Not even her father's untimely death or a disapproving and disturbingly handsome Indian chief could prevent Dayanara from exploring the untamed Cree lands west of the Missouri River and proving her worth as an archaeologist. Forbidden. Any relationship between a Cree chief and a white woman was prohibited by both their peoples, but the golden woman of Quick Fox's dreams was more glorious than the setting sun. How could he deny himself her bright beauty, her soft warmth? Not even her interest in the sacred burial grounds of his people could prevent him from discovering the delights they would know together and proving his SAVAGE LOVE.",
