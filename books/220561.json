  "description": "“***** Five Stars! Sarah’s Landing1 (Contact) is a work of pure imagination. This sci-fi tale is a perfect blend of fantasy, mystery, and romance working together in a most seductive way. The peaceful setting of this New England coastal village is anything but what it seems. Dark forces are at work breaking down the barriers of two separate worlds. All the elements of a wondrous tale are here as Elena keeps the reader in suspense from beginning to end. I can’t wait to read book II.” —Sandy Bernstein, Sour Grapes Magazine",
