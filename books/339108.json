  "title": "The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution",
  "description": "Charles Darwin, whose 1859 masterpiece \"On the Origin of Species\" shook society to its core, would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy over evolution still raging 150 years later.\"The Greatest Show on Earth\" is a stunning counter-attack on creationists, followers of \"Intelligent Design\" and all those who still question evolution as scientific fact. In this brilliant tour de force, Richard Dawkins pulls together the incontrovertible evidence that underpins it: from living examples of natural selection to clues in the fossil record; from plate tectonics to molecular genetics.\"The Greatest Show on Earth\" comes at a critical time as systematic opposition to the fact of evolution flourishes as never before in many schools worldwide. Dawkins wields a devastating argument against this ignorance whilst sharing with us his palpable love of science and the natural world. Written with elegance, wit and passion, it is hard-hitting, absorbing and totally convincing.",
