  "title": "Humpty Dumpty was Pushed: A Novel",
  "description": "In this novel, the unspoken truth is it’s a dog-eat-dog world. There are no accidents, and there’s a reason for everything that happens. Humpty Dumpty was pushed. The victim is a mesomorphic doorman. He lays stretched out on the parking lot pavement just a few yards from the nightclub where he worked.On the case is a brilliant, troubled eccentric, media-darling-cop Sal Messina, aka Black Sallie Blue Eyes—“so smooth he can take your socks off without touching your shoes.” Sal’s investigation leads from the wealthy lairs of Manhattan to the manicured estates in the Hamptons to the PJs in Queens and places beyond. Like the immigrant communities of the Boogie Down Bronx inhabited by fierce survivors of ethnic wars. It’s a wild ride through a vast craven underbelly of society that takes its toll on both the detective’s personal and professional life. Before this case, the detective thought he had seen it all. But this time, what’s coming is way beyond the officer's range of vision.",
