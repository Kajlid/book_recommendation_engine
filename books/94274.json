  "description": "We all must take responsibility for our choices, and be prepared for the consequences. But what if the consequences affect someone else? Trent is growing up and he desperately wants to know his father. His mother does not know what to tell him, since he was the product of a one night stand. When Trent starts acting out and getting into trouble, his mother makes a promise to try to find the man who fathered him. The search ends with a life changing event, and many people are affected, including Lindy and Ricky DeCelli. Lindy (Riley, then) had suffered Nelson's brutal attack as a teen (\"Choices\"); and then both Lindy and Ricky went through hell when their daughter was kidnapped by Nelson (\"The Bushes are Red\"). Nelson paid the consequences for the first crime and is now paying for the kidnapping. Unfortunately, Trent is, too. First there were choices to be made, and then came the consequences that lead to the next generation.",
