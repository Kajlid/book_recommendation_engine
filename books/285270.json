  "title": "Panda Not Dragon: Why the Rise of China is Not a Threat",
  "description": "\"Spellbinding reading that starts with explaining 'traditional' Xenophobia and Sinophobia in the West and opens up on a veritable encyclopedia of China's strengths, challenges, aspirations, and dreams. It brings as much light into the opaqueness of Chinese politics as a young scholar who loves his country and people could marshal without falling foul of the guardians of political correctness. A compact introduction to China in the era of intercontinental competition! \"--- Former German Ambassador to North Korea, Delegate to the United Nations, Dr. Friedrich LohrA conflict seems imminent. In this eye-opening book, Yuan boldly challenges the concept that the rise of China is a formidable threat to the rest of the world. The author argues that the rise of China is rather peaceful as a panda, and it is certainly not a fire-breathing dragon. The first chapter demonstrates the history and psychology behind the concept of Sinophobia, explaining why people would automatically assume the rise of China is a threat. The following two chapters explain why China does not have the capacity to become a threat even if the country wants to, providing a detailed look at the real situation of the Chinese military and economy --- weak and unstable. The final chapter of the book presents the benefits brought by the rise of China. As the rivalry between China and the US begins, this book takes the reader on a journey to understand the real China.",
