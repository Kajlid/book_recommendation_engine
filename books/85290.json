  "description": "Detective Aaron Sanders' abilities and fortitude are put to the test when he investigates a brutal double-homicide where a boy's parents are found mutilated inside their home. The boy is the only witness to the crime and his clothes are stained with his parents' blood. His clothes are also tainted with the blood of other victims from a separate and even more horrific crime scene at a nearby cemetery. All of the victims appear to have been killed in the same manner and the boy knows the true identity of the evil responsible for the multiple deaths, but he is unwilling to talk. No one would believe him. A threat on the boy's life and a disturbing nightmare causes Detective Sanders to question his beliefs and his own sanity. This investigation ultimately leads Sanders in a fight to save himself and the life of an orphaned boy from an unimaginable evil that is spawned from the curse of the devil's nightmare.",
