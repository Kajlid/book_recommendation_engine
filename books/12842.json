  "description": "He wanted to be treated like a man, not a child.Every summer the men of the Chavez family go on a long and difficult sheep drive to the mountains. All the men, that is, except for Miguel. All year long, twelve-year-old Miguel tries to prove that he, too, is up to the challenge--that he, too is ready to take the sheep into his beloved Sangre de Cristo Mountains.When his deeds go unnoticed, he prays to San Ysidro, the saint for farmers everywhere. And his prayer is answered . . . but with devastating consequences.When you act like an adult but get treated like a child, what else can you do but keep your wishes secret and pray that they'll come true.Cover illustration by Chris MilesInterior illustrations by Jean Charlot",
