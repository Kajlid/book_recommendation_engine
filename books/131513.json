  "title": "Transgressive Adventures in Erotica",
  "description": "These are stories about loving couples who are seeking out that transgressive spark to reignite the desire between them. The women do this by granting strange men access to their sexuality, which is normally reserved for their husband or boyfriend. They are breaking the rules and bringing novelty and mystery back into their stable, predictable relationships. They are shaking things up and renewing themselves as objects of desire.The first section is about dominant women who are confidently journeying into unexplored erotic territory with new men. The second section is about women who are pursued and submit to the aggression of other men, recognizing that their misconduct will help their own husband or boyfriend see them with new eyes. The third section is comprised of some older, shorter pieces that are punchier and jump right into the action.Some of the fantasies explored in this collection include:- A woman strips for her boyfriend's buddies, demanding that they honestly rate her body.- A wife goes back into the bar to perform oral favors for a jerk who just fought with her husband.- A husband comes home late from work to find his wife drinking with his friends, dressed only in her skimpy lingerie.- An aggressive man talks a couple he just met in a coffee shop into letting the wife come back to his studio to sit for a nude portrait.- A rough jock crashes a geeky board game party and takes liberties with the giggling, bespectacled wife of a nervous nerd.There are 20 stories in all.Note: Some of these stories had previously been posted on Gustav’s blogs, but they have all been removed. Feel free to preview this title to get sense of the writing style. See Gustav’s author page for more information.",
