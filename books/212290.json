Kester's lethally gorgeous, and he's come with a terrifying message: Ursula owes her soul to a demon. No one seems to care that she doesn't remember striking that deal.

Along the way, she must reclaim her magical knowledge and her long-forgotten skills with the blade if she wants to escape eternal damnation.",
