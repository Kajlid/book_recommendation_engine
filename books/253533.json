Small-town New Zealand moves so much slower - and her world has changed so completely that it seems as though she's only wasting time.Since time immemorial, two forces have been locked in endless conflict: Life and Death. When Frankie Bounds inherits the powers of Life’s chosen, she must defeat Death’s generals in order to face the reaper itself, or die trying and pass on the powers to the next in line.Frankie Bounds hates every minute of it.Now, with the second of Death's generals breathing down her neck, Frankie has to balance her responsibilities as the chosen one with her simple, petty desire not to see her friends burned to ash.A free episodic, 12-installment queer supernatural fiction series about a small coastal New Zealand town, its scars, and the supernatural forces that gather around its protector - Frankie Bounds.
