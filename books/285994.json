  "description": "We're burning from within....I’m in trouble. My mate, Iain, thinks I betrayed him. That's because I did--using a love potion to control him so that he'd save my people. But now, it's stopped working, and there's nothing left but his anger. He's not the only one pissed off at me. My Court knows that I’ve lost the sacred Soul Stone of our people, putting everyone in danger.When the Royal Guard comes for me with a pair of fire manacles, I’m not surprised. But when my estranged mate, king of the Sea Fae, strolls into the Court of Fire to help me…. Well, that bit is unexpected.I’m in no position to turn down help, even if my mate is hardly speaking to me. If we don’t recover the Soul Stone soon, all of my people will burn from within. I just don't want to completely fall for Iain. But as we go deep into enemy territory, the desire between us becomes impossible to resist. And if I can’t fight it, he’ll never let me go.",
