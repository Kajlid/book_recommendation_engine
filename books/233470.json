  "description": "A gritty mystery featuring an ex-military PI in coastal South Carolina, by an author who “nails the voice of new Southern noir” (Hank Phillippi Ryan, Mary Higgins Clark Award–winning author of Trust Me).   Lowcountry private investigator Blu Carraway needs a new client. He’s completely broke and the tax man is coming for his little slice of paradise.   Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates his skills. Some call him a loose cannon. Others say he’s a liability. All the ex-Desert Storm Ranger knows is his phone hasn’t rung in quite a while.   Of course, that could be because it was cut off due to delinquent payments.   Lucky for him, a client does show up at his doorstep—a distraught mother with a wayward son. She’s rich and her boy’s in danger.
