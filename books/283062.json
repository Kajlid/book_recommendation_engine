  "title": "The Road Rage Vigilante",
  "description": "Three victims have been found, all killed in the same manner. Drowned when their cars were submerged in the Sacramento River. The killer’s trademark is an obscene word written on the side of each victim’s car. The police have few clues, but the victims all have one thing in they were aggressive, inconsiderate, mean drivers. They paid the ultimate price. When the vigilante is classified as a serial killer, the FBI steps in to help. Now the vigilante has another victim in his sights. Kevin is basically a nice guy, except when he gets behind the wheel. Can they find the killer and stop him before he claims his next victim and leaves his children without a father? Amazon Charts bestselling author JJ West brings you a gripping tale that will keep you turning pages to find out who lives and who dies. Includes strong language and violent scenes intended for adult readers.",
