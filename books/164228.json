  "title": "9/11 Contradictions: An Open Letter to Congress and the Press",
  "description": "In 9/11 Contradictions, David Ray Griffin shows that the official story of what happened on 9/11 is riddled with internal contradictions. Since two contradictory statements cannot both be true, it is clear that individuals and agencies articulating the official story of 9/11 have made many false statements. Congress and the press must ask which of these contradictory statements are false and why they were made.This book simply lays out the fact that these contradictions exist; it contains no theory. Therefore, politicians and journalists who deal with the issues raised herein will not be giving credence to some \"conspiracy theory\" about 9/11. They will simply be carrying out their duty to ask why the official story of 9/11 - arguably the most fateful event of our time - does not stand up to examination.",
