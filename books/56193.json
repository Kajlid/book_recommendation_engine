  "description": "A world has fallen. A world is falling. An illiterate scholar - The Keys - and a former priest - The Lantern - climb to the roof of a dying world to reclaim their names. The megastructure that was once their home, and their prison, lies in a state of ruin that is overshadowed only by its enormity. The task before them is vague, concocted in a smoke-drunken haze, but the fruit that it will bear tempts them with all the sweetness of vengeance, marrow, and lust.",
