When Rowan learns her new neighbor is Jensen Lund, the smoking-hot tight end who takes being neighborly to a whole new level, she’s grateful for the team’s strict “no fraternization” policy because the sexy man defines temptation.    But Jensen is intent on rushing straight to the goal line to prove to Rowan he’s much more than just a player…on and off the field.",
