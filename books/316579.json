  "description": "A love story you can live in…ZachBrady is my overprotective best friend, and I love him like this. He’s so much bigger than me and makes me feel safe. We are opposites in so many ways, but when I’m cuddled up against him and he reads to me, all those differences fade away. Brady promises to be friends forever, but what will he say when he finds out my secret? Will I lose my best friend and the boy I love more than life itself?BradyZach is so tiny and tenderhearted. All I want to do is protect him from the world. He’s my sweet bookworm and never wants to hurt anyone. I love my best friend, but how do I give him all of me when I don’t understand myself yet? If nothing else, I can shower him with all the acceptance and love he deserves.Zach and Brady come from completely different social and religious backgrounds, but they don’t let that weaken their friendship. Both teens have to go through a journey of self-discovery, including all the heartaches and joys that come with growing up. As they get older, will they find themselves and how they fit together? You’re My Home is a sweet and emotional coming of age story. It’s a slow-burn, hurt/comfort, teen best friends to adult lovers romance. There will be tears, laughter, new friends, and steamy lovemaking as Zach and Brady learn the meaning of true acceptance of oneself and others. **Trigger warnings: domestic violence, trauma, PTSD, and religious homophobia.",
