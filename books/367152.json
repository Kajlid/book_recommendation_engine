  "title": "The New Book of Forms: A Handbook of Poetics",
  "description": "The New Book of Forms contains over three hundred verse forms, each succinctly described in prose and, where necessary, with a schematic diagram. Many entries are followed by examples drawn from modern English poems that use the form and by references to well-known poems written in it. Each entry ends with complete cross-references so that readers can discover relationships and similarities among many of the forms. What makes The New Book of Forms more than just an encyclopedia of verse structure, though, is the opening section called \"a handbook of poetics.\" This surveys the two modes of writing - prose and verse - and discusses various prosodic and metrical systems. Although the accent is on the forms of poetry, this book in fact contains all the information essential to a study of poetics from the Middle Ages to the present.",
