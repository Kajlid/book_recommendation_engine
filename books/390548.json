  "description": "One hot cowboy plus one tough rancher-girl adds up to trouble! Kiersten Day holds a grudge against all things Texan, especially cattle baron CJ Howell, with his hubcap-sized belt buckle and tacky white hat. He's set his sights on her tiny Colorado ranch, and he's a master of dirty tactics, slinging threats to make her sell out. Caught in the fight of her life, Kiersten meets Cleve, a tall, handsome good guy. Too late, she finds out he's Howell's son. She might be pregnant, she doesn't know who to trust, and danger is closing in. She's head over heels -- and kicking herself! Content warning, a hot cowboy, dirty tactics and lots of lone star trouble.",
