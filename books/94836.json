  "title": "The Great British Bake Off: Everyday",
  "description": "This book is for the baker who wants to whip up a cake for an office party, a traybake for a kid’s birthday, or a pudding to follow a simple supper. Using straightforward, easy-to-follow techniques, there are foolproof recipes for cakes, traybakes, bread, biscuits, tarts, pies, puddings, and desserts. If you are a confident baker or ready to move onto the next stage, each chapter also showcases the best recipes from the series, including Mary and Paul's Signature Bakes, Technical Challenges and Showstoppers, plus the best bakers' recipes from series four. There are step-by-step photographs to guide you through the more complicated techniques and beautiful photography throughout, making this the perfect gift for all bakers. As usual, everyone who buys the book will be able to download the digital booklet of finalist recipes after the finale has transmitted in October. And as a thank you to every one who has bought the previous  Great British Bake Off  books, we will be featuring snaps of some of the best home-bakes, sent in by readers, on the endpapers of the book.",
