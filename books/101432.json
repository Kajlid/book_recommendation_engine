  "title": "Miracle Belle, A Horse with a Secret",
  "description": "Note: Originally published in Twisted Vine: An Anthology of Short Stories and Poems. Because the story would appeal to a youngster rather than the adult stories in the anthology it was published separately.This is my best seller.Belle is the first horse created by Trisha's scientist father after all the horses in the world vanished. Belle spent her life as a research object, but was loved by Trisha who knew her secret. After Belle's last surgery Trisha thought her best friend lost her abilities, so she complied with her father's wishes and went off to boarding school. The friends didn't see each other again until Trisha was grown and Belle was old. They rediscovered their friendship and found a special place to share, along with new marvelous discoveries.",
