  "title": "Rorke's Drift",
  "description": "The defence of Rorke's Drift has gone down in history as one of the grandest heroic actions of British colonial wars. About a hundred men defeated an enemy force 30 or 40 times their size, and 11 of the defenders were awarded Britain's highest military decoration, the Victoria Cross. The action has been immortalized in the film \"Zulu\". Michael Glover shows how this undoubted act of bravery was exploited for political ends, and why an event of little military consequence found its way into the \"National Hagiography of Battles\".",
