  "description": "Zombies VS Bikers This book contains two great stories about Zombies battling with Bikers and other groups in a Post Apocalyptic world.  The Dead Jesters are an aptly named motorcycle club with only ten or so members left at the time of our story which is about seven months after the green light bathing the Earth brought the dead crawling back to life as zombies. The group has been travelling across America on their Harleys taking what they need but keeping a good pace because of the rumored salvation in a small seaside town in southern Florida. The Jesters must kill zombies and fight off other humans along the way. The rumor is that a mass exodus will be taking place featuring hundreds of ships. Weâ€™re talking boats of any kind, loaded with supplies, hoping to find a way to survive on the sea while the zombies continue to decompose and die off since a large chunk of the living population will be off the country and unavailable as zombie food.  The Eight Horsemen This is a very tough and well armed biker gang that battles hundreds of zombies along side with another town of survivors. They fight hard and party even harder while trying to find refuge in a zombie infested America.",
