  "description": "Life If a dragon tells you to jump, just do it. Jami Raye doesn't believe in fate or fairy tales. She's got voices in her head taunting her, a possible stalker (or a really bad case of paranoia), and she's just lost her third client to a drug overdose this month. So she definitely doesn't need a hot, Russian gazillionaire trying to convince her she can help him solve a murder. Nope. She just needs some sleep. And maybe an intervention. She hears him out anyway and things get really crazy from there.Half-human and half-dragon, Maxim Drago wants nothing to do with other shifters. Until his unquenchable thirst for control and power hits a tragic road block that brings him face to face with his fate, a sexy, but haunted drug counselor who may hold the key to finally unlocking the uncontrollable violence inside him.When a killer targets the mate he didn't know he wanted, Drago will do anything to protect her...One woman can melt a dragon's cold heart. If they can survive the firestorm.\"OMG OMG this book is fantastic.\" Ingrid, Goodreads\"This is one book that will keep you up until it is finished. This story is full of intrigue, secrets and above all the trust that bonds two people together.\" Sharon, Goodreads",
