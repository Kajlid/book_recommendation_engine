  "description": "Replete with whimsical mechanical wonders and charmingly anachronistic settings, this pioneering anthology gathers a brilliant blend of fantastical stories. Steampunk originates in the romantic elegance of the Victorian era and blends in modern scientific advancesâ€”synthesizing imaginative technologies such as steam-driven robots, analog supercomputers, and ultramodern dirigibles. The elegant allure of this popular new genre is represented in this rich collection by distinctively talented authors, including:Content\"Introduction: The 19th Century Roots of Steampunk\" by Jess Nevins\"Benediction: Excerpt from The Warlord of the Air\" by Michael Moorcock\"Lord Kelvin's Machine\" by James P.
