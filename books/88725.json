  "description": "The crash was no accident. Fate carried Brady and his airplane to the isolated island where Karis was banished to live alone. She feared the worst as she sifted through the wreckage, sure that no one could survive. But there he was, barely breathing yet still alive. The closer she got to him, the more her powers awakened. He was like a magnet she was drawn to. Maybe it was the years alone that left her yearning for companionship, or maybe it was the taut muscles in his arms that beckoned her to come closer, either way she had a hard time controlling her thoughts. She knew things about him that he couldn’t remember, things that were blocked from his memory. He wasn’t from earth either, and she needed his help to save both of their worlds. But the closer she gets to Brady the more she knows her world is with him.Even with a woman as beautiful as Karis, Brady was well trained, but he wasn’t prepared to care as much as he did. Being an underground fighter made him the wrong man for a future Queen of a different world, and he knew it. But that didn’t stop the yearning he felt deep inside. It didn’t stop his heart from racing when she was around. And it didn’t stop him from falling in love.",
