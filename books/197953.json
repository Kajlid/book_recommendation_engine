  "description": "Being head cheerleader doesn't exactly prepare you for life during the apocalypse, and it's a dangerous learning curve...  Sixteen-year-old Jane wakes up to a desperate text from her best friend—the dead are walking around outside her window. Jane's parents are in New York for the weekend, and Jane is completely alone.  After a gruesome personal tragedy, Abby rescues Jane, and the girls flee the town they grew up in, hoping to find a place unaffected by the dead. Abby’s family lake house seems like the only choice, but their beacon of hope is three States away, separated by a sea of reanimated death. Reaching it will be anything but easy.",
