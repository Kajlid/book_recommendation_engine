  "title": "The Cost of Rights: Why Liberty Depends on Taxes",
  "description": "To \"fight for your rights,\" or anyone else's, is not just to debate principles but to haggle over budgets. The simple insight that all legally enforceable rights cost money reminds us that freedom is not violated by a government that taxes and spends, but requires itâ€•and requires a citizenry vigilant about how money is allocated. Drawing from these practical, commonsense notions, The Cost of Rights provides a useful corrective to the all-or-nothing feel of much political debate nowadays ( The Economist ).",
