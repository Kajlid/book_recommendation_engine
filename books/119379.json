  "description": "Deep in the canyons of Southern Utah lies nature's deadliest man. The location is Zion National Park, host to three million tourists each year. But unfortunately, not all of them make it out alive. Nick Perrone is a successful executive whose wife is seven months pregnant with a child he never wanted. Wyatt Orr is a struggling Homicide Detective who joined the force after failing to save his father from an armed burglar. A camping trip seems like the perfect opportunity for these estranged friends to reconnect - and what better place than Zion? But after a heated argument, Wyatt backs out, leaving Nick to go alone. Now Nick is missing and the authorities suspect he staged his own disappearance. But Wyatt doesn't believe it, and finds himself en route to Utah fighting old and new demons. When he discovers Nick has been kidnapped, the pieces of an incomprehensible puzzle of human depravity and corporate greed begin falling into place. With every twist raising the stakes, it becomes a furious race against the clock. Something sinister hides behind those canyon walls, and if Wyatt can't uncover it in time, he, Nick, his wife and their unborn child will be forced to pay the ultimate price. Their lives.",
