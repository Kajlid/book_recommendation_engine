  "description": "Book 2 in the Unrivalled Regency Series. Anne and Giles’ story.  Waiting for nearly two years hadn’t been easy. Every second under Anne’s emerald gaze had been pure torture while Giles waited out her mourning, but now it was over and with the county’s eligible, if aging bachelors already gathering at her gates, he hadn’t a moment to lose.  With his heart in his mouth and his marriage proposal on his lips, it was unfortunate that Anne’s aristocratic father and overbearing brother chose that particular moment to visit.  Lord Edward Ellesworth had never been keen on the lower classes. That his sister would even consider marrying someone as inferior as Giles Denvers, was beyond all reason. It wasn’t going to happen while he had breath in his body. There had to be a way to separate them.  With Giles facing the hangman's noose, and Anne frantic to avoid marriage to one of her father's aging cronies, desperate measures are called for.  Add to the delicious mix of romance and intrigue, a herd of hungry prize porkers, a beautiful young cousin, a very noble intention plus a diamond as big as a walnut and we have the makings of a ripping Regency yarn!  This book is a stand-alone story but the series is best read in order to gain full enjoyment of all the previous characters and scenery involved. (Please see Silence of Scandal by Jackie Williams)  A Murderous Masquerade is suitable for ages 16 and upwards due to sensual, sexual scenes.",
