  "title": "The Lincoln Spy",
  "description": "Time travelers, secret agents that never age, and singing graves. This may all seem like fiction to a normal person, but Amelia Raht has been destined for this life since she was born. You couldn't exactly call her a normal fourteen-year-old girl either. Amelia is an independent, intelligent, headstrong, agent in training for a secret society of time travelers. At least, that's all she's ever wanted to be. When she finally gets assigned her first mission, she is paired with the impulsive, wise-cracking, annoying Otto Ray. To make it even worse, the mission is the one every agent has failed so far: changing the fates of President Lincoln and President Kennedy. Confronted with watches that can halt time and lightning that is used as a weapon, the two agents travel from Washington D.C. to Dallas, trying to catch time on their side. Amelia is going to learn that impulsiveness and a bit of humor are the only things that can ensure their very survival. This sci-fi / fantasy debut combines action, death, suspense, and codes with the truth in myths that only time can reveal.",
