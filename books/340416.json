  "description": "It's a sultry July night, and Wild Bill is content. It's deliciously warm outside, the fireworks are about to start, a whole pint of freshly-tapped blood is on the menu, and his boyfriend hasn't murdered anyone in months. Too bad Bill's contentment isn't shared by Michael, who's tired of his own lack of experience. He hints that a new lover in their bed might broaden his horizons. Their first encounter might have been a threesome, but it certainly didn't end well for the third participant. Even now, Bill can't seem to shake the memory of the hickory stake protruding from the chest of his old nemesis. Lust wars with guilt as Wild Bill tries to figure out how to bury his past, once and for all.",
