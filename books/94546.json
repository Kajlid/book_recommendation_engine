  "description": "The KING OF THE JUNGLE is a ‘not-so-young-anymore’ man living in voluntary exile from the artistic maelstrom he once dominated working as an unknown London park-keeper. Via the KING’S once so vital and much-admired vision we learn of the rivalries and reveries of the febrile London art college scene and the bunfi ght that ensues upon graduation. As the ‘KING’ regails us he reluctantly reveals his own story and the real reason he has chosen anonymity, low pay and long hours. With irony worthy of the best of modern art this manages to be mad, moving, entertaining and massively poignant.The other two novels of the trilogy complete this major saga of modern society, art and life from different viewpoints and times. We hope that you will visit Part One of this major retrospective with us.KS SILKWOOD was born in the 70s, grew up in the 80s, endured the 90s, and wrote a book or two in the noughties. King of the Jungle is one part of a trilogy of thematically linked novels, exploring the lives and loves, the conflict and the compromise, of the modern day artistically (dis)inclined.",
