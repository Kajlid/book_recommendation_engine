Everything she knows has been learned first hand or has been taught to her by her parents. Her life changes drastically when a human family moves into the house her family lives near. Will Kara make a new friend? Or is there something darker, possibly more dangerous in store for her?7\" Kara is an ongoing watercolor children's comic written and illustrated by Becca Hillburn. Collected in this first volume are the first four chapters of the main comic, a bonus story featuring Kara, and a selection of concept art. Full color, 112 pages of content, 71 pages of comic.",
