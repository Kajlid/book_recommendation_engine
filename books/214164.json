  "description": "Lana Tate dreams of the day she can leave Wyoming and live in a more civilized place like San Francisco or New York. Since her mother died her father has been paralyzed with grief, and Lana must sing in the saloon just to earn enough money to make it through the winter. She worries that if she doesn't find a way out of Wyoming soon she will die there just like her mother. Taggart Morgan watches the reward for the capture of the legendary wild stallion grow until it reaches two thousand dollars. Lana learns of the reward and sees it as the answer to her dreams. The amount is more than enough to get her and her father to San Francisco, where she can finally live her dream of becoming an opera star. Taggart expects competition for the stallion, but he never suspected that a delicate but determined young gal would be the one to stand between him and his goal. The competition heats up as Lana and Taggart butt heads. Finally, when they see that neither can capture the horse alone, they team up. If they work together they can both accomplish their goals and go their separate ways. But the closer they get to their goal, the less important it seems, as these two hearts learn that love can make even impossible dreams come true.",
