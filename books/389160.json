  "title": "Peace from Broken Pieces: How to Get Through What You're Going Through",
  "description": "How do you find your way through the broken pieces and the pain to peace? In this honest and searching book, New York Times best-selling author Iyanla Vanzant recounts the last decade of her profoundly human journey and shares her own hard lessons to inspire you to put your personal puzzle back together. Part metaphorical teaching story, part wrenching personal chronicle, this phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes tale is about men and money, love and work, mothers and daughters, life and death, and the patterns and pathologies that families pass down through the generationsâ€”until someone gets clear enough to break the pattern and pave the way to healing. Discover why everything you need to learn is reflected in your relationships; gain a new perspective on personal power, spiritual purpose, and karma; and recognize that it is possible to make your broken pieces whole.",
