  "description": "Can love truly set you free?   Belinda Wu is in trouble. She's just one bad day away from losing Bewitching Bites bakery, the business she built from scratch. The 80-hour weeks, the assistant who can't bake, and the constant stress are taking a toll on her health. And on top of it all, Belinda is nursing a broken heart. When she rescues an injured raven in the park one evening, she has no idea he could be the answer to her prayers, or the final nail in her coffin.  Cole Erikson is a prisoner. Bound to his human master by a centuries-old spell, Cole refuses to let anyone get close to him until he is a free man. But when his escape plans turn dangerous and he ends up being rescued by a beautiful but impossibly sad woman, he can't help but be drawn to her.  But love between a raven shapeshifter and a human girl is doomed to fail. Powerful forces are gathering in Crookshollow, determined to keep Cole and Belinda apart forever.  Watcher is a full-length paranormal romance novel with a cliffhanger ending by USA Today bestselling author Steffanie Holmes. It is the first of a two part series exploring the idea that love truly can set you free.
