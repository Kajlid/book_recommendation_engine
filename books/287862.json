  "title": "The Breast",
  "description": "Librarian note: An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here.Like a latter-day Gregor Samsa, Professor David Kepesh wakes up one morning to find that he has been transformed. But where Kafka's protagonist turned into a giant beetle, the narrator of Philip Roth's richly conceived fantasy has become a 155-pound female breast. What follows is a deliriously funny yet touching exploration of the full implications of Kepesh's metamorphosis â€” a daring, heretical book that brings us face to face with the intrinsic strangeness of sex and subjectivity.",
