  "description": "Meet the Damage Control Boys - set in the world of the bestselling series Inked Brotherhood Author this book was published in the Red Hot Alphas Boxed Set, so if you bought the boxed set, then you already own it. There’s Micah Owens. Tattoo artist at Damage Control. No parents or siblings. A past that still gives me nightmares. And then there’s Evangeline, the girl who saved my life and haunts my more pleasant dreams. Only she doesn’t know who I really am, and telling her might well send her fleeing for the hills. She deserves better than a loser like me. She’s pretty. She’s clever. She’s goddamn sexy and has a heart of gold. Which is why I can’t tell her. A smile from her and I’ll do all I can to make her mine – including pretending to be someone I’m not, someone worth having. Isn’t love weird? Standalone novel. No cliffhanger. * this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young readers.* MICAH is book 1 in the series Damage Control - a series set in the same world as Inked Brotherhood. The boys of Damage Control were taken in by Zane Madden and Rafe Vestri and offered apprenticeship and work in the tattoo shop Damage Control. Next in the Damage Control Jesse, Seth, Shane and Ocean.",
