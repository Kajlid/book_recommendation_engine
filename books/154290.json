  "description": "Emmalyn Ross never thought a person could feel this alone. Sustaining a marriage with a man who's not by her side is no easy task, especially since her husband currently resides behind impenetrable prison walls. His actions stole her heart's desire and gave their relationship a court-mandated five-year time-out. What didn't fall apart that night fell apart in the intervening years.Now, on a self-imposed exile to Madeline Island--one of the Apostle Islands of Lake Superior--Emmalyn starts rehabbing an old hunting cottage they'd purchased when life made sense. Restoring it may put a roof over her head, but a home needs more than a roof and walls, just as a marriage needs more than vows and a license. With only a handful of months before her husband is released, Emmalyn must figure out if and how they can ever be a couple again. And his silence isn't helping.",
