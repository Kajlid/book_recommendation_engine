  "description": "The ice bridge of Niagara Falls - steeped in history, fraught with tragedy, challenged by daredevils, lures five young men from the world they know into the mysterious Niagara Gorge. After an encounter with the mighty Falls, they emerge in a struggle of life and death with a Niagara they never knew existed. Peeling back time, meet the hermit living on the Falls in a quest to become one with it; experience the day the Falls stopped, exploring a riverbed never before exposed -- until the water returns in a frenzy; witness slavery through the eyes of a runaway riding the ''Underground Railroad''; and feel the clash when the path of a drummer boy converges with an Iroquois brave at the ''Devil's Hole'' massacre. Author d k LeVick creates a tale rich in both historical fact and ingenious fiction. LeVick brings together a series of historical events, a twist of mystery, and a group of teenagers caught up in a changing world. You might just hear the ice crack and feel a tremor beneath your feet.",
