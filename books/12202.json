  "description": "In 1932, the R.M.S. Aquitania embodies all that is gracious and refined, in a world gripped by crisis and doubt.Returning home on the luxury liner after months abroad, Rowland Sinclair and his companions dine with a suffragette, a Bishop and a retired World Prophet. The Church encounters less orthodox religion in the Aquitania's chandeliered ballroom, where men of God rub shoulders with mystics in dinner suits.The elegant atmosphere on board is charged with tension but civility prevails...until people start to die. Then things get a bit awkward.And Rowland Sinclair finds himself unwittingly in the centre of it all.",
