  "description": "These are some jokes I wrote to entertain my therapist. With inspiration from Mitch Hedberg, Steven Wright, and psychosis I give you my thoughts unfiltered; perfect to poison your mind with. Sometimes all you need to get through the day is a funny and creative thought that won't leave you alone until it's scribbled on your bathroom mirror with pink lipstick.
