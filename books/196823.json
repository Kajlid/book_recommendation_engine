  "title": "Star Hawks: The Complete Series",
  "description": "On October 3, 1977, Star Hawks premiered and introduced newspaper readers to the best science fiction/action comic strip in the last thirty years. Star Hawks combined the talents of renowned science fiction writer Ron Goulart and famed comic artist Gil Kane. The strip also introduced a two-tiered format to daily newspaper comic strips. Each daily installment of Star Hawks had the look and feel of a Sunday strip. The strip ran for three-and-half years and has never been reprinted in its entirety. This book will reprint the entire continuity of 1,244 strips together with all of the Sunday strips. All the Sunday strips will be presented in full color. The book has an introduction by Ron Goulart together with a comprehensive essay about Star Hawks. Numerous examples of original artwork used in the strip are also used to explain Gil Kane's composition methods.",
