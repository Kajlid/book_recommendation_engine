  "title": "Creepy Crawlers: An Anthology of Spine-Tingling Terror",
  "description": "Featuring eleven short stories of the monsters we’ve all come to know, and even love, it opens the door to a few new ones...especially one breed in particular that loves to justify all the evils that they do... Meet a different kind of teenaged werewolf, foreboding specters, vengeful angels, vampires of the non-romantic sort, personal demons, ravenous, lusty insects, zombies without a clue, and read a very special note to humanity from Lucifer himself. From darkly humorous, to gothic and somber, to thought-provoking, and making the hairs on the back of your neck rise, Creepy Crawlers will have you rethinking the world of the typical clichéd creature, because sometimes, the real monsters are the ones who live right next door to you… Features the story, “Bad Phone Call”, a first place winner in The National Haunters Convention’s short story competition.",
