  "title": "Travels With Pegasus - a Microlight Journey Across West Africa",
  "description": "An enterprising and fearless traveller, Christina Dodwell has rafted white water rapids in Papua New Guinea, canoed down the Congo river, ridden horses across Turkey and through Africa, driven reindeer and dogs in Kamchatka, travelled around Madagascar in a horse-drawn stagecoach and journeyed alone through China. But for this journey from the Cameroun rain forest to the Atlantic, via the Sahara and Tombouctou, Christina had to learn to fly! The author and her pilot-instructor progress in a series of hops, so she not only gets fantastic bird's eye views of forests and the limitless desert, but also has ample opportunity for exploring on the ground. Travels with Pegasus combines the infinite variety of Africa with the exhilarating exposure of microlighting. Christina is a courageous and resourceful traveller whose curiosity about her fellow men and what may be over the next hilltop will, we hope, never be satisfied.",
