  "description": "What if God were agnostic and we were nothing more than the product of existential angst?After stumbling upon the creation of existence and life, God attempts to resolve petty religious conflicts by coming to the people in the form of five prophets. Instead of setting the people straight, however, the five—the individual embodiments of mind, matter, time, life and death—inadvertently set off a chain of events that will leave time, space, and humanity forever changed. Take a critical look at religion through an infant God's eyes in this dark science fantasy allegory that spans from the Big Bang to present day.",
