  "title": "The Case Against BDS: Why Singling Out Israel for Boycott Is Anti-Semitic and Anti-Peace",
  "description": "The world is a very dangerous place for the State of Israel. It is besieged by domestic terrorism, bordered by armies bent on its destruction, and targeted by Iranian missiles capable of raining chemical or nuclear destruction on its cities. In a never-ending attempt to destroy Israel, Muslim countries, the international Left, and anti-Semites of all political stripes have joined forces to create a worldwide campaign aimed at the complete economic and cultural isolation of the Jewish State. BDS aims to de-legitimize Israel's very existence-barring it from international organizations, cultural exchanges, and global economic activity. Based on the absurd notion that Israel is equivalent to South Africa under Apartheid, BDS activists portray Israel as a racist and genocidal nation. This fantastical notion is gaining traction, with the potential to cause serious damage to Israel's economy, reputation, and, eventually, security-clearly the aim of BDS proponents. The Case Against BDS is a must-read for all people of goodwill who support Israel's right to exist. Only by shining sunlight on the shady origins and dishonest methods of BDS can we hope to defeat it.",
