There, he encounters a young barbarian named Wulfgar, captured in a raid and made the ward of a grizzled dwarf named Bruenor. With Drizzt's help, Wulfgar will grow from a feral child to a man with the heart of a dwarf, the instincts of a savage, and the soul of a hero. But it will take even more than that to defeat the demonic power of Crenshinibon, the fabled Crystal Shard.This new release of the classic R.A. Salvatore novel continues the classic tale of Salvatore’s signature dark elf character Drizzt Do’Urden. Although this was the first title actually published about Drizzt, it has now been placed in its proper chronological order as fourth in the series. Each title in The Legend of Drizzt series showcases the classic dark elf novels in new, deluxe hardcover editions. Each title will feature all new cover art and new introductions written by those who have become familiar with Salvatore and Drizzt over the years.",
