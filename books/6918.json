  "title": "Oscar Wilde: Short Stories",
  "description": "This collection of Oscar Wilde's writing includes fairy tales, short stories, and poetry. Influenced by the Irish fairy tales he heard as a child, Wilde allowed his imagination to run free across a variety of genres-from mystery to fantasy and the supernatural-while ensuring that his serious social and artistic concerns featured as an undercurrent throughout.From The Happy Prince, a tender story about friendship, compassion, and the transforming power of selfless love, to The Remarkable Rocket, a cautionary tale about a deluded, self-important firework, Wilde's aesthetic preoccupations are evident in every line.Witty, wise, generous spirited, and sometimes melancholy, these writings are a testament to Wilde's standing as a literary genius of the Victorian age.",
