  "description": "Have you ever lay awake at night, watching the shadows? Have you ever seen them move? If you could talk to The Devil himself, what would you say? Would you want to talk in the first place? Have you ever quantified love? In a world where right can be wrong, where demons can be your allies, and laughter is anything but pleasant, not all stories have a happy ending. This collection of 27 macabre short stories will dig into your mind, make a home there, and watch the world unfold from the inside.",
