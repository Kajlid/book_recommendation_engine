After being possessed by a mischievous spirit, he lost his scholarship and got blamed for a scandal that left him blacklisted from the legal profession.

But he’ll have to overcome his own self-doubt — not to mention the seemingly impossible odds — in order to achieve that goal.However, this isn’t your run-of-the-mill sweepstakes.

If the villains are successful, they will spread a dangerous supernatural pathogen throughout the food supply. But with distribution of the tainted products already underway, does Eric have what it takes to stop their plan and protect his family from being the next victims?",
