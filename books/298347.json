  "description": "Xander James would never have guessed that the goals he had set for his life after high school would change so drastically. He encounters an angel named Griff who gives him a choice; if he chooses correctly, it will set into motion a more profound, and supernatural adventure than he’s ever dreamed possible. But along with important tasks, often comes danger, and the darkness is always watching. But Griff is a clever angel, and commands Xander to seek out the very person he was trying to avoid: Greer McLean. Incredibly, she will become part of the unimaginable journey, and will help to teach him all about the Light. Sloane, Caris, and a fifth member will join them on their quest, and each of them will be given powerful gifts to accomplish their task. Being in such close proximity to Greer, forces Xander to face his feelings…but how could he ever be worthy of the girl he’s cruelly tormented since childhood? Her Light is a raging fire, while his is still as dim as cooling embers. What awesome event is about to take place that will change the entire world forever? And will Xander and his friends survive on the mission? Will it all have been worth it in the end?",
