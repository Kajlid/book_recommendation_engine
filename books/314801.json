  "title": "Waves of You: Love Poems",
  "description": "Meant to be read aloud to the one who shares your heart, it is brimming with blooming romance, enduring love, and alchemical connection. From “sun-drenched smiles” and “wide-eyed wonderment” to “sanguine summers” and “umbrella-lined beaches,” this collection of whimsical poetry “will carry you…into a boundless sea” of love. No, I cannot end your waves of pain, but I will lift you up and always raise you higher, so, you can rise above them. In this collection, you will find heartfelt poetry and prose celebrating romantic love and the joys of falling in and sustaining love in all of its fluidity. The book begins with playful flirtations and the ebbing and flowing moments of falling in love, and then moves to the sensations of physical connection. It ends with the sweet rewards of lasting love.",
