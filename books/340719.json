  "description": "Being thrown overboard off a luxury liner by her so-called aunt and cousin was bad enough, but being rescued by a creature that shouldn’t even exist took the cake. Mix in the infuriating man’s insistence she was his “perfect mate” and Dallas had had just about enough. All she wanted to do was to get back to Texas and bring her aunt and cousin to justice before the evil duo could get their hands on her money. But first she had to get past an extremely adamant, extremely horny selkie. Thane was more than satisfied at the mate the Fates had provided for him. Hot and feisty, full of life and a body that made him want to cry. All he had to do was to get the daft woman to see they were destined to be together. Unfortunately, she was human, so Thane had his work cut out for him.",
