  "description": "Brought up in a dysfunctional family, Shayoni sets out to find herself. Her dreams scatter, new ones take their place, but some things are rock solid. Can she depend on anyone? What is genuine and what is not? Sushant, her brother, grows from a precocious eleven year old into a young lad of eighteen, but the scars of his childhood mark him forever. Rahul is strong, patient, reserved, but his time-tested values have to take a thrashing at the new-age culture that assails him as he goes in search of his lady love.A novel that explores almost all facets of growing up in the 21st century and where two cultures clash â€“ an old world one, still prevalent in small towns in India, and the other snazzy, snap-it-up one in the metros. In the midst of flux is a still centre, call it loneliness or self-realization.",
