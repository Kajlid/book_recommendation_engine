  "description": "'So cadets, how's the morale?''High Sir!' we boys and girls screamed in unison.'Should we tighten your training?' 'Yes sir, give us more!' 'Good!' he said. Then whispered to the chief instructor,'Tighten their discipline. Toughen their schedule.I've never seen such happy cadets. This is not a party!'They entered the Officers' Training Academy at Chennai, with a single desireâ€”to be Officers in the army. Soon they discovered it was going to be an uphill task, literally! They fought, they bickered, they cried and they raised hell. But they also learnt. They learnt to take push-ups and punishments, front rolls and figures of eight, strict discipline and night marches in their stride.Where Girls Dare is a hilarious and entertaining story of what happens when fifty-two lady cadets (LCs) train alongside four hundred Gentleman Cadets (GCs), some of whom believe that girls in the army is a bad idea.",
