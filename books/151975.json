  "description": "The psycho-social stage theory couples with cognitive therapy that focuses on rational and irrational beliefs to produce a lasting change in maladaptive beliefs. The focus of the processes of maladaptive development and irrational belief systems also contribute to a lack of meaning or a meaning that is harmful to the individualâ€™s healthy image of himself or herself. The focus on self-development raises awareness of tendencies and biases that the individual holds. A transition to current irrational and rational beliefs direct the individual toward change, and the concluding treatment with an emphasis on providing a meaning and purpose for the individual to understand the events of life allow for a lasting solution for the individual to be able to maintain the changes that had been created as a result of the therapeutic process. The approach also provides flexibility that allows for the approach to be adapted to address cultural awareness and identity while allowing for non-discriminatory treatment of women through the same approach.",
