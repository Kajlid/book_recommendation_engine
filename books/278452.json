  "title": "How to Cook Children: A Grisly Recipe Book",
  "description": "Every dish in this very unique cookbook has one thing in the main ingredient is children! Many famous culinary witches have contributed—from Barfa Stew-Wart to India's favorite Kideeta Skingh and Janie Groviller from Britain—and each of their recipes is introduced by the general editor Esmelia Sniff. Recipes range from such tangy delights as Seared Tina in Boy Sauce on a Bed of Fragrant Lice to the more filling Bratwurst and Upset Cabbage to sweet Flat Jacks. Featuring a dark subject matter but laugh-out-loud jokes, absurd characters, and beautiful illustrations, this is the perfect cookbook for parents and children alike.",
