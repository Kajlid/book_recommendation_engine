  "description": "\"This guy can write!\" --Ray BradburyLoory's collection of wry and witty, dark and perilous contemporary fables is populated by people- and monsters and trees and jocular octopi- who are united by twin fear and desire. In his singular universe, televisions talk (and sometimes sing), animals live in small apartments where their nephews visit from the sea, and men and women and boys and girls fall down wells and fly through space and find love on Ferris wheels. In a voice full of fable, myth, and dream, Stories for Nighttime and Some for the Da y  draws us into a world of delightfully wicked recognitions, and introduces us to a writer of uncommon talent and imagination.Contains 40 stories, including \"The Duck,\" \"The Man and the Moose,\" and \"Death and the Fruits of the Tree,\" as heard on NPR's  This American Lif e , \"The Book,\" as heard on  Selected Short s , and \"The TV,\" as published in  The New Yorke r .",
