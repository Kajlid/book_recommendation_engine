  "description": "The poems of John Glassco are something new in Canadian poetry, but there is nothing hasty or ill-digested about them. They are the products of a mature sensibility, and they assimilate disparate and even discordant elements of experience. This subject matter is rural life in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Understanding and sympathy are deepened by the poet’s complex and genuinely sophisticated viewpoint, which combines an aesthetic with a genuinely moral code of values. This little pocket of country isolation—a country of the mind as well as a fading arduous, and dedicated way of life—is presented as a kind of forlorn and heroic rejection of the evils of mechanization and success-worship of the acquisitive society.Besides his eclogues and bucolic verses, Mr. Glassco has written poems of a personal and psychological nature which testify to the wide range of his experience and the catholicity of his classical spirit in a way that is peculiarly his own, and his thoroughly mature volume makes a new and extremely valuable contribution to contemporary Canadian poetry.A.J.M.
