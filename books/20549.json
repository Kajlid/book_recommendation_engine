She has saved legendary Hollywood writer Jack Larch's fortune at least a half dozen times. Living in the guest house behind Jack's Holmby Hills estate that she bought from him, Clare endures the uncertainty that goes along with Jack's glitzy show business lifestyle. She feels a growing affection for her talented and unpredictable client. But Jack's personal life is a train wreck of failed relationships and broken marriages. News of his old army friend's untimely death has Jack reviewing his past and growing closer to Clair. But that same past is now moving in on them with deadly, murderous intent. Clair must learn to believe in her instincts and follow her heart--even though it makes her the new target for murder.",
