  "description": "This is the FOURTH book in the Hellhound Series. This book contains TWO origin stories.  “The Long Ride to Hell” Long ago, in a time of War, a great man ruled with an iron fist, that of Vlad the Impaler. His armies vast and his lands growing but it was not at his own hand, it was led by Dorin, The Red Dragon. Dorin served Castle Bran and his Lord with an unwavering loyalty. His strength absolute and his armor impenetrable, except for one thing, his forbidden love for Vlad. With war subsiding and a bright future of peace on the horizon, Lady Illona is sent to Castle Bran to bind their nation’s houses as one. As a wedding looms, Dorin finds that his love cannot be contained and it sets a series of events into motion that will seal his fate and that of the legend of Dracula, forever.  “Moriah” Long before man existed, other beings did, that of the angels of Moriah. Moriah was a beautiful planet on the outskirts of the Andromeda system and if it was not for war, it would have been a true heaven. As with all things, every being fights for survival and the angels of Moriah had done just that for all of 200 years. Led by Elohim and that of El, their army of the Helios Guard defended the planets greatest resources, that of water and iron. Once war ended they found themselves left without purpose. Elohim tries his best to ensure that the angels of Moriah will live forever, but in his desperation has he saved them, or has he doomed them all?",
