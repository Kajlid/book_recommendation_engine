  "title": "Petersburg Tales: New Translation: Newly Translated and Annotated / Includes the Diary of a Madman",
  "description": "A new translation of comic tales by one of the leading figures in 19th-century Russian literatureWritten in the 1830s and early 1840s, these comic stories tackle life behind the cold and elegant fa√ßade of the imperial capital from the viewpoints of various characters, such as a collegiate assessor who one day finds that his nose has detached itself from his face and risen the ranks to become a state councillor (\"The Nose\"), a painter and a lieutenant whose romantic pursuits meet with contrasting degrees of success (\"Nevsky Prospect\"), and a lowly civil servant whose existence desperately unravels when he loses his prized new coat (\"The Overcoat\"). Also including \"Diary of Madman,\" these Petersburg Tales paint a critical yet hilarious portrait of a city riddled with pomposity and self-importance, masterfully juxtaposing 19th-century realism with madcap surrealism, and combining absurdist farce with biting satire.",
