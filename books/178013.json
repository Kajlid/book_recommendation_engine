Dr. Hari Parameshwar, corporate spiritualist, yoga guru and a life coach, reveals the profundity of his thoughts-as well as his spiritual and mystical insights-through this brilliant collection of stories based on his encounters and experiences in life. This amazing collection of gems, picked up from the depths of human mind, go a long way in leading one to find simple answers for many mysteries that life beholds. At the same time, they depict new age philosophy and corporate spiritualism. Every story is psychic and emotional-yet rational-with a strong message, which in itself is unique in most of the cases. They reflect the conflict within-between the body, mind and real-self-as interpretations vary at different stages of life, as varies the thought process of human beings. The moods that they generate are found to swing frequently between emotional and spiritual. This extraordinary collection of stories will surely provoke your thought by questioning your own beliefs, and will inspire and help you to come out of your lows with a newfound vigor.",
