  "description": "\"WHO'S BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED?\"She woke up cold, practically naked and in a stranger's bed. Sophie couldn't remember a thing…and she sure didn't recognize the brooding loner who was nursing her back to health. But still she felt drawn to the tempting mountain man….The last thing Seth Brogan wanted in his cabin was a mysterious, sexy woman. Especially since he could tell she was running from something—or someone. But Seth wasn't as tough as he pretended, and he soon realized he couldn't refuse to help this damsel in distress.",
