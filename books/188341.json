  "title": "Storm of Steel",
  "description": "One of the great war memoirs, published here in a stunning Deluxe Edition for the centenary of World War I and the Battle of the Somme — and featuring a foreword by the New York Times bestselling author of MatterhornA worldwide bestseller published shortly after the end of World War I, Storm of Steel is a memoir of astonishing power, savagery, and ashen lyricism. It illuminates not only the horrors but also the fascination of total war, as seen through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier.Young, tough, patriotic, but also disturbingly self-aware, Ernst Jünger exulted in the Great War, which he saw not just as a great national conflict but also — more importantly — as a unique personal struggle. Leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart, Jünger keeps testing himself, braced for the death that will mark his failure. His account is ripe for rediscovery upon the centennial of the Battle of the Somme — a major set piece in Storm of Steel — and a bracing read for fans of Redeployment and American Sniper.",
