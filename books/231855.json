  "description": "What, Jane Delaney asks herself, could be better than skating on a frozen lake with sexy Martin McAuliffe? After all, Martin’s thought of everything:• Yummy picnic lunch, complete with the requisite hot chocolate? Check.• Adorable, if slightly neurotic, canine sidekick? Check.• Chainsaw (don’t ask)? Check.• Frozen corpse? Dang! And just when things were starting to get romantic!The authorities decide Allison Zaleski’s death was an accident, but Death Diva Jane isn’t so sure. For starters, some of the wealthy young woman’s nearest and dearest had reason to want her out of the picture—her boy-toy husband and his greedy mistress for starters. But it isn’t until Jane discovers Allison’s secret video diary that the questions really start piling up. Such as: Who left a decapitated Barbie doll, altered to look like Allison, in her mailbox? And what, if anything, did Allison have to do with her first husband’s death?",
