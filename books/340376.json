  "description": "Love survives the ravages of time.â€¦Set against the backdrop of the Taklamakan Desert, Fiona, a beautiful, modern young woman of Celtic heritage, finds herself transported to ancient China during a time of barbarian warriors and marauding nomads from the northern steppes; at what was then a crossroad between East and West. Fiona discovers a new way of life in the arms of the handsome warrior, Kellach, a man of noble stature and a leader among the Celtic settlements ringing the great desert. Desperate to return home to the present while struggling against her mounting feelings, Fiona finally accepts her fate, exulting in the rapture and delights of Kellach's love; only to have Voadicia, a beautiful seductress, destroy that dream of happiness. Kellach's soul searches the mists of time, yearning to be reunited with his one true mate.",
