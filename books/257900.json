  "description": "The story of Monroe, Zachary, and Angel continues…\n  The Devil’s Playground series can be read out of order, but you should read Zachary and Monroe’s book before this one.  Zachery: Former Marine, swat commander, and hero with a hidden erotic edge. Zachary loves Angel and must also come to terms with his desire for the man he owes everything to or he could lose them both. Zach’s background in the world of law enforcement leaves little flexibility when it comes to the strictures of acceptable love.  Monroe: Lethal killer and mysterious Shibari artist in love with two special people. He must face his deadly past to keep the people he loves safe. Leaving Angel behind is hard but with so much left unsaid, leaving Zachary is nearly impossible. Monroe’s forbidden goodbye could change their shaky dynamic forever.  Angel: Rescued after being tortured by white slavers. Her haunted eyes beg two men for love.  When tragedy strikes, Zachary and Angel must face a world they never saw coming and discover the strength in a bond more resilient than the strongest rope.  Can Angel pull the people she loves into her web of safety?  This book is intended for mature audiences. You’ve been warned!",
