  "title": "Everything: What You Give and What You Gain to Become Like Jesus",
  "description": "Readers discover exactly what it takes to grow in Christ and become like Him.\"I don't write this book as a condemnation or as a sermon. The last thing I want to do is provide a 'how to be the best Christian in ten easy steps' guide. I pen these words as a fellow struggler who is learning that what we think about God matters, how we allow Him to reign in our hearts matters, and how we obey Him in the moment matters. It \"all\" matters. Everything.\"Author and speaker Mary DeMuth has been abused, foreclosed, abandoned, and betrayed. She has been pressed and drained till it was too much . . .But it was just enough to bring her to a place of surrender, piece by precious piece. In that surrender, she found the freedom of giving \"everything\" to God. And through Scripture, community, and the work of the Holy Spirit, she gives it all over again, every day.In this gentle \"and\" challenging book, DeMuth describes the process and the nuances that shape us to be more like Christ. Her words are clear, vulnerable, and thought provoking, and every chapter is infused with Scripture.Most of all, DeMuth provides personal and practical evidence that there is no greater pursuit than Christ. We must surrender everything, but it does not compare to the \"Everything\" He is, the \"Everything\" He gives.",
