  "description": "A new collection of creative artwork from artist, author and proud Aspie Maranda Russell (Aspie is a nick-name for someone who has Asperger's Syndrome, a type of high-functioning autism). As the book's title suggests, Maranda shares the stories and inspiration behind some of her recent artworks. She isn't afraid to be silly or fun in her art, nor is she afraid to tackle hard subjects, look at things in a different way or share those views with others. Quickly becoming a highly collected outsider/folk artist, Maranda Russell shares the joy she finds in personal expression with the world.",
