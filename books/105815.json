  "description": "Cara Cassidy, a Dublin tree surgeon and Chairman of the high IQ group Irish Mensa, discovers two people dead in a house following a vicious knife attack, and their separate lives and families have to be searched for their killer.The victims, William Fleming and Nicola Marr, worked in insurance and were having an affair. Marr’s partner runs a video shop and provides East European girls for porn films, while Fleming’s widow dabbles in art and has resentful teenaged sons. Garda Detective Ricky Norton gains promotion, so by Garda regulations he must return to uniform duties for a year. He enlists his Mensan friends Cara and Mike Fraser to investigate the crimes, meeting the families and visiting an art gallery, and they compare notes while hill-walking in Wicklow. Cara is good at gaining information, but she can’t tell Ricky that she has found someone trying to supply drugs at Mensa meetings… and someone close to the murders believes that she knows too much.",
