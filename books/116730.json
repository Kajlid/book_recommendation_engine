But five years ago she had something better: happiness. Her firefighter husband, Quaid, was handsome, courageous, and crazy about her.

And then a rumor surfaces that could bring a miracle or shatter her world--again. Q has been a prisoner forever. He's honed his mind and body into weapons. He's developed abilities no one else understands. But he's still at the mercy of a cabal of ruthless men, who blank his memory, test him like a lab rat, and tell him lies.
