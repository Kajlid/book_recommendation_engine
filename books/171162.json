While researching for this book I found out that most couples who experience severe problems cannot even tell exactly what caused them. Before this state passes a point of no return, the common question is “What can we do to fix this?”. Possible consequences of not doing anything are boredom, mutual ignorance and disinterest and most couples will likely part ways. Asking the question what was missing to have a fulfilling and loveful relationship, the most common answers where a lack of shared interests, beloved activities and desire for each other.  In this book, I am trying to give inspiration and deliver easy and actionable advice to those to are willing to take action.
