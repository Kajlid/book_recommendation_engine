It holds a sacred history that goes beyond words, beyond religion, and its legendary places of worship are truly its crown jewels.Susan Cahill's Sacred Paris is a guide for seasoned Parisian visitors, novices, and armchair travelers to the historic religious sites of the city, from the well-known landmarks to the sacred spots off the beaten track, from the magnificent towers of Notre-Dame and the sweeping arches of the Grand Mosque to the serenity of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre. This spiritual tour is interwoven with the artistic and cultural history of Paris, from the medieval Crusades through the Resistance of World War II. Stand in the basilica of Saint-Denis, where Joan of Arc prayed with her soldiers in the Hundred Years' War, and gaze at the murals of Saint-Sulpice painted by Eugene Delacroix, or visit the village of Auvers where Vincent van Gogh painted the lovely Gothic church of Notre Dame d’Auvers-sur-Oise.Organized by the major geographical sections of the city―Ile de la Cite; the Latin Quarter on the Left Bank; Montparnasse; Northern Paris on the Right Bank; the Marais―each chapter is accompanied by Marion Ranoux’s beautiful four-color photographs.
