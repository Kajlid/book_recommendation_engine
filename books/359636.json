  "description": "George and Mitchell are both asked for favorsand each finds himself with a painfully difficult choice to make George’s friend, Kaz, arrives at the apartment with a staggering request: she and her partner Gail want to have a child, and they’d like George to be the father. George is warming to the ideahe has always wanted kids, and he can be as involved in the baby’s life as he wishesbut he is wary. What if his condition is genetic? Mitchell and Annie don’t approve of the new plan, but Mitchell is wrestling with a difficult decision of his own: a patient at the hospital, Leo, is surprisingly good company for a pasty older bloke who believes the 1980s were a golden age. But he seems a little too interested in Mitchell’s historyand he has a surprising request of his own in store for his new friend.",
