  "description": "Andie Miller is ready to move on with her life. She wants to marry her fiancÃ© and leave behind everything in her past, especially her ex-husband, North Archer. But when Andie tries to gain closure with him, he asks one final favor of her. A distant cousin has died and left North the guardian of two orphans who have driven away three nannies alreadyâ€”and things are getting worse. He needs someone to take care of the situation, and he knows Andie can handle anything. When Andie meets the two children, she soon realizes itâ€™s much worse than she feared. Carter and Alice arenâ€™t your average delinquents, and the creepy old house where they live is being run by the worst housekeeper since Mrs. Danvers. Complicating matters is Andieâ€™s fiancÃ©â€™s suspicion that this is all a plan by North to get Andie back. He may be right because Andieâ€™s dreams have been haunted by North since she arrived at the old house. And thatâ€™s not the only haunting.Then her ex-brother-in-law arrives with a duplicitous journalist and a self-doubting parapsychologist, closely followed by an annoyed medium, Andieâ€™s tarot cardâ€“reading mother, her avenging ex-mother-in-law, and her jealous fiancÃ©. Just when Andieâ€™s sure things couldnâ€™t get more complicated, North arrives to make her wonder if maybe this time things could just turn out differently.Filled with her trademark wit, unforgettable characters, and laugh-out-loud scenarios, Maybe This Time shows why Jennifer Crusie is one of the most beloved storytellers of our time.",
