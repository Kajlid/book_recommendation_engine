  "title": "The Vanishing Voter: Public Involvement in an Age of Uncertainty",
  "description": "From the award-winning author of Out of Order —named the best political science book of the last decade by the American Political Science Association—comes this landmark book about why Americans don’t vote.Based on more than 80,000 interviews, The Vanishing Voter investigates why—despite a better educated citizenry, the end of racial barriers to voting, and simplified voter registration procedures—the percentage of voters has steadily decreased to the point that the United States now has nearly the lowest voting rate in the world. Patterson cites the blurring of differences between the political parties, the news media’s negative bias, and flaws in the election system to explain this disturbing trend while suggesting specific reforms intended to bring Americans back to the polls. Astute, far-reaching, and impeccably researched, The Vanishing Voter engages the very meaning of our relationship to our government.",
