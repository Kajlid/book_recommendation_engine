  "title": "Altered English: Surprising Meanings of Familiar Words",
  "description": "Over the centuries, innumerable English words have drifted from their original purposes and acquired vastly different meanings - some subtle and others not so. Author Jeffrey Kacirk, a man intrigued by words, has sifted through mountains of discarded meanings to arrive at almost 1,500 entries in this fascinating romp through the ever-changing world of lexicography. As he puts it, his goal is to \"leave the reader with a sense of where many modern usages may have come from, or in some cases have strayed, whether we choose to think of the changes as corruptions or improvements.\" Study the altered meanings in this erudite but fun book and you'll be able to \"razzle-dazzle\" (originally, a daylong drinking bout) your friends and acquaintances. So indulge your fancy for linguistic \"escapades\" (no longer the plunging and rearing of a horse). The mind-expanding enjoyment of exhuming these forgotten meanings will \"manure\" (to enrich the mind) your personal lexicon.",
