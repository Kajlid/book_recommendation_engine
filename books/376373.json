  "description": "Videl Lai is dead and Tarizon’s cataclysmic civil war is over, or so most people think, until Tarizon’s Intergalactic Fleet refuses to surrender. Then Videl Lai’s adopted son, Evohn Cystrom, masterminds the escape of Rupra Bruda, recognized to be the father of the Purist movement. As the Fleet defiantly leaves it’s moon base on Clarion, Cystrom informs Chancellor Lorin Boskie that they intend to travel to Earth, conquer it, and someday come back and destroy Tarizon. The Chancellor, at great personal political risk, puts together a rag-tag armada of Earth Shuttles to try to beat the Purists to Earth and warn the American government of the impending invasion. The odds of the Loyalist armada reaching earth before the Purists, or even surviving the trip against the powerful Purist fleet, are long but Commander General, Leek Lanzia, is determined to save Earth and destroy the Purists once and for all.",
