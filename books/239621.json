  "description": "Preston Endicott, Jr. was hated by most of his staff at Endicott Publishing, at least until he turned up dead in his locked executive office. Taylor Browning, a new editor at the book publishing house, sees plenty of possible perps right in the office suite, but his employees were hardly the only people to count as suspects. His ex-wife wasn’t a fan either. Dominique Boucher, their bestselling author, has just submitted her latest manuscript. It’s a locked-room mystery with a similar story line to the real life puzzle. About the only non-suspect is Taylor’s Abyssinian cat, Oscar. Taylor doesn’t know who to trust and discovers her own life is in jeopardy. One thing is certain. She can’t edit her way out of this one!",
