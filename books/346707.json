  "description": "In this western from Charles G. West, blood beats all—except justice…Outlaw Roy Blanton’s raised his four boys in the family business since they were half-pints—and they've gotten away with murder. That is, until U.S. Deputy Marshal Casey Dixon had hot-headed Billy, the youngest, hanged for shooting a policeman. Now the Blantons have vengeance on their minds.   Old Buck Avery, Dixon’s partner, had been thinking of turning in his badge. And taking down the Blanton name sounds like a fine way to leave the law on a high note. But it's going to get bloody--because the house of Blanton isn't going to fall without a fight... “The West as it really was—savage, heroic and unforgettable.”—Ralph Compton",
