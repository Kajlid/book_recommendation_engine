  "title": "The Truth About Drew",
  "description": "At fourteen, Claire Thomas leads the average life of a teenage girl, maneuvering her way through family, friendships, and first love. But her childhood best friend, Drew, is not your average teenage boy. In fact, he is downright unusual. Sometimes he disappears, almost before her eyes. He speaks in clich√©s and Bible verses, and is always writing in his worn leather notebook. It seems he is trying to tell Claire something important, but she isn't sure what. After years of wondering why she is the only person to ever see or speak to him, thinking maybe he isn't real and it's all in her head, she is determined to discover The Truth About Drew.",
