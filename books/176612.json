  "description": "After Carter left, I convinced myself I was well and truly over him. Fairy tales didn't exist. I learned to make myself happy, while avoiding commitment like a plague. I couldn't afford another heartbreak. Love simply didn't exist the way I once believed it did. I tried to heal and move on, while Carter became a rock star, taking the world by storm. We lived two completely different lives. But when he unexpectedly shows back up again, making old feelings emerge as though they never went away, I'm torn between reliving the past, or moving on again, alone.***WARNING: This book contains a lot of SWEARING, and SEX. If that is not your thing, this may offend. ***",
