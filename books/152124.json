The ruler of this tribe was King Zuberi, a wise and generous leader who’s only concern was for the welfare of his people.The King had one child, a daughter. The young Princess was a very special light in the King’s heart.One evening, around a campfire, King Zuberi, his daughter and many others, gathered to talk of the day’s events and tell stories.Princess in the Clouds was one of those stories and it was told by the King. A trader who was present that night would end up retelling that story at every campsite on his trade route. This story, as you read it, has been passed down from generation to generation to this point. I lovingly share this with you in hopes that it will delight and inspire you, and all whom you share it with.This is the first and only time it has appeared in print.Cherish this story, as so many have.",
