Ten years ago, when she was Grant Chapman's student, they shared a single, scorching, unplanned kiss that still haunts Shelley's dreams. Now, as irresistible as ever, Grant has just returned to teaching after a stint as a congressional aide in Washington . . . and sees no impropriety in asking Shelley out.
