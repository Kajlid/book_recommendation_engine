  "title": "Stress Fracture: A Memoir of Psychosis",
  "description": "This psychology memoir is about the things that break us and how we heal. It offers a raw view of a 33-year-old wife and mother swallowed by psychosis. The psychotic episode includes meeting Jesus Christ, dancing with Ellen DeGeneres, and narrowly escaping eternity in the underworld.Casually called a nervous breakdown, psychosis is an entrapment outside of self where hallucinations and delusions drop anchor in one's mind. Family, doctors, and fellow patients witnessed a nonverbal, confused, distraught shell of a woman. In the security of a psychiatric care center, the week-long psychosis broke, spitting out a bipolar patient in the cushioned place of middle class medicine.Outpatient recovery consumed the better part of a year with psychiatric treatment and spiritual contemplation. Left scarred and damaged, health returned, allowing her to tentatively embrace a grace and peace earned through acceptance of bipolar disorder.",
