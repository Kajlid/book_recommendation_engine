  "title": "Where Secrets Lie",
  "description": "Where Secrets Lie is a riveting exploration of one family's reliance on secrets, how those secrets affect their relationships and alter the directions their lives take, and where those secrets all began.Sara and Katie's mother, Lee, spends her life deploying secrets in order to protect her loved ones not only from difficult truths, but also from the prejudices they elicit. In spite of the torment her own secret laden past causes her, Lee raises her daughters to repress inconvenient truths. As a result, both sisters' relationships with their significant others are in jeopardy. Sara chooses an unorthodox way to reconcile her own unresolved guilt concerning a pregnancy her husband knows nothing about, and Katie cannot muster up enough courage to defy their mother's behavioral boundaries. That is, at least, not openly.Set in Colorado, Where Secrets Lie shifts between the unique foothills community of Boulder, the mile high city of Denver, and the majestic Rocky Mountains as it moves from the sisters' stories to their mother's story weaving them all together and merging each woman's past with her present circumstances.",
