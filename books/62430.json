  "description": "Their online games turn into games of the heart.A brutal mugging two years ago left Calli terrified to go out after dark, and incapable of real dating. Hanging out with a resentful Chihuahua every night hasn’t filled the void, and all the sex toys from the store she owns could never replace a flesh-and-blood man. An online Scrabble-type site promising anonymous, flirty fun sounds right up her alley. A like-minded geek, that’s what she needs. Unbeknownst to her, the man on the other end of the game is anything but geeky.Travis is tired of the party scene and women chasing after his bad-boy musician persona. He wants somebody who is drawn to his mind, not his profession, and he might have found her—on the opposite side of an internet game board. After heating up the tiles with Calli online, he’s determined to meet her in person. Touch her in person. And when he does, their chemistry is undeniable. But when he discovers her tragic past he realizes it will take more than words to win her heart…and her trust.",
