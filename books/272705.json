But when she discovers an injured woman and her baby in the forest, Aschyllia and her best friend unwittingly find themselves caught between a feuding brother and sister, one of which is desperate to escape their past while the other is obsessed with having control over the future.  With the aid of her faithful dog, Zie, can Aschyllia find a way forward after her having her entire world flipped upside down?  Will she and her friends have to sacrifice too much to do the \"right thing\"?  And can she live with the choices she makes along the way?  Join Aschyllia as she ventures away from home for the first time, and struggles to find a place for herself in a world about which she knows little, while also having to take on responsibilities for which she's truly not ready.",
