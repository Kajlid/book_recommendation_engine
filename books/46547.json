  "description": "My name is Liz, and I’ve always had a thing for dominant men. But I’ve never met anyone I felt comfortable enough with to explore that side of myself, so I’m not even sure if it’s a real need or if it’s just the idea of being dominated that gets me hot.Then I laid eyes on Master Gareth, and I knew he’d be the one to show me. Not only is this my chance to see if I really am a submissive, but there’s something more in the way he looks at me. Something dangerous, forbidden. For one glorious night, I’ll be his to control completely. At his mercy, bowing to his every desire—and I can only hope he’ll make all my fantasies come true.My only fear? That I won’t want to return to reality when the night’s done…even though I know I can’t stay.",
