  "description": "The remarkable, stellar new entry in the Doc Ford series from New York Times–bestselling author Randy Wayne White.   Half-eaten dolphins are washing ashore on Sanibel Island, and it’s a nightmare. There’s a predator out there, and whatever it is, tourists are staying away and businesses are hurting badly. Doc Ford has a theory about that, but he hopes he’s wrong. Because if he’s not, there’s a predator out there, all right, but it’s nothing like anyone supposes. It’s human, and very determined—and it’s on a collision course with everyone on the island.",
