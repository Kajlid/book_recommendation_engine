  "title": "Freedom Fallacy: The Limits of Liberal Feminism",
  "description": "Feminism is back in fashion. From female celebrities to male politicians, it seems almost everyone is keen to use the f-word. But are there limits to this 'pop feminist' approach to liberation? Taking on topics from pornography and prostitution to female genital mutilation, from women's magazines and marriage to sexual violence, contributors in this collection argue that the kind of liberal feminism currently rising to prominence does little to challenge the status quo. Aiming to revive a more radical analysis, the chapters in this book confront the dangers of reducing feminism to a debate about personal choice and offer the possibility of change through collective action. Contributors include: Meghan Donevan. Teresa Edwards. Kate Farhall. Shakira Hussein. Natalie Jovanovski. Miranda Kiraly. Julia Long. Finn Mackay. Laura McNally. Meghan Murphy. Caroline Norma. Camille Nurka. Helen Pringle. Kaye Quek. Naela Rose. Laura Tarzia. Margaret Thornton. Meagan Tyler. Rebecca Whisnant.",
