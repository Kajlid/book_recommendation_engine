  "description": "Moojie Littleman, a biracial and partially-disabled foundling, lives with his adoptive grandfather. Unable to connect with hardhearted, racist \"Pappy,\" Moojie reaches out to a secret, otherworldly clan. Following a series of trials, Moojie is called to a great destiny ... if only he can survive one last terrifying trial. Welcome to the mythical 1900s world of mayhem and merriment, where miracles are as real as the extraterrestrials and noxious spirits roaming the ancestral site of decimated American Indians. From screenwriter and award-winning novelist, Robin Gregory, comes a masterful d√©but about family and first love, magic and miracles--brimming with compassion, lyricism, and originality. Winner of 22 awards.",
