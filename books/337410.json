They enjoyed free trade and full bellies until the raids began.But it was the arrival of the boy Edgar Brave that puzzled Stellamaris the most.He was new to this world, frantic to find his brother while evading the man who kidnapped him.But that was not what was puzzling.What was puzzling was that Edgar had some role to play in this looming war. And an ancient lore, older than Cassini itself, somehow involved Edgar.",
