  "description": "Sara Colson, a woman with a dark secret. Her life was a lesson in torment, her death a nightmare of rape and torture. Catherine Colson was almost ten when she witnessed her mother's terrifying death. A troubled soul, Catherine is defensively hostile. At first glance she is rude and brash, but take a look beneath the surface and she is so much more. Having grown up being called a freak due to her exceptional IQ and photographic memory. Catherine has little self-worth and even less confidence. Except in her work - in that she takes great pride and works hard to achieve success. Her experiences of men have been brutal and terrifying. A chance meeting at a client's office brings Catherine to the attention of Logan Sayers, and he is fascinated by her. Tall and broad, he plays prop-forward for a local rugby team and doesn't take crap from anyone - except Catherine. Sparks may fly between them but it all adds to the passion and the mystery that is Catherine Colson - Sara's Child.",
