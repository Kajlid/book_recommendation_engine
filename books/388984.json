  "description": "The issue of Sabena Revue is intended as a tribute to the Art of Black Africa, & not as a catalogue. It does not seek merely to illustrate the art through its chief masterpieces, but rather to act as invitation. It invites you to a better knowledge of the peoples who have found expression in these statuettes, these masks, these humble domestic objects. It invites you to seek out the conditions which lay behind this creativity, by finding them in their natural context. It invites you, most of all, to a meeting with other people, by making contact with their innermost aspiration - their sense of beauty.Includes bibliography, maps and beautiful photographs.Language; English, French, Afrikaans,",
