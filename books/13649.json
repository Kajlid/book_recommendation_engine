  "title": "The Christmas Cat",
  "description": "It is Christmas Eve. An abandoned gray cat shivers alone in the cold, snowy forest. In a nearby farmhouse, a young boy worries that Santa Claus might not be able to come in such bad weather. But soon the bitter wind stops howling, and the sound of sleigh bells rings clearly through the woods. Neither the cat nor the boys know it, but a small Christmas miracle is about to occur. Beloved illustrator Tasha Tudor's classic style gives this holiday tale a timeless appeal.",
