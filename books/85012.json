  "description": "Reluctant hero Karla Hawke should've taken her rock star boyfriend up on his offer to take a break and go to London. Here in the city of Wabun things are getting a little . . . challenging. When her brother Jayce joins forces with her mortal enemies, the vicious Steel Panther gang, she’s not sure if it’s madness—an act of bitter revenge—or a demonstration of his disturbing genius. If it turns out to be a terrifying combination of all three it means serious trouble. Speaking of trouble, Karla can’t make up her mind whether or not her personal stalker is a blessing or a curse. He thinks he’s god’s gift with sideburns. She’s got enough to worry about. The mysterious heritage that gave her the telekinetic abilities to help her be one of the infamous Furies is the same heritage that made Jayce a dangerous psionic with psychotic tendencies. How close is the call of blood? Will she follow in his footsteps and hurt everyone she loves? Her powers and instability make her a juicy target. Can Karla get a grip before she ends up someone’s unwilling puppet?",
