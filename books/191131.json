  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Elementalists—those that have the ability to command the elements. Only recently has humanity witnessed such unfathomable power. Some believe that it is a curse. That elementalists are possessed by demons. Others claim that it is a gift from the deities above.  It is neither.  Some use it for good, helping those in need and dedicating their lives to selflessness. Others use it for power and personal gain.  Neither understand what elementalism truly is.  Serraemas—one of the first of human elementalists—sees the world not how it is, but how it should be. Able to manipulate the element of ice, he sets out to realize that dream. What he has yet to discover is that in trying to save the world, he might just bring about its end instead.",
