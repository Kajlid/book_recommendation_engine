  "title": "A Teller's Tale",
  "description": "In a dystopian world where a man's title defines him, the Tellers are powerful orators who control society through carefully crafted storytelling. When told that he has the potential to be a Teller, Jon is hesitant to pursue the role. He is critical of the lessons and rules these authoritative storytellers perpetuate. Thrown off course on his journey to the annual Festival, Jon's travels lead him to a deeper understanding of the people inhabiting his mysterious homeland and the secrets that the powerful Tellers have hidden from the masses. As the wrinkled truth unfolds, and the fabric of the Teller's stories unravels, Jon is forced to make a decision. He can either accept the highly revered position of Teller and control the narrative or choose the honest path of a renegade and find out whether one lone man from a fishing community has the power to ignite a revolution.",
