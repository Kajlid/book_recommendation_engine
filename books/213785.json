  "description": "Betty Hitchens is working on a custom birthday cake for a friend when her daughter, Brianna, brings her exciting news. Brianna's musician boyfriend, Ethan, was selected as one of the winners in a contest where the grand prize is a house party with the band Imagine Falcons. Excitement turns to dismay, however, when the group arrives in Yellow Rose, TX, and someone connected to the band dies soon afterward. The police think the death may have been accidental, but Ethan and at least one of the band members suspect foul play. Betty begins an investigation of her own and soon discovers that not everyone is prepared to pay the high price of a rock 'n roll lifestyle.",
