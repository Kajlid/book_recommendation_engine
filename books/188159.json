  "description": "Clear Vista, California is picturesque town overlooking a tranquil bay on the Pacific. Quiet. Friendly. It's a great place for children to grow up. That is, if they grow up. But an unusual number of children in Clear Vista don't live long enough to grow up. A car accident. A hit-and-run. A tumble down the basement stairs. A suicide. So many tragedies fill the plots in the local cemetery, Resurrection Gardens. The worst is the disappearance of the eight-year-old Loewen twins, Heidi and Holly. When their bodies are found in the cemetery's tool shed, the horrified townspeople are desperate to find the predator that has come into their midst. Under the mounting pressure, Police Chief Braden Powell searches for the culprit, but he soon finds himself investigating a string of additional deaths. Adults this time. All parents of lost children. They're definitely not murders, but they're definitely not natural, either. Is the town of Clear Vista just unlucky, or is something far more sinister moving over the horizon?",
