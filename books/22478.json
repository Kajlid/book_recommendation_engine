  "title": "Snaps",
  "description": "Snaps takes place just before, during, and after the Second World War in a tiny town on Vancouver Island. The complex narrative is a period piece told from various points of view, in the Modernist literary tradition, and sometimes the characters and their stories overlap in intriguing ways. The style is magic realism combined with pulp dialogue. There are soldiers, tough working women, and children, who present their slice of life stories in a brief two or three pages, almost in a photographic way, hence the title. Sometimes dreamy, sometimes surreal, this graphic novel will further establish Kraatz's reputation as a writer-centric artist and a talent to watch.",
