  "description": "Rodeo star Grady Farrell is devastated when a gruesome leg injury ends his career. The rodeo was his life, and retirement gives him too much time to think about Becca Johnson, the woman who betrayed him. But when Grady buys a ranch in Cameron, Utah, he comes face to face with Becca again.  Becca is no longer the insecure teenager Grady remembered – she's now a strong, confident woman. She's never stopped loving Grady, but she knows she can't get too close to him. Becca is hiding a huge secret – she can't let him find out that her daughter is his daughter, too.  When Grady finds out the truth, will this new betrayal destroy their second chance at love?",
