  "description": "In the future we as a people will be going through many strange and conflicting changes. We will be traveling and living in Space and under water. We will have an even better network of communications and transportations but we will still need to have a vacation and to relax from this antiseptic new environment. People will need an escape and most people dream of the future and the past, because no one romanticizes about their own time. Fantasy Time Inc won two awards best couple and best male lead for the Travel-Less Online Book Event Awards!",
