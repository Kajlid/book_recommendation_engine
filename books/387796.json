  "description": "The first-ever story collection from the \"New York Times \"bestselling author, including two all-new works! Kitty Norville, star of a \"New York Times \"bestselling series, is everybody's favorite werewolf DJ and out-of-the-closet supernatural creature. Over the course of eight books she's fought evil vampires, were-creatures, and some serious black magic. She's done it all with a sharp wit and the help of a memorable cast of werewolf hunters, psychics, and if-notgood- then-neutral vampires by her side. \"Kitty's Greatest Hits \"not only gives readers some of Kitty's further adventures, it offers longtime fans a window into the origins of some of their favorite characters. In \"Conquistador de la Noche,\" we learn the origin story of Denver's Master vampire, Rick; with \"Wild Ride,\" we find out how Kitty's friend T.J. became a werewolf; and in \"Life is the Teacher,\" we revisit Emma, the human-turned-unwilling-vampire who serves the aloof vampire Master of Washington, D.C. This entertaining collection includes two brand-new works: \"You're On the Air,\" about one of Kitty's callers after he hangs up the phone; and the eagerly awaited \"Long Time Waiting,\" the novella that finally reveals just what happened to Cormac in prison, something every Kitty fan wants to know.",
