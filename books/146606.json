  "description": "Dear Author,He was my nemesis all through school. I was the gay kid who he treated as contagious. Now I’m a successful detective, and he has just transferred in to my Police Department. Everyone knows I’m gay, but I’m a damn good detective so no one says anything. I refuse to be bullied again, and I’m not giving up the career I’ve fought so hard for.Photo Description: Two naked men lying on a bed; the smaller one on top of the bigger one, his head resting on the other man’s chest. The man underneath has his arms up around his lover. There is the hint of a white fluffy rug covering them from the hips down. The two are obviously lovers and are at peace with each other.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
