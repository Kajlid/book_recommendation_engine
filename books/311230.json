  "description": "I’ve got the life people only dream of. Fame, fortune, a great family, and even better friends. Yet my heart wants more.⁣⁣But it’s hard to get more when you keep a wall around your heart. Friends with benefits is easier, less mess involved.⁣⁣And then like out of a movie, a southern gentleman walks into my life and offers me my happily ever after. But nothing in life comes that easy, and the man who I’ve only had a physical relationship now also wants more.⁣⁣How did I go from being unlucky in love to having two men fighting for my heart? I need to figure out a way to untangle this love without hurting them, or me in the end.⁣Tangled Love is Book 7 in the Love in Sienna Series but can be read as a stand-alone.",
