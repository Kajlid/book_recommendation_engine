  "description": "Things were running smoothly on the floating city that served as the headquarters of the Conglomerated Conglomeration of Planets (CCOP) ... until someone started tampering with things and killing Mechanicans (the politically-correct term for robots that have voice synthesizers). Prime Adam Dresker and the crew of the IRB--the investigative branch that handles all major security concerns for the CCOP--must figure out who's at fault and stop them before they can do any more damage. But when you're dealing with all of the races living and working on the CCOP, including Humans, Hyzethians, Uknarians, Gheptians, Tchumachians, Yetians, and more...you end up with all sorts of trouble. This is especially true when your second-in-command is an Uknar named \"Truhbel!\" Many questions arise for Dresker and his crew as they fall into their investigation, such as, Who done it? Why did they do it? Are they going to keep doing it? Is the president of the CCOP actually happy about them doing it? Will Dresker ever live down the \"Erect Penis\" comment that he blurted out while standing at the HUB? ...and the most pressing question of all: Have Mechanicans seriously found religion?",
