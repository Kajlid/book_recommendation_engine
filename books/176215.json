  "description": "Dare you delve into the darkest corners of nightmares a second time? In Volume 2 of Thirteen: The Horror Continues, journey into horror with some fiendishly good tales from some frightfully good authors. As well as Kevin S. Hall's Klown 2, The Isolation Horror, Death Trap Massacre and The Creeping Dread Of Halbrook Manor, there are more devilish delights waiting to be read. Dare you go to find a nightmarish monster in Robert Rumery's chilling Into The Woods? Samie Sands delivers three bone chilling classics in the making; Wonderland, The Paranormal House Entity and Temptress Of The Night. Rob Shepherd gives us a grisly and creepy tale of a murderous Caretaker, Kerry Fenton delivers her debut horror masterpiece A Dark, Dark Secret. TJ Weeks gives us a new Urban Legend monster in the form of Grynn, and Chasity Nicole delivers monstrously good tales The Mirror and A Ghostly Fright. Can you survive the nightmare again?",
