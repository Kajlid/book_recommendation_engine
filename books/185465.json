The message is clear—everyone wants to see her fail, even members of her own family. When a man is murdered in her bookstore the night before her grand opening, Delilah tops the short list of suspects. The evidence mounts along with the ill-will of islanders who don’t want her there in the first place.If Delilah Duffy has a shot at the beach life, she must navigate a vicious family feud, outrun a dark past, and uncover the truth. It’s not only her business but her very life that’s in danger.",
