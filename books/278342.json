  "title": "The Future's So Bright I Can't Bear to Look",
  "description": "Welcome to a world where George Bush and Dick Cheney are secretly radical leftists trying to destroy the Republican party from within; where Jeffrey Dahmer is a celebrated conservative pundit and the author of such instant bestsellers as Kill Them and Eat Them ; and where Richard Perle hosts the NeoCon Game Show, awarding fabulous prizes to the contestant with the most outlandishly wrong answers. Welcome to the world of Tom Tomorrow, whose subversive new anthology skewers the absurdities of American political culture -- and the depravities of the Bush era -- with the sardonic wit and keen insight his many loyal readers have come to expect. From Hurricane Katrina to the latest presidential campaign, these cartoons provide an unflinching look at where we've been -- and just how bright we can expect the future to be.",
