  "description": "Astronomicon minorem - DMT, Cthulhu and YouThe Book of Devouring Stars, written by Khurt Khave, head priest of the First United Church of Cthulhu, provides church doctrine of the Great Old Ones and describes how you can open the astral gates and contact these otherworldly beings.Discover how H. P. Lovecraft's night terrors were not merely a case of hereditary acute psychosis but his vivid visits to the Dreamlands, and in fact the inspiration for the entire Cthulhu Mythos, were actually caused by an overproduction of naturally-occurring endogenous dimethyltryptamine, DMT, within the brain of our mad prophet.Was it plagiarism, homage, or a shared madness? We discuss other similar works by authors Edgar Allan Poe, Robert W. Chambers, and Ambrose Bierce.Meet the brave psychonauts who traveled to aether space and beyond the veil to bring back knowledge of alien worlds. Terence McKenna, Rick Strassman, and Joe Rogan are all avatars who have contacted the Great Old Ones. Other artists predating Lovecraft had similar dark visions of strange lands. Gustave Dore, Josef Vachal, and Alfred Kubin. Learn of the ceremonies and holidays of the First United Church of Cthulhu. Also learn the way of Peace, Love and Tentacles or, Human Sacrifice - You're Doing It Wrong. And, of course, we *touch* on the over 500 year history of tentacle porn. Beyond anything you will read in those other fake Necromonicon knock-offs. This is Lovecraft for the 21st century.",
