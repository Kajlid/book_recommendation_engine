  "description": "Love can lead you astray. . . All Xavier Hunter wants is to stay out of trouble, keep his grades high enough for a college scholarship--and get out of the hood for good. But when he spots hot new girl Samantha Fox, he'll do anything for her--even try to live on both sides of the fence. To prove he's everything she could want, he's convinced he'll have to up his game--and score way, way out of his league. . . Samantha is used to guys thinking they can roll right up on her. But she can tell Xavier is about a lot more than just racking up mad paper. What she's starting to feel for him is getting all too real. And every move they make is bringing them--and bad news--dangerously close. . .\"",
