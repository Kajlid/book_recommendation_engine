  "description": "'I think sheep are soppy', said Ben scornfully.Beth and Ben's father suggested counting sheep jumping over a gate, to help them go to sleep. But Ben thought dragons would be much more interesting than ordinary old sheep, so he sent them jumping over the gate instead! What he hadn't intended, though, was for his ninety-nine greedy green dragons to jump into the same field as Beth's fifty sweet little sheep!",
