  "title": "The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse",
  "description": "Based on the author's extensive training and experience in working with abuse survivors, The Survivor's Guide to Sex offers an affirming, sex-positive approach to recovery from incest and rape. While most books on the topic broach sexuality only to reassure women that it is alright to say \"no\" to unwanted sex, this one encourages women to learn how to say \"yes\" to their own desires and on their own terms.Points of discussion include problems common to women survivors. Haines teaches survivors to embrace their own sexual choices and preferences, learn about their own sexual response cycles, and heal through masturbation, sexual fantasy, and play. The Survivor's Guide to Sex includes resources, bibliography, and an index.",
