From mountain to rocket ship, a small rabbit shows that a box will go as far as the imagination allows.Inspired by a memory of sitting in a box on her driveway with her sister, Antoinette Portis captures the thrill when pretend feels so real that it actually becomes real â€” when the imagination takes over and inside a cardboard box, a child is transported to a new world where anything is possible.Dedicated to children everywhere sitting in cardboard boxes.",
