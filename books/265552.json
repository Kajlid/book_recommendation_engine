  "description": "Read all three books in the complete Snow Queen series: Heart of Ice, Sacrifice, and Snowflakes in this special collection.  Rakel is a princess who should have been queen.  Instead, as a despised magic user she has spent most of her life exiled on a barren mountain, alone in her ice-castle. She longs for acceptance but lives with the constant fear that her brother, the King, will order her execution.  Her empty life changes forever when an army of magic users invade her home country. Their powerful leader is known for his cruelty and darkness, but one of his colonels is different.  When Colonel Farrin Graydim meets Rakel he is immediately intrigued by her. Her harsh rejection of an offer to join their cause only deepens his interest. He admires her unflinching strength, but his bloody past makes him utterly unworthy to stand beside the purity of her ice and snow.  But Rakel refuses to watch as the people whoâ€™ve scorned her are attacked, imprisoned, and even killed by the invading army. Swallowing her fear, she joins forces with her jailers and uses her magic in a way she never anticipated: on the battlefield.  Can Rakel defeat the invasion and free not only her people, but Farrin as well? For if she cannot defend her homeland, all will be lost.
