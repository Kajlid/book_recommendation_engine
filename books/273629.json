  "description": "Ever since Melanie's mom married Kurt's dad she's had the hots for the gorgeous, off-limits guy. Knowing Kurt feels the same way doesn't help her lust, but through and unspoken agreement they ignore their forbidden feelings. Then Kurt drives her to a modeling shoot for an exercise book and winds up volunteering to model as her partner. What neither of them know is that the exercises in the book are all sexual--a modern Kama Sutra. Melanie tries to ignore the sparks flying between her and Kurt, even when they have to get naked and pose for pictures that are both explicit and erotic. But how can she resist giving in to her feelings? Will she and Kurt be able to keep from crossing the invisible line between them or will they give in to temptation in order to get every shot... Picture Perfect? *Author's note--do you love steamy audio books? Picture Perfect was featured on Read Me Romance Podcast in April 2019--be sure to check it out! *Please note--Picture Perfect was originally published in 2008 by another publisher. Now that I have the rights to the book back, I am re-publishing with a sexy new cover but the content is the same. Enjoy! ; )",
