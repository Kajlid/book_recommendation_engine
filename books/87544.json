  "description": "In this paranormal fantasy, a modern woman meets a time traveler, journeys with him to the past, and endeavors to help an aristocratic woman and an endangered child, who are in dire need of protection. Before she can complete her task, she may need to resort to a little murder and experience a bit of Hellfire, but that's to be expected when the threads of time are ruled by sexist Thraeder pigs. Fortunately, a certain irresistible man (who happens to be the ultimate feminist) makes everything worthwhile in the end. CATEGORY: Time Travel Romance. (Not, in general, for sexist Thraeder pigs.)",
