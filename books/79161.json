Will they be successful? Will they make it back?  OMG begins when Kelly, whose parents died in a car accident, moves from Texas during early summer to live with her Aunt Jane who is an assistant district attorney. Kelly quickly becomes friends with her quirky next door neighbor Scott who has a reputation as the school’s number one geek.  Scott’s best friend is Austin, the hot and popular quarterback. Even though he runs with the cool crowd, he has stayed loyal to Scott. He joins Scott and Kelly as they embark on an adventure after Scott invents a way to travel back in time.  Zoey is on the cheer squad and hangs with the popular kids. She barely even notices that Scott and Kelly exist, but she is very focused on getting Austin’s attention.  Through a twist of technology, they go back in time to find a girl who has begged for their help. They solve the mystery, but are then faced with the dilemma of whether or not to right a wrong or to let history stand. The four end up on the time travel adventure of their lives.[CUL8R is a registererd trademark of Nightwriter93]",
