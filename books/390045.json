  "title": "A Monastic Landscape: The Cistercians in Medieval Ireland",
  "description": "This book offers a fascinating insight into some of the majestic ruins that dot the Irish landscape. These Cistercian monasteries were repositories of prayer, learning, physical labour, exquisite stone structure and so much more. This text explores the monasteries, monastic estates and their management but, crucially, for the first time in many cases lists the lands associated with many of the Cistercian monasteries in the east and southeast of Ireland. This publication is not intended as a full history of the Order in medieval Ireland; rather it is compiled to provide a sound basis for the others to continue exploring this wonderful aspect of Irish history. Included is a convenient guide for visitors to Ireland. Listed are the most extensive remains, how to get there and what to see; a must have for any trip to Ireland.",
