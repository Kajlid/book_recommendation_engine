  "description": "What began in the The Finest Line and escalated in A Line Crossed, is now concluded in A Line Drawn. As Mairead looks to her future with James, their wedding on the horizon, she is plagued with the demons of her past. One of them seems to have invaded her life, but Mairead is uncertain whether she is the victim of a tortured mind, or the prey of an evil man. Separating reality from a nightmare is difficult, but Mairead is certain that she is not alone in uninvited attention. Someone has an unhealthy interest in James, which is only increasing her troubles. Knowing that her willful nature often leads to trouble, Mairead tries to find peace in obedience, but submitting to such a dominant man has its own painful problems. As their happiness is threatened, Mairead must decide whether submission is the answer, or is it time for a little defiance?",
