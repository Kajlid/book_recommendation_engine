But that’s not what I’m looking for now.  I came up rough and hard. I learned how to survive on the streets. But somehow my true identity was kept from me. Filling me with a lust for vengeance.  A web of lies was woven about me keeping me tightly ensnared. But now that web is beginning to disintegrate. Pieces of the puzzle are starting to come together. For the first time, I’m beginning to see the real me.  But completing the puzzle will prove to be my most daunting challenge yet. The journey to self-discovery is fraught with rage….betrayal…danger….lust….and passion.  With a beautiful woman I may not even deserve at my side, I will face the dark past. For where I was once looking for vengeance, I will now find redemption. Wicked Redemption.  This is a panty melting dark alpha male romance. It is a 60,000 word full length book. Don't read unless you like roller coaster ride uncontrollable passion!",
