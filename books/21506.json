  "description": "A guinea pig in Central Park? PeeWee, once a boy's dear pet, has been secretly released into the wilds of Central Park. But instead of relishing his freedom, PeeWee is at first a stranger in a strange land--until he meets Lexi, a city-wise squirrel who gives his new stubby-tailed friend some tips as well as some confidence. A series of eye-opening adventures—from the search for PeeWee's former owner to his discovery of the power of reading—turns a timid rodent into an endearing hero that will leave Hurwitz fans cheering for more.",
