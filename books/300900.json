  "description": "Amrita of Eloquence is a luminous portrait of the life of Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, one of the Kagyu lineage's most beloved and revered teachers. Beautifully written by Lama Karma Drod√ºl (Rinpoche's nephew and disciple) and elegantly translated by Yeshe Gyamtso, Amrita of Eloquence describes Khenpo Rinpoche and his life with humor, lyrical beauty, and boundless affection. Born in eastern Tibet in 1924, Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche is one of the great masters of the Karma Kagyu tradition. Rinpoche received most of his training and education in Tibet before the Chinese invasion and is highly accomplished in meditation, philosophy, and monastic arts. As abbot of a monastery in Woodstock, New York; spiritual guide of thirty-five Karma Thegsum Choling (KTC) affiliate centers, and retreat master at the Karme Ling Retreat Center in Delhi, New York, Rinpoche has touched the lives of thousands of students. He is also known for numerous books, including \nThe Quintessence of the Union of Mahamudra and Dzokchen\n.",
