  "description": "Khalil is an American. He was born here, and he grew up here. And yet he feels he’s not allowed to dream the same dream as other Americans. While he is liked and respected at school, and he dates a popular girl, he is called names and is discriminated against. And while he is taught that opportunities for success after high school exist for all, Khalil finds his future looks bleak. When his parents have to move back to eastern Europe to assist the family they’ve left behind, he feels even more lost. That’s when his older brother begins sharing radical ideas that are not in line with the faith in which Khalil has been raised. That’s when things spin out of control.",
