  "title": "The Lost Queen of Egypt",
  "description": "Soon to be back in print from Purple House Press!In the city of Akhetaten lived a princess, Ankhsenpaaten (later Ankhsenamon), who grew up in the royal household, one of six daughters of King Ahkenaten and Queen Nefertiti. We come to know and love this girl, called Small Bird by her family, through the events of her colorful childhood and her marriage to Tutankhaten, a boy of royal birth. Her efforts to save the kingdom from conniving priests and soldiers were gallant and dramatic.While the fate of the Queen is unknown, in her story Lucile Morrison ventures to suppose a satisfying ending to the romance. An extraordinarily accurate, vivid picture of domestic and court life which will enrich any study of the culture of ancient Egypt.Illustrations by Franz Geritz, done in the style of ancient Egypt, help set the mood of AnkhsenÂ­amon's story as the clock is turned back more than three thousand years. Color frontispiece and newly recolored map end pages.",
