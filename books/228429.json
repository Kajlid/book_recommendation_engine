  "description": "Love wasn't part of the deal.\n  It's hard to turn down a million dollars, especially when you're flat broke and a few steps from living in the streets. That's why Trystan Raines agrees to a proposition from a stranger to act as a male escort for a month. He's done worse things for less money, and he does love men. What he doesn't know is that his new client isn't human -- and now he's contracted to serve Braelan, the prince of the Seelie Fae.  Uriskel also serves the prince, but his sentence is far longer: life, without the possibility of parole. Enslaved to the Seelie Court for as long as he can remember, Uriskel has no choice but to accompany Braelan and his new pet to the human realm as a 'bodyguard' -- though it's really just a cover for the prince to find new ways to abuse him.  Trystan thinks Uri's a bastard. Uri thinks Trystan is a fool. But the more time they spend scrambling to serve the prince's whims, the more they uncover a powerful mutual attraction neither can deny.  However, the only way Braelan will allow them to be together is over Uriskel's dead body.",
