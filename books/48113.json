  "description": "The Millie the Mouth ebook is available on Amazon, iTunes and everywhere else for $2.99. To view the audio book and hear the song, please visit http:/www.milliethemouth.com.In this charming homage to Dr Seuss, Sara and Paul are bored, but that soon changes when Sara gets some juice and finds a huge mouse sitting in the fridge.Her name is Millie, and when Sara is surprised that she can talk, she says, “Of course I talk! I’m a talking pro! I’m not an ordinary mouse, you know.” She then announces that she is hungry, and decides to make a chicken pot pie. “Get me a bowl and the right ingredients, and in no time at all, I’ll be feeding us.”And what goes into a chicken pot pie? Everything, apparently. “I’ll use whatever you have in the house. I’m a very, very unpredictable mouse.” So they collect everything they can find, and mix it all together, and then the adventure takes a strange twist, and Sara and Paul discover that Millie is even more talented than they thought she was.Kirkus reviews says, “French’s charming tale has an exuberance and wit that should delight any child. The big, brassy, enthusiastic personality of Millie will jump off the page; some readers will take to Millie as a much beloved partner in crime when she urges the twins not to tell their mother about dinner since ‘she’ll spoil the fun.’ French’s simple but enchanting and expressive illustrations display the mischievous Millie in a variety of moods and poses. Lively and active, the drawings depict the entire story for children who can’t read, culminating in a humorous climax.A delightful children’s tale with an engaging, larger-than-life lead character.”",
