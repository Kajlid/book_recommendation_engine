  "description": "Lilie never thought her life would change so drastically when she crawled into bed that night. She never believed what everyone said about her neighbor either. Mr. Clem, crazy? No... That is, until she finds him driving spikes into the ground in the middle of a vicious storm, wearing nothing but his pajamas and a ratty bathrobe. The retired engineer couldn't have prepared Lil for what was about to happen next. Things don't go as they should and one well aimed lighting jolt sends her careening through a portal of some sort, a worm hole to an alternate dimension. Miss Lilie shoots straight through to the other side, landing herself smack dab in the middle of a strange alien world with an unfamiliar setting. What's a gal to do when she suddenly finds herself being chased by an angry, bellowing red creature that looks like something straight out of science fiction movie. A demon, an angry looking demon.Will Lil make it out of this alive? or will she ultimately end up demon fodder? or is that what he'd even had in mind at all? What will happen to Lil as she navigates her way through this strange new world....Reader Advisory: This book contains menage a trois sex scenes, one woman with multiple partners (m/f/m) (no m/m) and mild violence.",
