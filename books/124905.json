  "title": "Go Woke, Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America",
  "description": "A riveting and smashmouth journalistic deep-dive into the progressive madness that has infected and corrupted the world’s biggest corporations, threatening the stability of the global economy—and life as we know it.   Intimidated by activists on the left, virtually every major corporation in America has embraced woke politics. For years, these businesses could get away with progressive virtual signaling without worrying about alienating customers. But things have changed. As high-profile backlashes at companies like Anheuser-Busch, Disney, and Target show us, customers are fighting back. Companies who cave to the demands of left-wing social justice activists are being punished like never before.   In Go Woke, Go Broke, New York Times bestselling author and veteran Fox Business financial journalist Charles Gasparino takes readers inside these disastrous corporate backlashes. A respected financial reporter who has covered finance for more than 30 years, Gasparino is deeply sourced and has dug into countless episodes involving Wall Street greed, corporate hubris, and government overreach in enterprise. Gasparino traces the origins of ESG and \"stakeholder investing\" and takes readers along on a ride as he shines a light on Fortune 500 companies that have suffered financially for caving to the silly and irresponsible demands of social justice activists and left-wing interests.   This explosive, in-depth investigation into the seminal players, institutions, and forces of the markets shows that, for the sake of global stability, we must immediately pry the clenched fists of radical activists off the levers of the economy.",
