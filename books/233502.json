  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B0719N46B4.)  It’s fake, but it feels so good.   Oliver Steele is supposed to be my knight in shining armor. He’s tall, handsome, and as cocky as he is rich. With his good looks and charm, no one’s going to suspect a thing. No one’s going to believe our engagement is fake.  But he’s taking this thing way too far. The way he wraps his arm around me like I'm his. The way he kisses me and presses his hard body up against mine. I almost believe that it's real. Almost.  He's doing it on purpose now; he loves that this is getting to me.  Two can play his game, though. I won’t let him win. By the time our week together is done, I’ll leave Oliver on his knees and begging.  But the minute we’re alone in the bedroom, I know I’m in over way my head. When he undresses me with his eyes, I realize I lost before the game even started. It’s only a matter of time before I lose myself in his touch and let him do whatever he wants to me.  I know what I want, but I can’t tell what’s real anymore.  Mr. Fiance is a full-length Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
