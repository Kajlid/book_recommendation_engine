  "description": "Samantha Rays is a twenty-year-old living in her father's cabin during the summer between her junior and senior year in college. She lives a normal and happy life, works to pay for school and spends time with her boyfriend. They go to parties in the woods, relax by the lake, and talk about spending their lives together. Flash forward one year, Samantha is sitting in the back office of a bank in Zurich. She's dressed nicely, but she's lost weight, she's pale, her eyes are dark with fatigue, and she's deathly quiet. A banker opens the door, sits across from her, and slides a statement across the table. He informs her that she has 25 million dollars in her bank account. The account was opened a year before she was born with very strict instructions never to send out any statements. No one has ever inquired about it since it was opened, and something is drastically out of place. Twenty-three years in the past, Samantha's father Mark is working for the largest investor of an international oil conglomerate. Mark is diligently overseeing construction of 1,800 miles of oil pipeline south of Amman, Jordan to ensure no corners are cut and no security gap has been overlooked. His assistant Clair looks remarkably like Samantha. The story begins to flip back and forth between the past, present and future to explain what happened to Samantha over that year. Beginning with a pleasant summer in the woods, and ending with the resolution of a twenty-three year old international secret that is more relevant today than ever, and that not even the highest authorities want revealed.",
