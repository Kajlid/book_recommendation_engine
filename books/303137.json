  "description": "Lin Su Yoshimura, trained in martial arts at a young age by her parents, is kidnapped as a teen in China and sold into the sex trafficking trade which lands her in the United States of America. She is rescued from an abusive sex pimp by Matthew King, New York drug dealer. Lin Su becomes a part of his organization as she wrestles with the horrors of her past. They are approached by Jason Stone, a disgraced ex-Special Forces officer, who convinces them to raid Juan Ramirez, leader of a notorious Mexican cartel. Stone assembles a team of well-trained mercenaries accompanied by Lin Su and King to carry out the operation deep in the Mexican jungle which leads to a huge cache of cocaine plus savage outcomes that neither expected. Pursued by the cartel, the mob, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and a Muslim community activist, Lin Su must make a choice before time runs out. She must decide to use her skills and defend the organization or address the dark demons that haunt her within. The stakes are high, forty million dollars in cash or their lives!",
