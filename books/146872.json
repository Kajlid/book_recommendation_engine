  "description": "I own women. It’s the chase that gets me, that look in their eyes when they surrender.Until Sarah.She won’t give in and I won’t give up… until she is mine, even if she has to suffer.But in her eyes I don’t see surrender. I see something darker, something dangerous and there’s a twinge in my gut that tells me I might’ve just picked the wrong woman.",
