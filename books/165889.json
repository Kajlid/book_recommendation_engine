  "description": "In an alternate universe, the ancient concept of a slave class continues to exist. While a few countries have finally ended the brutal practice, the United States isn’t one of them. Once born a slave, one remains a slave, with only a few laws for protection against the whims of a cruel master.Eighteen-year-old Oliver is a newly-minted pleasure slave. Trained to be a living sex toy, he has been sold to a wealthy widower. Being gay, Oliver has high hopes he will enjoy his new life. Unfortunately, his master has a sadistic streak and treats him like an object. Oliver has no choice but to endure and make the best of his lot.Ben has reluctantly come home to help his father temporarily with the family business. He’s surprised to learn his father has bought a beautiful young slave boy to warm his bed. He doesn’t approve of slavery and is disconcerted by his attraction to the boy. Oliver is equally wary of Ben’s kindness and appeal. No other free person has ever treated him with such care.There can never be anything between them, however, so they fight their growing desire. But despite their resolve, Oliver and Ben grow closer, tumbling into a clandestine affair. In a world in which slaves have no choice and falling in love with a freeman is the stuff of movies, they risk everything to be together.",
