(Unfortunately that's no longer a thing - sorry.)You'll get answers to questionsWhy did patients gargle with wee?How did a doctor save people's lives using a washing machine, a can of beans and some old sausages?What was the great stink? (No, it's not what doctors call your bum.)If you're sure you're ready, then pop a peg on your nose (there was a lot of stinky pus back then), pull on your wellies (there was a lot of poo there too), wash your hands (because they certainly didn't) and explore this gross and gruesome history of the human body!Praise for Kay's'An enjoyably gross look at the human body.
