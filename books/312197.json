  "title": "Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book Of Homeschooling",
  "description": "The classic and indispensable work on teaching children at home, fully updated for today's new laws, new lifestyles, and the growing new generation of homeschooling parents Today more than one and a half million children are being taught at home by their own parents. In this expanded edition of the book that helped launch the whole movement, Pat Farenga has distilled John Holt's timeless understanding of the ways children come to understand the world and added up-to-the-moment legal, financial, and logistical advice. No parent even considering homeschooling should be without this wise and unique reference. Rather than proposing that parents turn their homes into miniature schools, Holt and Farenga demonstrate how ordinary parents can help children grow as social, active learners. Chapters on living with children, \"serious play,\" children and work, and learning difficulties will fascinate and encourage parents and help them enjoy each \"homeschool\" day. John Holt's warm understanding of children and his passionate belief in every child's ability to learn have made this book the bible of homeschooling families everywhere.",
