  "title": "Alchemy of the Human Spirit: A Guide to Human Transition Into the New Age",
  "description": "Published in 1995, this third Kryon book was the largest so far... 376 pages. It continued the lineage of practical information, gave the best channellings of 1995, and broached some new subjects (like ascension and responsibility). The attribute that marks book three is all the MATH (gulp). The reference to 9944 is researched by two mathematicians, and an entire treatise on the value of pi is given (since Kryon tells us that our pi is incorrect. Kryon tells us that it reflects a sacred elegance, and is a whole number!).",
