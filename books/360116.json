  "description": "Here is the powerful and inspiring novel that has guided hundreds of thousands of people and given them strength and comfort. The kindly Dean Harcourt with his simple wisdom has encouraged many to write to Lloyd Douglas for advice and help. He has brought pleasure, solace and inspiration into many lives. Dean Harcourt, of a Middle-western cathedral, is the motivational force in this story of present-day America. The dean had been crippled by infantile paralysis early in his career and his subsequent suffering had made him more aware when the time came to right the wrong done to a young surgeon. He is also instrumental in bringing about the happiness of lonely, young Phyllis Dexter.The Chicago Daily Tribune says, \"There is something of the simple faith in it that has been proclaimed to be more than Norman blood.\"",
