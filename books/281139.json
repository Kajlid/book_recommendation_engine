  "description": "My name is Tamsin Vale and my life is radically different from a few months ago. I’m a college freshman who didn’t finish high school. I’ve inherited more money than I could ever spend after nineteen years of never having much of anything.  I’m the last fairy… And no one knows what happened to the rest of them.  That doesn’t even cover half of it. I’m having hot sex with a dragon prince that I have some weird energy thing with. Then there’s my sexy professor who I can’t seem to stop crossing lines with when I know it’s stupid.  My best friend—who has turned out to be from a dragon knight clan—now works for the college and is helping to keep me safe. And it’s needed since I’m drawing attention with being powerful as an unknown.  Also, because I’m not declaring my species—but how can I when some people on campus can tell if I’m lying? And telling the truth isn’t an option.  Not if I want to stay alive, much less pass the semester. At least I have the school’s best tutor helping me and I like a challenge.  Including handling the impossible, like trying to save all of Faerie.  Artemis University a hot burning reverse harem, university-age paranormal academy series with darker elements, strong language, violence, and a heroine who follows her own moral compass of what is right… And who she ends up giving her heart to.",
