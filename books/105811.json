  "description": "Cara Cassidy, a Dublin tree surgeon, is having a tough May weekend. Her landlady has given her notice. Cara’s in the middle of organising an international convention for the high intelligence group Irish Mensa. Visiting American tobacco heiress Laurel Cabot – who has married a Dubliner with the paper title of the Baron of Ballymun – is murdered and her priceless diamond necklace stolen. Both the Gardai and Interpol believe that the killer is among the guests. Amid visits to the National Stud and Trinity College, Cara, newly elected Chairman of Irish Mensa, does some investigating, with the aid of Mike Fraser, a Scottish guest. The Mensa members trust her, but some people would prefer their secrets to remain hidden…. By the Amazon No. 1 Bestselling author of MURDER AGAINST THE CLOCK and SILKS AND SINS. Clare O'Beara won the Arkady Renko short story competition held by Simon & Schuster in 2014 and judged by Martin Cruz Smith. \"Please congratulate Clare O'Beara for me for her clever short, short story 'London Calling.' I appreciate that she treated Arkady kindly, taking his age into consideration, and managed to cross the finish line with a different sort of twist.\" - Martin Cruz Smith.",
