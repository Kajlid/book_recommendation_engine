  "description": "Karen Baicker's can-do heroine is back. This time, instead of figuring out what she has to learn, as she did in I Can Do It Too! , she is teaching her young sibling everything she thinks he needs to know. From banging a spoon on the back of a pan for music to march by to spitting straight into the sink when it is tooth-brushing time, the big sister is very busyâ€”so busy that it takes a while for her to realize that her little brother can do something she cannot! Ken Wilson-Max's vivid, posterlike illustrations and Karen Baicker's simple, family-friendly poetry make this reading pleasure for toddlers, their older siblings, and the grown-ups who love them.",
