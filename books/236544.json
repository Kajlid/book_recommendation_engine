Wealth, power, respect, beautiful women eager to marry him—there is very little the Chief Mage of Nebara lacks in his life.  Except, perhaps, compassion.  Mages are taught from an early age to rein in their emotions, that they are superior to humans and shifters, and that they must rule with a firm, unyielding hand. But when an execution order for a little girl crosses Lord Polar’s desk, his entire world view is called into question. Especially when he realizes the depth of corruption within his own office.  Saving the life of an innocent child should not be a hard choice. But if Polar helps her, his own life will be at risk. And with enemies lurking in the shadows, waiting for him to fall, he cannot afford a single misstep…   Scroll up and grab your copy today!",
