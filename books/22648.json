  "description": "The epic saga advances, as the shadows deepen ... Friedrich accompanies the powerful Avatar Enki into the depths of the Abyss. They seek to discover the fate of Erishkegal, who crossed the Veil to spare a horde of outcast Nephilim ages ago. The quest will take them to the brink of hell itself, but it is one that may hold astounding revelations. Elsewhere, martial law is installed across the UCAS during the outbreak of a deadly virus, and the onset of a war to the Far East threatening the stability of the entire world. The imposition of a diabolical technology looms, as centuries-old organizations in the service of Adonai race to confront the looming menace. Ex-marine Gregory Andreas leads a budding resistance to the authoritarian government, while Dagian Underwood, the mastermind behind the oncoming Living ID technology, reaches out to the dark realm of Set to gain the help of an ally with a rare, formidable ability. Seth Engel and his teenage friends venture forth once again to seek proof of spreading rumors; this time of rounded-up townspeople being herded into large detainment facilities close to Godwinton. Even the shape shifting An-Ki are caught in the maelstrom of uncertainty. Godral and the others of Sargor's clan struggle to find their place in the strange modern world, while Uria leads his renegade new clan into the unknown. Threads intertwine as the dangers escalate swiftly. The Seventh Throne will leave the reader hungry for the next installment, after a revelation of tremendous magnitude culminates the latest Rising Dawn Saga adventure.",
