  "description": "It wasn’t all that much as summer jobs went. The pay sucked harder than a backed-up toilet and the office that I was given would have stood in nicely as a broom closet – if you had got around to giving it a proper paint job and maybe a window or two to peek out from.  It was the peeking that started the whole thing.  Jenny should have known better than to kneel down and peek through that peephole in the back of her closet/office. She should have known better than to drop her track shorts and do what she did. And she DEFINITELY should have kept an eye on what was going on behind her as well as staring so intently at what was going on the other side of that peephole.  This three thousand word short story is just long enough to get the job done. I ought to warn you gentler readers that this story contains some explicit content that might offend folks with a delicate disposition. I should also warn you that after reading a Tug Johnson Hot Tale spontaneous combustion has been known to occur.  Don't say I did not warn you.",
