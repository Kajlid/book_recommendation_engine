  "description": "Lucius is a lone werewolf who was disowned by his pack along time ago because he behaved completely differently from the rest of the pack. Once when he was on a prowl, he heard a cry for help from a ten-year-old boy and decided he would help him, killing and eating his parents in the process. Ever since then, he and the boy, Jonathan, have been inseparable companions.  But now, Jonathan is a grown man and Lucius is slowly falling in love with him. Will they overcome all the obstacles that are in their way? Will Jonathan be able to accept Lucius as his lover, given the fact that they are a different species and are both men--not to mention they are both like family to one another?",
