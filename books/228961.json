  "title": "Lucia Zarate",
  "description": "Lucia Z치rate is based on the poignant, real-life odyssey of the world's smallest woman. Pretty and gregarious, Lucia Z치rate was just twenty inches tall. A celebrity after her 'display' at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial International Exhibition, Lucia's extraordinary, heartbreaking story is one of exploitation by greedy sideshow hucksters and a fishbowl existence on the road, from New York to Victorian London. We follow the adventures of diminutive Lucia Z치rate and her devoted governess as they grapple with life and death, finding joy and adventure in their bumpy sideshow journey of more than fourteen years. This is an artfully balanced novel that is a mesmerizing tale of survival, resilience, and the uplifting force of friendship.",
