  "description": "Sarah Jessica Parker has said about this book: \"What a great story!\" From the outside looking in, Lily Lockwood--popular star of the hit TV show \"St. Joes\"--seems to have it all. She has recently been nominated for an Emmy and her star is on the rise. Lily shares her beachfront Malibu home with her gorgeous actor-boyfriend Jamie. Perfect? Not so fast. Within a microcosmically short period of time, the whole thing falls apart when she learns that this boyfriend, on location shooting a Western, is riding horses all day and his curvy co-star all night. Then, before Lily can catch her breath, she gets words that her beloved mother, bestselling author Daisy Lockwood, has had a near-fatal car crash and is in intensive care in New York.  Lily flies from Los Angeles to be with Daisy. Once there, she must make critical life-and-death decisions. While sorting through her mother's papers, Lily makes a shocking discovery about her mother that threatens to shake Lily's very foundation. This sets Lily on a journey as she seeks to unlock the riddle of her mother's past.www.theseedsofadaisy.com Itunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-...Paperback: https://www.createspace.com/4081993Amazon Paperback and Kindlehttp://www.amazon.com/Alison-Caiola/e...Nook Barnes and Noble http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-s...",
