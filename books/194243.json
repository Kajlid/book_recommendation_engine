  "description": "\"Not your ordinary rock n' roll read! Although Rogue is a world famous rock band, the characters have depth, are well developed, and their celebrity takes a back seat to a thoughtful, sweet, and interesting story line. It's a really lovely book about relationships and the human spirit, and it moves along at such a pace that keeps the reader enthralled. Lara Ward Cosio is a seriously promising writer, and I'm definitely looking forward to more in this series.\" - Miriam (reader review) Playing At Love is a glam, globetrotting exploration of the complications of friend and love relationships that will leave you rooting for the rogue(ish) heroes. Conor Quinn and Gavin McManus are mired deep in the wreckage of a betrayal that has damaged their friendship, ended Gavin’s marriage, and threatens to break up their band. Conor’s shaken by the mess he’s made and no longer trusts his heart. Book smart but love dumb, he decides acting with more calculation in matters of the heart is the key to moving forward. He starts by wooing back his ex, Colette, and quickly ends up engaged—and in over his head. When Conor’s old schoolmate, Felicity, unexpectedly returns to his world, he gravitates with increasing frequency toward their renewed friendship. Harmless flirting soon turns into real temptation and suddenly Conor’s questioning whether his impetuous reunion with Colette means he’s missed his chance with the right woman. Felicity is still stinging from a brutal divorce and wary of her old friend’s rock star ways. She wants stability, not the boy who ran off to join the rock circus and never had a proper job or responsibilities. But that doesn’t mean she’s immune to his charms. At the same time, wounded, passionate singer Gavin has a song-writing epiphany that convinces him he can't stay stuck in the past. And he knows what matters most is his wife, since he refuses to believe their love story is over. As Conor’s wedding rapidly approaches and Gavin attempts to reunite with his wife, both men must also find a way to keep their band together as they strive and stumble toward something resembling redemption—with each other and with the women they’re meant to be with.",
