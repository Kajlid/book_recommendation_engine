He did one thing right: he produced an heir. But nothing could save him from a tragedy so great, it caused the De la Cova heir to skip town…putting Claudia right where she belongs—in position as the Queen.Finally, under her leadership, she takes the family business in her direction, shaping the organization to her satisfaction…until her nephew returns wanting the throne he believes is his.Claudia has a shock for him, though. She isn’t giving up her empire without one hell of a fight, and if that means spilling family blood to keep it, then so be it. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time.",
