This is an intriguing history of the condom and an unusual unraveling of the politics and culture that surround this most practical item.This Trigger Issues book takes in the early history of contraception—think crocodile dung and sea sponges, the rubber revolution of the early 1900s and female liberation through birth control, the role of the condom in the front line against HIV/AIDS, and Bush’s “war on the condom.” It then looks ahead to a high-tech future of spray-on and liquid condoms.Buy the book direct from New Internationalist",
