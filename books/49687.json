  "description": "Sometimes taking a chance on a stranger is worth the risk ... The Fairy's Assistant is a stranger wherever he goes, except to the knight determined to capture him once and for all. The Prince of the Moon desperately seeks to break the curse on his kingdom, but will the stranger who arrives to help him prove to be only a hindrance? In Learning to See a man saves his family by sacrificing everything to a stranger in a mysterious castle. Cinder-Elle lost his birthright alongside his vision, and his dreary days are brightened only by a man he met by chance in the marketplace, a man about whom he knows very little â€¦ and Capture the Moon is about a woman who leaves home in the guise of a boy to see what the world has to offer.Show more Show less",
