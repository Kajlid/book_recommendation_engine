  "description": "There have been no communiques from Earth post Singularity. The Martian colonists wonder if the race abandoned space-time altogether. But for now, they have bigger problems. Their sun is going supernova well ahead of schedule. The two greatest minds of the time, one a scientist, the other a philosopher, concoct a two-pronged plan to save the human race. Frakas, the bioengineer, will continue to seed humanoid and increasingly alien lifeforms across the heavens using space warping ships. But higher consciousness isn't exactly his specialty. And the one man who can be bothered to think beyond mean survival, his philosopher friend, Draxor, must be cloned before he passes. Only he can continue to uplift the ragtag worlds of hearty pioneers with little time to savor the finer things in life. Only he can ensure that, for those who choose to remain in the physical universe post Singularity, evolution will win out against the increasingly stronger pull towards barbarism. Thus is born the first of The Hundred Year Clones who reigns before passing the torch to the next in line. There is just one problem. The Hundred Year Clones are just prototypes--and they're flawed.",
