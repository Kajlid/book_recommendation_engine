  "description": "Ufrid Tyrunath, the heir apparent to the throne of Ulmenir, has been a hero, a leader, and a traitor. He’s colluded with the Shadow Master, murdered his father, and raped his brother’s wife. In retribution, he’s been forced into slavery to an ancient half-elf female, grandmother of the woman he can never have. How can life get any worse? Oh, it can get much worse, if one has crossed the line of social decency and taken a certain renegade monk for a lover. Slavery will seem an easy burden by the time Ufrid learns the truth of former Abbot Herfod, revered living saint of the Turamen Order. And the promise of death will be but a small price to pay for having earned the secret. (Second Edition. Content warning: Adult fiction. This novel is the seventh in The Soulstone Chronicles.)",
