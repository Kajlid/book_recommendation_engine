  "description": "Evolved Publishing presents a dark, epic fantasy unlike any other you've read. [DRM-Free] \"Conklin writes with a poet’s flair, using minimal words to deliver maximum dramatic impact. Visceral, shocking, and deeply imaginative, Eulogy pushes to the edge . . . and then dives right over it. An unapologetic, no-holds-barred descent into madness—yet there is method in it. Readers with the fortitude to take the plunge stand to be rewarded with what may go down as one of the most ambitious, redefining forays into epic fantasy of all time.\" - Eldon Thompson, author of \"The Divine Talisman\" 'They’ll stand amongst the corpses of the beloved.' That’s what he said at the end. I never considered myself one of the beloved. Not at the beginning. At that time, I was simply a terrified woman. Now… now I understand. Maybe I wish I didn’t. Void take me, this is so demon-damned hard. In the beginning he loved me. Irony, it twists and twirls like a lover’s song, but this is hardly a lover’s tale. It's one of blades and blood. I wish I could’ve seen it sooner, but that would’ve been too easy. I wouldn’t have learned to truly love him. Through the years, Irreor had trained Kipra, taught her everything his father taught him, and she was nearly as skilled as he with a blade. Yet there was more to it than that. She was a fingertip to a parted lip—silence that should’ve been said, yet words never spoken. He cared for her. Deeper than the deepest pool, he cared for her. Yet she’d never let him say it. And so he’d held his tongue. \"Some epic fantasies are straightforward tales of magic and adventure, where a band of heroes fights and defeats an evil overlord. 'Eulogy' is not such a tale. Conklin's book overflows with magic and adventure, but the book is a puzzle -- a maze of secrets and wonders, implications and hidden meanings. A treat for readers who love a challenge!\" - Tom Crosshill, Nebula-nominated author",
