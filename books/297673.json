  "description": "Do you like drunken heists, accidental time travel, wild magical battles, and twisted humor? If you answered yes to any of that, you’ll love the hilarious tale of an inept wizard with a drug problem, his cynical apprentice who can’t catch a break, and the monumental quest they never saw coming! Who ever said a story can't be whimsical and a little fucked up at the same time?Left with no career or prospects, the man known only as The Wizard is forced to devise a half-baked plan to steal a valuable artifact from the vault underneath the Circle of Mages. Lost in a labyrinth of tunnels, he stumbles upon a sinister conspiracy rooted in the heart of the kingdom. An evil cabal of sorcerers have been corrupting the land for centuries, hidden just below the capital. What he discovers is horrifying, even for a man of his dubious ethics.Will he be able to stop the dark devices at work, or will he be swallowed by them along the way?Wizardrous is an excellent choice for fantasy enthusiasts with a twisted sense of humor. It is packed to the page with madness, satire, and plenty of laughs! Even if you're not a big fan of fantasy, this book is great for anyone with a bit of a screwed up sense of humor.CONTENT Wizardrous is intended for mature audiences only. This book contains drugs, violence, heavy profanity, and moderate sexual content.(Please feel free to leave a review letting me know what you think! Even if you didn't enjoy it, I'd love to hear why. Constructive criticism is much appreciated.)",
