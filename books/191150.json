  "description": "A Collection of Oddities, Survivors, and Other Impossibilities. Step right up to the modern freakshow. We have mermaids, monsters, and more. You won't be disappointed, but you may not get out alive. UnCommon Bodies presents a collection of 20 beautifully irreverent stories which blend the surreal and the mundane. Together, the authors explore the lives of the odd, the unbelievable, and the impossible. Imagine a world where magic exists, where the physical form has the power to heal or repulse, where a deal with the devil means losing so much more than your soul.The authors: Christopher Godsoe, Philip Harris, Sessha Batto, Rebecca Poole, Brent Meske, Robb Grindstaff, Sally Basmajian, Michael Harris Cohen, Robert Pope, Jordanne Fuller, Deanne Charlton, Bey Deckard, Vasil Tuchkov, SM Johnson, PK Tyler, Laxmi Hariharan, Daniel Smith, Samantha Warren, Bob Williams, Kim Wells, Keira Michelle TelfordContents: * Saltwater Assassin (2015) / short story by Samantha Warren * We Is We / short story by Michael Harris Cohen * Don't Touch Me / short fiction by Bey Deckard * Undead Cyborg Girl / short fiction by Kim Wells * Skin / short fiction by Brent Meske * Scars: First Session / short fiction by Jordanne Fuller * Mermaids / short fiction by Robert Pope * In Her Image / short fiction by Vasil Tuchkov * It Runs in the Family / poem by Deanne Charlton * Brenga's Body / poem by Deanne Charlton * Eternity in a One-Night Stand / poem by Deanne Charlton * Reserved / short fiction by SM Johnson * UnTamed / short fiction by Laxmi Hariharan * Ruby and Deidre / short fiction by Robb Grindstaff * All the Devils / short fiction by Keira Michelle Telford * Ruby / short fiction by Bob Williams * Phantom Pain / short fiction by Philip Harris * Daedalus' Daughter / short fiction by P.
