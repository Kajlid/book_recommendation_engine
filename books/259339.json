  "description": "\"A book that can't be put down.. A star's confession that took guts.\" --VogueMore brutal than Mommie Dearest... More heartbreaking than Judy...Frances Farmer had everything. A latter-day Cinderella, she rose from a stormy, poverty-stricken childhood in Seattle to stardom on Broadway and in Hollywood in the turbulent thirties.She had beauty, talent, and a career that was a realization of the American Dream. Then it all fell apart. And Frances Farmer was plunged into an unending nightmare of madness and degradation, of cruelty beyond endurance... and terror beyond belief. This is her story-- and she lived it. \"If you never read anything else by an actress, read this.\" --Rex Reed\"Chilling and real.\" --Sun-Times (Chicago)\"Agonizingly candid... It will sear its impression on your mind... what a story it is!\" --John Barkham Reviews",
