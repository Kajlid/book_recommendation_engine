  "title": "The Book of Elizabeth",
  "description": "The world as we know it has vanished in the blink of an eye. All of human history, washed away. In its place, a new story of humanity, a story without the complications and twists we all know; a story without the Cold War, or Shakespeare. Without Christ.But there are echoes of our world - lone souls from all ages of our former history, shipwrecked in the new. Each and every one of them represents a living threat against the validity of this new, virgin history, none more so than the mysterious author of a subversive book passed in secret, and spoken of only in whisper. Elizabeth writes of England, of Israel and Egypt, all countries that never existed. She writes of a garden, and genesis. She writes of a promised land and a chosen people. Of revelation.The Book of Elizabeth is the moving journey of Englandâ€™s greatest monarch, Elizabeth I, who liberated from the constraints of her time, seeks a life free from the turmoil and strife that plagued it. In doing so, she opens a Pandora's Box she never could have anticipated, and can never hope to contain.",
