  "description": "On a beautiful April day in 1836 Mrs. Ellen Roxburgh boarded the Bristol Maid, bound for England from Australia. She and her fellow passengers are embarking on a far more perilous journey, however. The Bristol Maid is shipwrecked, and, taken prisoner by a tribe of aborigines, Mrs. Roxburgh journeys back to man's savage past. In order to survive, she redevelops her most basic strengths; shorn of every vestige of civilization, she rediscovers her native sensuality and passion.",
