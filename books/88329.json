  "title": "Donny and Ursula Save the World",
  "description": "Debut author, Sharon Weil, offers up a hilarious, sex-charged, romantic comedy adventure that’s “a fertile cross between Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut and Mr. Toad’s Wild ride.”Can love make you brave? Hopelessly mismatched lovers, Donny and Ursula, are ignited by their mutual attraction to become unlikely heroes well beyond their imaginations or mere neurotic existences. If good sex can melt fear, and love can inspire leaps, then they’re in trouble because poor earth-loving, travel agent Ursula has never had the Big O, and cynical writer Donny’s heart is in hiding.But, an agribusiness giant is out to own all the seeds of the world, and someone had better stop them! Could it really be these two will save the world? Find out as this story wheels and banks in eccentric glee, as love, sex, seeds and greed collide in outrageous climax. As they fumble their way to bravery, the flaws and foibles of Donny, Ursula, and their crazy rebel friends, (outlaw guerilla gardeners, belly dancing feminists, gun-crazy survivalists and mushroom messengers) are at once surprising, ridiculous, scary, and heartwarming.The funniest book about love, sex and GMOs you’ll ever read!Also available as an audiobook read by the author. “Weil’s debut has an uproarious premise… Weil’s narrative, by turns winsome and hilarious, is populated with well-drawn comic characters and filled with snappy dialogue; even a cleverly anthropomorphized Mother Earth gets in a few good zingers. The book’s action climax is also delightfully surreal. A fun, raucous eco-novel.” - Kirkus Review",
