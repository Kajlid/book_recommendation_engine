  "title": "Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail, Companion to the PBS Documentary",
  "description": "Beginning with their expulsion from Nauvoo in 1846 and for the succeeding twenty-two years, the migration of Mormon pioneers—some 70,000 of them—was a compelling saga of the settlement of the American West. Mostly poor, they traveled on ships, canal boats, trains, and riverboats, and then came on foot, in wagon trains and in handcart companies. Their story is told by two archivists with the LDS Church History Department in this beautiful book, filled with fascinating photographs.",
