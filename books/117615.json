  "title": "Destiny's Heir",
  "description": "A thrilling new high fantasy series from upcoming author Casey Neumiller, this is a novel you won't want to put down! Everyone has a destiny. The throne of Letale has been occupied by a usurper for twenty years following a violent coup, and fourteen years have passed since the last legitimate heir died in an attempt to reclaim the crown. The mysterious and powerful Magi, once the advisers to the royalty, have disappeared after refusing to support the new ruler. An uneasy peace exists, but the tinder is dry - a single spark could ignite the flames of war once more. None of that matters to Ben, a young thief living in the shadows of the capital - not even when he is recruited for the ultimate the royal crown, locked away inside the usurper's vaults. But as the ragtag brigands set their plans for immense riches in motion, he finds himself torn by conflicting loyalties while facing peril he never imagined, not realizing the secret he holds - a secret worth far more than any crown! Hidden deep in the Cosmane Mountains, Arraya is apprenticed to a surviving Magi, content in a quiet life of solitude and study. But her world is upended by her master's vision of a surviving heir to the throne, and her subsequent vision of her master's death at the hands of a mysterious enemy. Untried and untested, she struggles to reach her master before her vision can come true - but finds herself caught between ideals and loyalty, with the lives of her master, a young thief, and herself all at stake. But for both thief and Magi, it is not just their own lives at risk - it is the fate of their friends, their allies, and just possibly the kingdom of Letale itself!",
