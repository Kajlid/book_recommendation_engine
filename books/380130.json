  "title": "Exquisite Corpse",
  "description": "Set in London, Paris, and Munich in the 1940s and 1950s, Exquisite Corpse is, like Irwinâ€™s cult classic, The Arabian Nightmare, a novel about the strange and ever-morphing powers of the imagination. At once a love story, a mystery, and an investigation into the ideas of absurdist art, \"Irwin's novel about English surrealism is funny and profound and hugely satisfying\" (A. S. Byatt, Sunday Times)",
