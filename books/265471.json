Expecting to be killed, he’s shocked when the queen demands he wed her daughter instead. Suspicion is quick to follow. Why does the queen fear the tiny figure hidden beneath black shrouds? Why is the Intergalactic Alliance keen for the marriage to stand? And why, despite his war-weary heart, is he drawn to his mysterious bride?In Vladnese, Celeka means Wretched.

While unsure of the Chief she’s bound to, he’s her best chance of survival. Though, if he discovers what she did to save her sister, he might kill her himself.Caught between one Queen’s struggle for power, the Intergalactic Alliance’s mechanisms, and their responsibilities to their respective worlds, they must risk everything for the chance to stay together.",
