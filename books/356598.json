But Azazel can't shake the fear that the Sons are still after them, no matter how much Jason reassures her they're safe. He wants to have a normal life. She can't stop looking over her shoulder for danger. Lilith's back, and she's got her eye on Jason. Jason doesn't like Azazel's new gay best friend Jude. Someone put a bell, engraved with a picture of the sun rising over water, in Azazel's purse. Azazel's worried, but Jason thinks she's paranoid.
