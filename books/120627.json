  "description": "Abby Williams has got it made: First a new job as magazine editor in London, and now a trip to an exotic island to review a five-star resort with poolside service. Unfortunately, on day two of her vacation, Abby finds herself bound and stuffed into a burlap bag and dragged across two continents. And worse than that? Her hottie abductor has got her distracted. Maybe escape is overrated.Iain Brodie is a muscle-bound mercenary. He just helped a despotic dictator take over an island. He's also Abby's kidnapper, and he has his own problems. Framed for a murder he didn't commit and a boss whoâ€™s out to get him, he has to face facts: Early retirement is out of the question and Abby Williams looks damned good in a burlap bag.Elise Sax delivers another hilarious page-turner, filled with adventure, murder, mayhem, and love. BOUNTY is a sexy, wild ride.",
