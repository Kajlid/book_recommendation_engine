  "description": "LGBT; Paranormal Superpowered Love; Previous Losing BetterMalory Claremont was born and raised to be the villain in someone else's story, complete with fire-based superpowers. But then his cousin and former partner-in-crime, Brady, led him into a trap, and he's been in superpowered lockdown ever since.When he gets out on parole, he meets Theo McCracken, a cold-superpowered ex-offender. Theo has a modern Hamlet-style past, dangerously pretty eyes, and a hunger for affection that even Mal's best defensive efforts can't deny for long.They've paid their debts to society, but society doesn't care--from blackmailing coworkers to suspicion from the neighbors, it's hard to catch a fair chance. Pile that on top of their dark family pasts haunting their every step, plus all the leftover abandonment issues and paranoia, and it feels like just a matter of time before they'll be shoved right back into prison.After all the people he's hurt, Mal isn't sure he deserves a chance to live his own life, to choose his own labels, to be his own man. But maybe having someone like Theo, someone who can love him and be loved, scars and all, could make the whole endless struggle worthwhile.",
