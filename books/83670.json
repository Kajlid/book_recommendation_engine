  "description": "\"Renda, you miss the war like an old love, and in the missing, you forget the bad of it. The dead, the maimed. Sure you'd not take it all back.\" \"Would I not?\" For Renda, Knight Commander of the Knights of Brannagh, peace doesn't sit well. Born and trained from childhood to be the ultimate weapon in Syon's struggle to end the Five Hundred Years War, she feels crude and out of place in a world at peace. She longs to return to battle. But when her seven-year-old niece goes missing, a sinister chain of events and a terrifying new enemy leave Renda longing for the peace she scorned.   Plague. Magic. Gods bound and chained...  Through this new war, she must reconcile her dual lives as Renda the knight and Renda the maid in order to save her world.  For prophecy is a delicate thing.",
