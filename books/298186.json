  "description": "There have been many events in the past 230 years of the half-magical race of the Deryni that were too short to turn into novels. Katherine Kurtz has been writing these when not occupied with longer works, and they are now collected here. Some have appeared in books and other sources now hard to locate. More than half of the fiction is new -- including a major story of how Denis Arilan became the first Deryni priest in 200 years.Katherine Kurtz has provided an introduction and individual headings for each story to indicate her feelings and intents in writing each tale. Additionally, there is the complete first story she ever wrote -- the first version of her Deryni vision, and how it all came about.For all the myriad lovers of the Deryni, this should be a must book -- both for pleasure and as a reference!Catalyst --Healer's song-Vocation --Bethane --The priesting of Arilan --Legacy --The knighting of Derry --Trial",
