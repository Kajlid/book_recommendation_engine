  "description": "Eli knows who he is, and he’s tired of hiding it.  Exhausted and at the end of his rope, Eli’s not just in the closet when it comes to his family, he’s so far in he’s starting to lose himself. When Elijah, the straight, boring businessman to his family, and Eli, the blogger and lingerie model to everyone else, start to clash, Eli begins to realize how much it’s affecting every part of his life…especially with Roman, the fiery photographer that drives Eli crazy.  Roman’s tired of insanity and drama queens, even sexy ones who make his pulse race.  A bad breakup left Roman broke and skeptical of getting involved again, especially with a brat who feeds off drama. With his bank account and patience drained, Roman feels cornered and at his limit. Leashes and Lace was supposed to be a fresh start for the photographer, but with Eli showing up at every turn, he’s not sure if he’s found a new career path or made the worst decision of his life.  When killing each other isn’t an option, there’s only one way to release all the passion that flares between them, but sex can’t solve everything…or can it?  58k Words Story Contains: M/m sexual content, BDSM elements, gender-fluid dressing, edging, and spanking",
