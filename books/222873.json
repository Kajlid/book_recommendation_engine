  "description": "Tara is the kind of bookish girl who has followed her wildest dreams: she owns a bookstore and celebrates her favorite holiday of the year, Harry Potter’s birthday, in grand style.   Zach’s idea of dreams fulfillment is a little different…he’s a professional football player.   When the two meet at the bookstore’s annual escapade, the real magic appears. There’s just one little thing...Tara’s a virgin and Zach’s definitely an all-around player.   Can a nerd girl and a jock win this game?  WARNING: includes steamy good times, lots of wizard jokes, some serious football action and (obviously!) an HEA.",
