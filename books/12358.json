  "description": "Raeâ€™s fragile emotions are becoming unhinged. Lochlann demands she keeps the bond with his brother secret, and the duties of High Priestess threaten to crush her rebellious nature, diminishing her glow. Breandan is her warrior, her light in the dark, but even he cannot hope to protect Rae from her own blood, and the extremes his need to possess her push him to. At odds with his kin, struggling with his own purpose, he fights for his claim on Rae to be honored. Rae must break the irons of doom and embrace her fate. She must become the Priestess demonkind cry out for, and wield magics that are hers by birthright. Or watch from the arms of her love as her Wyld perishes in flames. BrE.",
