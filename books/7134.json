  "description": "Callie Andrews is content with her life, until she gets a phone call telling her that her twin brother is in an Iraqi prison. When Mark Wilson contacts her and tells her that his father has also been taken captive, her organized life is suddenly turned upside down. As they uncover more information, they soon realize that the company their family members worked for is not what it appeared, and the kidnappings may not have been as random as they seemed. Callie and Mark's own lives will soon be in danger as they race to rescue their loved ones. As Callie and Mark travel around the world, staying one step ahead of the men trying to keep them from discovering the truth, they find that they may have been brought into one another's lives for an even larger purpose. Can Mark's faith inspire Callie to turn back to God after spending so long running from Him? Can Callie's beauty and love help Mark heal from the heartbreak of losing his fianc√©e and learn to open himself up once again? Their journey brings up questions of love and faith for each of them as they make Footprints in the Sand.",
