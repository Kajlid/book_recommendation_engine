  "description": "Some people were destined to find love. Some were destined to destroy it. I was chaos. She was my sanctuary. I was lethal. She was curious. Together we were the perfect storm. Then the unthinkable happened. And I was to blame. Now I was on a path of self-destruction paved in secrets and lies. Until something stopped me dead in my tracks. Something I never expected. A truth that made me want to set the world on fire. If the sins of the father were passed down to the son, then we were all damned. *Hallowed Eve is book two in a series. It may be read as a standalone but it is highly recommended that you read book one first to avoid spoilers. Please note content warning.*",
