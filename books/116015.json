  "description": "This is a compilation from the free serial story blog ‘Shalia’s Diary – A Clans of Kalquor Story’ by Tracy St. John. It is highly recommended you read Shalia’s Diary Book 1 before reading this story, which picks up immediately where that book left off. Told in the passages of her ongoing diary, Shalia Monroe’s adventures continue while she prepares to leave the dying Earth. As the Academy comes under attack by rebellious Earthers, she finds herself fending off the romantic attentions of Kalquorian site commander Nang. He’s gorgeous enough to offer more than a little temptation, but his clanmates aren’t looking for a lifebringer to add to their unit. Plus there’s that tiny matter of Shalia being in love with Dramok Dusa and his clanmate Esak. Treachery and danger abound as the time grows near for Shalia to start her journey to the Kalquorian Empire. Marked for death, she needs all the help she can get. It’s too bad she can’t figure out who is friend and who is foe...a mystery she may not be able to solve until it’s too late.",
