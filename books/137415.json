  "description": "When seventeen-year-old Jeremyâ€™s girlfriend agrees to do the deed, life can't possibly get better. And then the condom breaks. He loves Elisa as much as a popular teenage athlete can love a girl, but he doesn't want to be a dad. Her parents want a marriage - his parents want an abortion, and Elisa and Jeremy's once-perfect relationship has been reduced to fights and drama. With a college scholarship on the line and the whole high school mocking him, Jeremy makes a decision that may haunt him forever. (copied from Amazon.com)",
