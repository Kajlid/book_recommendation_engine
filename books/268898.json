She’ll do anything to save Ryder. He helped her rescue her friend. And protected her from a grisly death. She owes it to him. And more than that, as much as she doesn’t want to admit it, there’s something powerful between her and the three demons who have pledged their love to her.  She doesn’t care that everyone thinks he’s dead. She’ll do whatever she has to. No matter how dumb. No matter how dangerous.  And someone, somewhere, is going to pay for hurting the people she loves.  VENGEFUL HUNTER is a short, 10,000+ word story. It is SCORCHING hot and will make you wonder why all your dreams aren't filled with sexy demons who know just how to possess a woman.",
