  "title": "The Late George Apley",
  "description": "Sweeping us into the inner sanctum of Boston society, into the Beacon Hill town houses and exclusive private clubs where only the city's wealthiest and most powerful congregate, this novel gives us—through the story of one family and its patriarch, the recently deceased George Apley—the portrait of an entire society in transition. Gently satirical and rich with drama, the novel moves from the Gilded Age to the Great Depression as it projects George Apley's world—and subtly reveals a life in which status and accomplishment mask disappointment and regret, a life of extreme and enviable privilege that is nonetheless an imperfect life.",
