  "description": "“Do not think at this moment, Cara Westling. Concentrate on nothing but saving your life. You want your daughter to be without a father AND a mother?” Cara Westling, a newcomer to the small town of Payton, Idaho, is grateful she’s landed employment with the highly respected J.L. Larrett. A victim of abuse both from her father and ex-husband, Cara is struggling to build her own self esteem—and a new life for herself and her troubled thirteen-year-old daughter, Riley. But J.L. Larrett is not the man people think they know. One week into the job, J.L. forces Cara to do the unthinkable—help hide the body of a woman he’s murdered. If she refuses, she could pay with her life. If she obeys, the stain on her soul may be more than she can bear.",
