  "description": "'My little panther', Nono's father called her, but he didn't get the chance to say it for long. Her African village was destroyed and she first lived in the bush then was sold as a slave, given a name and a home and then -- horrifyingly -- sold once more into the hands of pirates. A rich, exciting stroy about a fascinating and thoroughly believeable character.",
