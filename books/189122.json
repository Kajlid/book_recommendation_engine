  "description": "Everyone around Stefanie Noble is content, but it seems that her “happily ever after” has passed her by. Then two troubled girls and their older brother, Gideon, show up in town and clearly need help. Could they bring the fulfillment that Stefanie has been searching for? Hollywood hotshot Lincoln Cash has made a life playing the role of an action hero, basking in the laurels of his fame, fortune, and adoring fans. But when he's diagnosed with a debilitating disease, he knows that life will soon be over. He only has a small window of time to start a new career, one that will earn him legitimate filmmaker kudos. He soon heads to Phillips, Montana, to put his plan into action. Not everyone is pleased with the movie star's arrival, especially not Stefanie Noble. She's even less enamored when he accuses Gideon of arson and tries to run him out of town. But what Lincoln and Stefanie don't know is that neither the fire nor the other strange things that have happened around town are really accidents. Someone is out to get them . . . but who? And who is the real target?",
