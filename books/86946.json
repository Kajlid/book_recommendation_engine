  "description": "Her Secret is the second part of My Adventures with la Femme Charmee, the diary of the New York Flaneur as told to alter ego David St.-Lascaux. My Adventures is a rollicking, riveting true story, and groundbreaking combination of cultural celebration and explicit erotica.Completing a family of diaries set in several of the Great Western Cities, and modeled after those of Samuel Pepys and James Boswell (London) and Anais Nin (Paris), My Adventures introduces le Flaneur and his exuberant co-protagonist and titular heroine, the Enchanted Woman. My Adventures notes numerous events (art, dance, music and theater), boldfaces the many talented New Yorkers le Flaneur meets, incorporates wide-ranging references to literature, details la Femme Charmee's gastronomic delights, and notes aesthetic landmarks to provide a flavor of living in New York today.Diary entries in My Adventures alternate with blushing \"pink pages\"; (les pages rouges), documentary erotica in French followed by translations into English. These humorous, explicit entries deliciously detail le Flaneur's sex life with la Femme Charmee. My Adventures will be of interest to today's readers for its encyclopedic cultural references and uninhibited eroticism, and to future generations for its incisive expression of the Zeitgeist of the early Twenty-first Century.",
