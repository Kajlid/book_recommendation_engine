  "title": "Mastering Creative Anxiety: 24 Lessons for Writers, Painters, Musicians, and Actors from America's Foremost Creativity Coach",
  "description": "In his decades as a psychotherapist and creativity coach, Eric Maisel has found a common thread behind what often gets labeled writer’s block,” procrastination,” or stage fright.” It’s the particular anxiety that, paradoxically, keeps creators from doing, completing, or sharing the work they are driven toward. This creative anxiety” can take the form of avoiding the work, declaring it not good enough, or failing to market it  and it can cripple creators for decades, even lifetimes. But Maisel has learned what sets successful creators apart. He shares these strategies here, including artist-specific stress management; how to work despite bruised egos, day jobs, and other inevitable frustrations; and what not to do to deal with anxiety. Implementing these 24 lessons replaces the pain of not creating with the profound rewards of free artistic self-expression.* Practical insights and proven techniques for overcoming the challenges and fears that plague creators of every kind* Teaching tales that convey effective approaches to creating fearlessly and abundantly",
