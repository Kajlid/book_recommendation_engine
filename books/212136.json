It turns out that my one-night stand has a reputation as a player and is one of the biggest commitment-phobes on the island. Not to mention the fact that he only has to snap his fingers and women fall at his feet. Can I forget about the sexiest night of my life and keep my professional mask in place? This is just the start of my problems in dealing with the complex office politics and my exploding passion for James.",
