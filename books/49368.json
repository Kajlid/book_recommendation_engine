  "title": "Memoirs of a Gas Station: A Delightfully Awkward Journey Across the Alaskan Tundra",
  "description": "Early one May, Sam Neumann arrived in the breathtaking wilderness of Denali, Alaska with a smile on his face and adventure in his heart. But less than 24 hours later, both had evaporated as he stood behind the counter of a filthy gas station—his new place of employment—and tried to piece together what exactly had gone wrong.Memoirs of a Gas Station is a delightfully awkward account of a summer trapped in a convenience store on the edge of Denali National Park. Often satirical, sometimes introspective, and always brutally honest, Sam takes you on a raucous ride through the best and worst summer of his life. From booze-soaked employee parties to large animal encounters to one very awkward romantic episode in a tree house, he learned more than he ever planned about the Last Frontier. But weekends spent stumbling through seedy Alaskan bars and hitchhiking to remote destinations led him to find friendship, adventure, and love in the most unexpected places.http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Gas-Sta...",
