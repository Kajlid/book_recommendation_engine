  "description": "The \"Theology in Dialogue\" Series explores the relationship between theology and different, secular academic disciplines which appear within the degree programs of colleges and universities. Each volume begins with a chapter and a reply, providing a thoughtful justification for the interaction of theology and the particular subject. This is followed by a theoretical analysis of this interaction, and a range of case studies illustrating the situation in the classroom.\"English Literature, Theology and the Curriculum\" explores the nature and authority of religious writings and their influence on secular literature. What makes it distinctive is the manner in which it investigates the textual dynamic between the two disciplines by combining both theory and case study in a single collection of writings. It discusses interdisciplinary dialogue, offers case studies on literature and theology from Anglo-Saxon verse to the twentieth-century novel, and looks at curriculum considerations. The eminence and breadth of the contributors is outstanding.",
