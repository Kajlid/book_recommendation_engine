  "description": "When Father Christmas pays a visit on Christmas Eve, Sam's busiest time of the year gets even busier. The problem, as Father Christmas explains, is that he's running behind schedule and wants Sam to help him out. For Sam, who's facing the closing of his ramshackle shop, the task seems impossible. After all, he has no sleigh or reindeer. But that's where a little magic comes in. Before the wonderful night is past, Sam and his young friend Joey get the chance to make some unusual deliveries and, most importantly, share in the true spirit of Christmas.",
