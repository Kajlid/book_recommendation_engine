Succeeding in the testosterone-filled environment means everything to her. She married young, to a fellow police academy recruit, but has been divorced for several years because he couldn’t handle her success. Her marriage led her to prefer brief encounters to satisfy her physical needs and she’s decided she’ll never date another cop.  Jim Cagney is one of the youngest detectives in the Drug Interdiction Unit. After five years in the military and two tours in Iraq, he’s been back in Kansas City for six years. During his recovery from the horrors of the war, he discovered the beauty of dominance and submission. Living in a 24/7 TPE relationship gave him back the control he lost on the battlefield. It’s been almost a year since he uncollared his submissive, and he’s ready to move on.  As Paula gets to know Jim more and more, she starts to appreciate both him and the pleasures he gives. Will she ever be able to fully submit to the kind of lifestyle he represents, though?  Publisher's Note: This steamy contemporary romance contains elements of power exchange. While it is part of the Club Indigo series, it can be read and enjoyed as a standalone.",
