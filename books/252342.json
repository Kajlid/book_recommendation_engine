And his simple, easy life gets turned upside down.One wild one-night stand was all it was ever supposed to be, so Lainey is shocked when she discovers that her sizzling summer fling is also her son's new math teacher. But that's nothing compared to the most unexpected twist of all—their hot hook-up left Lainey knocked up, and now they're about to become parents. Together.What ensues is an addictive, insatiable, sweet and tender romance that won't be simple, but it will be more than worth the fight.",
