  "description": "Sullivan Evans has had it up to here with needy, pushy women. His one goal is to live a peaceful life devoid of females. So when his formerly quiet neighbor--a woman so elusive he calls her Bigfoot--begins talking to him, it can only mean one thing: she's on the prowl.Blair has no idea her neighbor is eligible and wary. After being jolted from her self-contained world by the death of a local recluse, she decides to change her life and reach out. First on her list: say hello to the neighbors she has never spoken to. Her only goal is to not die alone, but a freak crossing of paths will change everything.As Sully misreads Blair's every signal, they seem more destined to be enemies than friends. Over time, the two people who seemingly don't need anyone else just might learn they need each other the most.",
