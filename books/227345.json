  "description": "She never wanted to leave the tower. He never wanted to rule the country. Nella has lived quietly in her tower in the woods for over a decade. After dangerous accusations drove her and her grandmother away from their village, they escaped deep into the forest where no one would try to harm them. Now, after her grandmother's death, Nella is alone, and she is determined to stay that way. She has no patience for a world she deems judgmental and ignorant. Or so she tells herself. In reality, her paralyzing fear prevents her from stepping foot outside of the tower. Prince Benedict Allesandro is an adventurer- a rescuer who prides himself on saving the weak and unfortunate. When he hears rumors of a beautiful damsel trapped in a tower, he rushes to her rescue...only to find a woman who most definitely does not wish to be saved. But when war breaks out, this reckless prince and reclusive maiden are faced with overcoming their deepest fears in order to determine not only their own fate, but that of their entire country. Note: this is a standalone paperback edition of the novella first published in the e-book boxset Once: Six Historically Inspired Fairy Tales.",
