  "description": "From award-winning author Sarah Marie Page comes a stunning new adult enemies-to-lovers romantasy featuring a simmering slow-burn romance between a vengeful spy and an enemy general's alluring second-in-command on opposite sides of a pending war. SHE'S STEALING MORE THAN SECRETS.As the royal physician of a tiny, windswept island, eighteen-year-old Isabel spends her days trying to keep the queen from dying and the mad king from streaking naked down the halls. But when her best friend is found murdered on the beaches, her world is ripped apart. Desperate for answers, she discovers a stash of letters that reveal a terrifying truth: the neighboring kingdom of Volgaard possesses a kingdom-shattering weapon and is poised to conquer everything in its path.Seeking vengeance, Isabel infiltrates the enemy. Her mission? Woo Erik Lothgarson, the general’s steamy, illusion-magic wielding son, and steal the dangerous weapon. She can bring Volgaard to its knees—if  she isn’t caught. But as Isabel dances along the knife edge of deception, the lines between truth and fiction blur, and she must wrestle her quest for vengeance against her undeniable attraction to the enemy.Please note the spice level is a steamy fade-to-black, meaning there's some foreplay and build-up, but no on-page sex.",
