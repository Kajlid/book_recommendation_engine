  "title": "The White Chief",
  "description": "An exciting and well-written book by Mayne Reid based on his experiences during the war between America and Mexico in the 1840s. Reid took the title of \"Captain\" because that was what his men called him during that war, although he was never promoted to that rank. The importance of Reid's books with this background is that they were among the first in the Wild West genre. (Nick Hodson)According to \"Thomas Mayne Reid (April 4, 1818 - October 22, 1883), was an Irish-American novelist. \"Captain\" Reid wrote many adventure novels akin to those written by Frederick Marryat and Robert Louis Stevenson. He was a great admirer of Lord Byron. These novels contain action that takes place primarily in untamed the American West, Mexico, South Africa, the Himalayas, and Jamaica.\"",
