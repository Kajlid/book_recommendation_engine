  "description": "Fortysomething Annette Osmund always knew she was psychic. She's not, but that didn't stop her from giving those nonexistent abilities her all. What she is, however, is a very powerful witch who has just inherited magics she never dreamed possible.Starting over in a new town with her BFF has been an adventure. Defiance's status as a powerful type of witch called a charmling has kept Annette busy. But while Deph, a seeker, is still learning to use her magics, to control the power at her fingertips, Annette is overcome with powers of her own. Turns out, her being besties with Deph was not an accident. They were drawn to each other even before their powers emerged, and Annette learns she is also a charmling, a healer, and an alchemist. But what does that even mean?Fortunately, there's one way to find out. She consults the house they're living in. Or, more to the point, the delicious entity haunting the house. Because, like her, he was once an alchemist. Maybe he will have the answers she so desperately seeks before she kills someone. The fact that he was once a stunning specimen of masculinity has nothing whatsoever to do with her desire to learn from a man who may or may not have been a powerful warlock.",
