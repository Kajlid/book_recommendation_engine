  "description": "An intelligent and self-deprecating romp through the out there humor of one of today's funniest womenA collection of comic narratives that are hilariously incisive and illustrated in her splashy, apropos style, Lap Dancing for Mommy runs riot with mainstream perceptions of underground lifestyles -- and with just about anything else that crosses this artist's keen eye. Whether she's revealing Phallusies: The Fake Penis Exhibition, relating the psycho antics of Therapy Girl or the troubles of Camaro Joe, or taking friendly shots at sexuality and the '70s Sisterhood, Lopez's talent and intellect take her work far beyond the usual comic fare.Erika Lopez's cartoons are so corrosive they should come with a hazardous material warning. Buy this book now and surrender to her exquisitely vile and depraved genius. -- Alison Bechdel, creator of Dykes to Watch Out For",
