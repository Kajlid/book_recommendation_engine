  "description": "All magic comes with a price tag.It's a lesson witches are taught from a young age, along with the ones about how we'll never survive a vampire turning, how hunters will always seek to eradicate us, and how a devil's bargain can never be broken.But together, my rebels and I have shattered every last rule, ignored every last warning. We've grown stronger because of it, and so far, we've survived everything fate has thrown our way.So what's one more warning shunned, one more cosmic law overturned in the face of such a devastating loss?Asher. Darius. Ronan. Liam. Emilio. To keep the men I love safe, there's nothing I won't risk. Break. Destroy.What's done is done. All we can do now is face the consequences, and hope that when fate comes to collect, we can afford to pay the price.",
