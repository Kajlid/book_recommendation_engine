  "title": "Seattle Quake 9.2",
  "description": "They knew it could happen - scientists had been warning them for years. Yet, nearly two million people living in the greater Seattle area went about their daily lives as usual. A Detective Agency thought they had found a missing woman, an upstart radio station was on the air, and an eccentric banker had just started a round of golf. Thousands were driving on freeways, shopping in malls, awaiting flights, working in downtown high-rises, and on buses in the bus tunnel. They knew -- they just didn't believe it could happen to them. (This book is dedicated to Ham Radio Operators all over the world who open the lines of communication after a disaster. Although the technology may be a little out of date, this book still honors their hard, behind the scenes work.)",
