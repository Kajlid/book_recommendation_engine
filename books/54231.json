The cocktail-waitress-turned-psychologist has handled obsessed patients, love-struck drunks, and her own guilt-tripping mother with aplomb. But when it comes to the lieutenant, Chrissy has an old-fashioned case of irresistible attraction—until things turn fatal when Rivera is accused of murder!Not only was Rivera found unconscious next to a dead woman, but the victim was his beautiful ex-girlfriend—who left Rivera for his wealthy dad. Chrissy detects a few father-and-son issues—along with plenty of evidence that her would-be boyfriend is guilty. But when she starts looking into the dead woman’s past, a rich senator’s connections, and Rivera’s relationship with his mother, will she discover there’s hope for her and Rivera after all? Or will her curiosity have deadly consequences?",
