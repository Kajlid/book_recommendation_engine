  "description": "From the acclaimed novelist, playwright, and journalist Laura Cunningham, a coming of age story and enchanting memoir of childhood\"Here is Lily Moore at 10, as judged by her fifth grade 'Unsatisfactory...Hair matted, uncombed, disheveled appearance. Soil under nails.' She has in addition been AWOL from school for 37 full and 38 half days...She lives in a bizarre apartment whose living room furnishings consist of a gold lame castro convertible and two pink bath mats--her choice. She shares the habitation with a senile old woman and two bachelors, one of whom habitually cooks popcorn for breakfast wearing a pith helmet...All indications to the contrary notwithstanding. Lily is living a blessed life, as depicted in Laura Cunningham's unromantic, spare, funny, enchanting memoir.\" -- The Washington Post \"A wonderfully vivid chronicle of a young girl's coming of age...funny and sad, irreverent and generous...A model memoir.\" -- Michiko Kakutani, New York Times \"Sharp-witted and funny but never mean. A lovely novelistic memoir.\" -- Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal \"Original, quirky, poignant, and hilarious.\" -- Los Angeles Times \"A winner...life-affirming.\" -- San Francisco Chronicle",
