  "description": "Nicky liked to call it business warfare-instead of stealing. But now she took something that the owner did not want human eyes to see, and he wants it back. With a strange group of men after her, Nicky's only chance of survival is to run, and to outsmart them. But everywhere she turns they are waiting for her, and she can't find a way to stop them. She found something much larger than she is, but how could Little Nicky stop what she stumbled into the midst of?",
