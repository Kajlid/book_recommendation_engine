  "description": "Regan O'Riley is a shy software developer who believes she'll never find a woman who can appreciate her self-admitted geekiness. Mel Raines is a lonely cop haunted by a painful past. She has spent years avoiding intimacy with anyone in her life, and she has no intention of changing. Mel and Regan have a chance meeting in, of all places, a straight bar, and both are surprised at the instant chemistry that springs up between them. But their new connection is put to the test when tragedy strikes Mel's life, forcing her to reconsider her career and her path for the future. When Regan suggests an impromptu road trip to the American Southwest, Mel is eager to grab hold of a temporary escape from reality. But in close company, these two will be tested in ways they never expected. What will happen as they re-examine their choices and their definitions of family? Can Regan and Mel manage to get past obstacles that seem insurmountable?",
