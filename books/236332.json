  "description": "The Dawn of Ascension Nears…  After the devastating consequences of THE LAST WINTER, August’s Alliance finds itself alone in a fracturing conflict, and Amara is one step closer to Ascension, threatening all life in the universe.  Renouncing the gods’ help after the battle for Earth, August and his fellow champions spend their days on the run, never able to gain enough ground to put an end to the Circle War. In a last-ditch effort to win the peace, August decides to hunt down Amara’s champions one-by-one, starting with the mysterious Tria. Aeris and the rest of the Alliance go along with August’s plan, but the group’s strength is tested when August’s decisions only lead to more death and destruction.  With his victory over Paralos’s champion, Gemini is on the verge of becoming as powerful as any in the Circle. He needs to kill something equally as powerful to complete his metamorphosis, and he sets his sights on one of the strongest of the gods. If he succeeds, any hope of victory could be out of reach for the Alliance.  The Circle War speeds towards its finale as August, Gemini, and the rest of the champions clash to decide the fate of the universe. Rivalries percolating since the beginning of the war come to a head. August has one chance left to realize his dream of being a hero, and he must do it before there’s nothing left to defend.",
