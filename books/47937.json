  "title": "The Family Itch",
  "description": "This is a really cool story. It sounds a little disgusting, with all that dirt, grease and cow patties. But just Immerse yourself in the filthy world of ‘Spud’. With his horridly wonderful family and his ambitions, brilliant in their absurdity. The only restriction is your imagination! “It takes more than just a vivid imagination to be a master storyteller. This is one of the greatest lessons I have learnt from reading your piece. Your use of craft is so clever that it has had me hooked from the start and almost over-eager to complete reading the story.Like a good pantomime it works on many levels, from 8 – 80 (and all ages in between).” Simon Halte (Writer)",
