  "description": "After losing her parents and many of her siblings during the genocide in Rwanda, Anamaliya was hunted ‘like an animal’ for weeks. Living through it all, she is able to tell the specific, cruel and inhumane acts of genocide. She becomes a woman who makes up her mind through her determined spirit to live and come out ‘victorious over death, hell, and the grave’.Anamaliya minces no words, telling the horrible truth about the 1994 genocide. “I heard the sounds of roaring guns and grenades and the screams of people. At that moment, no one needed to tell me anything. I knew they were killing my family; my mom, my siblings and all the people who did nothing wrong except to be born Tutsis.”",
