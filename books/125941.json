  "description": "David had an ease with things that tended to make others think he wasn't taking life seriously. Some had called him blessed, but most that knew him knew his success in his construction company, as well as in his life, was because of his hard work. Life had been good to him. When his wife passed away suddenly, everything changed. David is transported to a new place, a place outside of his own world, and begins to question the premise of life and the foundations of religion. Before he can come to grips with any of it, he learns about an evil that threatens the very existence of the universe. David quickly learns that he may be the only person with the key to defeating this evil, but it would be impossible to do it alone. With the help of Kona, his trusty Malamute, as well as his sister Debbie and his best friend Brian, David enters a battle that could very likely re-write the world as it has always been known.",
