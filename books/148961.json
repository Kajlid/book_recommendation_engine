  "description": "There are no Happily Ever Afters in the new Undead World. There are no vacations or time-outs or do-overs. There is only the endless daily grind of living or the shockingly horrific fact of death that hangs over every living creature left on the face of the earth. For some that death lies in a single mistake or a moment of bad luck, or simply in fate. For others that hard death hounds them day and night, relentlessly. When a huge bounty is placed on their heads, Neil Martin’s misfit family is set upon by ruthless bounty hunters. They are pursued by sociopaths, sadistic ex-soldiers and of course the warped Believers of New Eden. There is no refuge, no place of safety, no shining city on a hill that will take them in. They are outcasts and doomed to flee from their enemies until they’re forced to make one great stand.",
