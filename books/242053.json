In the aftermath of the trouble I brought, one man holds the answers I seek so desperately.Whether he will part with his secrets, that’s another matter.This world is not what I always thought it to be and someone is doing their best to kill us all; when accidents continue to happen I must consider the possibility that someone I love is setting me up. With the fate of the world at stake, I must face the demons of my past or risk being consumed by them. But this time, I’m not alone.I'm Kit Davenport and this is going to leave a mark.",
