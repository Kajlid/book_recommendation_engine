  "description": "Sophie McLeod is desperate for her turn at hot sex but needs a few strangers. Maxwell Gibson, Pinkerton detective, refuses to assist her while working. His identical twin, Sam, doesn't hold back, giving Sophie an arousing taste of what she's been missing. On their last assignment before they leave the Agency, they've agreed to find Mr. Isaac, who's tortured and murdered women. Finding a wife is high on Sam and Josh's list, but Max insists brazen Sophie doesn't suit his meticulous plans for their ranch. Desperate to catch Mr. Isaac, Sophie works in a Bannack City saloon as bait, upsetting Max's plans and raising Sam's protective instincts. She's forced upstairs as punishment, hired by a scruffy but arousing man. Then he introduces himself as the youngest, and most dominant, Gibson brother, Josh. Men from all the Tanner's Ford ranches come to help, but she must ultimately face Mr. Isaac on her own. And who is the villain, once unmasked? There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings. ** A Siren Erotic Romance, Menage Erotic Western Menage a Quatre Romance, contains spanking, Happily Ever After",
