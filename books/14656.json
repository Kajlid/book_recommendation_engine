  "description": "What Readers are saying about CHASING \"Spooky, captivating mystery.\" ... \"A glimpse of a strange world behind this one.\" ... \"Great story telling!\" ... \"If you are a fan of this genre give this book a try you will not regret it.\" ... \"I was sorry when it ended.\" ... \"an epic journey through a mans life\" ... \"This was a wonderful story.\" There is an old man sitting in a bed on Angel ward, telling stories. He says he has to tell someone, because he is dying. He says he doesn't care if you believe the tales are true or not, because he is not sure that half of them ever happened at all. Reg Weldon claims that he has seen things that would make your skin crawl. He claims a lot of things... \"I was born four seconds before the strike of midnight, on the 31st December 1900. As far as I know that makes me the last person to be born in that century. My mother, god bless her soul, she may well have been the first person to die in the century that followed, because no sooner had I taken my first breath, than she took her last.\"",
