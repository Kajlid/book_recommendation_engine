  "description": "I wish I could say our meeting was happenstance. I wish I could say we took one look and we just knew. I wish I could say falling for him was the best thing that ever happened to me. But none of that would be true. Rhett Carson was as cold as the ice on which he skated. He was as calloused as the hands that shot the goals that won world championships. He was also damaged. And broken. And he didn’t know it, but I knew all about him … and his unfortunate connection with my estranged older brother. I knew why he was so bitter and angry. I knew why he was so cold hearted. But I didn’t know why I let myself fall in love with him. And I didn’t know why I couldn’t stop–even when he told me to. But when the truth came out, I knew I’d lost him for good … until he came back, more cold hearted than ever before.",
