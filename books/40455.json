  "description": "There are reasons our courts, judiciary and police are expected to remain neutral. This story is why… Will Middleton, a professional sportsman, thrust into a world of machinations and masonic conspiracy he didn’t know existed, finds himself at the centre of a surreal, Kafkaesque-like trial. When fiction becomes real, when authority crosses boundaries that should never be crossed, you cannot but doubt the line between corruption, fantasy and reality…. It’s a hell of a line to cross, and it’s based on the authors own true story!Also from John Bartlett, Dark Horse, the Chequered Justice prequel! You can read Chequered Justice before or after Dark HorseA John Grisham style legal thriller, worthy of the big screen!LESLIE PHILLIPS CBE A chilling tale set on the twin tracks of motor racing and justice, exposing the hazardous pit stops of one against the systemic pitfalls of the other, in which truth becomes the loser.MICHAEL MANSFIELD QC, Barrister for the Birmingham Six miscarriage of justice appealFu**ing first class!
