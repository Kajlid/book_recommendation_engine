  "description": "First, he created the dwarfs—and disappointed by their weakness, he quickly destroyed them. But for God Perun, creating a race of giants hasn’t been as great as he imagined, either. Slow, clumsy, and not exceptionally bright, the sizable creatures known as ispolins have failed to live up to Perun’s expectations. But in the name of fairness, he comes up with a plan that will put them to the test. An unhappy ispolin, on the verge of leaving his village for good, Goran never thought he would find himself responsible for the future of his kind. But now, he’s facing a dangerous quest—to retrieve three golden apples from one magical tree, guarded by a formidable dragon, and bring them back to Perun. Aided by a number of magical creatures, great and small, Goran is well on his way to accomplishing his goal, and saving all of ispolin-kind. But not everything is as it seems, and when hidden motives begin to reveal themselves, it could put an end, once and for all, to more than just the giant’s epic quest.",
