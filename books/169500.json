  "description": "May 16th, 1869My name is Taran Collins. I take pen to paper to let anyone who follows after me a warning. If you come after me you can expect trouble. I don't know of what kind per se, but........well let's just leave it at that. You've been warned.Regards, Taran CollinsP.S. I'm not coming back. That much I am sure of. My story isn't an easy one, but my hope is that my fortune will change, Godwilling.The town of Orlaca wasn't a thriving place. Situated at the base of a mountain in the northern region of  Arizona  it didn't have much going for it other than scenic views and the wistful dreams of the few who called it home. Built as a boom town before the  Civil War  by those in search of gold, it later lost its luster when gold became hard to find. Unknown to the latest people to come to this remote stretch of land was that of the oral history of the  Native Americans , who'd called it home for far longer. To them it was a sacred land. A place where wind and fire met and became one. Fire Wind  is the beginning of a series of  western sci-fi  novels that feature  adventure,  action, and  faith.
