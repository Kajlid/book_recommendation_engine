It gives you a deep, insider's knowledge of how the top reviewers think and operate. It not only shows you what to do: it also takes you inside the reviewers’ heads so that you can see for yourself both how these techniques work and why they’re so effective. Lessons include:• A simple, four-part formula for writing emails that get your work reviewed.• Three things never to say when communicating with reviewers!• How to pick reviewers who are more likely to give you a good review.• How to reduce the chance that a reviewer you contact will give your work a bad review.• How people get caught out when receiving reviews from friends and family. This book teaches an honest, straightforward approach that works. It works because it’s not based on gimmicks or tricks but on a real understanding of how Amazon reviewers operate: most of all on what they expect from authors and other sellers. If you want to know how to talk to an Amazon reviewer in a way that will make them respect you as a professional and see you as the kind of seller they actually want to help, this is the book for you.",
