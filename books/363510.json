  "description": "Ramton Gallow is a small town in the heart of Worcestershire, England. It is quaint, picturesque some might say, but it holds a secret. Strange things happen in Ramton Gallow, strange things that go mostly unnoticed by those who live there. They have been going on for years, centuries even, yet they are thought of as just fairy tales, or urban legends, though a few know the truth.When a teenage boy is found dead, twelve-year-old Daniel Grade suspects that old Mrs. Harris, a little old lady who is rumoured to be a witch, is the murderer. Is she? Or is there something far more sinister going on in the town of Ramton Gallow?",
