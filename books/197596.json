  "description": "A comical treatise on the state of American public education, including the emphasis on testing, pay-for-performance, and biased teacher evaluations. Wendy Taylor, veteran teacher of 6th grade, finds herself in hot water when the new assistant principal takes exception to her teaching style, her outspoken ideas, and even her seating arrangements. Things heat up as Wendy tries to adjust to the new requirements from her school district and her new evaluator, but it is all for naught as she discovers the heinous secret that the District doesn't want anyone to know.",
