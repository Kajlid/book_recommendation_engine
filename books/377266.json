  "description": "“The Buddha’s teachings are not a philosophy or a religion; they are a call to action and invitation to revolution.” Noah Levine, author of the national bestseller Dharma Punx and Against the Stream , is the leader of the youth movement for a new American Buddhism. In Heart of the Revolution , he offers a set of reflections, tools, and teachings to help readers unlock their own sense of empathy and compassion. Lama Surya Das, author of Awakening the Buddha Within , declares Levins to be \"in the fore among Young Buddhas of America, a rebel with both a good cause and the noble heart and spiritual awareness to prove it,” saying, “I highly recommend this book to those who want to join us on this joyful path of mindfulness and awakening.\"",
