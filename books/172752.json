  "description": "This novel by Cyndie Shaffstall wraps science fiction around the mystery of a near-future conspiracy.Engineers, inventors, and business people alike scrambled to develop a solution before the world’s population was completely wiped out by an irradiated atmosphere, but the chosen solution became a temporary fix at best. By 2062, we are burdened by the weight of unchecked population growth and global warming has reduced our inhabitable space by half. With our workplace frustratingly neutered by the Genderless Act, we came to embrace sex in trystrooms—where anything goes—and it’s all kept secret by the Privacy Act. Combined concern for humankind and the planet drives innovation, and businesses thrive in an environment where unemployment and poverty have been eliminated. The Government Reorganization and Realignment Effort enables one group of brilliant young designers to reclaim some of the ever-shrinking space—but bringing it to market exposes manipulation and corruption on a devastating, worldwide scale.",
