  "description": "Sequel to the award-winning Chemistry.  Foul-mouthed, plus-sized Stella Blunt is back, and so is her undead admirer, Howie Mullins.  On the surface, Howie seems to have it all - eternal life, the ability to sense brain waves, and the love of his perfect woman. But there's a dark side to being a half-zombie, and it's starting to catch up to him.  As Howie's anxiety about the virus increases, Stella is facing graduation from high school and wrestling with college applications. Refusing to accept that Howie's illness will prevent him from going to university and living a normal life, Stella fights the realization that she is outgrowing the love of her life.  What neither of them knows is that their world is on the precipice of disaster, and they will soon be swept apart by circumstances they could never have imagined possible.  Can Howie overcome his enemies and his own inner struggle with the zombie virus? Or will Stella have to end their relationship... with a meat cleaver?  Find out in History, the sequel which is both the end, and the beginning, of everything.  Praise for Chemistry (Stella Blunt #1)  \"Lynch's work is overflowing with wit...
