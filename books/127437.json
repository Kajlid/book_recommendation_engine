  "description": "This edition has been edited and updated with an extended ending. The original version was published in January 2014.(Please check the date on all reviews. Any review before October 2023 is for the FIRST edition. The extended ending of the second edition (with the skull cover) makes this \"not the same book\". While I stand by the original ending and didn't touch it, there is an extended ending in the new edition that changes things to the point that many of the earlier reviews no longer make sense and don't apply to this NEW edition.)A Dark Fairy Tale...What would you do for freedom? For salvation? How much evil would you commit to end your own suffering?August Corinth is a vampire cursed to kill and suffer the pain of his victims every night, until he can find the one soul who can resist his thrall and break the curse--his blood mate. He thought she was a myth, a fairy tale, but Nicolette Rose very much exists.The problem is, she’s in love with her husband. There are no lines August won’t cross to possess her, to claim her as his own. She will not move or sway him with those pretty tears. He’s suffered for centuries, and he will do whatever he must to make it stop--even if it means taking away everything and everyone she’s ever loved.",
