John Chisum, the Cattle King, planned to gain control by making sure that one of his men was picked as round-up captain. But the job went to a passing stranger. Getting rid of him should have been simple for Chisum and his gunslinging toughs. But there was one problem. The stranger's name was Dusty Fog.",
