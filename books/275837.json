He never imagined such a relationship could work, let alone that he’d be at the center of it, but a year later, his bond with the four mercenaries is stronger than ever. Each man in Clover’s life completes him in a whole different way. Where Drake teaches him shibari, Boar always showers him with cuddles. Where Tank is strict and protective, Pyro takes Clover on wild adventures. To truly become a part of the mercenary crew, Clover chose to train under the guidance of his men. He’s itching for action to prove to himself and to others that he can handle the toughest jobs.  But through violence and mayhem, Clover will be tried in ways he never wished for. Old enemies resurface, bonds are tested, and one wrong move can mean death. *THEIR BOUNTY is a dark gay harem contemporary romance, book 2 in the “Four Mercenaries” trilogy.
