  "description": "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. A young lawyer named Cotton Malone happened upon an explosive secret about what really happened that day—one that haunts him still. . . Known as a maverick in the field, Malone was doing legal work for the U.S. Navy when Stephanie Nelle, a high-ranking member of the Justice Department, sought his help in investigating a delicate situation involving a stolen rare coin and a rogue FBI faction. Soon, Malone realizes that the Justice Department and the FBI are really at war over something else entirely: a cadre of secret files about the King assassination. Caught in the midst of this epic clash, Malone ultimately discovers a shocking truth—one that could ruin innocent lives and threaten the legacy of the civil rights movement’s greatest martyr.Now, from the raucous bars of Mexico to the clear waters of the Dry Tortugas, the annals of history to the halls of power within Washington, D.C., Malone’s decision to see this case through to its rightful conclusion will not only change his own life but the course of history itself. . . “Fast-paced and exciting…Berry has a knack for presenting alternative history that seems as though it might be true.”—Library Journal (starred review) “A compelling historical mystery with a terrific payoff.”—Associated Press",
