The only bright point has been her new life at Cimmeria Academy. It’s the one place she’s felt she belongs. And the fact that it’s brought the brooding Carter West into her life hasn’t hurt either...  But the exclusive school’s cloistered walls are about to prove more dangerous than Allie could ever have imagined. The students are and teachers are under threat and Allie’s family – from her powerful grandmother to her missing brother – are at the centre of the storm.  Allie is going to have to choose between protecting her family and trusting her friends. And this time, no one is there to save her. This time, she’s going to have to save herself...
