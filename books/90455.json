It remains one of the world's most widely produced plays. The plot follows a love affair between two people, Doris and George, married to others, who rendezvous once a year. Twenty-five years of manners and morals are hilariously and touchingly played out by the lovers. \"Delicious wit, compassion, a sense of humor and a feel for nostalgia.\"- The New York Times \"Genuinely funny and genuinely romantic.\"- The New York Post",
