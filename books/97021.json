Nothing will sway her from her plans, especially the famous hockey player Dominic Chekovsky, who can't take no for an answer. But, when Dominic strolls into Cottage Grove and begs her in his thick Russian accent to keep his adoring female fans away from him, she's not going to turn him downâ€”because the job pays half a million dollars. Dominic Chekovsky life is out of control. American women go crazy around him. They invade his personal space, leave their husbands for him, and make his life hell. Except, Diana. She's the one woman who always turns him down, no matter how many times he asks her out on a date. Now he's desperate. He needs Diana's help to figure out why she's the only female immune to his charm, so he can continue to play hockey in the United States. Maybe when Diana finally allows herself to say yes to having sex with him, he'll be over his wild fascination with the one woman who always tells him no. Warning: Sexy Russian accent, big ego, and thick, hard thighs on ice. Go Sharks!",
