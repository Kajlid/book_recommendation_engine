  "description": "THE FINAL PART IN THE DARK EROTIC FAIRY TALE...  Hansel. Gretel.  They were captives who shared a wall, and cut a hole in it so they could hold each other's hands. Until he killed their captor, Mother. Then he disappeared, and as the world swooped in to save the Children locked away in Mother's house, the girl called Gretel became...lost. No breadcrumbs.  Finding Hansel, years later, is the shock of Leah McKenzie's adult life. Finding out how far she'll go for him - that's no surprise.  Leah's given Hansel - Lucas, he says it is - every piece of herself. And he's been both cruel and kind.  What they share is dangerous. What they feel is dark. Their history is twisted. Their hearts already broken. And that's before the secrets are revealed.  *Hansel Part 4 is the final installment in this erotic fairy tale. Full disclosure: it's a dark read. If you don't enjoy mind-bending stories with disturbing twists, this story may not be for you.",
