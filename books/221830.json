  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ISBN 9781481913027Eighteen years after Adam defeated the Kingdom of Parus and proclaimed himself emperor of Athesia, he dies peacefully in his sleep. When his daughter Amalia crowns herself empress and takes nobles from neighboring Eracia and Caytor hostage, the political situation in the Realms is primed to explode. Meanwhile, exiled god Damian has resumed his quest to flee his eternal prison and kill the remaining gods. With Damian renewing his murderous quest and tensions boiling over in the Realms, the conflicts breathlessly march toward an overwhelming conclusion. Will Athesia prevail, or will it take a new leader to keep the empire intact? Will King Sergei of Parus be successful in his plans to avenge his family? Can Damian succeed in breaking the bonds of his imprisonment, or will he succumb to the one emotion he's had all along? Bringing back the series' signature tone and styling, the novel's gritty realism, intense atmosphere, and intricate storyline make The Broken more than live up to the promise of The Betrayed. A harsh lesson in morality, The Broken will leave readers clamoring for more.",
