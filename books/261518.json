  "title": "Kael Jai: Outcast",
  "description": "His name is Kael Jai. They thought he would be safe on earth, but they were wrong. Nothing could stop the enemy from finding him. He'd been sent to earth for protection, to this planet that was so far from the war that raged on his home-world light years away. He was an outcast, having failed in winning the long battle with the madman called Jindom who intended to rule the entire planet. After a year's sojourn, Jindom had discovered Kael's location and sent one war machine to earth to kill him. But one was not enough. One was their mistake. Now Kael Jai intended to settle the score once and for all, to return to his planet and make good on a promise to his people; to rule Trinoor in peace and to rid the planet of the madman called Jindom.",
