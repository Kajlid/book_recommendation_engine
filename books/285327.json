  "description": "\"Pink is a keen observer of the culture of minimum-wage jobs and low-rent studio apartments that is the reality of life for all those who don't find a cog space in today's hyper-capitalist economy.\" —The GuardianIt was maybe the first job I'd ever had where people were happy to see me.  An odd feeling indeed, to wield this kind of power.  To be this kind of force.  As near to magical as any mortal should stride.  A technician of unspeakable joy.  Braving the neon mountains to return with blue raspberry concentrate.  Tearing out sundae cone fangs from the mouths of snow beasts.  And so on. Cone dealer, sunshine stealer, alleyway counselor, lunch lady to the homeless, friend to the dead, maker of sandwiches. Metal wrangler. Stag among stags. And so it goes—another journey through time spent punched in. A life's work of working for a living. Blood, death, and violence. Dirty dishes, dead roaches, and sparkler-lit nights. Nights ahead and no real fate. So open your mouths because the forecast calls for sprinkles. Thirteen delights, scooped and served. Let it melt down your hand. Let the sun burn your face. It's the ice cream man, and other stories.",
