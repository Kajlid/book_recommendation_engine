It is a powerful account of God and #146;s working in one man and #146;s physical and emotional suffering, helping him discover the real meaning of joy.  Tim doesn and #146;t treat lightly the difficulties of anyone and #146;s life. In his words, and #147;this book is in no way meant to diminish the awfulness of pain, tragedy, and affliction. I don and #146;t want to and #145;celebrate pain, and #146; but more deeply understand the dignity of what can happen in it, through it, and because of it. and #148;  Tim Hansel is the founder of Summit Expedition, a wilderness survival school for individuals seeking deeper experiences with themselves, others, and God.
