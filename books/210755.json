  "description": "Elektra. The first woman ever loved by Daredevil, the man without fear. Her touch was warmth. Her smile was light. Then, her father was murdered, and a soft heart became as stone. She left this country, driven by rage and grief, to study the many arts of killing with an order of ninja called The Hand - until she betrayed them. Forced into exile, she came back to the land known as America; now, as an assassin-for-hire. And for her crimes, this tragic, haunted woman is hunted by the one man she has ever cared for, remembered through years of loneliness and denial - Daredevil! When Elektra confronts her lost love, only death can follow.",
