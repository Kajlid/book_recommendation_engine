  "description": "Strange things have been brewing in the village of Ashlaw in 1923: the once-prosperous drapers' shop has gone bankrupt and three separate families' lives have each, it seems, been hexed. In a bigger town such news might happen every day, but in tiny, remote Ashlaw, even one of these curses can set the whole village off-kilter.So what could be responsible for the stir? Margot, a local, precocious schoolgirl, has been trying to figure this out, especially since hers was one of the three ill-fated families. She comes to a strange conclusion-each of these curses somehow involves one Linden Grey, the most intriguing woman Margot has ever met. She determines to understand, once and for all, Linden's identity and her preternatural, even deadly, powers. But in her search, is Margot willing to hand over her childish innocence?With eerie suspense and clever turns of plot, Anna Gilbert bewitches believers and non-believers alike in this chronicle of a village's encounter with the other-worldly.",
