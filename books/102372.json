  "title": "Indelible Lovin': Max & Jane's Story Vol. 2",
  "description": "Last we met, I was doing a great job getting to know Max's family and trying to soften up his ice cold parents, when his mother dropped a serious bomb on me. Max, Hannah, an unwanted pregnancy...then I blanked out! This volume explains what happened since that night, and I get to tell you about all the ways Max and I love each other, frustrate the hell out of each other, and overall try and grow with each other.In Vol. 2 of my story, you meet Max's brothers - both of whom I adore, get a glimpse into the weirdness going on between (my) Donovan and Laney, and see my family constantly running interference for me and Max. There are days when I don't think we will make it, and Donovan Taylor does his part to ruin my relationship with Max. But in the end, love and fiction rule, and a happily ever after is restored...or is it? There are more twists and turns in my life than a roller coaster ride at Great America. Why can't life be simpler? I guess if life was easy, it'd be boring.Check out Vol. 2 and I promise you won't be disappointed. It was nice getting to know so many of you during the eight-month blog run. I'm sure even after my story ends, we'll see each other again in another Reid saga.Talk to you soon!Jane",
