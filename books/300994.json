  "description": "Prisoners. That’s all we’ve ever known in life, until the portal opened and we were finally able to escape Hell.As Lycans we’ve always been adaptable, some of the smartest supernatural creatures there is. When we walked through that portal we found ourselves in a quaint town in Canada.We came across a biker club in the middle of the woods, along the main road and walked inside. This could be our way to integrate into this community. We were certain of it.Only, we didn’t anticipate for there to be other Lycans around, or a pair of sassy witches who couldn’t help but get under our skin. With these two sets of supernaturals, chaos begins to fall from around them. Specifically the witches. Their kind has always been trouble. I suppose they can’t help it.Both of these witches are captivating. Tetra with her fiery red hair and fierce spirit, and then her twin sister, Jadis. I feel a pull towards them, almost like I have to help them sort out their issues. My pack and I will do anything to ensure Lucifer doesn’t track us down, even if it means helping solve problems that aren’t necessarily ours to deal with. Only, in helping solve them . . . I begin to realize something bigger is at play.Being on Earth never meant we’d do it the good way. Bloodshed follows us wherever we go and by the end of this . . . many lives will be lost.",
