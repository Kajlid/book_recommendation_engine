  "description": "**This novella was previously found in A Summons From Yorkshire and Ladies & Gentlemen... \"Ava Stone's sparkling dialogue and fun characters make for a delicious read. You'll eat it up!\" ~ Sabrina Jeffries, NYT Bestselling author Lady Emma Whitton has decided its time to take her future in her own hands. She has been in love with Viscount Heathfield since she was in leading strings. Unfortunately, it's been almost that long since she's laid eyes on her brother's old friend and vice versa. Tired of waiting for him to remember her, Emma pens a holiday invitation (in her brother's hand) to Heathfield and waits as patiently as she is able for her one true love to arrive. Heath isn't quite certain what to make of the very strange summons he received, but his curiosity is most definitely piqued. He heads north to Danby Castle, only to find that his very orderly life is about to be turned upside down.",
