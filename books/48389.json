But far too many of those same marketers ignore the critical importance of the lead.In Great The Six Easiest Ways to Start Any Sales Message marketing genius Michael Masterson and master copywriter John Forde break through that ignorance to provide a clear, concise, and easy-to-follow guide to writing successful leads. But this is not a simple “How To” book on leads. Great Leads goes far deeper.

It is the only book of its kind.",
