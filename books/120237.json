  "description": "The weather outside may be frightful, but the WILD Boys keep things delightful with four stories that will keep you hotter-than-hot under the covers. These mini episodes give emotional updates for the couples with whom you've fallen in love during the series’ first three books, as well as a not-to-be-missed preview of what's in store for Tait Bommer and Kellan Rush in Book 5.  \"Raze the Barn\": Garrett and Sage reignite their flame as Master and S during a well-timed visit to see Wyatt and Josie on the farm, and a visit to \"kinky barn\" that neither will soon forget.  \"Tie the Knots\": Garrett and Sage have finally said \"I Do\", but the knot-tying lessons have just begun for Zeke and Rayna, a Best Man and Maid of Honor who only have eyes--and other body parts--for each other.  \"Diamonds In The Rain\": Ethan's taking Ava home to meet his parents, but when a mansion full of friends is invited for the occasion, there's a storm of deeper conflict for the couple, requiring Runway to expose his \"inner Dom\" in a decadent new way.  \"Moonrise\": Their road to love was filled with the craziest twists life could deal--before it completely blew up the route. Now, Luna is locked from Tait in a night that doesn’t seem to have an end. Can he bring the light of love back to her?",
