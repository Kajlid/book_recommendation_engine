  "description": "Welcome to the sleepy town of Majic, where neighbourhood watch is a killer â€¦For Nell Forrest, life in the little town of Majic is not going smoothly. One of her five daughters has just swapped university for fruit-picking, another is about to hit puberty, while a third keeps leaving aggrieved messages on the answering machine. On top of all this, her mother is infuriating and it's only been a matter of months since Nell lost her husband of twenty-five years. It's no surprise, then, that she is even struggling to write her weekly column. But the floodgates of inspiration are about to swing open, almost knocking her out in the process. Murder and mayhem, arson and adultery, dungeons, death threats and disappearances are just around the corner. Despite Nell's abysmal aptitude for investigative work, she manages to shine the light on the local Richard III Society and that's when things really start to heat up. Throw in some suspicious widows, nosy neighbours, a canine witness, plus a detective who is getting a little closer than he should, and it's clear that nefarious doings are well and truly afoot. Nefarious Doings is the first book in Ilsa Evans' new Nell Forrest Mystery series. The second is Ill-Gotten Gains.\"Funny and heartwarming, Nefarious Doings kept me turning the pages until its surprising but entirely satisfying conclusion, when I found myself sad to leave Nell and the town. I'm eagerly looking forward to the next instalment.\" - Di Blacklock",
