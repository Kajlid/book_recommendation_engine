  "description": "When a threat so brutal it has the force to rip the magic right out of the world takes over Vagabond Circus, everyone seeks refuge away from the big top. Finley knows he has to protect the circus he’s grown to love, and its people. But to do that he’ll have to further scar his soul. Jack is relentless to take back what was stolen from him, but in the process he becomes someone he never expected. And this acrobat, who once stole the hearts of millions, accidentally steals a heart he didn’t expect. But it is Titus who is most changed by the events at Vagabond Circus. He’s always been the fearful coward, but with a new threat bearing down on his best friend’s circus he knows he has to invent the courage to become a new man. Zuma watches from the sidelines as the people she loves grow in an effort to save one of the most important ventures in the world. In this final installment to the Vagabond Circus series, deals will be made, futures tampered with, and everyone’s hearts broken. But the question that will keep the troupe of this circus going is precisely the same one that will plague readers. Can Dr. Dave Raydon’s circus be saved? And if it can’t, then is everything around it doomed?",
