  "description": "There are crazier ways to spend a holiday. At least that’s what journalist Janey Turner keeps telling herself when she agrees to spend Thanksgiving with the editor she’s never met in person before…who lives three hundred fifty miles away.The recently divorced mom hopes the trip to Casper, Wyoming, will be a welcome distraction on her first single holiday, and a great chance to pick the boss’s brain on how to get a front-page byline. But the chemistry that flares between her and Joe Argenti is as hot and unexpected as the lightning strike that soon ignites Casper Mountain. When a massive wildfire erupts, it’s Janey’s big chance to get ahead—but only if she’s willing to risk this budding relationship. Will her professional dreams cost her a merry Christmas?",
