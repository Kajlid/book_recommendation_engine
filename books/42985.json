In another story, Andrea rents her garage apartment to a strange couple and ends up saving a life and losing her rental income. Then there’s Aunt Libby, who dies after drinking a margarita. Was it a stroke, or did someone do her in, someone who’s interested in her will and the valuable timber on her property?
