  "description": "Second Edition. Proceeds from the sale of this edition of A Woman Called God will go to fight violence against women throughout the world.So, why couldn’t God be a woman? Really, why not? In this adorably playful, yet poignant and timely book, A Woman Called God asks all of us – women and men alike – to consider how the world would and could look if our universal perception of The Creator were not male but female: a mother-figure of unconditional love.The result of a seventy-year personal journey by the author, A Woman Called God revolutionizes the traditional thinking of organized religion and makes possible a new and inviting path for every woman and man on the planet.In its short five-minute read you may discover a new way of thinking. In its simple 27 hand-drawn stick-figures you may find a new dialogue. And in its less than 500 words you might even uncover answers that will take you and the world in a new and welcome direction.",
