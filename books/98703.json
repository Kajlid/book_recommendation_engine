  "description": "The dictionary defines phobia as a persistent, irrational fear that can interfere with the ability to socialize, work, or go about everyday life. In this hilarious collection of essays by entertainment industry veteran, Roger Lefkon—a self-proclaimed world-classphobic—readers will surely identify with at least one fear that strikes close to home. This book is by no means written from a medical or scientific point of view and is certainly not meant to be prescriptive. But since, as the saying goes, laughter is the best medicine, The World Is A Really Scary Place does provide some medicinal value. While reading this laugh-out-loud collection, you may not be cured of what ails you, but you will be entertained and feel better just knowing you’re not Roger Lefkon.",
