  "title": "Case of the Cottingley Fairies",
  "description": "This biography examines whether two cousins, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, really witnessed and photographed fairies in the suburb of Cottingley in Bradford over 70 years ago. It questions why people such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Edward Gardner were convinced that the photographs were genuine. This text reveals what the author discovered about the case of the Cottingley fairies, as he worked with the two cousins for six years for the purpose of his research, and found that some of their prevarications become confessions. However, it also explains how, to her death Frances maintained that \"There were fairies at Cottingley\", and how one of the photographs has never been satisfactorily explained. Giving an insider's perspective on the case of the Cottingley fairies, this biography reveals a great deal about the human will to believe the incredible.",
