This journey will take them to a country which promises safety and a new life. The only problem is, they don't have a ticket, and people are stopping at nothing to get a place on board. Luckily Papa has a secret that could change everything. But who can they trust to help them?Reminiscent of Anne Holm and Sonya Hartnett, Close to the Wind is a powerful and moving novel about greed, love, trust and what matters most when your world falls apart.",
