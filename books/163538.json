  "description": "Two years on the run. Two years since Jennifer Clarkson fled for her life and now she’s back, but Whispering Pines has changed. Two years ago The Death Crusaders battled their rivals the Devil’s Advocates and the Sleazebags MC and it did not go well. The resulting chaos left dozens of hardcore bikers injured, fatally wounded or dead and scores imprisoned. In twenty-four hours Whispering Pines became a zero tolerance no man’s land for bikers of any breed. “Show your cut, go to jail” was the Mayor’s promise. Jennifer Clarkson thought she was coming back to start her life over with Blade the new president of the rag-tag band of what’s left of the Death Crusaders but what she got was not what she expected. The moment she rides into town her life is in danger and the man she had fallen in love with is not the same man he was when she fled. When her first stop is the town’s cemetery it becomes clear to her that the life she had known has been lost to her. Unable to tell her new friends from her enemies both new and old, Jennifer Clarkson becomes a minor sleuth and searches for answers others are dying to protect. How many people will have to die for her curiosity and will there be anyone left that she cares for? All she has to do is stay alive for ten days; easy right?  Purge is a fast-paced race against time that does not let up until the last page is turned. Detailed thoughtful descriptions give way to crisp, clear, and witty dialogue in a story that is as violent and it is provocative and will have readers cringing and blushing at the same time.  This gritty contemporary romance novel is the second book in the Death Crusaders MC series, contains scenes of explicit violence and sexual content.",
