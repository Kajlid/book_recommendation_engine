  "description": "The English translation of new work from a celebrated Danish poet. Frayed Opus for Strings & Wind Instruments is a collection of poems that zooms in and out of places and states of mind, from a lit bicycle shed in the back yard to a root canal in November, from a typhoon in Hong Kong to instincts astray in various Copenhagen neigbourhoods. Elegantly translated by Canadian collaborators Per Brask and Patrick Friesen, these dreamlike poems attempt, with honesty and humour, to fathom what it is to inhabit a specifically unspecific point in life - not to mention in the Universe. ?In my pocket I havethe photo of the house, I have to stop continually, putthe suitcases down, take the photo from my pocketand compare the house in the photo with the houseswe pass. In this way seventeen years go by.- from Frayed Opus for Strings & Wind Instruments Praise for the work of Ulrikka S. \"?airy and abstract, like pinching smoke? risky and intriguing.\" - The Antigonish Review",
