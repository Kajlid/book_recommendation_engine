  "description": "\"A powerful, severe, and harshly comic portrayal of Irish immigrant life in lower New York exactly a century ago.\"â€”Alfred Kazin. Although fellow novelists William Dean Howells and Hamlin Garland immediately recognized genius in the twenty-one-year-old author of Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, in 1893 most readers were unwilling to accept its unconventional theme and were uneasy with a style that was at once darkly naturalistic and vividly impressionistic. Today Maggie is esteemed as an American classic, the first of an impressive group of works in which Crane explored the underside of urban life, portraying the rise of the metropolis as it alters not just the human environment but human nature itself. This volume includes \"George's Mother\" and eleven other tales and sketches of New York written between 1892 and 1896. Together in their dignified realism these tales confirm Crane's place as the first modern American writer.",
