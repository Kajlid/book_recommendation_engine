Owen is a teenager who grew up on the flooded coastline of Australia. He sets out on a journey to find a missing marine biologist but is about to come up against powerful forces that will push his mind and body beyond their limits. Owen must solve the mystery of Evelyn’s disappearance before those forces change the ocean forever and threaten the future of the entire planet.Owen likes writing poetry (or he used to) but he’ll need to revive every last one of his poetic skills to find the clues that will guide him. Time is running out but why is poetry suddenly so important?This book uses the latest topographic maps and climate science to imagine what Australia could really be like in a hundred years. It also explores the human response to these changes. What are the implications for the rest of the world?",
