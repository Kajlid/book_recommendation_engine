With triplets.I just have to find a way to tell the one-night stand he's going to be a dad...My Grumpy Billionaire is a laugh-out-loud swoonfest including a smoking hot masked hookup, a few silicone toys, and a peopling-averse hero you can’t help but love. It’s a stand-alone romance guaranteed to give you all the feels, along with the grand gestures and happy ending you crave.",
