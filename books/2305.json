  "description": "Meet David Boring -- a feckless lad of 19, who works as a night watchman in an unnamed parody of downtown Chicago. He lives with his best friend Dot, a disaffected lesbian he met in high school (\"We made super-8 movies and talked in endless gynecological detail about all the girls in our class [and one particularly braless math teacher]\").Boring is infatuated with a drawing of a woman (nude, from behind, looking over her shoulder) he's clipped from a magazine. On the way to the funeral of a childhood friend he, amazingly, meets her (at least it looks just like her) and insinuates himself into her life. After they date for seven weeks, she disappears. Boring is devasted.Then someone shoots him in the head.David wakes up stranded on his family's New England island retreat with relatives, friends, murderers, lesbians and maniacs. Relationships and unlikely couplings develop, and the primal nature of man comes slowly to the fore.At once a paranoid whodunnit, fragmented slice of life and surrealistic fantasy, \"David Boring\" checks into your head and won't leave anytime soon.",
