  "description": "Ever since he could remember, seventeen-year-old Eloik MacMillan has suffered terrifyingly real nightmares. Tormented and ridden with guilt by his fears, teased and bullied by his peers, Eloik wants nothing more than to be left alone. But he will unwittingly go from outsider to insider to play a key role in an epic battle that will determine the ultimate fate of the universe. With his newfound Dreamrider friends Janika, Dylan, and Nilianna, he must now confront Kuwursha, the Queen of Nightmares, Widow-with-a-Thousand-Faces, whose relentless goal is to rule supreme over the dream world and the unconscious mind. If she succeeds, it will be the end of humankind. Are our dreams an escape from reality or are they a bridge to a completely different universe? The Dreamerâ€™s Awakening spans this great divide, shedding light on vastly unexplored worlds beyond our consciousness.",
