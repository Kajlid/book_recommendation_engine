Jeremy Lander wanted nothing more than to relax during his summer break, but a Saloli tribe looms on the brink of war and is forced to look for help outside their own species. Facing the threat of never being human again, Jeremy must serve his new tribe, even to the point of death, all while keeping his human past a secret. The stakes grow higher every day. The upcoming war could affect far more than one measly forest, and Jeremy may just be the deciding factor.",
