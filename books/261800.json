  "title": "Molly and the Night Monster",
  "description": "When Molly wakes up in the middle of the night and hears the sound of a step on the stairs, her imagination runs absolutely wild. It could be a crocodile creeping up to catch her . . . or a giant giraffe outside on the landing . . . or an enormous elephant turning the doorknob and opening the door . . . or even a night monster coming to gobble her up. But when Molly surprises the tiptoeing beast, she gets an even bigger surprise of her own! This simple, soothing bedtime story is perfect for dispelling fears of the dark and monsters under the bed.",
