  "description": "It's the end of days. The sky is falling, the seas are burning and your neighbour is a zombie. It's brutal out there. It's every man for himself and these heels are going to have to go; you simply can't run in them! Across two volumes, The Girl at the End of the World offers forty-one striking visions of the apocalypse and the women and girls dealing with it. From gods to zombies, from epic to deeply personal, from the moment of impact to a future where life is long forgotten; bestselling authors and exciting new writers deliver tales you'll still remember when holed up in a fallout shelter with one remaining bullet and a best friend with a suspicious bite mark on their neck.1,1 Antichristine James Bennett1,1 Change of Address Rob Harkess1,1 Coming Back Tracy Fahey1,1 Skin James Oswald1,1 The Borrowed Man James S Dorr1,1 The End of the Garden Catherine Mann1,1 The Ending Plague Andrew Reid1,1 The Wife of Watsorous Nathan Lunt1,2 A Sailor Girl Goes Ashore Margret Helgadottir1,2 Blueprint for Redwings Ruth E J Booth1,2 Demon Runner Dash Cooray1,2 Little Daughter Dayna Ingram1,2 Rolling in the Deep Cat Connor1,2 Sophie and the Gate to Hell Carol Borden1,2 The Glaciers Stone Alexander Danner1,2 The Last Rushani Jonathan Ward1,3 In the Absence John Perkins1,3 Only So Far Adam Rodenberger1,3 Saint Salima Alex Helm1,3 Somebody to Play with Geraldine Clark Hellery1,3 The Beast Within Christian Dâ€™Amico1,3 Zompoc in Nashville K.A.Laity1,3 All things Fall Chloe Yates",
