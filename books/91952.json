But the welcome they may have expected isn’t waiting for them. Finding themselves in a world that is in some ways just as hostile as the colonial battlegrounds, the veterans must hold close to each other amongst the chaos of a peace no-one thinks will hold, combatting enemies from without and, most of all, from within.In this much-anticipated sequel to Virtues of War, author Bennett R. Coles sweeps the reader back into the futuristic world of the Terran Astral Force: a world where love and loyalty are painted in shades of grey,and where truth is very often the first casualty of war.",
