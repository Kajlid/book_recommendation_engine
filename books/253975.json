It's been three years since chef Erin shot her boyfriend, John, five times during a domestic dispute. Two years since she was found not guilty on murder charges by way of self-defense. And one year since she opened Essen, a German restaurant in San Francisco's East Bay. You can read all about it in her memoir; there's a copy on the front seat of the car parked in front of Essen. The man in the driver's seat was John's best friend, Alex, a former engineer. Heâ€™s abandoned his career to take justice into his own hands, what he doesn't know is that soon he'll be inside, using those hands to peel carrots for the girl who can cook.",
