  "description": "Some secrets refuse to stay buried... it’s time for Retribution.***Raven hasn’t had it easy; her life has been a whirlwind of clusterfucks and disasters, but the latest has left her reeling. She’s faced with a tough decision: crumble and break, or rebuild and come back fighting harder than ever.With the help of the guys she loves picking her up and supporting her every step of the way, she chooses the second option. But as secrets and lies are revealed, even with fierce love on their side, it might not be enough to help Raven in the fight of her life.Can a secret that refuses to stay buried be the key to serving up the ultimate retribution to Cordelia and finding Raven’s happiness once and for all? Or is this a secret too far – something there’s no coming back from that will threaten to tear them all apart for good?***Retribution is a contemporary New Adult reverse harem revenge romance, with some dark themes. It is told from multiple points of view and is a medium burn with a HFN/HEA. It contains hot guys, bad language, and sexual scenes. I would love for you to read this book, but please be aware that it comes with triggers, a warning of 18+, and you really need to have read Vengeance and Atonement first, as this is the final book in the trilogy.",
