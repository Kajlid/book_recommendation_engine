  "description": "An elegant memorial to the victims of the Armenian genocide—from the award-winning author of The Brick House.A New York Times Notable Book that imagines the lives of several sufferers of the twentieth century’s first genocide. Anaguil, an Armenian girl taken in by Turkish neighbors after the death of her parents who now views the remains of her world through a Muslim veil; Sargis, a poet hidden away in his mother’s attic, dressed in women’s clothing, and steadily going mad; Lucine, a servant and lover of the American consul; Maritsa, a rage-filled Muslim wife who becomes a whore; and Dickran, an infant left behind under a tree on the long exodus from an Armenian village, who reaches with tiny hands to touch the stars and dies with his name unrecorded. Through the lives depicted in Three Apples Fell From Heaven , we witness the vanishing of a people. Together, the stories of these lives form a narrative mosaic — faceted, complex, richly textured, a devastating tableau.",
