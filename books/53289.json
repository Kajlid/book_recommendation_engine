  "description": "No one said love was easy and Laurel Peterson figured she'd probably picked the most complicated form of it known to humanity. She'd fallen for a man who was totally unattainable. A working author in a sleepy mountain town in Georgia, Laurel depended on Detective John McAllister to provide the necessary facts for the romantic suspense novels she wrote for a living. The longer their association went on, the deeper in love she fell for him. There were two problems with this; the first being that Detective McAllister was trapped in a loveless marriage that he refused to end. The second was that Laurel was openly and unashamedly, a witch; something John couldn't wrap his practical mind around. Deciding the only way she could ever be free of him is to leave, Laurel packs up and takes off to the small Caribbean island of Bimini. Just when she begins to think she's safe in her new life, Detective McAllister appears one steamy, tropical night to claim what he now considers to be rightfully his. Newly divorced and on a mission to win Laurel's love, John is forced to look closer and more intimately at the woman who has captivated his mind and heart for more years than he cared to admit. When the murders start, beginning with Laurel's friend Rick, John is forced to concede that Laurel's psychic and magical abilities are all too real as she becomes linked to a supernatural killer bent on stealing the souls of his victims. Together and with the help of the island's police chief, John and Laurel must face down Belial, a demon who is older than time, locking Laurel in a battle of life and death.",
