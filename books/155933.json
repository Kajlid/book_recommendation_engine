  "description": "What you're about to read is based on a chance meeting I had with self-confessed murderer on a train. During the 60 minute journey, I was disgusted, terrified and shocked but never bored. He asked me to get off at the next stop and run away with him. I didn't, but from the safety of the pages of my new novel, I gave it a try. THE KILLING OF MUMMY'S BOY‘I slit someone’s throat,’ the man told the woman on the 4.20 from Waterloo to Portsmouth.’ Two strangers. One shared interest. Murder. Ben slit a man’s throat. Sandra’s son, Carl witnessed a murder. With Carl on a Witness Protection Programme, Sandra fled London to live anonymously in a remote village on the Isle of Wight where she becomes increasingly isolated and vulnerable. Terrorised by an unknown stalker, the police are unable to help and she turns to Ben. What makes a respectable, middle-aged woman want to sleep with a killer? More importantly, can the relationship give her the love she craves and help Ben find redemption? Hate, fear and lies boil over in a page-turner with love at its black heart.",
