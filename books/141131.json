  "description": "Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00FQSM6S0.Will the pain they feel ever lead to pleasure or will they always be searching for something? Shifting together. Shifting apart. Making lyrical love, dancing wildly in the dark. Author Note: *The Shifting Series is not paranormal. This Coming of Age Romance trilogy is a love story told in the dual POV of two best friends, Josh and Riley, woven poetically with his music and her dark poetry. It’s not an easy story to tell, but love isn’t always rainbows and sunshine and often times we must travel through the dark to find the light at the end of the tunnel. This is their journey. Is taking a chance with your heart worth the escape, or was it better to have never loved at all? Can forgiveness really set you free?After the unexpected death of her Dad, and the haunting manner in which he died, Riley Shaw built invisible walls around her heart. Barriers she created to protect her from splintering into broken pieces that couldn’t be repaired. She was unable to move forward from her past, letting the guilt of her parent’s mistakes dictate her own choices.Dean Warren was safe. Being with him was innocent and peaceful because she didn’t truly love him. His words held her captive in a false sense of security. His eyes were deceptive, and his promises of never pushing her beyond what she was willing to give were broken, leaving Riley in a state of regret and doubt.Joshua Parker had the power to take what was left of Riley’s splintered pieces and ruin her completely, or make her whole again. He was her best friend, her next-door neighbor—everything she wanted and settled on never having. Loving him was as easy as breathing air. The fear of losing him forever was more real to her than the feelings she couldn’t escape.When faced with the very thing she feared the most, and in the arms she thought were safe, Riley finds herself questioning every decision she has made over the past two years. When she finally escapes the doubt in her head, and accepts the truth in her heart, is it too late?“I'm so close to the edge of the cliff that I know one more breath, one more inch, I could fall.” -Riley ShawDisclaimer: Not recommended for anyone under the age of 17 due to underage drinking, sexual content and adult language.***Warning*** This is book one in a trilogy (The beginning of Josh and Riley).
