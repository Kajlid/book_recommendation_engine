  "description": "Can Andy live up to his brother's basketball legacy? When Andy Soaring's older brother, Pete, died in World War I, Andy's life changed forever. Now, five years later, Andy is fourteen and beginning to feel the weight of his brother's legacy, especially when he holds Pete's basketball in his hands. Andy dreams of leading his high-school team to the Indiana state tournament, as his brother did before him. If only Andy could be a basketball star, maybe he could ease his parents' sadness, and, more important, feel like he truly belongs to his family. But when Andy lets pride get in the way--over a girl, no less--all bets are off. Set against the backdrop of Prohibition, this stunning novel tells of one boy's search for answers--and the perfect free throw.",
