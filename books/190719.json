Blond and dark, yin and yang, perhaps even angel and devil.In fact, sometimes Thomas Fitzgerald wonders whether the mysterious Burns is a figment of his lonely nights, a creature evolved from an idealized portrait of the poet Robert Burns.Real or not, the university teacher-curator teams up with him to solve a murder involving a Celtic burial site and a voice from Scotland’s bloody past.Join two unusual sleuths at the ancient mound called “The Dundee Law” as two men merge their talents, and much more.",
