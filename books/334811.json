  "description": "When Dad springs an impromptu wedding on my brothers and me, we all show up to support him. Even though I’d rather be inking some skin at my tattoo parlor, I grin and bear it for my father’s sake.The ceremony blows, and champagne doesn’t hit the spot like whiskey does. I’m ready to slip out of there until the prettiest little angel I’ve ever seen stumbles into me, snapping me out of my surly mood.Her big brown eyes are sweet and innocent, and her radiant smile gives me a reason to suffer through the rest of the reception. She might be nine years younger than me, but that doesn’t phase me one bit.Everything’s going great until her real identity is revealed, and my mood sours faster than day-old fish.She’s my new stepsister.",
