  "title": "Phoenix Down",
  "description": "Alex is just settling in to a relaxing Spring Break when a leprechaun appears at her door and tells her to run. And she doesn’t stop running: from the police, the FBI, angry griffins, a powerful wizard, and her teachers – who happen to be Amazon warriors. ‘Detention’ has a far more serious meaning if all your teachers carry spears across their backs and know how to use them! Her Buddha-quoting grandmother and the leprechauns seem to have a plan to get her out of her mess, but the more she follows it, the worse things seem to get. The down of the phoenix just might help, but then again, if she uses it wrong she could rip apart the very fabric of existence.",
