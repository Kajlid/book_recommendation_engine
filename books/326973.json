  "description": "Nora, Noah, and John.They work together. Nora and Noah have been playfully flirting for a while, their relationship stuck in a safe, comfort zone that is probably not so comfortable anymore. Noah’s friend, John, is going to change their relationship. He’s distant and gloomy, but there’s something behind that front, that the two of them can see. What they can’t see is John’s past, something terrible he doesn’t want to share with anybody, that makes him mean, difficult, and sad.This is a story about a polyamorous MMF relationship, with angst, love, and a lot of hot sex with dirty talk and BDSM. Mention of clinical depression only in the backstory.It’s a standalone.By the end of the book there’s a crossover with some characters from the previous books by the same author, and two steamy bonus chapters dedicated to those characters.",
