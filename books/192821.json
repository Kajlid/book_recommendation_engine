  "description": "Ethan Morgan never asked to be firstborn—and definitely didn’t buy into all the ridiculous tradition that came with it. From the time he could talk though, Andrew, Ethan’s twin and younger brother by mere seconds, begged for the honor. Maybe if he’d just given it to him—signed away his birthright like Esau—he wouldn’t be a cop on the wrong side of a crime scene. But here he was, left with nothing but a widow, a missing family heirloom and a heart filled with rage, regret and bitterness. Is that what it takes to step up to family responsibility? Do the sins of the fathers revisit their sons, or do the ghosts of the past make believers of them?",
