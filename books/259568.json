  "title": "Becoming Eichmann: Rethinking the Life, Crimes, and Trial of a \"Desk Murderer\"",
  "description": "Becoming Eichmann, the first account of Eichmann’s life to appear in over forty years, reveals a surprising portrait of the man once seen as epitomizing the “banality of evil.” Drawing on recently unearthed documents, David Cesarani explores Eichmann’s early career, when he learned how to become an administrator of genocide, and shows how Eichmann developed into the Reich’s “expert” on Jewish matters, becoming ever more hateful and brutal. This sobering account deepens our understanding and challenges our preconceptions of Adolf Eichmann and offers fresh insights into both the operation of the “Final Solution” and its most notorious perpetrator.",
