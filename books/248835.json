Well, it would if they could find someone to fill the gap in their lives. In comes their sexy new housekeeper, Sascha Dubois. An American ex-pat in London, this chick has no problem with setting these guys' worlds on fire. In the bedroom and out of it. Only trouble is, Sascha's not like any woman they've ever met.
