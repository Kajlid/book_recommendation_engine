  "description": "Do fallen angels really fly? Does karma really exist? The Harper family is becoming impatient and believing it to be untrue. Just as an unwelcome guest appears at Lyla and Everett's big engagement party, the pieces they picked up fall apart and scatter in the wind along with the virtue that they clutch onto... hope.  Lyla and Everett's love is tested and taken to the edge of an abyss of uncertainty as someone's life hangs in the balance all while the dots start to connect between Michael Thomas and someone he thought he ridded the world from. Will going back to Chicago tear them apart when a person from Lyla's past reemerges from the depths of her heart, making her reconsider her future?  People hide. They cheat, lie and they hold secrets in their souls. Will the two new lovers be resilient enough when the eye of the storm approaches the heart of Rigdon and follows them to the big city of Chicago?  **Graphic content. Not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.**",
