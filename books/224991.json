  "description": "The world is made safe by a woman . . . but it is a very big world. \nIt has been generations since the Storyteller Queen saved her country from fire and blood - but now, the kingdom of Kharuf is threatened by a demon gathering power. When a princess is born, the demon is ready with her final blow: a curse that will cost that princess her very soul, or force her to destroy her own people to save her life. The threads of magic are tightly spun, binding princess and exiled spinners into a desperate plot to break the curse. But the web of power is dangerously tangled - and they may not see the true pattern until it is unspooled.Kingdom of Sleep by the critically acclaimed E. K. Johnston, is a spellbinding retelling of an enchanting fairy tale with the power of story at its heart.",
