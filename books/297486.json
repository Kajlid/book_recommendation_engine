  "description": "Tamsen Hayes vowed never to return to her hometown of Franklin, North Carolina. But then again, she never thought she would lose her job and end her relationship on the same day, either. Weary of the hustle and bustle of corporate work and city life and in need of a new place to live, Tamsen impulsively purchases a fixer-upper farm that she had always admired as a child. With a few coats of colorful paint, and the addition of a few adorable goats, her little farm in the holler starts to feel like home.What she didn’t bet on was that a handsome neighbor with a mysterious past would come with the territory. Despite their friendship and mutual attraction, Tamsen just can’t seem to shake the memories of her ex, and finds herself building a wall and running away before she gets hurt by anyone… especially the enigmatic Jake Turner. Tamsen soon learns that if she can’t move on, she might end up closing the door on something good and missing out on an unexpected love that, just maybe, was always meant to be.",
