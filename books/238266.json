Alice Sharp is no different – until a mysterious theft threatens to ruin a dear friend. The investigation leads Alice deep into London’s underbelly.

There is nothing that should bring them together…except the magnetic power of the attraction neither Alice nor Kirby can deny.  Can Kirby help Alice catch her thief?
