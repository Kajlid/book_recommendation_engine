  "description": "Designer Marly West has one reason for taking the job at Draconia Fashions...and it's not to come up with the latest clothing trends. But when she blurts out a good idea in a corporate meeting, she gets exactly what she didn’t want … an opportunity of a lifetime. Too bad taking advantage of it might reveal the secret she desperately needs to keep hidden. But it’s too late to get out of it now, and she soon finds that she’s in over her head with a boardroom full of resentful executives, a hot CEO, and a jealous M&M-scarfing assistant who wants to make sure Marly doesn’t succeed.",
