  "description": "Captain Sheppard McCloud is unexpectedly called to Washington in May of 1942 while his ship, the battle cruiser Argonne is in dry dock undergoing repairs from the Battle of Cape Vilan. At a luncheon with President Roosevelt and the new head of the OSS, he is informed of his next mission--this time unsupported, in a race against General Rommel's panzers to save the French Fleet at Mers-el-KÉbir. Intrigue, spies, the 'Maquis', plots by both the Italians and his nemesis from Sheppard of the Argonne German Admiral SchrÖder, make a thrilling page turner that readers will find hard to put down.",
