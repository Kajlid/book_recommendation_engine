  "description": "Destiny's path is not always a clear cut trail, a discovery the tinker's daughter is about to make in this dramatic sequel to Hope Flies on Broken Wings. Armed with little more than a tattered shirt, a whisper of hope, and a protective charm, Collie flees from the seaside ghosts of Donnel that haunt her soul and dares to cross into the Tillaman Realm. There, she succumbs to a charismatic young knight named Morgan who offers her sanctuary, only to learn that a pretty smile is not always to be trusted. Her ultimate fate is precariously held within the mind of a catatonic child, and a deep winter snow has settled over the boundary mountains, blocking all roads of escape. Bound to Morgan and hopelessly entangled in a dangerous game of brutality and possession, all Collie wants now is to return home.",
