  "description": "Workaholic developer Richard Gardener is laid up at home for two week’s mandatory leave—doctor’s orders. No stress. No computers. Just fourteen days of complete rest. Bliss for most, but hell for Richard… in more ways than one.There’s a darkness that lives inside Richard’s home; a presence he never knew existed because he was seldom there alone. Did he just imagine those footsteps? The smoke alarm shrieking? The woman in his kitchen?His wife thinks he’s just suffering from work withdrawal, but as the days crawl by in his solitary confinement, the terror seeping through the walls continues to escalate—threatening his health, his marriage, and his sanity.When the inconceivable can no longer be denied, Richard is forced to come to terms with what is happening. Can he find a way to banish the darkness before he becomes an exile in his own home?“Steven Jenkins weaves such masterful shades of weirdness between the workaholic programmer’s inner psyche and the supernatural elements he encounters that the reader is equally unsure if they are real—or just products of his overworked brain. I did not want to put the book down until the mystery was solved.” — Val Muller, author, The Scarred Letter",
