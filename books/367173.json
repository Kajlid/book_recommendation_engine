  "description": "Tumtum and Nutmeg just want to live out their comfy lives in peace, unbothered by anything as distracting as an adventure. But the holidays are upon them, and it seems to be the time of year when Arthur and Lucy, the disheveled human children of Rose Cottage, and bumbling veteran hero General Marchmouse are most likely to get into trouble. Tumtum and Nutmeg want to make things right, but first they'll have to outwit a wicked mouse named Purple Claw, face a crazed circus ringmaster, and even save Christmas!In three delightful new adventures, Tumtum and Nutmeg prove that big heroes come in tiny packages.",
