  "description": "The last thing Zack Westland expects on a frigid night is to be summoned to an exorcism. Demonic possession, however, proves the least of his problems. Father Frank, a veteran turned priest, knows Zack s deepest secrets, recognizing him as Anakim, an angel belonging to that hidden tribe. And Halley, the girl they ve come to save, carries a secret that could unlock a centuries-old evil. She chants an eerie rhyme, and she isn t alone \"HANDS TO TAKE AND EYES TO SEE, A MOUTH TO SPEAK. HE COMES FOR ME.\" As Zack's secrets spill out, far more than his life is at stake, for Halley is linked to an ancient conspiracy. Yet Zack can't help her unless he's willing to risk losing his immortality and reigniting the Blood Wars.",
