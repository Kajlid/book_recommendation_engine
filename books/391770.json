  "description": "All Carson Reno Mystery Series Books are standalone novels. It is not necessary to read them in any particular order. The year is 1962 and this small west Tennessee town has been turned upside down by a labor strike at its main manufacturing plant. It seems that, as result of the strike, some very serious underworld crime problems have surfaced in Humboldt. A small town sheriff and small town Chief of Police have their hands full dealing with the strike - when the worst happens – one of the principal figures surrounding the labor problems is murdered. Carson Reno is very familiar with Humboldt – after all, he grew up and went to high school there. But Carson has a successful private investigation business in Memphis and no desire or reason to get involved. However, circumstances pull him into the turmoil and a situation that grows more dangerous everyday. By trying to not become involved, he becomes deeply involved and ultimately the prime suspect for the Murder in Humboldt.",
