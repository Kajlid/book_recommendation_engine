  "description": "Caroline O'Hara has been a published historical romance writer for over a decade, but her fan response is just not what it used to be. Her agent informs her that she'll be dropped as a client unless she finds a way to sell more books. Saddened, she begins to research erotica, the hottest reads that are gaining popularity every day. The problem? Her marriage is stale, and she's a bit of a prude. She can't write erotic fiction unless she knows how it feels to live an erotic reality, so she puts her husband to work. As she strengthens her knowledge for the sake of her writing career, she will find she's strengthening her marriage as well. This series contains mature content suitable for adults.",
