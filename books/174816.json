  "title": "STORY STORY: How I Found Ways to Make a Difference and Do Work I Love",
  "description": "Chris Guillebeau, NYT bestselling author: \"These unconventional stories from globetrotter Kola are fun and inspiring.\" One day, I had an idea. What if my entire life was centered on making a difference and doing work I love? So rather than engage in occasional or random acts of kindness, my life was a life of service. And rather than drudge through eight hours of work every day, I could earn my living from doing work that I actually enjoyed. This single idea sent me on a journey that has spanned 5 years, 12 countries, 86 YouTube videos, and countless boxes of Chinese food. STORY STORY is a funny, lighthearted, yet provocative book about finding passion, taking risks, having faith, and all the unexpected lessons learned along the way. STORY STORY is not a “how-to” guide. It is an example, a companion, a friend even, for any young adult that has ever dreamed of making a difference in the world or doing work that is personally exciting and meaningful.",
