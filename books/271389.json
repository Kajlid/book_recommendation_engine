  "description": "ABOUT THIS EPISODE  When a 911 call goes wrong and a young man goes missing, it falls to Malcolm and Seong-Jae to investigate the responding officers when Internal Affairs' internal politics leave the case compromised and the officers aren't willing to talk. But with Seong-Jae on the wrong side of the thin blue line, tensions just may turn violent before the detectives find their answers--and only their trust in each other will keep this investigation from hitting a dead end. Will Malcolm and Seong-Jae's savage love survive the test, or will this case end in self-destruction?  With Sade mysteriously vanished once more, taking one of their major assets out of commission, it's anyone's game. Especially when their missing young man becomes a dead young man...and no one will admit who's truly responsible for his violent demise.",
