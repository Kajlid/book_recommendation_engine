  "description": "My life has spun out of control.It wasn’t just a knock on my door that altered it forever. No, it all started with him. Nic.One innocent glance across a crowded bar set off a series of events that neither of us could control. Words like forever and for always became promises. It was intense, blinding even.And then, he disappeared.I tried to start over. I moved across the country for a new job, but some things are unavoidable. At least, that's what I told myself when the man I thought I'd left behind suddenly reappears.Every twist, turn, and trauma that follows forces me to question everything I thought was true. About him. About us.But it’s too late to walk away. Because Nic isn't the only one with something to hide—I've been keeping a secret, too.  Author’s Note: SAVAGE is the first book in a trilogy. It should not be read as a stand alone.",
