  "description": "Now available at Smashwords.Dovizel lives in a city built on the back of a sleeping dragon, a city full of wonders. Strange beasts stalk its markets; magic is everywhere, miracles are commonplace. As is peril. The buried dragon is about to wake. It is so immense that if it rises and spreads its wings, it will tumble her city down.The knight chosen to face the monster—Lord Wyrdrake of the Library--will win Dovizel as his reward. She has no say in this. She was born for it. To love Wyrdrake is her destiny, and though she fights her own longing, she can’t deceive herself: his kisses make her go up in fire.The more she wants him, the more she wants to dig her heels in. She’ll never say yes to fate.A dark magician lusts for Dovizel too. Once her father’s apprentice, he has strayed into wicked ways, and now strange hungers consume him. Because she’s been held up as a prize for Wyrdrake, he wants her too. He’ll see the city shaken apart if it means he can devour her among the ruins. No matter which way she turns, it seems her fate is to be conquered, to yield.It makes her furious. Hers is a city of odd, wild magics; well, she can learn magic too. There has to be another way. Let the dragon wake!*",
