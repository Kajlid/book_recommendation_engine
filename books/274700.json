  "description": "Dani had her entire life planned out by the time she was thirteen. She was going to marry the boy who stole her heart – her brother’s best friend – have a great life, and live happily ever after. Then tragedy struck and Dani had to bury those childhood dreams in a pine box along with the love of her young life. The memory of what she lost haunted her until she disappeared into the night, leaving behind everyone, and everything she’d ever known.  Years later, she returns home to find everything has changed. When she meets Kyler, there is something about him that gets past the walls around her heart. Will she let fear control her, or will she let go of the past and learn to love again?",
