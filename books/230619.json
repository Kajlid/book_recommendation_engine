She's a city girl who won't stay longer than it takes to get her fancy foreign car repaired--which is why he should ignore his powerful need to make her notice him.

But when he gives her a private tour of his craft whiskey distillery, their attraction ignites and Luke seizes the chance to show her there's a whole lot more to him than rough and rugged.When he finally learns her secret, will it shatter his trust in her? Or do they have a chance to create a whole new blend?A sizzling, enemies-to-lovers romp with bite.",
