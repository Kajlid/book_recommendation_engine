  "title": "THE ROCK STAR'S SECRET WIFE",
  "description": "Kate married rock musician Jay when she was only 18, but separated from him when she became pregnant. She didn't want her son, Mark, to have a part-time Dad with a Rock 'n Roll lifestyle. Sharing the child care with her mother, Kate trains as a landscape gardener. Eight years later, Jay - who doesn't know of Mark's existence - contacts her out of the blue, asking her to create an English garden for his Italian 'castle' on Lake Garda. Telling herself she can't afford to turn this lucrative job down, Kate agrees. But she has no idea what a devastating impact this decision will have on her life - and Mark's.",
