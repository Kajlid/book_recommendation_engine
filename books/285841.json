  "description": "Newly retired from the Boston Police Department, Ronan O’Mara is looking forward to spending time with his husband, Tennyson, and his daughter. It turns out walking away from his job is harder than he thought. When Ronan is offered the chance to work some cases at West Side Magick, he jumps at the chance.  Psychic Tennyson Grimm is used to all kinds of reactions from clients after psychic readings, but he isn’t prepared when a grieving father kisses him. What makes matters worse is that Ronan saw it happen.  When Tennyson’s client is found dead with Ronan hovering over him, it raises big questions. Did Ronan murder the client to get even, or is there a killer out there?",
