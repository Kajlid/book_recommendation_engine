  "description": "A broken heart and a lost mind will have to fight against past and present to defend their love in an underworld filled with dangers. With them, a girl used to running away and a boy tormented by his past meet in a world filled with gods, where humans have been banished. Young Dairine and her friends, the siblings Darnelle, Logan and Ty Mallister, desperately try to end the curse that the evil goddess Shaina unleashed upon them. Determined to free themselves from torture once and for all, they penetrate the planet in search of their enemy. They use the scientific William Asghor’s book as a guide. In it, he describes a horrific journey to the innermost parts of his world. But, once inside, they find themselves bewildered. Everything they had read about this world ruled by gods doesn’t match the reality. They are in unknown whereabouts, among creatures as dangerous and cruel as Shania herself. Will love be enough to face these dangers?",
