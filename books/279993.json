To further complicate things, she discovers a human skull in a bog disturbingly close to home. Later attacked in those same woods by a young man, Avery makes a break for it and narrowly escapes alive. Is she right for thinking the attack is somehow connected to the mean girls at school, or has she uncovered a long-buried secret?A mystery to be solved…As Jan sifts through Avery's life of threatening texts, emails and mysterious attacks, suffering the sting alone thanks to a frequently absent husband, she reveals a chilling connection. With no one left to turn to, she finds herself unlikely allies in the mysterious strangers who live at the edge of the neighborhood. But something is off about them. They always seem to know more than they should. Can Jan and Avery trust the warm and welcoming pair, or is their family's world about to be shattered?",
