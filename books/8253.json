  "description": "Heaven dreamed of the day he would meet his mate and settle down. He had no idea that the bad luck he experienced his whole life was about to give its grand performance. How has the fairy tale romance he dreamed of turned from blissful wishing into the hell he would soon find himself in? Murdock has always been the playboy of the estate. With an endless supply of willing males, who needs a mate? Then Heaven walks into the bathroom at the club and sees something Murdock wishes he hadn't. Now Murdock has two weeks to convince his mate that he didn't know Heaven existed and win his love or Maverick will execute him. Talk about pressure. Heaven struggles to get past the images burned into his memory and find forgiveness in his heart before he loses his mate forever. The only wrench in that plan is the humans who have discovered their existence and are now out for blood. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
