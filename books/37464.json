  "title": "Let's Get Lade",
  "description": "It's New York, February 6, 1964. The Beatles are making their first American appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in one more day. The Plaza hotel is crazy with the preparations. Desk clerk Alex Fraser has secretly let his brother Freddie use the penthouse suite for the evening so he can wine and dine the girl of his dreams. There’s just one small problem—the secret service are using the same room to hide spy novelist Henry Lade. Lade's most recent novel has attracted the attention of the Soviets and East Germans who believe Lade may have secretly discovered their plot to bomb Fresno, California. They’ve dispatched assassins to kidnap or kill Lade, which ever is easiest. Worse, just like Alex and Freddie, Henry Lade and Secret Service Agent John Parker don't know that the penthouse suite is already a bit crowded—with John, Paul, George and Ringo. ~ Come Tomorrow, everyone will be wishing for yesterday!",
