  "description": "Isabel has had some very unusual experiences when it comes to men. In fact, they typically tend to steer completely clear of her. One lousy tornado and a few storms and she is dubbed ‘lighting girl’ by all. However, on the eve of her 22nd birthday things change literally, overnight.  When Isabel wakes up in a dream with a man not fit for human consumption she can’t believe it. And upon waking things go even more haywire. Never could she have imagined the world that she sees once the ‘blinders’ are off. Abandoned by the very person who sent these gifts to her to see the world for what it is, she is naturally skeptical of it all.  Her men problems before were laughable. Enter two of the most gorgeous creatures she had ever laid eyes upon. Add a curse and a requirement to pick one in the next 9 days. Make that nights, since she can only reach them in her dreams.  Oh, and it just so happens if she picks the wrong one then the veil between all the magical realms could be destroyed and create ultimate chaos and death. Both men want to seduce her and make her his, but only one will lead to restoring the realms, and her heart.  So heavy the burden, so great the stakes. Will she even survive the war that has already begun to rage between the worlds before her choice is made? There are the waking hours too, that are contending for her fate. And very little help is on her side....",
