  "description": "People say it's easy for members of a monastic order to have full spiritual life because their environment allows for peaceful meditation. But is the peace from contemplation beyond the reach of the person in the world struggling with noise of today's life? A new book of practical spirituality, A Place Apart shows how the peace and serenity of an abbey can be achieved despite the noise and busyness of today's world. A leading American spiritual writer and Trappist monk, Father Basil Pennington shows how, step by step, the spirituality of monasticism can be converted for use in daily life.",
