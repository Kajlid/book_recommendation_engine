  "title": "102 English Things to Do",
  "description": "Packed with suggestions that will spur even the most lethargic reader to leap from their favourite armchair and express their Englishness (perhaps by buying a gnome, needlessly apologising, or going to a beer festival - or all three), 102 English Things To Do is a delightful, insightful and mostly affectionate portrait of the English national character. This beautifully illustrated and charming book (to boast in a very un-English manner) deserves a place in every English home - and will entertain and enlighten the mystified outsider in search of a key to that most elusive of qualities: Englishness.",
