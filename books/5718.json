  "description": "Detective Chief Inspector Frank Castle never caught the Woodlands Killer and it almost destroyed him. Now, years later, mauled by the press and traumatized by nightmares, he is faced with a copycat killer with detailed inside knowledge of the original case. He and his partner Jacki Stone enter a deadly labyrinth, and at its center is the man Castle believes was responsible for the first killings. He's running a sinister cult and playing dark mind games with the police. The investigation has a shattering effect on Castle and Stone. Dark coded ritualistic killings are being carried out on high-profile figures and the body count is rising. Castle employs a brilliant psychologist to help him solve the case, but some psychopaths are cleverer than others. The book has a unique twist, timed to perfection by the author. A dark, layered narrative with detailed psychological profiling, Apostle Rising is an extremely powerful noir crime story with a chilling dimension of horror.",
