  "description": "\"In the sequel to Shinju, Rowland's highly acclaimed first novel, samurai detective Sana Ichiro is at it again as he tracks a serial killer.\" The year: 1689. The place: Edo, Japan's feudal capital. An all-powerful shogun controls the state, surrounded by bitter machinations and political intrigues. A young samurai and ex-policeman, Sano tries valiantly to follow \"Bushido-\" the way of the warrior-in a society whose ancient, noble ways have been all but forgotten. Suddenly, a \"bundori\" appears-a severed head, nailed to a plank, offered for public display. Another \"bundori\" appears, and then another Detective Sano must risk everything he's learned as samurai to bring the killer to justice.",
