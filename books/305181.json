  "title": "The Cellist of Sarajevo",
  "description": "Sarajevo: a city under siege. As the mortars falls and snipers conduct their deadly business, a cellist sits at his window, playing Albinoni's adagio. When a bomb kills twenty-two people waiting in line to buy bread on the street below, he vows to carry his cello into the cratered street at four each afternoon for the next twenty-two days and play the same adagio in memory of the dead. Unknown to the cellist, a young woman watches his performances more avidly than anyone else. For she is the counter-sniper chosen to protect him from the enemy she knows lurks nearby with gun poised and ready to shoot. Can she keep the cellist alive? And what will it cost her to do so?",
