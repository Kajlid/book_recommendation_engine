  "description": "I was her therapist. She was my lifeline.You think having a one night stand with a woman in a bar would be simple, right?She was everything I wanted.This little dark-haired beauty who let me do exactly as I pleased.And gave as good as she got.Everything about that one night was perfect.Until she walked into my office with her twin sister.I tried to stay away and deny what was between us.She was too young. Too innocent. Too sweet.And worst of all, my client.She got under my skin, making it impossible to forget her.Iâ€™ve had a taste of the forbidden.And once was never going to be enough.Fiona Benson made me throw caution to the wind.I watched the flames crash and burn.A patient/therapist forbidden romance with dark story elements.Author Note: I highly recommend you read both the Corrupt Empire series and the first two books in the Benson Siblings series before diving into this book, but Prohibit can be read as a standalone.",
