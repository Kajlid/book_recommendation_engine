  "description": "I wish this was our happily ever after. But it’s not.My mates and I got what we wanted—we found Rhys’s sister. We should be celebrating, but the danger is far from over.Our welcome into the Lost Pack was frosty at best, and tensions between old and new blood threaten to boil over. Crammed too close together, trapped by our fear, we’re hardly better off here than we were at Strand.If my men and I can’t unite the two packs, they’ll tear each other apart before Doctor Shepherd and his hunters even have a chance to find us again.I won’t let that happen.My wolf has claimed each of these four men. And the deeper I fall in love with them, the more determined I am to create a real future for us.But to do that, I’m going to have to fully accept the truth of who I am… and what I am. Wolf Claimed is the third book in The Last Shifter series, a reverse harem story intended for ages 18+. This book contains strong language, violence, sexual situations, and a fierce heroine who doesn't have to choose between her men.",
