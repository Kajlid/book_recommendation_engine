  "description": "It has rested hidden and reviled since the Twilight, when the light of the world was very nearly snuffed out by it. Guarded by a zealous warrior knighthood of continental renown, the omnipotent evil of the Coda Uma is about to be stolen by two famed thieves.Meet Prince Sefalin, who isn't human, can't control his powers and never wanted to be king much less Emperor. And Azaroth, the moody wizard who becomes hopelessly trapped in his own random metamorphosing. When they themselves are robbed by someone bent on a different kind of revenge, all hell breaks loose.Literally.Weary, hunted, separated, they navigate horrific wars, hideous monstrosities and a catastrophic plague. Can these same thieves steal again what they want to be rid of while evading their enemies (everyone), and if they can, where can they hide what wants to be found and cannot be concealed?An account of love that endures, friendship that transcends and an apocalypse that will reveal the greatest casualty of all.",
