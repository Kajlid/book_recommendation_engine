  "title": "A History of Polish Christianity",
  "description": "This is the only single-volume history of Christianity in Poland, a subject at the core of religious history and European secular history alike. The book covers the development of Polish Christianity from the tenth century to the present, placing it in the broader context of East-Central European political, social, religious and cultural history. A History of Polish Christianity should be read by anyone interested in the confrontation between Christianity and the totalitarian systems of the twentieth century, and in the interplay between Eastern and Western Christianity.",
