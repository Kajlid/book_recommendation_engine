  "description": "This is a story about magic, cohabitation, loneliness, girls who love girls, investigating the arcane and survival in a supernatural world hidden from the eyes of modern civilization.  Karin Ashley lives a lonely life that feels hollow, with a job she hates and a family she loves but can't quite figure out. Called in late one night to respond to an electronic break-in at a branch office of the Records & Licensing Agency, she is introduced in the most terrifying way to a hidden world of legends, supernatural beings and plenty of corruption, both literal and metaphorical.  Behind corporate and political veils, evil spirits are summoned and bargained with for power. Fantastic powers and reality-bending magic lurks beneath the successes and conquests of modern corporate dynasties, descended from ancient arcane Houses that have influenced human history for centuries. Karin is thrust headlong into a world suddenly gone mad, but she won't have to fight alone. Mystically bound to an ancient spirit within the sword through a capricious twist of fate, will the new bonds they forge together prove to be the strongest yet?",
