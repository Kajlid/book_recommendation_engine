  "description": "Sergeant Ryan Pettit has a secret life blogging as Groundpounder, dutifully recording online a deployment where every day feels exactly the same—until a female reporter shows up at their all male camp. Then Ryan realizes nothing is ever going to be the same for him again. Ambitious Journalist Vicki Vanover is not above using her feminine wiles or a bit of blackmail to get a fabulous interview. When she decides to travel to a small base in Afghanistan, the last thing she anticipates is meeting Ryan, a soldier who runs towards danger rather than away from it and puts her in danger of losing her heart. In this high action sequel to Model Soldier, Cat Johnson continues the story of one squad’s time in the turbulent border provinces of Afghanistan. With the return appearance of Task Force Zeta, as well as the unexpected appearance of a beloved public figure, A Prince Among Men is another hot and sexy page-turner you won’t be able to put down.",
