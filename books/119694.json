  "title": "Time Capsule - Sheriff Warren Price RIP",
  "description": "An experimental project conducted by the United States Navy went in another direction when one of its capsules was transported back into time. The Navy's project was an experiment in the use of quickly transportable units that could be used to defend locations coming under attack such as embassies, temporary military bases and airstrips around the world. These capsules were made to create an electrical force with the idea of confusing the trajectory of incoming radio controlled missiles. Each capsule was set up for a crew of three, who would be able to monitor incoming missiles and adjust the strength and frequency of the electrical field. Seeing the potential of having a time capsule which could be used to change the outcome of traumatic events in our past such as Pearl Harbor or Nine-Eleven, the experiment was reclassified and placed under the command of a highly sensitive and secretive investigative unit at the Pentagon which pursued the development of unorthodox weapons. One of the unexplained characteristics of this capsule was it only went to one location and one time period, a closed mine shaft in New Mexico a few years after the Civil War. While scientist tried to determine the reason why only one of the many capsules produced traveled to the past; the Pentagon continued with a program of collecting data, putting together a manual on time travel and training someone to make the journey back to that time period and live among the inhabitants. What was to be an unobtrusive journey to the past for training purposes changed when Sheriff Warren Price was killed, effecting people from the Nineteen and Twenty-first Centuries.",
