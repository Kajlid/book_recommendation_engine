  "description": "Resonance of Ancient Myth or as it is more commonly called Roam, is the most popular multiplayer online role-playing game in the world. It is a game that brings the heroes and gods of the ancient world to life. Sage Monroe is a quiet, anti-social, gamer girl. She spends more time online in the world of Roam than she did in the real world. She even met her boyfriend Morgan in Roam. She is a simple and practical girl. She likes Roam, she likes her cat, she likes her online boyfriend--until he came to visit. It was the first time they had met in the real world. Then she learned Roam wasn't all it seemed and neither was her boyfriend, or even her cat. And then she died. She was surprised to learn that some people don't go to heaven or hell, they go to Mmorpgs. Now the fate of her friends, boyfriend, and even her cat are all depending on her.",
