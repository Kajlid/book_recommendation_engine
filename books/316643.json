  "description": "Jamie: Three years ago, I sold my soul to the devil.Also known as my boss. Same thing. Here’s the deal. Connor Quinn is arrogant, impossible to please, cold as ice, and prone to find flaws in everything.Since that fatal day three years ago, many a murder plan have been made and many a weapon considered. Until…I accidentally get to know him better, which is unfortunate, since it turns out that underneath Connor’s icy exterior, there’s a man shaped by past hurts and difficult life lessons.Which means I’m in a bit of a pickle since it also turns out I might kind of like the bastard…Connor: For as long as I can remember, I’ve chased calm. I’m the exact opposite of an adrenaline junkie with my pursuit of peace and quiet. My rules are simple. I don’t make terrible decisions. I don’t make mistakes. And I don’t do chaos.Until Jamie.He’s an anomaly. A glitch in the system. Unpredictable. Distracting. Confusing.But now I’ve accidentally gotten to know him better, and it turns out he’s also warm. And funny. And interesting. And with him, the world gets just a tiny bit quieter. And I fit just a tiny bit better.",
