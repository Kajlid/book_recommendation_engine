Especially after Leo is beaten within an inch of his life. Fortuitously, however, the attack leaves him with a lasting clue about the case that the attackers carved into his chest. Now, this new lead brings Leo into the woods just north of Seattle to infiltrate the dark heart of an impressionable young boy’s sudden, violent turn—a white-power retreat that’s amassing an army for a far-reaching endgame.What they have planned isn’t only putting Leo’s life at risk. Thousands of lives are going to be at stake. And the deeper Leo gets, the more he fears that he’s totally underpowered to save them.",
