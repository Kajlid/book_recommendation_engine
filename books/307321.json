  "description": "Is there more to the spoiled, entitled, British billionaire man-whore than what I see on the surface? I really want to hate Dylan Lancaster. He hurt my best friend, and nearly destroyed her relationship with his identical twin brother. So, I decide that someone needs to rein him in so he doesn't try to demolish the couple completely before their wedding takes place. Unfortunately, the only woman who would try to take on that impossible task is...me. It's only six weeks, right? Surely I can tolerate the womanizing, obnoxious jerk and keep him out of trouble so that no more of his scandals hit the media before his brotherâ€™s wedding. I'm a public relations crisis manager. Squashing bad press is what I do, and I do it extremely well for my high profile clients. What I don't count on is actually starting to like the glimpses of the real Dylan I begin to see underneath all of his cynicism. Nor did I ever imagine that I'd become so attracted to him that I could barely breathe every time he gets close to me. Dylan is a man who has suffered profound emotional pain. I can sense it. I can feel it. The question is: Can I possibly reach the real Dylan Lancaster before it's too late? Note: This is an enemies to friends to lovers British billionaire romance with an American heroine. I'd recommend reading Damian's story first in Tell Me You're Mine, Book 1 of The British Billionaires to enhance your reading pleasure.",
