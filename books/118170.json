  "description": "One of the all-time greats of seafaring supernatural fiction - The Ghost PiratesThere were rumours that the Mortzestus was haunted. But when she had sailed out two weeks out of 'Frisco before a fair wind, the crew dismissed them. Until, unaccountably, the rigging went slack. A ghostly form was seen to climb up from the sea. A great weight crashed down from the mast. The shadows thickened and an unnatural mist descended around the ship, leaving her helpless. Then a legendary ship bore down on the Mortzestus and it looked like the fate of the crew was sealed - to disappear on a calm sea... without a trace.We know nothing like the author's work in the whole of present day literature. - Bookman",
