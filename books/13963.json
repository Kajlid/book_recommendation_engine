Armed with just his Elitario training and signature tools of the killing trade, he must confront the forces of darkness in order to survive.Lost upon the flat tundra of a frozen wilderness, he traverses the barren plateau to a small ghost-like-town named “Boondocks.” There, the hitman avails a saloon for shelter and knowledge of how he might return to the living-world. However, the price of earning that knowledge along with its salvation might just condemn his soul for all eternity.",
