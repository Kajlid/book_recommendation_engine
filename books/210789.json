  "description": "Episodes 14-26 offer a lot of fascinating twists to retwist. Frank Underwire has been banished to a hog lot. Frank starts his own religion. Frank strategizes to get some \"WOW\" in his life. Smoky Buns is out of Frank's life. Of course, episode 18 is the famous \"Curd Hurled 'Round the World\" episode. In episode 19, look for \"Animal Planet\" to tweak some of the character names and habits so \"Curds\" can run on their channel. And, naturally, what would the second season be like without a visit to Earth by E.T.? He's reporting on Frank and others. Episode 25 is the \"Just Shy of Treason\" offering. And Episode 26 is essential to read if you want to decipher all the complex symbols in \"Curds.\"",
