  "title": "Loose Gravel",
  "description": "The grimy road story of Spooge - a punk band who gets to know each other way more than they want to, cooped up in a crap-beaten van on their first tour. This, like any typical band relationship, resembles a one-night-stand; everybody's in it for the fun, there's an unspoken hope of it becoming something more, it's usually bitterly disappointing, and no one knows each other's last names.A peculiar odyssey of archetypical music scene types, lies and discovery, a thieving runaway, a coming-out story, and flaming chest hair... all underscored by a bizarre curse.",
