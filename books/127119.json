Broken and vulnerable yet talented, she falls for journalist Peter Safford at her first showing. He takes her with him on a visit to Sierra Leone, where Elizabeth finds an affinity for the people, and the land gets into her blood. As she focuses on these people who seem so happy, content and good to one another even after the recent, devastating Civil War, she begins to realize she has the power within to make of herself something more than she imagined.
