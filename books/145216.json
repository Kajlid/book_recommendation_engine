  "title": "Total Commitment to Christ: What Is It?",
  "description": "This booklet deals with what it means to be \"crucified with Christ\" in terms of Christian commitment. Are you attached to Christ exclusively, irrevocably, with no turning back? Are you attached to Christ at all? Or do you only follow him for his benefits? A. W. Tozer (1897-1963) is among the deepest Christian devotional writers of the twentieth century, and one of the most popular. Tozer was an American Christian pastor, preacher, author, magazine editor, Bible conference speaker, and spiritual mentor. For his work, he received two honorary doctorate degrees. Among the more than 40 books compiled from his work, at least two are regarded as Christian The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy. His books impress on the reader the possibility and necessity for a deeper relationship with God. Living a simple and non-materialistic lifestyle, he and his wife, Ada Cecelia Pfautz, never owned a car, preferring bus and train travel. Even after becoming a well-known Christian author, Tozer signed away much of his royalties to those who were in need. Tozer had seven children, six boys and one girl. He was buried in Ellet Cemetery, Akron, Ohio, with a simple epitaph marking his \"A. W. Tozer - A Man of God.\" Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life. He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them.",
