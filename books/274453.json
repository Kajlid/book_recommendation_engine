  "description": "This book, giving insight into the struggle of independence from a new point of view, looks at the role of Amar Shahid Chandrashekhar Azad in the fight for independence. We have already seen the first novel 'HumKhwab' by sensitive writer Aman Verma. There is now his second novel, 'Ishq-e-Shahadat', which is based entirely on historical background. Today, patriotism of Chandrashekhar Azad and his martyrdom need to be reorganized in the delicate time of nationalism fever. This need was felt by the author, which resulted in this novel.",
