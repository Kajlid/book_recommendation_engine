  "description": "Tracy Johnston is having a really bad reaction to her own life, and she has the hives to prove it. Turning 30 set the alarm bells ringing... She's just not traditional like her mother, and she'll never be perfect like her sister. And the one thing she hoped would set her apart - her brave move to Hollywood - has turned out to be a monumental flop. Despite the handful of English classes she'd taken at her local mid-western community college, churning out awe-inspiring screenplays isn't quite as doable as she'd predicted. So, she's stuck with a crummy job, a wobbly mattress, and a career that refuses to show up. Her prospects for fulfillment are looking dim - until, that is, a car crash delivers her a strange new possibility. And a sexy one at that. STORY GIRL is a comical look at a young woman's attempt to be 'somebody' and find love in the ensuing confusion.",
