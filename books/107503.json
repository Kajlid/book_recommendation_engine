His own tragedy waited until he had everything to lose - in one night,a reckless driver shatters Ezra's knee, his athletic career and his perfect life. No longer part of the popular crowd, Ezra finds himself at the table of misfits, where he meets Cassidy Thorpe. Intelligent, effortless and wonderfully weird, she is unlike anyone Ezra's ever known before. Together they discover flash mobs, buried treasure, secret movie screenings and a poodle with a questionable history. But as Ezra dives into new friendships and new love, he is forced to ask: if you survive disaster the first time round, what happens when it strikes again? \"Maybe it's time to expand your list of literary crushes toinclude someone other than Augustus Waters.\" - MTV.com\"I couldn't help but think of John Green's novels - I think his fans will eat this up.\" - Publishers Weekly[Official Book Cover blurb and reviews]",
