  "description": "*Available in printed format upon requestPresented as free form epigrams. You will not find entertaining poetry over flowing with sunsets, miracles of nature presented as works of art suitable for hanging on a gallery wall, just a jarring collision of words offering no rewards or satisfaction.Earth is the printerGravity is the softwareSediment is the inkSometimes the printoutsHave a life of their ownEcocriticism presented as a series of observations composed of sentence fragments to illustrate the fact that no one really understands how the world works. You control where your thoughts take you in a world where complex life is embedded in a microbial whirlwind loaded with genetic dander. Only in the mind do we have a majority share holder position, in our bodies we have a minority share holder position. Various inventions made to make life simpler actually keep shifting the identity of the final winner, much the same as a game of musical chairs.",
