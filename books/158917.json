  "description": "Menaker State Hospital is a curse, a refuge, a prison, a necessity, a nightmare, a salvation.When Dr. Lise Shields arrived at the correctional psychiatric facility five years ago, she was warned that many of its patients-committed by Marylandâ€™s judicial system for perpetrating heinous crimes-would never leave.But what happens when a place like Menaker is corrupted, when it becomes a tool to silence the innocent, conceal an injustice, contain a secret? Why is it that the newest patient does not seem to belong there, that the hospital administrator has fallen silent, and that Lise is being watched by two men with seemingly lethal intent? The answers are closer than she realizes and could cost her everything she holds dear.",
