  "description": "Part 2 of the 4-part Mastered by His Touch series  Kiri is having the strangest week of her life.  First, she was mesmerized by billionaire Caden Storm who walked into the bank where she worked and swept her off her feet with his chiseled looks, muscular body, and I-am-a-man-to-be-worshipped vibe.  Then, he left her a perplexing gift that placed her at the center of an FBI investigation. Seeking answers, she has so far discovered only cryptic clues that seem to have triggered some odd disturbing visions about being on a sinking boat... or are they memories?  A bewildered and frustrated Kiri, now in possession of his real name and address, marches into Caden Storm's world in the penthouse suite of a luxury tower.  What she finds there tantalizes her body and soul in a superheated session of flesh-melting deviant joy... in the strong hands of a man who knows what she truly needs.  But soon, mysterious clues begin to appear. Is Caden really who he says he is? And is he somehow connected to the jolting visions of a past traumatic event that haunt Kiri?
