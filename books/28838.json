  "description": "Winner! 2012 American Alpine Club Literary Prize (USA)Winner! 2011 Munday Award, Banff Mountain Festival (CANADA)Winner! 2011 Boardman Tasker Prize, Kendal Mountain Festival (UNITED KINGDOM)Freedom Climbers — the most honoured book of mountaineering literature published in Canada — tells the story of a group of extraordinary Polish adventurers who emerged from under the blanket of oppression following the Second World War to become the world's leading Himalayan climbers. Although they lived in a dreary, war-ravaged landscape, with seemingly no hope of creating a meaningful life, these curious, motivated and skilled mountaineers created their own free-market economy under the very noses of their Communist bosses and climbed their way to liberation. At a time when Polish citizens were locked behind the Iron Curtain, these intrepid explorers found a way to travel the world in search of extreme adventure—to Alaska, South America and Europe, but mostly to the highest and most inspiring mountains of the world. To this end, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Nepal became their second homes as they evolved into the toughest group of Himalayan climbers the world has ever known.",
