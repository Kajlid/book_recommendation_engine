  "title": "Our Lives in the Light",
  "description": "This is a book about life! Much like trying to capture a moment on camera, this book is an attempt to capture a moving, shifting, realistic life, with all the vibrant, active people associated with it. It has been a fun adventure to write, and I hope it will be a “frolic through the wilderness” to read. It is a book that documents my life, through the eyes of a mzungu child growing up in Zambia. With the completion of each universal theme in my book, I take the time to bounce my memories off my sister, Dawn, as we philosophize and try to make sense of the world around us. In my attempt to make sense of my life, my hope is that the few readers who take the time to read my book, will get to the end of it, with a renewed sense of faith, hope and love…and that they will come to remember that the greatest of these will always be love.",
