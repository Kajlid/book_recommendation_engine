  "description": "After more than thirty years, the characters from Mart Crowley's 1968 breakthrough drama, The Boys in the Band retook the stage in The Men from The Boys . The famous circle of gay friends (minus one) assemble again in Michael's New York penthouse, this time for a memorial. Keenly observant, unabashedly bitchy, hilarious, and honest as it's predecessor, the sequel and the original, as presented in this volume, provide a then and now look at gay lives from Stonewall to today. Mart Crowley is the author of five plays, including Boys in the Band which was made into the 1970 film of the same name. He is also the author of several screenplays for television and was the producer of the TV series Hart to Hart .",
