  "description": "A cell phone trader is killed on a steamy Friday night in Mumbai.A beautiful tennis star is brutally attacked and tortured in Cape Town.And someone is out to kill Winter with a deadly Sikh cultural weapon.Sent to India to find an Al Qaeda terrorist, Winter looked forward to an easy payday, short skirts at the tennis, and international cricket. Introducing Nick Winter, former MI6 consultant in Iraq, tracker and finder of terrorists for the highest bidder. A keen scholar in Eastern history, religion and politics, he is scarred by racial prejudice due to his mixed British/Indian parentage.Nick doesn’t like taking orders;… doesn’t like confined spaces;… and definitely doesn’t like being taken for a fool.Was it Al Qaeda, or did Nick’s own employer sell him out? Already torn apart by sectarian violence, India is threatened with another wave of terrorist strikes since that fateful day in November 2008 when the Taj Hotel billowed with fire and smoke. Both the British Secret Intelligence Service, and Indian Intelligence lay claim to a Secure Data card he ostensibly took from the slain cell phone trader. What’s on the card, and why are they prepared to kill for it? With Britain and Europe plagued with austerity measures and India rocked by corruption scandals, everyone has something to lose. Forced to kill again and again, can Nick stop the terrorists striking at the heart of Mumbai’s financial district. Failure is unthinkable, or will the great holy Ganges River run red with blood again.A beautiful tennis star, a rogue intelligence agent and a terrorist mastermind all form part of an explosive cocktail from Cape Town to Mumbai to the bad-lands of Pakistan.",
