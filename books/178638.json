Note to This book contains detailed descriptions of sizzling passion only suitable for mature readers. From Battle Born is a spinoff of my Shadow Assassins series. However, it’s not necessary to have read the earlier books to enjoy these new stories. All of my books are cross-genre romances. They blend elements of science-fiction, fantasy, and paranormal romance. The Battle Born books will lean a bit more toward sci-fi, but there will still be plenty of steamy romance. Enjoy!",
