  "description": "Phoenix Nest: Guardians of the FutureShelana is a genius with a lot to learn. A descendant of genetically enhanced humans known as Preservationists, Shelana roams a landscape devoid of civilization in a world that long ago managed to advance itself right back to the Stone Age. Presers have only one lifetask: to pass on to their children the knowledge stored in their enhanced memories so that eventually, when mankind is ready to use it wisely, civilization may be restored. The tragedy that leaves Shelana on her own too soon also sets her on a second path that threatens to end her life before her lifetask is complete. To make matters worse, she faces a constant battle against the powerful, bloodthirsty Myths. Their leader, Vernon, wants to eradicate Preservationists so he alone can control the redevelopment of civilization. Vernon has made one mistake that may ruin his plans, a mistake the Myth leader doesn't even remember. But Shelana does.Winner of the Authorlink 2001 International New Author Awards Competition, Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror category.A sample of the sequel to Memory's Child, Phoenix Rising: The Battle Begins, is INCLUDED in Memory's Child if you buy the Kindle edition after June 4, 2013.
