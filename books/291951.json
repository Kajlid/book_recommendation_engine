  "title": "WHOLE: A Leg Up On Life",
  "description": "Imagine having to make the choice to cut off your daughter’s foot. That is the decision Kendra Herber’s parents were faced with when she was born with a malformed foot. After years of indecision, the family agreed that amputation was the best option when they received what was thought to be divine intervention. A Leg Up On Life provides a window into the struggles that life-long amputees often endure. Kendra’s bountiful accomplishments are paired perfectly against the physical and emotional turmoil that she had to combat. The vulnerability and honesty of Kendra’s story can be felt in every page. She extinguishes common stereotypes and challenges readers to start seeing beyond outward appearances. This inspirational memoir poignantly speaks of the inner strength, beauty, and courage that people with any type of limitation can possess.",
