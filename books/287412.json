  "title": "The Legend of the Avatars: The Created World",
  "description": "We have proven inadequate and stand uncomprehending under the endless sky, spying distant, dark universes that we might one day be able to reach.But for now even our own world remains a mystery to us, and we can only speculate about the origins of our existence.Perhaps the birth of our world was similar to that of the Created World, and the past and future fate of the two will be alike. Who knows?The epic fantasy trilogy is all about creation and the formation of life. The Avatars (as God-endowed beings), playing the Creators, created a world far away in the universe. Avatars brought to life two Ancient Races, magicians and demons. Lord of the Avatars, he empowered the Magi with the Awakening Forces and the Demons with the Dark Forces. The Creators have always been watching the creatures of The Created World. Using fantasy elements, you couldn't miss the story: wizards, demons, warriors, spells, and finally romance.The author recommended the epic fantasy book to teenagers, young adults, and the older audience also. He recommended it to anyone curious, have a good imagination and for the audience who is open about a possible variation in how life develops.The prediction of the epic fantasy trilogy:\"When a New World emerges,Cast more than once into perdition by Evil,The Avatars will give new life to the earth,So that a better world may be created,And Darkness shall not prevail forever.\"",
