  "description": "My Hometown Named Love is a collection of twenty short stories about love for women seen from the men's point of view. These universal stories could happen anywhere, but the reader can find their way in Ireland, UK, Finland, Italy, France, United States or on a road trip across Europe. The warmly melancholic stories come alive as we have all yearned for love we were hoping for, or had to let go.",
