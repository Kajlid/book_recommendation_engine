  "description": "Larry Doyle, the author of I Love You, Beth Cooper , returns with Go, Mutants! , a hilariously outrageous novel of teenage angst and restlessness, populated with heroes and villains straight out of the classic sci-fi and teen movies of the ‘50s and ‘60s. Soon to be a major motion picture from Universal Studios, Larry Doyle’s Go, Mutants! is the funniest, most original bit of genre-bending since Pride, Prejudice and  Zombies . This story of alien high school rebels without a cause is sure to bring out the unabashed B-movie fan in everyone.",
