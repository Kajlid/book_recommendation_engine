  "title": "The Way I Am",
  "description": "For the first time, one of music's most popular and headline-making rap artists shares his private reflections, drawings, handwritten lyrics, and never-before-seen photographs. Fiercely intelligent, relentlessly provocative, and prodigiously gifted, Eminem is known as much for his enigmatic persona as for being the fastest-selling rap artist and the first rapper to ever win an Oscar. Now, in The Way I Am, he shares his private thoughts on everything from his inner struggles, to the trials of being famous, to his love for his daughter, Hailie, creating a book that is every bit as raw and uncensored as the man himself. Illustrated with never-before-seen photographs of Eminem's home and life along with original drawings, The Way I Am is filled with reflections on his greatest hits, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. Providing his millions of fans with a personal tour of Eminem's creative process, it is poised to be hailed in much the same way as Tupac's The Rose that Grew from Concrete, Bob Dylan's Chronicles, and Journals by Kurt Cobain.",
