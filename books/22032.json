  "description": "An original member of Booth's conspiracy, Arnold had withdrawn from the plot only three weeks before the president's assassination. Captured, tried, and sentenced to life at hard labor at the infamous Dry Tortugas, Sam Arnold survived to tell his remarkable story in a vivid and compelling style. Based on Arnold's diaries, it is the only full-length account of Booth's conspiracy written by one of the accused. Published as a newspaper series in 1902, it is reproduced here verbatim, along with supplementary notes, appendices, and photographs.",
