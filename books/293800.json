  "title": "The Contract",
  "description": "My jerk of an ex-boyfriend completely screwed me over. I was going to have to drop out of my Master's program if I didn't find a solution, which meant losing the health insurance that made mine and my little sister's medication somewhat (but not really) affordable. A favour from a professor led to an introduction to a man who had an unconventional proposition. If I agreed to a six month contract with him, his brother, and their friend they would ensure I had financial security. I could stay in school, Hope could get the medication she needs to live some semblance of a normal teenage life. It was a no-brainer. I agreed. At first I felt like their toy, but soon they opened me up to a world of experiences I never thought possible for me. Then I did the absolutely worst thing I could possibly do. I started falling them. I need to keep it together, for my sister Hope and for myself.  This is a reverse harem romance that is a standalone full length novel (65k+ words), with a HEA. There are FMMM, MM, FF and \"sort of\" FFMM scenes. There are also scenes with spanking , anal and cumplay so if you're turned off by that, don't download this book. Otherwise, happy reading!",
