Her obsession with the missing girls makes her the best person for the job, but it also serves as a refuge from the problems in her own life.Battling her own demons offers coincidences impossible to ignore. Rescuing the missing girls will require Kat figuring out how much coincidence is too much, as well as fighting her desire for what she can’t have.",
