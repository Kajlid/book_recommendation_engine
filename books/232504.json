When things spiral out of control the next morning, Jack makes Daisy an offer she can’t refuse. She’ll pretend to be his fiancée and he’ll help her open the bakery she’s been dreaming about. But in between late-night campfires and days on the lake, Jack finds himself falling for the strong, stubborn woman for real.Each book in the Sorensen Family series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.
