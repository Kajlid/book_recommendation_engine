  "title": "The Jared Effect",
  "description": "Vanessa picks up a hitcher on the Interstate and enlists him to rescue her friend from a doomed romance, with no idea how far he'll go to help. Sasha steals a carnie from her shy friend Libby at a funfair, setting the girls on course for a surprise that will rock them both. Hot teacher Sylvia re-acquaints herself with an ex-student at a music gig, and finds their one-time classroom roles shockingly reversed. It's all one man - Jared Morgan, who dropped out of college and hit the road with a Fender acoustic and a change of clothes. He's been blowing in the wind ever since, getting by on short-term gigs and shorter-term loving. 'The Jared Effect' tells three stories of this charming long-haired rogue and the women whose lives he changes. And maybe of the woman who can change him in return. A laid-back joker with an infinitely raunchy mind and a permanently hard cock, he's the kind of trouble it's wise to steer clear of. But seriously - where would be the fun in that?",
