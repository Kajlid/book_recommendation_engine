  "title": "Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White Feminist Movements in America's Second Wave",
  "description": "This book is about the development of white women's liberation, black feminism and Chicana feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, the era known as the \"second wave\" of U.S. feminist protest. Benita Roth explores the ways that feminist movements emerged from the Civil Rights/Black Liberation movement, the Chicano movement, and the white left, and the processes that supported political organizing decisions made by feminists. She traces the effects that inequality had on the possibilities for feminist unity and explores how ideas common to the left influenced feminist organizing.",
