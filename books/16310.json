  "description": "MIDNIGHT SIN When a rookie cop walks on to the midnight shift, the lines between right and wrong become blurred. Every step he takes and every decision he makes has unforeseen consequences. His life will never be the same. Becoming a cop changes everything you thought you knew about life. Midnight Sin is an inside look at the dark and mysterious world behind the cop's badge. Rookie cop Gary Hollings quickly learns that wrestling street thugs and arresting drug dealers while trying to track down a serial rapist is nowhere near as tough as watching his back from his fellow cops. He must also fight his inner demons - ones that he never knew he had until he put on that police uniform. The police world is one of long hours and split-second decisions where the choices are not always clear. Midnight Sin is a gritty cop novel that explores the complexities of the cop psyche.",
