  "title": "Book of Lies",
  "description": "Book of Lies is an essential guidebook to the world of mendacity. This fascinating trove of falsehoods covers areas such as how to get away with a lie and categories such as Presidential Lies, Sex Lies, Lies to Children, and even True Lies. Book of Lies also incorporates tips on how to spot a liar-a change in vocal pitch, speed, and a lot of \"ums\" and \"ahs\" thrown in. Covering little-known information such as lies told by royalty to more common items such as every child's favorite lie (\"It wasn't me-I didn't do it\"), Book of Lies is the irresistible tome of everything that is false. Book of Lies is a great companion to Book of Secrets-you'll know everyone's secrets and you'll know when they're lying to you! Each book is bound with an irrestistible red leatherette flexicover with ribbon marker./p>",
