  "description": "Running From the Past Katie Reus Miami socialite Emma Garcia has been running from who she is her entire life. When she witnesses a horrific crime, she goes on the run. In desperation, she answers an ad for a chef on a remote horse farm in the middle of nowhere, Florida. It seems like the perfect plan until she figures out what to do with her secrets. The only thing she doesn't count on is being attracted to the rugged cowboy who owns the place. Whenever he comes around the only thing she can focus on is his seductive voice and sinful body. Retired Marine Caleb Ryder hires Emma even though he knows she's lying about her identity. He desperately needs the help, but he also doesn't have the heart to turn away a woman so obviously in need. After being burned by a woman once, he doesn't let that deter his mission to claim Emma's body and heart.",
