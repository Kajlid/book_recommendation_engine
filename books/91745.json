  "description": "What’s a divorced mother of four want for her 30th birthday?Single mommy vacay! Siri knew anywhere a swimsuit was required was out-her thighs wouldn’t be on display in swimwear like…ever. After her husband of 11 years had an affair, she had no intention of getting involved with another member of the male species. But she sure as hell didn’t mind looking at their species-especially cowboys and her cousin Chassie, a barrel racer knew where to find the hottest cowboys…one cowboy in particular-not that she’d filled Siri or Jamie of her matchmaking plans.His breath actually caught when he saw her. Siri had hips that brought thoughts to his head and the thoughts got dirtier until he reached the most beautiful pair of….baby blues he’d ever seen. He’d ridden some of the meanest bulls known to rodeo but this woman knocked him on his ass before the buzzer. Everything in him screamed to keep her well past an eight second ride-could he convince her? She was the furthest thing from the buckle bunny’s he was used to and after an interesting game of truth between them with Cuervo leading the way, Jamie might just get his shot with Siri!",
