  "description": "Silver Coyle thought she was doing the right thing—see something, say something. Now she finds herself kidnapped, chained to a pipe in the hull of a ship, and on a collision course with death. Her only chance of rescue is from the one man she never wants to see again—Weston Beil—the know-it-all former SEAL. He’s bossy, arrogant, and sexy all wrapped up in a tough-guy package. Untouchable. But that doesn’t stop the man from sending shivers of excitement racing down her spine.Weston Beil didn’t want to be right, he didn’t want to say I told you so, but there it was—the beautiful Silver was caught in the middle of a drug war just like he’d warned. The woman was headstrong and stubborn. She tested his limits, pushed his buttons, and set his body on fire. Weston had a plan, he was prepared to use everything in his arsenal to prove to Silver she was his. Only there’s a glitch in Weston’s plan—Silver might not stay alive long enough for him to claim his treasure and convince her he’s fallen in love.",
