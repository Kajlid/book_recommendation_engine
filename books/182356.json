  "description": "As defenders of the cosmos go, Rocket Raccoon has faced his fair share of galactic battles. He's been a hero to the weak, a champion of good, a protector of the innocent, a heartthrob to the many intergalactic female species and now--a raccoon on the run?! ( I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a \"formidable-and-expert-Guardian\" on the run. Rocket is NOT a raccoon, okay?)",
