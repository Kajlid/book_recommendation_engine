  "description": "From the author of \"Saturn's Return to New York \"comes this dark psychological thriller. \"'What we think is impos-sible happens all the time.' So claims the beguiling narrator of \"Come Closer,\" and after reading this spare and menacing tale, the reader has to agree. Sara Gran has created a sly, satisfying (fast!) novel of one young woman possessed not only by a demon but also by her own secret desires.\"--Stewart O'Nan \"From the Hardcover edition.\"",
