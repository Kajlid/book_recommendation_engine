  "description": "A dark god rises, and a goddess to meet him...As a librarian in the most gorgeous library in the world, I'm living my book nerd dreams. The hallowed halls are my haven, until the specter of a dark god begins to haunt my days and nights.When he kidnaps me, the lethally beautiful god gains a name: Hades. That should make me Persephone, but I’m no goddess. So why does he want me?While I'm trapped in his castle, I set out to discover what his deadly plans entail. When I learn what he wants me for, I'll do whatever it takes to escape, including seducing the brooding dark god. Yet there’s more to him than I realized. More to us. Despite the cracks that I put in his armor, he still wants me for a darker purpose--something that would bring about the end of the world.",
