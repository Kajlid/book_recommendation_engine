  "description": "Read your own heart – then walk your own road.ABOUT THE BOOKAll I wanted was a little reassurance – a glimpse of the future. I shouldn’t have asked.“I speak from the Realm of the Dead,” Moontouch said. “You will abandon me and your son, again, leaving us to face our enemies alone. I see a White Death, invincible, wasting mighty empires. And innocents, trusting in you, betrayed and abandoned – by you! I see an endless war, your people exhausted, in despair. I see men without minds, killing without remorse, and children without hope, waving the flags of an evil God. I see two madmen, leaders of the forces of light and darkness, locked in a struggle to the death for the future of humanity. You will follow the one, and fight the other, and never know which God you serve. I see you … leaving your mortal flesh, to walk among the dead…”I learned soon enough that it was all to come true – all of it.ABOUT THE SERIESSoldier of the Legion is a six-part epic tale Soldier of the Legion, The Black March, Slave of the Legion, Secret of the Legion, Cross of the Legion, and coming in 2011 Curse of the Legion.",
