  "title": "Gandhi the Man: The Story of His Transformation",
  "description": "The world remembers Gandhi as a political leader who led his people to freedom without violence. Here Easwaran examines Gandhi’s personal significance: how he transformed himself, and how we can apply his discoveries in a smaller way to resolve conflicts in our own lives. This intimate portrait shows how we can use Gandhi’s example in the home, the workplace, and the community – wherever people disagree.“Readers will never forget the look and sound of Gandhi the Man. Here Easwaran reveals Gandhi’s belief that beneath the ‘mask’ of self-obsession ‘is all the glory of our real self: complete fearlessness, unconditional love and abiding joy.’” – San Francisco Chronicle",
