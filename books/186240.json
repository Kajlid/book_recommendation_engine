  "description": "Originally published in 1866 under the pseudonym \"A. M. Barnard.\" Louisa May Alcott's novel of romance and sexual intrigue is one of her lesser-known gems. Its tone and characterizations strike a markedly different chord from her best-known works, such as \"Little Women\" and \"Little Men,\" and it remains a popular addition to her oeuvre.",
