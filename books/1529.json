  "description": "It's 1996; twelve-year-old Heather walks the street covered in blood until the Matron of an Orphanage finds her. Heather can't remember anything. Even after she gets help, her past remains a dark mystery.  Fast forward fifteen years, Heather's normal life is suddenly thrown into turmoil when she becomes involved in a grocery store robbery. She turns heroine when she shoots the man before he can kill anyone else, but her fame begins a treacherous new phase of her life when the incident is picked up by the local news channel.  After seeing the report on TV, John Doe—a psychopathic killer—is prompted to search for her. He knows she is Krystal, the one who got away so long ago. Now, he embarks on a search where murder propels his quest to find her—and he doesn't care how many he has to kill to do it.  A Detective named Taft is unexpectedly pulled into Heather’s life, and as they struggle to remain alive, they uncover details of her horrifying past. However, John has a long history of death on his hands, and he plays the game well. He crosses all the lines into the darkest reaches of human behavior, which forces Heather and Taft to face him head-on.",
