  "description": "The New York Times bestselling author of My Sunshine Away returns with a warm, surprising, and humorous novel about a mysterious machine that upends a small Louisiana town.What would you do if you knew your life's potential? That's the question facing the town of Deerfield, Louisiana, when an unusual new contraption appears in their local grocery store. The DNAMIX machine is nothing to look at, really--it resembles a plain photo booth. But its promise is amazing: with just a quick swab of your cheek and two dollars, the device will use the science of your DNA to tell you your life's potential. Soon the former teachers, nurses, and shopkeepers of the town are upending their lives to pursue their destinies as magicians, cowboys, and queens--including Douglas Hubbard and his wife, Cherilyn, who both believed they were leading perfectly happy lives until they realized they could dream for more....At equal turns moving and hilarious, The Big Door Prize explores the ways in which the glimmer of opportunity can bring a community together, pull it apart, and reveal the power of self-discovery and second chances, even under the strangest of circumstances.",
