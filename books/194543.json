  "title": "Kevin Myers: From the Irish Times Column 'an Irishman's Diary'",
  "description": "Since the early 1990s Kevin Myers has been the mainstay of the Irish Times 'Irishman's Diary' column. 'Did you see Myers today?' Often we meant to and didn't. Often we did and hoped, in vain, that we'd be able to recall it later. Outspoken, whimsical, outrageous, sheerly funny, deadly serious - you never knew what to expect. Sometimes Myers is our jester, sometimes our conscience, some times red rag to our bull. This book collects and selects from a decade of the 'Diary' to provide, at last, an intriguing taste of Myers.",
