  "title": "If Nuns Ruled the World: Ten Sisters on a Mission",
  "description": "Veteran reporter Jo Piazza profiles ten extraordinary nuns and the causes to which they have dedicated their livesâ€”from an eighty-three-year-old Ironman champion to a sassy campaigner for equal wealth distributionMeet Sister Simone Campbell, who traversed the United States challenging a Republican budget that threatened to severely undermine the well-being of poor Americans; Sister Megan Rice, who is willing to spend the rest of her life in prison if it helps eliminate nuclear weapons; and the inimitable Sister Jeannine Gramick, who is fighting for acceptance of gays and lesbians in the Catholic Church. During a time when American nuns are under attack from the very institution to which they pledge, these sisters offer inspiring, provocative counterstories that are sure to spark debate.Overthrowing our popular perception of nuns as killjoy schoolmarms content to live in the annals of nostalgia, Piazza defines them instead as the most vigorous catalysts of change in an otherwise constricting patriarchy.",
