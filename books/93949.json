  "description": "This book is an outcome of the thought provoked by the Angels in my dream and Angel Gesuina guided me in writing this book from beginning till end. This book is a conversation between Angel Gesuina who is the Angel of Creativity and me in which the Angel explains how we could walk in the light and the means to achieve that goal. Most of the time I was just a listener as the thoughts and messages that came in was from a higher source of wisdom which I was not aware of. This book helps you in understanding the myths about spirituality and the ways that you should take in leading a spiritual life, understand your divine life purpose in this world and finally fulfill the Divine purpose of oneness with the Divine power which is the source from which we all came into this world. This book will help you in understanding the ways to attain the ultimate love, peace, harmony, joy and abundance in all areas of your life.",
