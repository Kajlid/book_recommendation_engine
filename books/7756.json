  "title": "The Minus Man",
  "description": "\" The Minus Man  is a ferocious, frightening book, dark with pain and sadness. Lew McCreary writes beautifully of terrible matters. If comparisons are to be made, one might mention Cormac McCarthy's  Child of God —high praise indeed.\"  --John Banville, author of April in Spain Vann Siegert is by all appearances an ordinary man. With only his truck and a few possessions, he has moved cross-country to start a new life, taking a temporary holiday job at the post office in a small Massachusetts town. But when the urge calls him, Vann takes to the road, armed with a poisoned flask of liquor and a smile that strangers trust. Woe to those who accept his comfort—junkies, hitchhikers, a high school football star, Vann gathers his victims like moths to a flame. A harrowing journey inside the mind of a disquietingly compassionate psychopath. Made into a motion picture, adapted and directed by Hampton Fancher, starring Owen Wilson, Janeane Garofalo, Brian Cox, Mercedes Ruehl, Dwight Yoakam, and Sheryl Crow. Reader Praise for The Minus Man \"McCreary's beautiful and poetic writing gives the book an unsettling and eerie mood that lingers long after the last page is rurned.\" --Josh Mauthe, Amazon \"McCreary's novel is spellbinding, using finely tuned skill to make the reader care for, if not love a murderer.\" --Ryan Costantino, Amazon \"One of the scariest books I have ever read. You will never hitchhike again if you read this.\" -- Shari, Goodreads",
