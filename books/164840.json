Unfortunately, when the big moment finally arrives, Paolo is nowhere to be found.Was it something she said?Dakota's heart won't move on until she finds out, but is she ready to face her dangerous world alone? Or will Dakota have to let go of everything she loves simply to survive?NOTE: While reading book #1 (Fate Book) enhances the story, FATE BOOK TWO is a stand-alone story.",
