  "description": "\"They had ways. They had so many dark little creeks they could paddle up to you in. Families were the best hunters and the most tender of trappers. Families knew.\" Such is the prevailing mood of Halloween, Ben Greer's suspenseful tale of flight and pursuit, family betrayal and death, and a young man's violent coming of age. Its setting is a Southern port city, where shrimp boats ride at anchor in the evening tide and trolleys amble along boulevards lined with oleander and jasmine; where small streets wind past century-old houses of stained glass and wrought iron - whose facade of a richer era long past seems itself a veiled threat of a menacing present. Blake Pasque has returned home on a mission of Knight to do battle against what seem to him the forces of evil personified in his Uncle Cross and Aunt Millis, whose intentions appear to commit his hard-drinking, flamboyant, actress-mother, Jess to an insane asylum. In the course of the traditional Eve of Haunts and Masques before All Saints Day, Blake learns that appearances deceive, particularly the faces of evil. As the Pasques prey on themselves, a psychopathic killer circles them all. In one chilling Halloween night, they confront this murderer - and their ultimate selves. Cruelty is defied, love challenged, - and life itself hangs in the balance.",
