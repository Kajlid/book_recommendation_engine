  "description": "Eons ago, vampires tried to turn the Dark Fae in order to harness their magic, only to create a demonic energy more powerful than they could have imagined. Quietly amassing their strength for centuries, the Vampiric Fae — led by the merciless Myst, Queen of the Indigo Court — are determined to enslave the world. Only one witch stands in her way....Cicely Waters had always thought she was simply one of the magic-born — a witch who can control the wind — but when she returned home to New Forest, Washington, she discovered she's also one of the shifting Fae. Now she must perfect her gift. For Myst, Queen of the Indigo Court, has captured Grieve, the Fae prince who holds Cicely's heart. To save both her beloved Grieve and her friend Kaylin — whose demon is waking — Cicely must journey into the heart of the Indigo Court. But even as Cicely gathers strength, old alliances are breaking faith. And new allies, like the hedonistic vampire Lannan Altos, promise to take Cicely down a far darker path than she's ever travelled before.",
