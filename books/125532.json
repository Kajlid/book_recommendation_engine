  "description": "You know what it’s like to feel alone, don’t you? You can understand pain, fear, and loneliness because you’ve experienced them. Maybe you are feeling them now and that’s why you picked up this book. As you read, you will learn how to transform that pain into strength, compassion, and spiritual health. The fear, pain, and loneliness you may be feeling will no longer dominate you. They will serve as tools for your growth and your happiness. The hope of faith is that God is not only with us, but God is already working in and through us to transform fear, pain, and loneliness. That is the good news of faith in God. That is the hope and promise proclaimed by Jesus and by others—the truth of God. You don’t need to live by faith in order to please God or appease God. God loves and embraces you right now regardless of how you’re living. The good news is, as we trust in God’s love, we will begin wanting what is best for us and respect what is best for others. And the peace, the joy, and the love of God will fill us body and soul here and now.",
