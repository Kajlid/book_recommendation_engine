  "description": "The second volume in the Fire and Steel series, by bestselling author Gerald Lund, launches into the years directly following World War I and explores the devastating impact of defeat on the people of Germany specifically young Hans Eckhardt and his family. Faced with massive unrest caused by widespread food shortages, crippling unemployment, skyrocketing inflation, and the forced disbandment of the German military, a wave of revolutionary attacks brings the fledgling government to its knees. Conditions are ripe for the extreme ideology of an ambitious young leader whose disturbing ideas go largely unnoticed by a population desperate for change at any cost. But as the flames of adversity grow more threatening, hope is on the horizon for the German Saints who discover that the Lord has not forgotten them.",
