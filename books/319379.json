  "description": "Turn up the heat and get up close and personal with Will Hunter, the legendary owner of London's most exclusive honeytrap agency. He doesn't believe in love. Why would he? He's bedded hundreds of women. All of them married. And all of them wanted more. All it takes for anyone to cheat is the right looks, with the right words, at the right time. Right? And he should know. That's what he thought. He believed it all his life, until he met Eva Adams. The one mark his honeytraps can't land. She is the woman he didn't believe in. The only woman he ever wanted to want him. So when she falls for him too, their relationship attracts all the wrong kinds of attention. Can Will overcome his demons and learn to trust? To believe in love? Or will a ghost from his past wipe out his future? Bared To You is the second book in the Lay Me Bare steamy romance trilogy. It is recommended that these books be read in order. It is told from Will's point of view over the same time frame as book one.",
