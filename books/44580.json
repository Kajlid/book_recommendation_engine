  "description": "Here are strange, beautiful stories covering the full spectrum of the late Roger Zelazny's remarkable talents. He had a rare ability to mix the dream-like, disturbing imagery of fantasy with the real-life hardware of science fiction. His vivid imagination and fine prose made him one of the most highly acclaimed writers in his field. Three times he won the Nebula Award, and six times the Hugo Award, for excellence in novels and short fiction. Roger Zelazny possessed a unique, dazzling talent; his visions of the future, of other worlds and of other realities are, by turns, enchanting and disturbing, and always memorable.Contents9 • The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth • (1965) • novelette by Roger Zelazny59 • The Keys to December • (1966) • novelette by Roger Zelazny97 • Devil Car • [Sam Murdock] • (1965) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny118 • A Rose for Ecclesiastes • (1963) • novelette by Roger Zelazny177 • The Monster and the Maiden • (1964) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny179 • Collector's Fever • (1964) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny184 • This Mortal Mountain • (1967) • novelette by Roger Zelazny243 • This Moment of the Storm • (1966) • novelette by Roger Zelazny293 • The Great Slow Kings • (1963) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny304 • A Museum Piece • (1963) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny320 • Divine Madness • (1966) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny333 • Corrida • (1968) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny337 • Love is an Imaginary Number • (1966) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny347 • The Man Who Loved the Faioli • (1967) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny359 • Lucifer • (1964) • shortstory by Roger Zelazny367 • The Furies • (1965) • novelette by Roger Zelazny423 • The Graveyard Heart • (1964) • novella by Roger Zelazny",
