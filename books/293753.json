  "description": "WHERE WILL YOU ESCAPE TO THIS SUMMER? \nFor fans of ELEANOR OLIPHANT, THE ROSIE PROJECT & THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY, an uplifting story about the search for a place to belong. When a young man, Joe, washes up on the sands of St Piran in Cornwall, he is quickly rescued by the villagers. From the retired village doctor and the beachcomber, to the priest's wife and the flamboyant romantic novelist, they take this lost soul into their midst. And they, in turn, come to find that he gives fresh perspectives on their lives and loves. But what the villagers don't know is why Joe fled the city for St Piran, and what he left behind. Intimate, funny and heart-warming, Not Forgetting the Whale is a story about community, the best and worst in our nature, and the search for a place to call home.\n'Fun, uplifting, charming' Financial Times\n\n'A warm-hearted book crammed with ideas . . . very, very good' Emerald Street\n\n'A tremendously enjoyable book' Independent on Sunday",
