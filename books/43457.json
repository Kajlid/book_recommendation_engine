  "description": "Her mother’s illness left Kizzy Dean alone and surrounded by bills and vicious moneylenders. Being swept away to the sun-baked Greek Isle of Rhodes may sound like the makings of a fantasy, but for the desperate and penniless Kizzy, it’s anything but. The brooding billionaire who now owns the restaurant she works and lives in is demolishing her only source of income and the only security she has left. She has no real choice but to go wherever he commands and agree to whatever arrangement he proposes.Greek billionaire Andreas Lazarides is intrigued and mesmerized by the spirited and yet guileless Kizzy. Guilt and sorrow have been his only companions since his sister’s death, but Kizzy stirs up something inside him. He’s unaccustomed to the word “no” and unwilling to reveal his closely guarded heart, so he makes her an offer—a position as his very personal assistant.As desperate as Kizzy is, she won’t be any man’s mistress. But it’s only a matter of time before she’s forced to decide whether she wants to strangle or ravage her infuriatingly tempting boss.",
