  "description": "With his son on the ground, Enzor stepped onto his left ear with the heel of his boot resting on Eddie’s jaw and pressed him deeper into the gritty black soil. Raising the chain above his head, Enzor tore shirt and flesh with every swing. With every lash Eddie’s mouth was filled with the soil he was tasked to work. With every scream of pain he choked on the dirt that invaded his nostrils. Then it stopped and he was able to lift his head from the dirt. Coughing up the earth that filled him Eddie turned to his father who was still standing over him. The sun peeked over Enzor’s shoulder as he leaned down. “Now, get up and finish this field.” He drops the trace chain and left his son in the dirt. Evil can be found in man, but true Evil resides in the soul of man. Pushing, pulling and gnawing at who you were or who you could become. Follow the true stories of Elbert Ensor Pate and his family, from his wedding day until his last breath. Each chapter can span hours or years and are told by his surviving children. This is a book of fiction but every story inside is true.",
