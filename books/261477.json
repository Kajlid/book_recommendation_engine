  "description": "A selkie’s song can enchant a man and tame the sea . . .  Naia’s unusual love for human things led her to become the sole artisan in her clan. But when this passion leads to her abduction, she loses more than contact with the sea when her pelt is taken. Unable to shift forms or return to the sea without it, she knows she will die if she cannot recover the pelt soon. Cut off from her family, Naia must appease the human king while persuading his lovesick son to honor past arrangements.  Malik has loved and lost before, an experience leading him to shy away from love. When Naia is stranded, however, he risks everything to find her. Together they uncover a plot that would sweep up humans and selkies alike in a war that would destroy the Five Kingdoms and possibly all of Sonera.  When the enemy acts, can they save sea and land . . . and each other?  A fantasy retelling of the classic fairytale, The Little Mermaid  Clean romance, adventure, and humor combine to bring classic fairytales and myths to new life in Love's Enchanted Tales, a series of interconnected stand-alone stories. Each story can be read and enjoyed on its own. However, for greatest enjoyment they should be read in order.",
