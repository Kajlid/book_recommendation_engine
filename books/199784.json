  "description": "Best-selling author and illustrator team Robert Munsch and Michael Martchenko have created another adventure about Andrew, his loose tooth, and the wacky ways friends and family try to pull it out!\"Yeow!\" shouts Andrew. \"Do something about my loose tooth. It hurts to much I can't eat my apple.\" Andrew's dad breaks his pliers trying to pull that tooth. Andrew's dentist can't pull it either--not even by tying a rope to Andrew's tooth and driving off in his car. The Tooth Fairy is a biker chick who says, \"This is the first tooth ever that I can't pull out!\"Andrew's best friend, Louis, ends up saving the day with his special tooth-removing remedy--lots and lots of pepper up Andrew's nose!",
