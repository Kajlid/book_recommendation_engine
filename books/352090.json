  "description": "Darren Cox has been an operative for the Retriever's Division of the Agency for Afterlife Activity for ten years, ever since he was killed by a rival sniper agent on earth. In that time, his cold demeanor has scared off too many partners to count. When he meets Tanner Simms, the youngest operative to work in their division, he knows his afterlife is about to become a lot more complicated. The energetic, friendly nineteen year old is only too happy to glue himself to Darren's side and learn all there is to know about helping the troubled souls of the dead cross over. Even the prospect of banishing a demon or two isn't enough to scare off the exuberant young man. What Darren cannot make sense of is why his boss insists that Tanner needs to learn from him, or what the special talents are that his partner supposedly possess. It isn't until he sees a telltale marking on Tanner's lips and his partner shares the events in his dark past that Darren realizes the power Tanner possesses, and that he is the one the demons speak of in fear as the \"Demon Slayer.\" Tanner's unique abilities will be needed in order to defeat the possessed ghost of a serial killer determined to take one last victim with him before crossing over. Can Tanner and Darren take out the bad guy without losing their afterlives? Find out in this exciting novel.",
