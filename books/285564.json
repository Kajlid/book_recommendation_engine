  "description": "One final task to complete before they're released, but what price will it come with?I never would have predicted I'd still be stuck in Mandora Supernatural Prison for as long as I have been, but I refuse to give up hope. No matter how long it takes, I'll find a way out from under the warden's twisted rule. More importantly, I'll do it the right way because a life on the run isn't one I'm after.With the Fabled Four at my back, and my feisty fairy sidekick on my shoulder, I won't stop until we're all released from the hell we've been stuck in. But with tensions high, escape isn't as easy as it sounds while we hunt down those the warden wants.It will take all the power I can acquire, and for our group to finally work as a team, in order for us to come out on top, but just when victory is in our sights, we realize not everything is as it seems.",
