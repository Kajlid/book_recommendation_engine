  "description": "She's been named Lexia, 'man's defender', by the one who raised her and died for her, the man she called her father.  She's been named Maura, 'for darkness', by the woman who created her, a mother who sees her as a weapon, and tool for power.  She has battled for her freedom, for the revenge of her fatherâ€™s death, and then given it all up to save the man she loves.  She's given up her soul, her humanity, and now, there is only one question left. Can she create her own destiny or is she bound to follow the fate set for her before she was born?  Maura?  Lexia?  Only one thing is certain; war is coming.",
