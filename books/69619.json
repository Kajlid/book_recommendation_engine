  "description": "Short story collection. Sometimes True Love needs a little help. That’s where the Fairy Godmothers’ Union, True Love Local steps in. ‘Three Wishes’ tells three loosely related stories in which the fairy godmothers help unite three couples to fulfill their destinies together. ‘In Every Day an Hour’ is the story of Jordan and Renata, who were divided by misunderstanding before they ever had the chance to get started together. It takes a dose of magic to dispel the misunderstandings and give love its chance. In ‘Happy to be Stuck With You’ it takes a fairy godmother’s interference to get practical security-expert Craig and New Age mystic Amy together in one place long enough to see past their differences. ‘In Your Dreams’ calls on the fairy godmothers to free Linda from the enchantment that has kept her from being her true self and letting Tony, the man she secretly loves, see the true beauty within her.",
