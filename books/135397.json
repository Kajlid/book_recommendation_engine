But sometimes they can turn into nightmares.  ‘The curse said that anyone who owned the Rockford plantation house would dream of their one true love, whether that love was their wife or husband or not; or indeed whether they had even met the person yet. You would fall in love instantly but when you consummated that love, you would condemn your soul mate to death, for within the next cycle of the moon your one true love would suffer the most agonising, painful death.’  Hard-nosed journalist Ryan Davis didn’t believe in the curse when he’d purchased the run-down Louisiana mansion. He still didn’t want to believe it after falling for Hunter Hampton, despite the fact that he’d had the most intensely sensual dream about him two nights before meeting him for first time. But it’s hard to ignore the tragedies that have befallen the previous owners of the property.  But who set the curse, and why? And more importantly, can it be undone before it’s too late?",
