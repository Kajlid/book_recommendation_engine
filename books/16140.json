  "title": "Royal Family",
  "description": "A bold Mesopotamian prince. A supernatural enemy. Two beautiful women torn between two ways of life... All brought together in an extraordinary saga of a time and a place aflame with conflict, passion, ambition, love, and the struggle for justice, peace and power. The idea for this series is taken from the Book of Genesis in the Bible. This chapter suggests that there was a time when angels, called the Sons of God, married human women. The children they had were much more powerful than a normal human. Millenias ago, when the giants of the Bible, the Nephilim, terrorized the earth, the Royal Family ruled Mesopotamia. Led by King Asher, he accepts the great responsibility to protect his subjects from the bloodthirsty offspring of Fallen Angels. He is aided by his son, Prince Tyro, also of fallen angel blood, but a powerful young man with a righteous heart. Queen Kenana, once a farmer’s daughter, will stand by her King’s side and serve with fierce loyalty and love against all odds. With a kingdom at stake and fate of the world in their hands, one Royal Family will stand up against giants. Click BUY NOW or READ FOR FREE to continue the Glorious Companions series today!",
