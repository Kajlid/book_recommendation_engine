  "description": "IN LOVE WITH A ROCKSTAR?No, I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.Rebecca Cooper knows what dating a rockstar is like. It’s late nights, months on the road, and constantly sharing your man with everyone else. It’s coming second. She’s been there, done that, and walked away with a broken heart. So how it is possible she’s put herself in this position again? In love with yet another rockstar. This time, his brother. Luke Mills is bitter. He’s bogged down by years of guilt and heartache. He goes through the motions. He’s rough with everyone around him. And then Rebecca walks back into his life. Sweet Rebecca. She shouldn’t be here. She shouldn’t have come back. But Luke sees her and can’t help the way his heart wants to respond. But, no, not in a million years—he’d never let her have a spot in his frozen heart again. Not when she was always his brother’s girl.**NEVER LOVE A ROCKSTAR can be read as a standalone, or as the third book in Sarah Darlington's NEVER TRUST Series.Look for the other books in the series, each available for preorder now...NEVER TRUST READING ORDER1.
