Without a doubt, it’s undead playboy Gregori Holstein, the dashing immortal hero of this wity, charming, and super-hot paranormal romance winner from New York Times bestseller Kerrelyn Sparks. Another fabulous entry in her Love at Stake series—which author Lynsay Sands, creator of the popular Argeneau vampire family novels, has called, “an absolute delight”—the Sexiest Vampire Alive has met his match, and she’s the beautiful, brave, and brainy daughter of the President of the United States, whom Gregori must accompany on a dangerous secret mission to China. Kerrelyn Sparks does vampire romance to perfection, which is why she is up there at the very top with the other paranormal superstars, like Sands, Katie MacAlister, and Mary Janice Davidson.",
