  "description": "This might not be rock bottom, but pretending to fall in love with my best friend's little sister feels pretty damn close.My avoidance of relationships has two neighboring towns joining forces to find me a girlfriend—one I don’t want.So when they name me the bachelor in their charity dating show, I have two options: suffer the consequences of bailing or accept help from my best friend’s little sister.I chose the latter.Because Olivia Vaughn has a plan.She suggests a ringer. Someone on the inside—someone I trust, that I can choose at the end of the show.A fake contestant.It’s crazy. Risky. And undeniably tempting.We’d have to touch, flirt, kiss.I could pull her close…that long, auburn hair wrapped up in my fist as I whisper all the dirty thoughts I’ve ever had about her.Pretending to fall for her may be more dangerous than letting our meddlesome town play matchmaker.Because if this backfires, it might cost me my best friend, disappoint our families, and reignite feelings for the feisty, hazel-eyed beauty I grew up with.So while I can’t—shouldn’t—pretend to fall in love with Olivia, I do.With the hope that fake girlfriends are curse-proof.Falling for the Bachelor is a steamy, brother's best friend, fake relationship, friends-to-lovers, small town, standalone romantic comedy. It contains plenty of steamy scenes, laughs, and an HEA.",
