  "title": "The philosophy of human death",
  "description": "This publication is devoted to an important and difficult issue. Important – because death is, in a way, the end of our life; difficult – because the fear of the idea of evolution has not been fully overcome yet. The author has undertaken a discussion of the evolutionary concept of man’s death and its implications, and an extension of that discussion to include the creative act of God understood in evolutionary terms. Thus outlined, the project requires relevant anthropological knowledge in both natural sciences and philosophy. It is therefore important to emphasize the relevance of issues discussed in this book, both from the scientific and philosophical point of view, and in terms of accepted worldviews. This publication introduces to a peaceful way of going through untimely death, whether inflicted on oneself or on others. Presenting the evolutionary approach to human death aims to emphasize the relationships that occur between science and faith, and the possibility of combining the religious doctrine of Christianity with the findings of natural sciences and philosophical anthropology. Therefore, this publication should be treated as an attempt at a synthesis of faith and rational philosophical argumentation which may help build a comprehensive, coherent view of the world.",
