  "title": "Teaching Naked: How Moving Technology Out of Your College Classroom Will Improve Student Learning",
  "description": "Technology is profoundly changing education. If students are going to continue to pay enormous sums for campus classes, colleges will need to provide more than what can be found online and maximize \"naked\" face-to-face contact with faculty. \"Teaching Naked\" shows how technology is most powerfully used \"outside \"the classroom and when used effectively, how it can ensure that students arrive to class more prepared for meaningful interaction with faculty. Jose Bowen introduces a new way to think about learning and technology that prioritizes the benefits of the human dimension in education. Here he offers practical advice for faculty and administrators on how to engage students with new technology, while restructuring classes into more active learning environments.",
