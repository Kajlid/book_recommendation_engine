  "description": "As war looms between the two species, the Demon Lord is determined to find Annabelle – little does she know, the truth behind his sinister actions is about to unravel.  When Annabelle discovers that she is not the true daughter of the Alpha in her pack, her world, as she knows it, comes crashing down and she finds herself running to hide from the tyrannical Demon Lord who is hell-bent on finding her.  Despite her objections, she is taken to the court of the Werewolf King. He’s arrogant, stubborn and discerning of her very being, but willing to defend her… for now.  Will the Werewolf King yield to the Demon Lord’s ultimatum and give her to the enemy or will she be the cause of a looming war between the two species?  More importantly, what does the Demon Lord want with Belle? She’s only a werewolf… isn’t she?  \nNot only wolves, but other supernatural creatures as well. I don't want to give anything away, but this book has a sneaky way of dragging you into the story and following every twist and turn with baited breath. The characters are believable, the story unique. One of my favorite wolf shifter stories now.\n - L.R.  \nI absolutely love this book and I cannot wait for the next one! What a wild and twisty ride the book was!!! I swear once I had everything figured out, it changed all over again, twisting and turning the entire way through. I love the writing it has a nice smooth and easy way of taking you to another world were vampires, witches, demons, and of course werewolves are all living along with humans and other supernatural beings.\n - Celeste",
