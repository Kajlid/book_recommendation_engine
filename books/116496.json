  "description": "The key to ultimate wisdom and is locked inside Mount Kilimanjaro. To protect it from the German Empire, missionary flier Jack Benjamin will need some wisdom of his own. Jack never wanted to be a missionary. But at the outbreak of the First World War, he surrendered his dreams of flying around the globe to continue his parents’ work, protecting the Kikuyu tribes of British East Africa. As Jack’s danger-prone fiancée, Amanda Regent, tends to a dying Kikuyu, she is entrusted with the secret of the mysterious Solomon Ring, rumored to bestow King Solomon’s wisdom on anyone who wears it. She is captured by the ruthless General Faust, who will stop at nothing to steal the Solomon Ring from its secret chamber, hidden deep within snow-covered Mount Kilimanjaro. Now only Jack and his Maasai warrior friend, Mayani, can save Amanda and stop the Germans from using the Solomon Ring to conquer all of Africa. Speeding to Amanda’s rescue in his modified Avro 504 biplane, Jack braves countless dangers, from crocodile-infested streams to an extinct tribe of savage warriors, while questioning his ability to protect those he loves. But all his courage will mean nothing if Amanda uses the wrong symbols to open Solomon's Chamber, where an ancient deathtrap waits to hurl them all into a pit of deadly iron spikes!",
