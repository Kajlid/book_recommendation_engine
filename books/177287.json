  "title": "Miss Priss -On and Off the Court",
  "description": "Priscilla Penelope Paxton is a witty ten year old whose interests and curiosity land her in, sometimes, sticky situations. Dance classes, Girl Scouts, school assignments, friends and hanging out at her family's drug store, and the local Piggly Wiggly would leave any other person with no time for anything else. Yet, the thrill of basketball and joining the Little Dribblers finds its way into Miss Priss' heart. Though this interest will prove to be a dream that requires overcoming the greatest of challenges; Momâ€™s opposition. A task that will require ingenuity, perseverance and a little help from some loved ones.",
