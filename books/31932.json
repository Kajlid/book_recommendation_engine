  "description": "American writer, educator, theologian, and feminist pioneer EMMA CURTIS HOPKINS (1849-1925) may well be the most important woman in the history of religion in the United States. Influenced by Mary Baker Eddy and her \"Christian Science,\" Hopkins developed the more metaphysical philosophy of New Thought, an early \"New Age\" outlook that encouraged its adherents to tap the latent powers of their potent minds. Known as \"the teacher of teachers,\" Hopkins inspired her students, many of whom went on to become influential leaders of the New Thought movement, to give full expression to their creative genius. In this 1888 book, considered by many one of the greatest works of mysticism every written, Hopkins encourages us all to live life with a greater awareness of the mystery and power of the universe as it is seen through the wisdom of Jesus Christ. No bleak call to celebrate Jesus' suffering or pain, this is a glorious expression of the power within us to triumph over loss, sin, and death to find new avenues to joy. ALSO AVAILABLE FROM COSIMO: Hopkins' Scientific Christian Mental Practice",
