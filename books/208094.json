After taking it upon himself to personally oversee her initial exam, he delights in bringing the naked, blushing human to one quivering climax after another.Though Marco quickly proves that he will not hesitate to punish Freya when she defies the rules of the colony, her burning backside does nothing to diminish her growing need for him to claim her and take her long and hard.
