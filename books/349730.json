Now she's back, packing a whole lot of attitude -- not to mention stun guns, defense sprays, killer flashlights and a .38 Smith &; Wesson -- on the trail of Kenny Mancuso, a boy from the working class burg of Trenton, who's just shot his best friend. Mancuso's fresh out of the army and suspiciously wealthy. He's also distantly related to Joe Morelli, a vice cop with ethics that lean toward the gray zone, a libido in permanent overdrive, and a habit of horning in on Stephanie's investigations. Aided by her tough bounty hunter pal, Ranger, and her funeral-happy Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's soon staggering knee-deep in corpses and caskets, trying to shake Morelli ... and stirring up a very nasty enemy ... \"[Stephanie Plum is] a Jersey girl with Bette Midler's mouth and Cher's fashion sense...Who could resist this doll?\" - \"The New York Times Book Review\"~",
