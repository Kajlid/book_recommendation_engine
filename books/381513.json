  "description": "He would take her as his bride...but could she give her heart in return?When Egan MacBain takes beautiful Glenda MacKay as his bride, it appears that he's done so for the noblest of reasons. In truth, he has vowed at last to claim the woman he's always loved--yet once lost--to another man. But the rugged Highlander is determined to keep his passion hidden while he woos her with his gentle caress and wicked kisses. For he will not have an unwilling wife and will only show his tenderness once she is tamed.Although Glenda has agreed to the marriage, she's only done so to gain the protection of Egan's name. Yet this young widow of the once-powerful clan MacKay never expected that vows of love would leave her lips again, nor did she believe she'd ever hold any man so dear. But suddenly she finds herself succumbing to the strong, silent warrior who fills her with trepidations and a fevered, forbidden yearning to fulfill his wicked promise of the love--and the child--she aches for in the depths of the soul.",
