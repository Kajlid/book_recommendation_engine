  "description": "I love a good romance and all things paranormal, so this Immortal Prophecy series is very near to my heart. The story is a paranormal romance with a slightly different take on the Arthurian legends and mythology. In this story, Merlin and Morgan le Fey weren’t witches or sorcerers, but powerful Elemental Immortals, able to manipulate the elements at will. These stories revolve around a prophecy (really, what good paranormal tale involving Ancients wouldn’t have one?) and a young Immortal’s fate as the Chosen One. Paired with her preordained warrior, they are destined by prophecy to defeat an evil Immortal bent on gaining ultimate power and upsetting the balance of the Universe. The story of a female Highlander meeting her own Aragorn from Lord Of The Rings in a contemporary setting, the series is a story of a magickal, fated love wrapped in a grand and dangerous journey.  Immortal Reckoning is a short story prequel to the Immortal Prophecy Series, taking place in 1912, where we get a bit of back story for the Chosen One, Isadora Winthrope before she meets her warrior...and we learn how dangerous her plight really is…  At 200 years old, Isadora Winthrop is an infant in the Immortal world, so what turn of events has put a target on her back? For a second time in two centuries, an ancient evil is stalking her, a mighty Immortal bent on destroying her to gain his own ascension. She was lucky in her first clash with Darius, High Priest of Avalon, but this time around she may not survive. She's not strong enough to best him in a face-to-face battle, that's certain. She needs help...and right now. To that end, she’s made a pact with a shadowy group known as Sentinels, but will they be able to protect her, or will they lead this ancient evil right to her doorstep?",
