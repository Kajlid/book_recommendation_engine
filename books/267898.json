  "description": "Hi, I'm Anne, Anne Hudderson, and this is my story. I suffer from social phobia, I'm too scared to open up in front of people. I've always just been on my own. It is a long, long story; a story about love, a story about sacrifice, a story about unimaginable things. You'll learn, you'll cry, you'll laugh and you'll smile. So, sit back and come along with me on this journey of mine.",
