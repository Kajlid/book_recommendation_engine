  "description": "The fact that Rod Langford achieved classification as a midget by just half an inch did not sit well with him. It did not sit well with him at all - particularly in light of the fact that his wife had escaped such classification by the same margin.When a washing machine literally falls from the back of a lorry at his feet, Rod wonders whether at last his luck is changing. Some people it seems, though, are just born unlucky; and it is a well known fact that when hope is taken away a man may fall far indeed. In no time at all, our man has murder on his mind.Can salvation come to Rod in the form of the locals from the pub around the corner? And what of his wife, Liz, who whilst working nights in the local supermarket, spends her time considering the benefits or otherwise of inserting poison into a variety of condiments?Into the troubled lives of Rod and Liz Langford come the Eastern Region Angel Collective. But what, and who, are this mysterious organisation? Angels? Real angels? Either way, it seems, somebody is going to get seriously hurt.Ah, but then we have the bird that nobody seesâ€¦",
