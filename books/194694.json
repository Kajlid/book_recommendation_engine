  "description": "Montana Blackstone has big plans for the deluxe spa resort she's building at Black Creek Ranch. They don't include letting her know-it-all new foreman take the reins, even if tall, broad-shouldered Steele Hardt looks mighty capable of showing her how blissful it can be to surrender control -- in and out of the bedroom. As the sizzling chemistry between them erupts in one mind-blowing encounter after another, Montana finds that Steele has a knack for knocking down her defenses and seeing through to the vulnerable core she's tried so hard to hide.Once a pro poker player, now a renowned business troubleshooter, Steele came to Black Creek to give investors a covert report on the spa's potential -- not to give its gorgeous owner such very personal attention. And once she learns the truth about why he's there, Steele stands to lose Montana forever. Convincing her that the heat between them is more than a diversion means taking the biggest gamble of his life. But Steele has never been known to take the easy way out -- and he's not about to start now. . . .",
