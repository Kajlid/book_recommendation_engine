  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Jacqueline Carey, praised for pushing the boundaries of epic fantasy, delivers the second installment of the Naamah series, set in the vivid alternative Renaissance world of her famed Kushiel's Legacy novels.Alone and far from the land of her birth, young Moirin sets out across wild Tatar territory to find her beloved Bao, the proud Ch'in stick fighter who holds the missing half of her diadhanam, the divine soul-spark of her mother's people. But the lovers' reunion is short lived. Moirin is abducted, cast in chains that bind her magic, and betrayed into the hands of a fanatic Yeshuite priest. Fiercely zealous, he is determined to save Moirin's soul and convert her to his faith...or see her stoned to death for her many sins. With her soul declared a battleground of the gods, Moirin will struggle to hold on to her humanity and survive - all the while wondering if the gift of love bestowed on her by the goddess Naamah is a blessing or a curse.Wrestling with issues of faith and divine will, Naamah's Curse explores what happens when mortal men seek to mold the gods in their own images.",
