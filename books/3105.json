  "description": "In the four years since her husband’s death, Melanie LaSalle’s life has been consumed with managing the family design firm and caring for her five-year-old daughter, Jerica. The possibility of a new relationship is the last thing on her mind. But when Melanie meets Joel Ellington, a new staff member at her church, she is instantly attracted to his warm spirit.As their friendship deepens, however, Melanie is troubled by something she can’t quite understand or explain. Joel seems to be hiding something–in fact, most areas of his past are off-limits, even to her. Because of her growing feelings for him, Melanie pushes her doubts away. But when unsettling facts come to light–and when Joel disappears, along with the contents of a church bank account–she can no longer ignore her fears. Now, torn between her feelings for Joel and evidence mounting against him, Melanie faces a heart-wrenching decision: to forget the man who gave her reason to love again or to trust Joel enough to give him her heart. Exploring the themes of the importance of truth, loyalty, and trust, A Scarlet Cord illustrates that who we are in Christ depends little on outward appearances and much on our relationship with him, and that through faith, we can find places of comfort, healing, and selfless love.",
