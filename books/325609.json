  "description": "Anastasia is the princess no one needs: the fourth daughter born to an emperor without a son, and the only royal lacking a magical gift.Until she collides with a young Cossack rebel, changing both their lives forever.Damien is taken from everything he knows and raised as a ward of the Romanovs.Anastasia develops a strange kind of magic shared only by the Black Monk Rasputin.While her power grows in secret, boosted by forbidden contact with Damien, Anastasia makes a mistake with terrible consequences.Fate grants her a single chance to set it right… but saving what she lost may cost everything she loves.The Lark Notes:I think what captivates us about Anastasia is our dream of what could have been. Anastasia’s death was so tragic, I wanted to give her another life.This book is not a retelling of any other Anastasia story. It’s set in 1919 in a world similar to ours, but with magic. My next series will be a vampire family saga set in the modern version of that same world.This is my fantasy of the happy ending Anastasia deserved. Not because she was a Romanov, but because she was a human. I want all of you to have the happy ending you deserve – it’s why I love writing romance. --Sophie“Anastasia” is an epic enemies-to-lovers fantasy romance. It is intended for mature readers and contains spicy scenes not suitable for all.",
