  "description": "Pulled from the invisible phenomenons of our world, each poem uses descriptive imagery to recreate specific feelings and environments. A camera for your soul. \"Like glass, the water holds still; supportive and strong. It reflects a distorted version of nature. Silent. It holds its breath until a simple droplet falls from the sky.\" M. Wellman uses specific visual items to inspire her. She takes items or events that sit in front of our eyes every day and deconstructs them melodically.",
