Dispelling some of the most pervasive beliefs as well as bringing light to others, Badman reveals that: • Monroe had a one-night stand with JFK at Bing Crosby’s house, but the rumors about her on-going affairs with JFK and RFK were untrue • Her father was not Martin Edward Mortensen but a man named Charles Stanley Gifford, who abandoned Marilyn’s mother when she was three months pregnant • Monroe was tricked into admitting herself into a psychiatric institute where she was treated like a prisoner in a mental asylum until Joe DiMaggio pulled strings for her release • A drunken Monroe was sexually exploited by mobsters at a Lake T ahoe hotel co-owned by Frank Sinatra, who had photos of the incident destroyed Badman sifts the truth from the gossip to provide a perfect companion to the hugely successful book, Fragments. For those who think they know the truth about Marilyn Monroe, think again.",
