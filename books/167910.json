  "description": "Kayden Garrett’s ready to head home to Georgia, after four long years in Boston attending university. An unexpected fight with an abusive lover leaves him battered--and cursed into becoming a werewolf. Immediately after leaving the plane, he’s introduced to Paul, who makes his former flame dwindle in the dark. Their connection is instant and explosive. The two can’t explain the attraction to each other, but don’t waste time trying to figure it out.Between struggling with being a werewolf and getting in with a local pack, Kayden has to acclimate to being with someone who treats him as an equal, instead of a possession. All their progress comes to a halt when a dark figure from Paul’s past resurfaces, threatening their newfound love, and their very existence.Going home isn’t always easy, but for Kayden, the experience is a true test of his strength, his ability to adapt to the shifter world he’s been thrown into, his need to protect his family and friends, and his overwhelming desire to be loved.",
