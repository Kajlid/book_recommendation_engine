With nothing to do, the closest beach two hours away, and Gram, who Ana is convinced is crazy, always in her garden talking to things that aren't there, Ana is bored out of her mind.One day, Ana sees strange colors floating around Gram as she works in her garden. Gram says they're fairies. She can \"See\" them, and there are others who can see things. Ana's a Seer, too.When Gram gives Ana a book that explains about the many different creatures, like selkies, unicorns, vampires, and others, Ana gets curious. She is shocked when she comes across the entry about famous werewolf hunters - her parents.Determined to learn where she fits in, Ana's summer gets a lot more exciting as she sets off to find out what she can \"see.\" Only problem is, she's not sure what to do when she finally discovers the truth. And she's not sure she'll live to tell anyone.",
