  "description": "The CRIMSON CROSS series is inspired by a mysterious silver and ruby cross, a precious relic of the Holy Land. In each volume it is passed on to a young person who has proven to be worthy of it. As they play a crucial role in dramatic moments of America’s history, the characters face difficult choices and challenges—not unlike those confronting today’s youth.\nKate Winfield on the Oregon Trail \nis the dramatic story of a teenage girl’s moral courage in confronting danger, disease, and death while taking part in the greatest human migration in world history. In 1843, Kate is among those 300,000 Americans who will journey up to thousands of miles to the Oregon Territory in search of a better life. Through perilous river crossings, blistering heat, choking dust clouds, freezing nights, and the tragic passing of her mother, Kate matures emotionally and spiritually and begins to dream of becoming a medical missionary to the Indians. But that dream is challenged when a typhus epidemic threatens to wipe out the entire wagon train.",
