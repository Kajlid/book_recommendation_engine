  "description": "I gave the world two middle fingers when I moved to the mountains Yeah, I’ve got skeletons in my closet, but who doesn’t? I built a log cabin that has everything I need Winter is coming alright, but I’m ready  Then I hear there’s a woman lost in the snowstorm Was it the same gorgeous blonde I saw earlier that day? If she’s lost in Devil’s Pass, nobody can save her but me  Shane: I was well stocked for the snowstorm, ready to drink my way through it like I’ve done with so many before. I sure didn’t expect it to find a gorgeous virgin nearly frozen to death in her car. I guess I’m going to have to find a way to warm her up.  Heather: My friends are really bad with directions and apparently my GPS doesn’t work in the mountains. I made one wrong turn and ended up trapped in a massive snowstorm. Just when I thought it was all over, Shane found me. He’s a ridiculously hot bearded man who lives in a log cabin he built himself! I don’t think I’m going to be a virgin when this storm is over.  Kelli's Note: This is a steamy standalone novella with a HEA and no cheating! I'm a girl that likes wild and crazy romances, so that is exactly what you get from me. My heroes might be a little over-the-top with a touch of caveman and you'll get some angst along the way, but I promise that the good parts will give you a plenty of reasons to read this all by yourself!",
