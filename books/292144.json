  "title": "Quest for Atlan",
  "description": "This is a story of what might have been in a time about which we know so little—the beginning of civilization—and how God, even then, could have chosen the weakness of frail humanity to accomplish His purposes! In this, the second of the Cradleland Series, Rhone's evil brother rules over Atlan—until Rhone is commissioned by the Gardener (Christ) to remove him! But there are obstacles to be overcome—the forces of evil and even the power of love that sometimes clouds our way. Still, Rhone must find a place where Noah can be safe and eventually build the ark that will preserve faith in the earth through a remnant of souls. Download the Readers' Guide.",
