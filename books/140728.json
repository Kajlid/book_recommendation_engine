  "description": "It’s been seven years since Payce started his new life, and it was finally starting to feel comfortable…almost. But when his past catches up to him, Payce has to decide if he’s going to deal with the things he left behind, or if he’s going to keep running. When his friends, Damien and Dax need help, Payce is forced to confront the one person who knows him better than himself, Braxton and the one who made him lose everything he held dear, Aaron. Seeing them both could change everything for Payce, and when past passions reignite, who will get burned in the end?",
