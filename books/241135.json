  "description": "CONFESS.  It's what he said to me across his altar, what he demanded so that I would be pure.  In the moment he blessed me with his virtue, I was no longer the woman I'd once been.  I was Eve.  His light. His salvation. His bridge to Heaven's gate.  I failed him because my faith was not strong enough.  He punished me for not giving in.  Resisting temptation is never easy.  Not when his hands, his teeth, his heat and hunger were the greatest of my sins.  **DISCLAIMER: This novel discusses sensitive subject matter and is intended for adults, 18+ or older. Readers who are sensitive to triggers are advised to proceed with caution.**",
