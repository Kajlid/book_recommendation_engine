  "description": "Percy Jackson meets Star Trek PSS 118 is just your typical school—except that it's a rickety old spaceship orbiting Ganymede, a moon of Jupiter. Jack's dad used to be the science teacher, until he got fired for tinkering with the ship. Now Jack just wants to get through the last day of school without anything else going wrong. But when the school is mysteriously attacked, Jack discovers that his dad has built humanity's first light-speed engine—and given Jack control of it. To save the ship, Jack catapults it hundreds of light-years away . . . and right into the clutches of the first aliens humans have ever seen. School hasn't just gotten out: it's gone clear across the galaxy.And now it's up to Jack and his friends to get everyone home. \"[T]his middle-grade action-adventure space opera is just plain fun.\"— Booklist \"A perfect bridge for readers looking for a Percy Jackson–esque work of science fiction.\"— School Library Journal",
