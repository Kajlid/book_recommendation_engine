But her little YouTube crafting channel, while fun, isn't exactly a money maker. So she's heading to the world-famous Cabazon Valley Music and Arts Festival with a goal - film a video that will launch her channel into popularity and turn it into a legit money making venture, even if it means selling out her creative vision.Instead, she finds obnoxious Jay Bankar, the annoyingly hot host of a popular prank channel who is the actual worst. Andi hates everything Jay stands for, which makes the undeniable connection she feels with him really freaking inconvenient. Soon she finds herself competing with Jay for an interview with the festival's headlining band, which could be the key to turning her little channel directly into college tuition. But she's starting to discover that there is more to Jay than his jerky on-screen persona, and she has to decide what's more important - winning, or giving a second chance to a guy who couldn't be more wrong for her.",
