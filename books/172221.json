  "description": "Théoden: Tonight, I have to make one of the hardest decisions of my life. I have to choose which two on my children to send off with my Sire, my King, Ara. As you know, I don't like to share what belongs to me, but I can't deny my King what he's commanded of me. The highlight of my evening, however, will be my ascension to Prince of the City. I'm expected to announce my own decree at tonight's ceremony and I can't wait. The citizen of the Kingdom of Ara WILL respect my rule... or else. Noel: I got a break last night when Théoden allowed his sons some free time. But Tonight is going to be no walk in the park for me. Marco is all business and he doesn't take his job of training me lightly. I'm still trying to figure out what I can and can't do around him, the cruel, sadistic bastard is so unpredictable. One thing is for certain, I want to learn what it means to be a vampire. I don't want to be ruled by my nature... I want to control it. Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes. The novelettes in this serial will be filled with dark, twisted, raunchy and steamy scenes between powerful, sexy men that will either offend you or get ya revved up. This series will not be pulling any punches, and it won’t apologize for hurting your feelings, either. You’ll find no fluff and ruffles here. The vampires are not misunderstood, hopeless romantics looking for love. The werewolves are not cute and cuddly and the dragons aren’t the ones from your childhood. This is NOT a romance. There are approximately 24,800 words in this novelette.",
