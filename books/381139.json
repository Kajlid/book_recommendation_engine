  "title": "Penguin Books: The Pictorial Cover 1960-1980",
  "description": "Printed for the Penguin Book Pictorial Cover Exhibition at Manchester Polytechnic Central Library May-June 1981. Evelyne Green gives an introductive history of pictorial covers at Penguin Books with footnotes of their development 1960-1980. The book ends with a list of 219 exhibits under various headings (a comparison of cover designs for books by the same author as they have been updated in the period c1956-1980; the introduction of pictorial covers c1955-1968; the application of the Crime grid to the Pelican and Fiction lists - the work of Germano Facetti; the impact of Pop Art at Penguin - covers commissioned and designed by Alan Aldridge; the final formation of the house style under David Pelham; the age of pastiche - period covers; Penguins Books as a patron of mainstream illustration; some photographic covers; the use of stills from cinema and television films; the creation of a cover style for the author; breaking the house style; new directions in Penguin covers). This is NOT an illustrated book. Green informs the reader in her preface that \"the exhibition had been planned as a small display of Penguin books which would form part of the 'Book Design Collection' of the Polytechnic Library. However, the generous loan of books from the Penguin archive made it possible to extend the scope of the exhibition so that it presented a survey of pictorial cover designs on Penguin books throughout the last two decades. Although an element of illustration was used on certain Penguin covers from as early as 1938 it was not until 1960 that the employment of the pictorial cover was fully accepted and it is a range of these covers which were displayed.\"",
