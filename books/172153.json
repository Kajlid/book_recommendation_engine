  "description": "In every school, there is always one exceptional individual who stands out from the rest of the crowd.Seventeen-year-old Anton knows this all too well. Creative, sensitive, and musically-gifted, he possesses an intangible quality that draws both the admiration of young girls and the ire of teenage boys. Teased since grade school for his slightly-pointed ears, and tormented in high school because of the long, brown hair he’s grown to cover them, he finds solace in a world of fantasy where his unconventional nature is not only welcomed, but desired. While at summer camp, the other boys pull a cruel prank that drives him into the woods, terrified and injured, and he stumbles into a deep hole where he falls into an altered state of consciousness; or does he? When he awakens, he finds himself in a most unusual, delightful place, surrounded by five charming, female, fairy-like creatures. “This is Vreeland,” explains Titi, a most captivating winged beauty. As the seed of love sprouts and grows between Titi and Anton, it is eventually discovered that he is, in fact, the son of the Great Architect, whom the Vrees revere. As the prophesied Chosen One, Anton is therefore destined to rescue the Queen of Peace from her captor—the malignant Drakon, Lord of the Weets. But how will this be accomplished? What hidden strength must be realized within Anton to see this mission fulfilled? And will he ever return to the realm from whence he came?",
