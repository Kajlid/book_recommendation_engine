She keeps on driving and takes a room at a local hotel to conduct a bit of spying—and discovers some worrisome information.But when she returns home to confront him, Jake isn’t just emotionally distant—he’s gone, along with all his things.

Then comes an anonymous threat and a demand for money. Nothing seems to make sense. Will she ever get her husband back? And does she really want to?",
