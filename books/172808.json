  "title": "Reality Check: Brief Reflections on Un-Conditioning the Mind",
  "description": "Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages. What we have here is a brief compendium of unconventional viewpoints regarding what is loosely termed “the spiritual path,” but what is, in fact, a return to our fundamental sanity. All this and more for only 99 cents!From the Un-conditioning is about waking up, emerging from a superimposed dream of separate realities into a direct perception of unity, which is life as it is. It's what's commonly called \"spiritual work.\" All of the great traditions offer teachings and methodologies to enable this process of awakening. Unfortunately, the conditioned mind can easily turn anything into a conditioned response. When that happens, the conditioned view that was supposed to be eradicated is actually strengthened, and the mind becomes even more narrow and closed. We are all too painfully aware of the rampant rise of fundamentalism, intolerance and violence stemming from so-called religious values.The brief reflections in this book can, I hope, illuminate the pitfalls of traditional spiritual work and broaden the possibilities of the path to awakening, which is simply, our birthright.",
