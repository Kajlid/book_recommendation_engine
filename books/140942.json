  "description": "Her powers could save her island...or bring their love crashing down. Hawaiian Heroes, Book 4 Despite her successful career, Lalei Kai-Ho'omalu has always considered herself mere decoration in a dynamic Hawaiian family, with none of their powerful gifts. Destined for life in the background as a useless, upper-crust wife. Desperate to escape her mother's latest matchmaking attempt, Lalei acts on her sizzling attraction to a guest at her cousin's island wedding, making him a bold offer he can't refuse. A no-strings, no-holds-barred affair on Nawea Bay with the sexy Hawaiian beauty is just the break California Realtor Jack Nord needs from his fast-paced career-and an inner darkness he'd like to forget. Just for a while. Their very public liaison is the shocking declaration of independence Lalei intended-with unintended consequences. Stirred to anger by developers set on carving her family's unspoiled ancestral lands into a resort, Lalei discovers she has the supernatural power to stop them. But when Jack learns his lover can bring down the rain and throw bolts of lightning, whose side will he take? The money-making machine? Or the woman born to protect her island home? Warning: A wahine whose real estate may be too hot to handle, and a Realtor who's determined to seal the deal.",
