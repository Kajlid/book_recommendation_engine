  "description": "\"Witte's achievement rests in maintaining his poise and applying his considerable intelligence even in the heat of the national moment....this collection stands a chance of enduring as a work of witness.\"--American Book Review\"Smart, timely, and sane, this volume is highly recommended.\" --Library JournalSet in our post 9/11 climate of deceit and mutual suspicion, the poems in Deniability utilize the vocabularies of bureaucracy and religion, exploring how the former co-opts the ancient latter, to such consequential effect.  Wielding clich√©s, repurposed words, rootless acronyms, and the persuasive lingo of expertise, these poems betray or undermine their speakers' confidence. Civil networks erode with mutual suspicion; surveillance holds neighbors at one remove. One woman steels herself for mortal crisis; commuters walk, ride, and pray in heightened states of awareness; a SEAL team is ambushed, an official blows smoke around a troubling admission, and a child asks three questions on what might be the last day of her life.  With wit and formal acuity balanced by emotion, Deniability considers what we lose when we abdicate the power of language, and so surrender to the seductive language of power.",
