  "description": "Hanukkah is here at last, and Daniel Bloom couldn’t be more excited. It’s time for candle lighting and storytelling and presents. Time for chocolate gelt and dreidel games and . . . green latkes? Uh-oh. Maybe this year’s Hanukkah won’t be quite what Daniel expects.And his mom’s zucchini latke experiment isn’t Daniel’s only holiday challenge. There’s that dog who just moved in down the hall. That huge dog with the fierce bark. Ever since being bitten last summer, Daniel has been afraid of dogs. Whenever he hears barking, he feels younger than his little sister, Amy. She loves dogs. Daniel knows that Amy wishes he weren’t afraid. Maybe then, one of her gifts could be a dog. But that would take a miracle, Daniel figures.A Hanukkah miracle.From the Trade Paperback edition.",
