  "description": "What do you do when the one you least expect to matter…  Ends up mattering the most?   Derek Pearson likes to think he’s an easygoing guy. Uncomplicated, upfront, and unapologetic with what he wants. His what you see is what you get attitude is on prominent display for anyone who cares to look, and his foul mouth is right there to back it up should you miss the point.  However, what you see isn’t always what you get, and only a select few have ever glimpsed the real man under the brash exterior.  Among them? Professor Jordan Devaney. Complicated, high-maintenance, and vibrant, he’s Derek’s opposite in every way. From the moment they saw each other, a love-hate relationship began.   But what happens when one person wants more?",
