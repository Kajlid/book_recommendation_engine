She might even try her luck at DayZ – hopefully without having all her stuff pinched.Well, if only.Press-ganged into action by Interpol, Tove finds herself stuck in Prague, with a target painted on her back, and forced to play spy-games with her BFFs computer whiz Arnie and the gadget guy of the group, Ota – who also happens to be determined to set her up. Running against the clock, going undercover, chasing terrorists, and fending off a group of black-hats, what could go wrong?Thriller, Technothriller, Geek Lit",
