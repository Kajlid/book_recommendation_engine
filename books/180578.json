But the dead need jobs done too, so the five form the Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service, carrying out the last wishes of their cadaverous clients, so their souls can move on. But the Kurosagi gang are magnets for weirdness—not just corpses—and every case gets them involved in disturbing personal obsessions, bizarre modern Tokyo fads, and strange rituals of old Japan! Collects The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Volumes 1–3.",
