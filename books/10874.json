  "description": "\"When you start a diet, the first thing you lose is your mind.\"—Bradley Trevor Greive  With his trademark wit and humorous animal photographs, BTG explains that the true motivation for losing excess weight and keeping it off is purely to enjoy a better quality of life, to get the most out of our brief time on this earth.Dieting Causes Brain Damage identifies the most common causes of weight gain as well as the perils of extreme dieting, suggesting that the number-one lesson is to \"Keep your mouth shut.\" This reduces the number of calories consumed and stops you from constantly whining and making excuses about your appearance.  You don't need a PhD., millions of dollars, plastic surgery, a library of fad diet books, or a Day-Glo Lycra bodysuit to get into shape. Eating well, enjoying quality sleep, and getting a little exercise is the key to weight loss and personal health and fitness.  This wonderful gift book is for anyone who would like to be in better shape and could use a few laughs along the way—a uniquely refreshing guide to looking, feeling, and living well that is free from false promises, tasteless recipes, and leg warmers.",
