  "description": "\"Some characters become your friends for life. That's how it was for me with Betsy-Tacy.\"—Judy Blume With a Foreword by Meg Cabot Maud Hart Lovelace’s beloved Betsy-Tacy series continues with the third and final books set in Betsy and Tacy’s high school years, Betsy Was a Junior and Betsy and Joe, featuring the original cover illustration from Betsy Was a Junior along with a foreword by New York Times bestselling author Meg Cabot. “Slipping into a Betsy book is like slipping into a favorite pair of well-worn It’s always a pleasure to live in Betsy’s world for a little while, to experience her simple joys, but also her (thankfully short-lived) sorrows.” — Meg Cabot “I re-read these books every year, marveling at how a world so quaint - Shirtwaists! Pompadours! Merry Widow hats! - can feature a heroine who is undeniably modern.” — Laura Lippman “There are three authors whose body of work I have re-read more than once over my adult Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and Maud Hart Lovelace.” — Anna Quindlen",
