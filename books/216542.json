  "title": "Soundman for a B-Band",
  "description": "Sex, drugs, and Rock-n-Roll would have been considered a tame existence back in the 1980s in Albuquerque New Mexico. At the age of eighteen, I was a sound engineer for popular bar bands. There was so much depth to that depraved existence that I was surprised I found my way out. Now I'm a husband, a father, a responsible human and I don't have anything to do with that lifestyle, but I do have the memories. Good, bad, vulgar, ugly, funny, stupid, silly, dangerous, decadent; there was always a new night, a new band, a new girl, a new party and it was so much fun that it seemed like the good times would never end. And then I grew up. My name is Duncan and these are my stories of running sound for B-Bands.",
