  "description": "In the dark lies hope.One boy looking for salvation. One girl yearning for hope.Colton Caldwell is hotter than I remember—broad chest, muscles in all the right places, wavy brown hair, and eyes that suck me in. All private-school perfection. Pity he can’t drive worth a damn. He hit me with his truck, just backed out without looking, leaving me bruised, aching... and well aware of him. But things have changed since he left. A lot of things. He’s no longer the budding football star, and I’m no longer the gawky kid he never noticed. We have one thing in common now… our tortured past. When I witness a fight between Colton and his dad, I realize just how much we’re alike. The only problem is, he doesn’t seem to think so. But as the darkness we try to leave behind pushes us together…We realize one thing is certain.Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow isn’t given. So what if we live today as if it’s our last?Crazy For You is a standalone boy next door romance with a happily ever after and is suited for mature audiences.",
