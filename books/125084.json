  "description": "Bold men of destiny, marked by the sign of the lion, and women of beauty and courage sprang from nameless oblivion to command the power of kings. A slave since birth...a man without a tribe...an innocent virgin sacrificed to the lusts of godless men.Across the vast, burning expanse between two empires - caravens driven by fate - they forged the weapons of hotblooded conquest and desire. In a great and fabled age of treachery and debauchery, they rose above their searing shame to flee the fiery destruction of Sodom and beget the CHILDREN OF THE LION.",
