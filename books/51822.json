  "title": "Baby Boat: A Memoir of Adoption",
  "description": "The Baby Boat resonates with the joys and sorrows adoptive parents face. With dry humor and a quietly beautiful literary style, Patty Dann recounts the hurdles she and her husband encountered at every step during their journey to adopt a baby, from the endless waiting, through the heartbreaking loss of the infant girl who might have been their adoptive daughter, to their flight home from Lithuania with their son in their arms. As much an affecting love story as the poignant tale of one couples struggle to adopt, The Baby Boat captures the complex and subtle emotions of an adoptive parents experience.",
