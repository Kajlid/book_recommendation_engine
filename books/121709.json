  "description": "I live for happily ever afters.And I'm finally meeting my favorite romance author in person!Only, all this time, I thought author, Amelie De Pierre, was a woman.It turns out, Pierre Toussaint is the man behind the books that make me weak in the knees.He could be the consummate book boyfriend with his dreamy hazel eyes, strong jawline, and those black-rimmed glasses. Not to mention that accent. Oh, that French accent. When Pierre speaks, I feel like I’m curled in his arms on a riverbank being fed chocolate-dipped strawberries.Not Pierre’s arms, of course. We barely just met. And I’m just me. And he’s Pierre, internationally renowned romance author.Seeing Pierre in person has me stammering and blushing—two things I don’t usually do.Imagine my surprise when I receive a call a few weeks after meeting Pierre—from his agent—proposing marriage. Not that I’d marry his agent.They want me to marry Pierre.",
