  "description": "In a world where the rules are gray and the Don's word is a law unto itself, only one thing is sacred… family.  A Team A.L.P.H.A. and Alphabits spin-off series  Tony Peterson has seen friend after friend find their mate, including his brother, but he’s pretty much given up on it happening for him, especially since he’s not a typical alpha. It’s okay though, he has his son Dexter and a great job helping shifter kids heal and navigate the system. What more could he want?  Joey Novak had to fight his way through a lot of prejudice to be seen as equal to all his alpha brothers, and he doesn’t regret a minute of it. Living on the wrong side of the law means you have to make your own, anyway. As long as he doesn’t wonder if he’ll ever find an alpha who will be the perfect match for him, he’s completely happy with his life.  Fate always strikes when you’re looking the other direction, and when a kid under the Novaks’ protection ends up in the system, Tony and Joey’s paths cross, and the two men from opposite sides of the law have to discover whether true love is enough when their values are so different. With a baby on the way, they don’t have much time to find an answer. But what if that answer is that they’d be better apart?  This is the second book in this mpreg mafia series. Get ready for a world ruled by the Don’s iron fist, unique interrogation tactics, and a family that stands together… no matter what. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and more violence than you’re used to from us. But at its heart, you’ll still find all the fluffy mpreg feels and crazy antics you’d look for from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown.",
