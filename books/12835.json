  "description": "Wouldn't it be nice if we all held hands and pooped rainbows?Sure, but until our world becomes a technicolor paradise, what's the REAL way for people to get happy?Avoiding catastrophe.This parody of \"The Book of Awesome\" outlines one awful(ly ridiculous) scenario after the next, to demonstrate how much worse life could really be. Whether it's a world where you finally meet your evil twin, the cancellation of Facebook, or the discovery of unicorns that forever alters society, you'll feel relieved you're only READING about it.For ease of comprehension, the author lends her humble experiences to several topics, and leaves no stone of embarrassment unturned (not even the one where she had head lice as a grown adult).To cover off a vast array of concerns, the book is sectioned off into highly relevant topics for 1. Self-Image2. World Issues3. Life Skills4. Food and Drink5. Society and You6. Alternative Lifestyles7. Stalking, Dating and RomanceYou can read it all at once or jump in when you're feeling blue.Not that you'll feel \"awesome\" by the time you're finished......but overwhelming relief?Highly probable.[ this book contains strong language and themes some readers may find offensive.]",
