  "description": "Here is an arresting look at art that uses slate, limestone, river boulders, sand, mud and clay--all created by young Scottish artist Goldsworthy. Stone reflects the artist's increasingly strong conviction that the places in which he works are as essential a part of his art as that which he creates. 130 full-color photographs.",
