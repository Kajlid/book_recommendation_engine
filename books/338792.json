  "title": "The Presenting Past: The Core of Psychodynamic Counselling And Therapy",
  "description": "\". . . a wonderfully readable overview of the developmental principles underlying psychodynamic counseling.\"--Jan Grant, Ph.D., senior lecturer, Edith Cowan University, Western Australia A person's past is ever present, from infancy to old age, and it always affects the dynamics of therapy and the therapist-patient relationship. Written by one of the most-cited counseling authors in Europe, the bestselling The Presenting Past gives practicing therapists and students keen insight into the subject. The theories of Freud,Winnicott, Klein, and others are organized into three main trust and attachment; authority and autonomy; and cooperation and competitiveness. Lavishly illustrated and updated to give the most complete picture available on the subject, this edition of The Presenting Past gives more attention to therapy models such as attachment theory. Known for his straightforward and accessible writing style, Michael Jacobs provides clinical examples of issues concerning the past as they are presented to clients in counseling and psychotherapy and coherently makes the connection between theory and practice.",
