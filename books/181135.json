  "description": "A Love Frozen In Time… Reese Johnson yearns for a life other than the world of drudgery she’s settled for as the manager of a comic book store. What’s that they say? Be careful what you wish for? Well that’s a motto Reese should have tattooed across her forehead. Because Loki, the Norse god of mischief, has just the remedy for the boring life of this woman who denounces his existence.  His recipe for disaster? Take a 30 year-old woman and send her back in time as a pawn for revenge. Couple her with Eirik Sigurdsson, a Viking Warlord, too arrogant and baggage-laden to be of any use for anything, but battle and bed. Mix thoroughly, folding in a heavy dose of pride, a tyrannical king, and a sympathetic goddess. Bake at high until a white-hot love is unleashed and then forever frozen in time.  NOTE: The Viking Wants Forever was previously published as Frozen in Time. The story has been expanded by 42,000 words.",
