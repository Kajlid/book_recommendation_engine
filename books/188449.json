  "description": "Sometimes you hit rock bottom and then discover a whole new level of suck.Moving to California last year was supposed to distance Axl Derringer from the drinking, drugs, and dangerous friends he left in Chicago after they landed him handcuffed to a hospital bed. It worked until Homecoming night when he broke his sobriety and blacked out.One month later, Axl’s girlfriend Gloria tells him she’s pregnant, that he’s the father, and that it happened on the one night he can’t remember. And it’s all downhill from there: mandatory AA meetings, visits to his probation officer, and dealing with the stress of Gloria’s vicious rumors plus a visit from his Chicago friends. To top it all off, he’s forced into a project partnership with Gloria’s best friend Rory, a girl who kind of wants to kill him.A paternity suit, betrayals of trust, insurmountable loss—it’s basically the senior year from hell. After a while Axl starts to believe that not even proving that Gloria is lying will be enough to put his life back together again. But then hope appears from one of the last places he expects and he realizes he may finally be ready to trust someone with his heart.",
