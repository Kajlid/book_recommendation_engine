  "description": "Sweet Cinderella is forced to spend her days waiting on her cruel stepsisters and stepmother, almost forgetting that she, too, was once a fine young lady with handsome clothes and a soft bed to sleep in. But when Cinderella is left at home on the night of the Princes ball, her fairy godmother turns pumpkin into coach, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and Cinderellas rags into a beautiful ball gown. At the ball Cinderella secretly captures the heart of the Prince, but it is not until he finds the true owner of the delicate glass slipper that the two can live happily ever after.",
