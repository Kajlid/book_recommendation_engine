Diamonds over marriage.He might be the most successful jeweler of his generation, a loyal friend and some say the most handsome man in London, but his past means he doesn’t deal in love.When Hollie Lumen enters the ballroom where exquisite royal jewels are on display, she brings Dexter’s world to a screeching halt.

She knows the only person she can rely on is herself.So what’s she going to do about the tall, dark, handsome stranger who keeps rescuing her?She’s going to rescue him right back.Mr. Knightsbridge is a stand-alone romance.",
