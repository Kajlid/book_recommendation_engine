But first she has to help a friend.She must enter the lair of the Wolfe.Grace's timid friend is being forced to marry Dominic Wolfe, who stands to inherit a huge estate if he weds. The Wolfes have a terrible reputation, and if there's one thing Grace cannot stand, it's a bully. Her friend begs for help to escape this marriage, so Grace acts as the plain and mousy chaperone on their visit to the groom-to-be. But when they arrive, nothing is as they expect, and Grace is scandalized to find herself being pursued by a big, bad Wolfe with dishonorable intentions.",
