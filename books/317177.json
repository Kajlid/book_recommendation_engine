To be worthy she must complete two important trials…the awakening and the challenge. Taught to rule for the first twenty years of her life, Dyonara is unprepared when she discovers she must choose five male seeds from among a large stable of men, and worse, they will be come her mates! Having never seen a male up close within the queendom, she is thrown off kilter by the odd feelings they arouse, especially the one called Thrace.Captured by an Andromedin raiding party, Thrace finds himself enslaved by a race of man-hungry warrior women. To add to the humiliation of being taken, he finds his own strength is no match for the Andromedins. Now, offered up as a prize stallion for some pampered princess, Thrace fumes as he plots his escape. But when he lays eyes on the beautiful blonde his determination falters. Caught between his desire to return home and his growing desire to claim Dyonara, Thrace finds himself in a quandary as to what to do, and he’s not alone. Four other men are also vying to become her favorite. Confused by his own jealousy, Thrace vows to best them all and claim Dyonara as his own.As desires flare and passions burn between Dyonara and her seeds, rebellions arise among the enslaved within the palace walls, the outliers beyond the gates, and a jealous aunt intent on ousting Queen Patra and claiming the throne for herself. It’s a galactic game of thrones where the stakes couldn’t be higher. The crowning of Patra’s successor sets events into motion that will test their experiment in matriarchy and the mettle of the new queen-elect, Dyonara.Book one of four. 18+",
