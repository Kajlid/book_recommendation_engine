  "description": "\"But what if we can’t find Jude?\" He leans closer. His breath is warm on my ear. \"We will.\"\"How can you be so sure?\" I want to believe him so badly, but this is Rafa. The guy who’s all action and no plan. His smile is tired, knowing. An echo of a shared past I don’t remember. \"Because I’m not smart enough to give up, and you don’t know how to.\" Gaby Winters’ nightmares have stopped but she still can’t remember her old life. Still can’t quite believe she is one of the Rephaim—the wingless half-angels who can shift from place to place, country to country, in the blink of an eye. That she was once the Rephaim’s best fighter. That demons exist. That Rafa has stayed. But most of all, she can’t quite believe that her twin brother, Jude, might be alive. And Gaby can’t explain the hesitancy that sidetracks the search for him, infuriates Rafa, and sends them, again, into the darkest danger.",
