  "description": "Human Geography: Culture, Society and Space challenges students to think geographically across scale and across a wide range of geographical phenomena and global issues. The authors engage the students throughout the text by posing geographical questions that encourage students to think critically about their own locality, region, nation, and world. In the Eighth Edition, the authors reformat the text to 14 chapters, provide a clear outline of key questions for each chapter, integrate their own field experiences, and rewrite the text to guide students through answers to geographic questions. The Eighth Edition includes three new chapters: \"Identity: Race, Ethnicity and Gender,\" \"Local Culture, Popular Culture, and Cultural Landscapes,\" and \"Geographic Networks.\" The concepts of globalization, identity, development, sense of place, and construction of scale are infused throughout the text. The author team draws from studies in geography and across disciplines to bring a broad and up-to-date perspective on the kinds of research geographers have done and are currently doing on a wide range of human geography topics.In the Eighth Edition, de Blij and Murphy welcome new coauthor Erin Hogan Fouberg (South Dakota State University), who brings her expertise in geography education and political geography. The author team created a new pedagogy and writing style for the Eighth Edition that make the book more accessible to students and faculty.",
