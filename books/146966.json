  "description": "Dear Author,I would like a TPE tale. I’d like the characters to have some depth and this lovely boy looks to be a bit melancholy about something. I LOVE angst! There isn’t much on the BDSM spectrum that I don’t enjoy. I’m not picky about the setting-dystopian, paranormal, contemporary, tentacles whatever.Blow my mind please. :)Photo Description: A naked man lies on the floor in a dark space. He has a muscular build and several tattoos. A light shines down on him from above. He appears to be deep in thought and is holding one hand up so the light shines through his fingers.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story. This story may contain sexually explicit content and is intended for adult readers. It may contain content that is disagreeable or distressing to some readers. The M/M Romance Group strongly recommends that each reader review the General Information section before each story for story tags as well as for content warnings.",
