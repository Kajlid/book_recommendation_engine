  "description": "Billie initially regrets giving up a fine Saturday to be dragged off to film her boy friend Chris's music video, but she finds it impossible to say no to his infectious enthusiasm. While she arranges the rest of the band before the camera, Chris disappears to change his clothes. When Chris returns in a blonde wig, pumps, and very tight skirt, the band members collapse into hysterics, but Billie's not laughing. Quite the opposite. There's something almost obscene about his gooey pink lips, and the excitement she feels proves even more incendiary. How can she carry on filming when all she wants to do is throw Chris on the floor and have her way with him?",
