  "description": "THIS EDITION IS THE 2002 EDITION. Nathanial Bowditch first published this encyclopedic work in 1802. During the last two centuries over 75 editions, almost 1,000,000 copies, of Bowditch have been published by the US Government. It has lived because it has combined the best technologies of each generation of navigator. This edition includes the latest advances in electronic navigation and digital charting technology. It also covers non-electronic navigation such as celestial, plotting and dead reckoning. Bowditch contains numerous tables which have been valued for years by practicing navigators. Bowditch is carried on the bridge of every U.S. Navy ship and should be the mainstay of any serious navigator's library.",
