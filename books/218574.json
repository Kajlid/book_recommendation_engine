  "description": "Alice Munro's territory is the farms and semi-rural towns of south-western Ontario. In these dazzling stories she deals with the self-discovery of adolescence, the joys and pains of love and the despair and guilt of those caught in a narrow existence. And in sensitively exploring the lives of ordinary men and women, she makes us aware of the universal nature of their fears, sorrows and aspirations.Contents- Walker Brothers Cowboy- The Shining Houses- Images- Thanks for the Ride- The Office- An Ounce of Cure- The Time of Death- Day of the Butterfly- Boys and Girls- Postcard- Red Dress -1946- Sunday Afternoon- A Trip to the Coast- The Peace of Utrecht- Dance of the Happy Shades",
