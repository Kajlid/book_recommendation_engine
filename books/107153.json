  "description": "If something is plausible, it's reasonable or believable.Giving a deceptive impression of truth and reliability at such an early age is certain to cause you to believe what isn’t real. Aquilla Chavez was raised by a loving father and a brother who may have loved her a little too much. Aquilla was spoiled and adored, bringing cheer when disaster threatened a family. She was exposed to a life of crime, all while lovingly being sheltered and protected from it. Will she ever reclaim the one man who she believes to be the love of her life? She didn’t want to be where she was forced to be. She wanted nothing to do with the person she was involuntary turned into. Aquilla had one goal - one goal that would save her from the catastrophic life she was suddenly thrown into. She had to find him. She had to try, or was this the plausibility of a life she was meant to have? Was the life she was torn from the disastrous life? Could this be where she was meant to be? How would she ever know? What if he found her? What if she never saw him again? What if.... she didn’t want to? If you are into lovey dovey, sappy romance, you should probably move on. This book contains explicit sex, drugs, and adult language. Not your typical every day romance.",
