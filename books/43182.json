  "description": "Young Irish couple Fergal and Brídgeen Griffin didn't think that their cousin Colm O'Brien's wedding gift—managing a winery in New York's Finger Lakes for him—was charity. When the demise of the Celtic Tiger—Ireland's economic generator—threatens Colm's funding of Loughmare Winery, the Griffins realize suddenly how dependent their future is on his generosity. Colm sets a deadline for them to increase the winery's profit; it collides with the June wedding date of the Griffins' best friends, Maeve Kenny and Andy Krall. Unaware of the coming conflict, Maeve and Andy give the Griffins a barn owl box with a webcam to celebrate Loughmare's current successes. As they and the world tune in to watch an owl couple raise its brood, all realize there is much to be learned from a wisdom of owls.",
