  "description": "Madison Phillips needs a husband fast. Someone who can put on the performance of his life…someone tall, dark and temporary. According to her grandfather's trust, she must marry before she turns thirty if she wants to inherit millions of dollars. Otherwise, the money will go to her cousin, Heather. Jackson Lang, a thirty-four-year-old self-made millionaire, lost his father when he and his little brother were toddlers. With a sickly mother who was underpaid and over worked, Jackson was left to care for his younger brother. He grew up believing that the good things in life went to those with money and power…those who took control…those who worked a little harder than the next guy. Jackson is mourning the death of Walter Garrett, a man who took him and his brother under his wing, when Walter's widow, Heather, asks Jackson for a favor. Madison and Jackson must convince family and friends that they are in love. Not an easy feat considering they don’t even like one another.",
