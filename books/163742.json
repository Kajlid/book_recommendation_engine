More treacherous than bomb bugs or sight scamps, though, is a human seeking vengeance. Soon Taro's students are dropping one by one, and no matter what Taro does, the killer stays a step ahead. Worst of all, Taro comes to suspect that the students are targets of opportunity—that the ultimate goal is Rafe.Taro would die for Rafe in a heartbeat, but who's going to take care of Rafe if he does?As it happens, the killer has a plan for that, too.",
