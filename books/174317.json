  "title": "The Thomas the Tank Engine Man: The life of Reverend W. Awdry",
  "description": "The enchanting biography of Reverend W. Awdry, a devoted pastor and family man, who adored trains. He started to tell stories about Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends, in order to entertain his son Christopher. Those stories have gone on to entertain generations of children around the world. A convinced pacifist, Awdry was thrown out of one curacy and denied another during the Second World War, because of his beliefs. He was a man of courage, who believed that you should live by certain rules. He built his imaginary world on the island of Sodor on these rules, and showed how those who transgressed them would always be 'punished, but never scrapped', as he said. The Thomas the Tank Engine Man is a charming biography and a fascinating insight into the life of Reverend W. Awdry.",
