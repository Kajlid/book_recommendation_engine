Author Patrick Lencioni—noted screenplay writer and sought-after executive coach -- deftly tells the tale of a young CEO who, facing his first annual board review, knows he is failing, but doesn't know why. \"This book provides extraordinary insight into the pitfalls that leaders face when they lose sight of the true measure of success: results.
