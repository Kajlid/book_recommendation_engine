  "description": "Perfection. How I hated that word although it described me perfectly.

Neither male nor female and with my thirtieth birthday looming, my life was in drastic need of something beyond the potential I was born with.I don't care much for the fact that the genetic manipulation long ago to save the human race on Earth, had limited my options of a loving relationship.You see, I am in love with someone fe/male like me, and there was no chance that such a relationship was possible. Or was there?",
