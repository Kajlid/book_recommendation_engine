  "description": "Joelle unknowingly unlocked a portal to a demon- The Skin Stalker- who wants to vanquish her humanity and create a new demon hybrid with her using her former lover, Colin. Although she tried to forget him, Colin continued to break her heart from a distance, making her vulnerable. The Skin Stalker began brutally murdering Colin's \"girlfriends\", setting him up as the prime suspect-but does Joelle really care if Colin rotted away in jail?Using a softball equipment bag and public dumping grounds, The Skin Stalker morbidly disposed of his victims, celebrating the notoriety, and his ability to stump the police. A unique blue \"tattoo\" behind Joelle's ear carries the key to her connection to the paranormal realm. Can an average woman actually conquer a demon?Set around the backdrop of the beautiful Rocky Mountains and Denver, Colorado, Blue Ink takes you inside the mind of a demon and the woman who must stop him.",
