  "description": "The year is 1912, and Lady Amelia Williams is one of the wealthiest women in Manchester, England and mother to the lovely Abigail. When James Thomas, the son of a family who has recently moved to the countryside, is invited to dine at the Williams manor, he encounters the secret that Amelia has long kept hidden behind the walls of her home: a woman enslaved into servitude and beautiful beyond words but donned in rags and treated in the cruelest, most appalling way. Her name is Magdalena, and one look into her eyes, so full of pain and sadness, is enough to capture James's heart. A story of tragedy, sorrow, loss and love, how much can two souls endure when there are those bent on tearing them apart?",
