  "description": "If the cabbage man doesn't arrive soon, another meal will slip by and the king will still be allowed to exude foul breath from his lips. While the pastry chef and the royal food taster plot in the kitchen, the butcher keeps a close eye on their plans. And don’t forget the sausage-lipped prime minister… he’s got a secret buried in that mustache, no doubt about that. Thus is the thrilling quagmire of regicide and culinary espionage of Kill the King. Read on for this darkly comic tale and eight others, if you dare... You'll find a mix of suspenseful action-packed short stories such as: the tale of an assassin out to kill his target: his former high school rival.Or quirky and funny stories: the tale of three washed-up and mostly-useless superheroes trying to save the life of a choking man at a deli.And tales of the absurd: the debut author whose great literary work becomes something horrible by a reality TV-loving focus group.",
