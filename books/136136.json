But his flirtation is cut short when criminals burst into the bank and shoot her right before his eyes. In attempt to administer first aid, Brody reveals a tattoo on his back. A mark that will drag him and the girl into the kind of situation he was trying to get away from. But he can’t walk away because he’s the only thing capable of keeping Taylor alive and bringing down the guys who shot her—guys who are seriously dangerous. This book can be read as a stand-alone.",
