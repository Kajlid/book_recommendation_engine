  "title": "Claiming the Prince: Part One",
  "description": "After seven years exiled in the human world, Magda is thrust back into the Pixie Lands, caught up in a deadly competition. At stake, the right to rule her family’s province and a shot at the Crown. But to have any hope of succeeding, she’ll need a Prince at her side. Rare as Princes are, she manages to find three—none of them ideal. One is worthless. One makes Magda promise not to claim him. And the other is . . . well, the enemy. As if fighting dragons and manticores isn't hard enough, Magda must also contend with her own desires or risk losing, not just her life, but her heart too. Claiming the Prince is a serial in six parts.",
