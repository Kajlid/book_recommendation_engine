  "description": "Maybe he should have said no. This case… it isn’t what he bargained for. He didn’t want this. He wasn’t ready for what it’s become. It should have been just another case, a final ‘hurrah’ before retirement and days spent fishing. No mistakes they said. Maybe they see him as expendable… a scapegoat should things go wrong. Maybe he was a fool to believe he had secured away the pain and that time had healed the wounds. But he can’t let her down. He can’t fail… not again. The heat in New Orleans is intense along the water’s edge. Swamps and bayous mark the city—a city of division. Megan Callahan is the city’s top criminal defense attorney. Her aggressive courtroom tactics have garnered her no love within the NOPD. Detective Albert Harris is a man for whom injustice became personal four years ago. He blames the system. He blames defense attorneys. He blames himself. When Megan crosses Harris’ justice line, she becomes first an enemy, and then his responsibility. From behind her cast-iron persona, Megan silently fights demons, while pursuing love in unconventional ways. When that quest leads to a bloody betrayal, it will shake both Megan and Harris’ polarized worlds. The line between personal and professional lives blurs as Megan faces demons she thought she had banished and Harris confronts fears he never knew he had. The truth he seeks, and the truth that seeks him, is buried deep within her wounded heart. With Megan trapped in a whirlpool of fear, compassion trumps bitterness as Harris becomes her lifeline of hope and she… his path to redemption.",
