But it's hard to get noticed on a planet of billions. To speed things up, Devi takes a job aboard the Glorious Fool, an trade ship so dangerous that one year of service on its security team counts as five anywhere else. The ship's terrible record doesn't worry Devi at first, but when the captain starts sending her into impossibly dangerous situations no trader should ever get into, she beings to suspect that the Glorious Fool's problems are more than bad luck. But with her career on the line, Devi's determined to keep her nose down, despite her growing concern about the captain's strange missions, his creepy silent daughter, and the ship's insufferably sexy cook, Rupert Charkov, who is definitely more than what he seems. Maybe even more than human.With the mysteries piling up and life on the Fool getting more dangerous by the second, Devi's knows she's going to have to get some answers fast, before all the secrets send her home in a body bag.",
