  "description": "Residents of a charming, quaint, maritime village on Lake Ontario are shocked when they learn that another murder has occurred in their bucolic coastal town, this time in an historic cemetery where the casualties of the War of 1812 are buried. Yet again, the murder hits close to home - the victim is a childhood friend of Ed DeCleryk, the criminal consultant hired by police chief Carrie Ramos to investigate the crime.During the investigation Ed and his wife, Annie, who is the head of the local historical society, travel to London, England and during a visit to a museum there discover a collection of artifacts dating back to the early 1800s with one missing piece - a link to the reason for George's untimely death.This clean fiction novel contains no graphic violence, explicit intimate scenes, or cursing, but there are lots of exciting twists and turns, an historical subplot and a surprise ending. Helping Ed discover secrets that have risen from the grave and the reason for his friend's murder doesn't deter Annie from cooking for friends and family, and the book offers gourmet recipes she prepares for them.",
