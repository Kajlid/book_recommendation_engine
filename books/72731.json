Appointed regent, she must preserve the Kingdom of Arianrhod until Fionn’s son is old enough to take the throne.Motivated by duty and love for her family, strong-willed Aislin has worked for eleven years to maintain the peace and prosperity of her kingdom. That idyll is shattered when Prince Jariath of Morrigan invades Arianrhod with a formidable army and a single purpose: to force her to marry him. Barely escaping him, Aislin flees with a friend into neighboring Blackthorne Forest. The forest is dark, dangerous, and uncivilized. It’s also the shortest way to the Kingdom of Wyndham and the help she needs. Blackthorne Forest is also full of surprises. Captured by hooded men and taken into the heart of the forest, Aislin will soon forge an unexpected alliance with a being she never dreamed existed.Follow Aislin as she fights to save her kingdom and herself:\"Jariath…please…please don’t…”“Oh dear, are you going to cry? Poor Princess Aislin, who thinks she can save the world,” he taunted in a singsong voice before he lowered it to a snarl. “I’ve beaten you, bitch. I’ve won. When will you understand that no one tells me no?”“And when will you understand that I will never tell you yes?” She shouted it across the room, fists clenched, her fingernails digging painful half-circles in her palms.Adventure, Fantasy, Paranormal Romance, Older Heroine.",
