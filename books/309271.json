I’ve made a career around it and dedicated my adult life to it.

Because, even as just a surrogate, I had to wonder: Would he still want me when he learned I was pregnant with another man’s baby? Would he wait out the nine months to be with me? And even more important, how could I ask him to?Not Turning Back is book 4 in the Breaking the Rules Series and meant for a mature reading audience.",
