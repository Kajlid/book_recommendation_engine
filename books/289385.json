HERWhen my father runs up too much debt, I pay the price.I’ve been sold.Sold to a man who vows to break me.A man who keeps his face hidden from me, even as his dark desires awaken mine.It wasn’t my debt to pay, but he took me, anyway.He said he would have his payment, even if it cost me my soul.HIMI run the club.If someone steps out of line, they either work for me or disappear.But when a local man runs up too much debt, I take his daughter as payment.She is mine to do with as I please.I will have her completely; mind, body, and soul.Nothing would please me more than breaking her.I didn’t think I would feel for her.I didn’t think I could love again.Now I might be the one who ends up broken.",
