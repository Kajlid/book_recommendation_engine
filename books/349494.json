  "title": "Salem Brownstone: All Along the Watchtowers",
  "description": "A mundane life takes a strange and magical turn in this rich gothic fantasy told with vivid black-and-white art -- a graphic novel perfect for a Halloween night. As he twists the key and slowly creeps into the grand mansion left to him in his father's will, Salem Brownstone has an eerie feeling that his world is about to change. First there's the appearance of a beguiling contortionist from Dr. Kinoshita's Circus of Unearthly Delights . . . then a crystal ball . . . then an attack by the sinister Shadow Boys. It seems the father that Salem never knew was actually a powerful magician, and the son has inherited his dark legacy -- and an unfinished battle for life or death. With intriguing echoes of Tim Burton, Edward Gorey, H. P. Lovecraft, and Aubrey Beardsley, this album-format, beautifully cloth-bound graphic novel forges a mesmerizing style all its own.\"Wonderfully imaginative and stylish. . . . A perfect example of the adventurous new directions that comic books should be taking in the future.\" -- Alan Moore, author of WATCHMEN and V FOR VENDETTA",
