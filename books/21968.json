  "description": "James Joyce has been hailed as one of the great literary rebels of our time. He rebelled against social and literary conventions, against Catholicism, and against Dublin, the city at the center of this magnificent collection of stories.In Dubliners, Joyce paints vivid portraits of the denizens of the city of his birth, from the young boy encountering death in the fist story, “The Sisters,” to the middle-aged Gabriel of the haunting final story, “The Dead.” This collection is both unflinchingly realistic portrait of “dear dirty Dublin” and, as Joyce himself explained, a window through which his countrymen could get “one good look at themselves.”",
