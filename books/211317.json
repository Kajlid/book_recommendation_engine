  "title": "Trouble For Master Jerico: Masters Of The Haven",
  "description": "When Anne was invited to her best friends' wedding and collaring ceremonies, she found out she could only attend if she agreed to have a \"handler,\" during the ceremonies. WHY she needed a \"handler\" during those ceremonies, at \"The Haven,\" a local BDSM club, sent Annes' mind reeling... and fantasizing. With no man in her life for several years, the stories her friend told about what happened at \"The Haven,\" had given Anne shivers... shivers of the best kind, and some really great fantasies.When Anne saw Jerico, her \"handler,\" for the first time, she thought he was the most gorgeous man she had ever seen. There was no doubt he was an \"alpha male,\" but he was also kind and considerate, with a naughty sense of humor. Anne decided her best friend had chosen her \"handler\" well.As Jerico tried to keep Anne quiet during the collaring ceremony, he realized he needed to get her outside and calm her down. Perp-walking her through the door, Jerico started to trip, and Anne shoved him. Jerico landed on his ass... to the amusement of several wedding guests that watched out the windows. \"That just got you five swats,\" Jerico growled. Anne was shocked when she was told she either had to leave immediately, and miss the actual wedding ceremony of her best friend, or submit to being spanked by Jerico; who told her, \"I'll let you leave your panties on, and I'll go easy on you.\"",
