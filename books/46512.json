  "description": "Someone wants dearly beloved philanthropist Agnes Henley to die. Never mind that thirty years ago, she committed murder in order to inherit a family fortune. When Agnes is found dead, Police Chief Harold Donovan doesn't believe that anyone in the Henley household would want to harm the highly esteemed lady, except perhaps Marcel, the fake French chef. When another murder occurs in the prestigious home, Donovan is convinced that Marcel is the murderous mastermind behind the killings. But is Donovan on the right track? Will he solve the murders before another occurs?",
