  "description": "Colin is not who he claims to be... His position as the blacksmith of Clan Chattan is simply a cover, a means to an end. He was sent with one mission; find Jacobite loyalists and eliminate their threat. But that’s not what keeps him up at night, or what burns hotter than his forge. The most dangerous threat is one of his own making; falling in love. Arywnn knows someone is watching her... In her dreams he’s handsome, braw, and willing to take her away from her reclusive mother and tyrant laird father. But her daydreams are a frivolity she cannot afford, not while a spy lurks within their clan. Worse yet, her father has promised her hand to whomever discovers the blackguard. A midnight meeting... A whispered kiss... And a rogue English knight all change the course of destiny in a way neither could have ever imagined. Colin must play a dangerous game, but the prize is worth the risk; Arywnn’s heart",
