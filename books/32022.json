  "description": "Life's hard. People make it harder. They tether you to them. Make it difficult to breathe, and damn-near impossible to leave...Seventeen-year-old Abby Rhoades knows this all too well. Born to a mother who could never love her and who vacillates between a sloppy drunk and a suicidal maniac, Abby's never had it easy. But Abby can swim. And Abby has a plan--win the state championship, earn a free ride to Penn State, and leave her small town and suffocating mother behind.But then Tom Ford, her mother's latest boyfriend and a man Abby adored, washes up along the shore of the Susquehanna River. His injuries suggest murder and suspicion quickly falls on Abby then on her best friend Garrett Scott, both of whom saw Tom the night he died.They both know what happened that night, but neither one is talking. There's too much at stake and the truth could tear them apart.",
