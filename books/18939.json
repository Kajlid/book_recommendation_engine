SEX, a novel by Sandra Nachlinger and Sandra Allen.When June, Kiki, and Peggy graduated from high school, all of them were still virgins. After all, they were good girls. Years later, when the three women read June's diary from their senior year, they joke about the sexual frustration they caused their steady boyfriends back then. That's when Kiki makes a startling statement. \"When you think about it, and I'm only trying to be fair, we owe those guys sex.\" With bawdy jabs and tipsy laughter, they vow to track down their old boyfriends and just DO IT, which is something they definitely did NOT do years before.Lives intertwined, the three friends share their quests with sexy, poignant, and sometimes hilarious results. Is each woman's sexual I.O.U. paid in full? Will everyone get what he or she deserves? Or is this just another one of Kiki's crazy ideas?",
