  "description": "THREE TIMES THE MAGIC EQUALS THREE TIMES THE FUN All three of E. Nesbit's delightful fantasies about the \"Five Children\" gathered together in one convenient ebook. In each, five children (Robert, Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and \"the baby\") stumble on something magical. \"Resulting inevitably in a totally delightful chaos,\" according to the Reader's Guide to Fantasy. \"The children are wonderfully real - given a magic carpet their inventive mischief with such an object is awe-inspiring,\" the Reader's Guide continues. \"Nesbit's magic is most original, hinting at great wonder and strangeness!\" The guide also calls the Five Children Trilogy, Nesbit's \"best work.\" You will see why when you read about what happens when the Five Children discover an amulet in the form of a horseshoe that grows until it becomes a gateway through which the children can enter the past and future, and the unintended affect their new-found magic ring has the maid! Here is a long-recognized classic that mixes fantasy and humor. Nesbit's world will enthrall and enchant and delight you all at once.",
