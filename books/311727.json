  "title": "Hunter's Heart",
  "description": "My life is in a tailspin. My soul hijacked by a demon, and my power is out of control. With so many dangers around every corner, even being the heir to the Dominance Coven can't save me from the forces at work. Being pulled in two different directions by my heart just makes everything so much worse. With deceptions at each turn, and traitors still amongst us, can I trust the demon who showed me his darkest side, or do I trust the hunter who already broke my heart once before? Except my heart isn't the only thing at risk here, and what if I'm the one no one should trust?",
