  "description": "Enjoy another “exhilarating roller-coaster ride of unusual cases” (Publishers Weekly) in this second book of the Ravi PI series, featuring detective Ravi Chandra Singh and his team at the gleefully amoral, unfailingly dangerous secret agency Golden Sentinels.When Ravi’s colleagues at Golden Sentinels discover that he sees gods in moments of heightened anxiety and stress, they are surprisingly fine with it. They even encourage him to incorporate his visions into his work, especially now that the cases have become more intense, with many hidden risks at play. But their latest case—a search for a dead Russian oligarch’s last will and testament—leads to more than anyone a missing heir, murderous relatives, and geopolitical implications. So, when Ravi’s boss sends him to Los Angeles to wait out the heat, it’s almost a relief…until Ravi’s past catches up to him. In this thrilling and complex sequel to the “exciting and dynamic” (Deepak Chopra) Her Nightly Embrace, nothing is what it seems, as Ravi ends up on the run in Los Angeles with a car full of stolen guns and chased by killers as the city is surrounded by a ring of fire.",
