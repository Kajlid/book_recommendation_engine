  "description": "Zach Nikolas isn't a typical high school boy--no acne, no awkwardness for this high school god among boys. Gorgeous, charming, and athletic, every girl in school throws herself at him. Zach's parents, friends, and teachers worship the ground he walks on. He has never known want or sacrifice in his charmed life. He is on top of the world. Things in Zach's perfect life begin to go horribly wrong. A murder attempt and a miraculous escape from certain death leads Zach to unheard-of powers, as an angry god seeks vengeance. The one girl Zach can't have--the beautiful, intelligent Allie Connor, who hates his guts--is the key to everything. When myths become reality, Zach must decide to sacrifice the girl he loves or let the world come to a fiery end.",
