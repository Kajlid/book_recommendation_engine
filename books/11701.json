  "description": "Dedicated veterinarian Hope Highfield is always rescuing creatures in need, whether they be abandoned or sick animals, lost teenagers, or lonely senior citizens who wear hightop sneakers. She will go to any length for a cause. But self-made and assertive Noah Brandywine has no intention of being rescued. In fact, he would like to throttle the adorable little woman who has practically brought his multi-million dollar corporation to a screeching halt by implying that Brandywine Beauty Products may be engaging in unethical animal testing. Nothing in his life has ever mattered more than building his corporate empire—until he has to match wits with Hope Highfield. Is he falling in love with this pint-sized instigator? What will she think when he has to admit that he is petrified of animals—from baby kittens and a mammoth dog, to an errant goat who seems to have a hankering for him? To protect animals from pain and suffering, Hope is willing to risk danger and destruction. What is Noah willing to risk to earn her love and faith?",
