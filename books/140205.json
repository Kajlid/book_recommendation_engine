  "title": "#Betrayal: a Nuclear Fiction Novel of Survival",
  "description": "March 11, 2014, marked the third anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. My first fiction novel (published originally in hardcover), “The Nuclear Catastrophe”, predicted that this type nuclear incident was going to happen. But not only has the accident validated what terrible things can happen, others are now writing and saying the same thing:“Fukushima is not a Japanese nuclear accident – it is a nuclear accident that happened to occur in Japan. The problems that caused the Fukushima accident exist wherever these type reactors operate.”Now we are finishing year three after the accident. Many of the several hundred thousand evacuated people are still living in cubicles in warehouses, with no possessions. Financial aid is being cut off. And no cleanup has been achieved. Radioactive water massively leaks from the destroyed plants into the ocean. The heavily forested areas of Japan have radioactive dust throughout the tree foliage, with rain washing down this dust, spreading contamination. There is no where to dispose of radioactive soil, so it is bagged and abandoned. The government seems unconcerned.For this reason I have written a fictional sequel to “The Nuclear Catastrophe” called “#Betrayal”.  Is the aftermath of the accident worse than the accident itself? It is set in Japan and Southern California. The characters' lives intertwine with lies, greed, murder, and power struggles. Whom should you trust?",
