  "description": "Valley Forge was a dark time for General Washington. Not because it was a harsh frigid winter, nor that it was the lowest point for the rebels in the war against England, but because when the moon was full George Washington roamed the frozen landscape as a werewolf... If you liked \"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter\" and \"Pride & Prejudice & Zombies\" then you'll love \"George Washington Werewolf\"!",
