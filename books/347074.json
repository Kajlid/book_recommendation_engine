  "description": "This story entitled \"Nasteneer\" (?) by Tagore is about a betrayal. It is considered to be semi-autobiographical. When first published by Tagore in 1901, it offended many of the intelligentsia. However, the dignified presentation by Tagore of forbidden love, without soiling it in any manner, delighted appreciative readers. Today this has become a great work read throughout the world. When presented as \"Charulatha\" by the great Satyajit Ray, its fame grew many-fold. Besides Indian languages, the story has been translated into many global languages as well.
