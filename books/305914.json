  "description": "Asher Owens. Gorgeous. Arrogant. Liar. It’s been ten years since Asher left me with nothing but the remains of our shattered dreams.  The last place I expected to see him was at a small bar in a city of over eight million. With my heart set on expanding my business, I needed one of New York City’s best real estate executives. Little did I know it would be the same man who had torn my heart like a piece of paper before setting it on fire.  Once my gaze lands on his, I know Asher is no longer the boy I loved when I was eighteen. No, this Asher treated me like a stranger. All for the sake of not wanting to sift through the ashes of our past.  Yet Asher’s arrogance rivaled any sort of rejection, even mine. Using his own selfish ambition, he needed me to claw his way to the top. Despite his true motives, I had foolishly let him back in.  I’d fallen in love with Asher Owens once before and this time I would try my best not to make the same mistake twice.",
