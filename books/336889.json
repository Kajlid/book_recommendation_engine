  "description": "Kieran Quinn is a Texas native transplanted to Manhattan and working as a columnist for a national magazine. He's famous for his snarky, sardonic columns, but deep down he's more interested in what makes people tick than his editor would like. He keeps his desire to find his own Mr. Right hidden under a sexy, carefree persona that favors champagne and underwear models of the male variety.When Kieran goes to Texas to cover the latest wedding of a real-life \"runaway bride,\" he falls hard for the gorgeous—and straight—groom. Jaxon Lang is the handsome, confident high school principal in a tiny Texas town, where he relocated from Dallas to pursue his relationship with a woman he thinks he wants to settle down with, despite the fact she's left three men at the altar before him.Kieran's charm and unique attitudes about sex and attraction soon challenge Jaxon's concept of what--and who--he wants. Will anything change when Kieran discovers the bride's been keeping a shocking secret?",
