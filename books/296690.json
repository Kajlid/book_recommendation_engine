This is how culture has raised us. They have a lack of understanding, a lack of resources, they are more shameful to admit to being abused by a woman and the mental health industry is hyper-feminized.Acknowledging male abuse victims does not take away from female abuse victims. It is not a gender issue; it is a people issue. Women can be abused too; this is not a competition! However, female narcissists are greatly underrepresented in the healing community of narcissistic abuse. \nIf there were not a lot of female narcissists, there would not be so many narcissistic mothers!\n Narcissistic women are highly destructive, horribly abusive, often extremely covert and can ruin another person. Furthermore, men tend to have a lack of resources. As a result, many good men decide that they are not going to be around women anymore. Narcissistic women are destructive, and men have labeled all women based on their individual experience with usually one or maybe two women in their life. Men are not supported and even the online community let them alone. Here is the main issue. Before this book, men victims of narcissistic women have not been considered the way they deserve, and female narcissists have not been represented the way they should be. \nIf you are an empathic man you have a harder time because of the way society is, but this book will finally help you to get rid of your toxic relationship and healing from narcissistic abuse.\n\nIf you need to start changing your life, Scroll Up and Click on the \"Buy Now\" button!",
