  "description": "When Maribel Ibañez inherited the crumbling old mansion in True Springs, PA, she knew it was her chance to turn it into a Bed and Breakfast. Running her own place was her lifelong dream, and she’s not letting anything get in her way. As far as anyone in True Springs knows, she’s a confident, assertive businesswoman with ambition to spare. What they don’t know about what goes on inside her brain is none of their business.Jory Meier is one half of a jazz duo about to hit the big time, but his partner’s increasingly erratic behavior is making it hard for him to stick around. Life on the road has been tough, and when they stop in at the True Springs Jazz Fest, he feels like he belongs. He’ll never put up with another emotional woman again. Not that it would come up - who would be interested in an almost-famous trumpet man?",
