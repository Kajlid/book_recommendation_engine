  "description": "Hungry are the dead, unable to be sated. Still their nation grows. -Winifred Lewis Every culture has its tales of ghosts and ghoulies, dead things that stalk the night to prey upon the living. Stories of these creatures have been told around campfires from time immemorial, lending an added chill to the darkness beyond. They have been the subject of countless songs and poems. What is it that the living find so fascinating about the living dead? That is a question we'll leave you to answer. We're just happy to add to the mythology in this collection of poetry and short stories featuring \"zombies, vampires, ghosts, and other dead things that want to eat you.\"",
