  "description": "Trapped in a concrete room beneath the headquarters of an international crime organization, four middle-aged high school classmates find themselves caught in a web of espionage and intrigue that threatens their lives and those of everyone they know. When the undercover agents first approached Melanie Tyler and Kathleen O’Brian the night of their 30th high school reunion, the women could never have imagined that the innocent 60’s television spy show game they had played nearly four decades ago, would become a real life confrontation with one of the most insidious criminal minds of their generation.",
