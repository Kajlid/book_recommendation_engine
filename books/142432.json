  "title": "Target Underwear and a Vera Wang Gown: Notes from a Single Girl's Closet",
  "description": "The story of a young woman's life, one outfit at a time. Tucked inside the fibers and buttons and pockets of the clothing in our closets are the stories of our lives, the lessons we've learned, the people we've loved. Like so many of us, Adena Halpern has used clothes to conform, to seduce, to console, to show off, and to hide. Her ability to relate fashion to her inner life in a way that is about so much more than just the clothes has endeared her to many readers, one of whom called her the real-life Carrie Bradshaw.But fashionista, she's not. Adena is: every teenage girl who had to have what all the other girls had, whether it looked good on her or not; the college coed who swooned for the boy in the leather jacket; the heartbroken young woman who chose a rebound dress over a rebound man; the woman who is forty-five minutes late to work because she has a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear. She is a lover of clothes and shopping whose passionate memories are always tied to not only the clothes that she wore, but to what everyone else was wearing, too. This is the affectionate and funny story of Adena's life, an unconventional love story that readers will want to share. You will never look at your own wardrobe the same way again.",
