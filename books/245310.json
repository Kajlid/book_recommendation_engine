  "description": "Winner of the 2018 Sheehan YA Book Prize, BORROWED is a genre-bending thriller that will take you to unexpected places.Rejection is never easy. But 17-year-old Linnea discovers it’s infinitely harder when it’s your own heart that does the rejecting. Nearing the one-year anniversary of her successful heart transplant, she starts to get the eerie sense that the donor is trying to reclaim the gift…and hijack her life. Clinging to the self she’s always known does nothing to push back the intrusive memories and cryptic messages that threaten her identity and her sanity. Maxine, on the other hand, suffers from a broken heart; she's plagued by guilt over giving her sister's heart away when she was declared brain-dead after an accident. The girls' lives intersect where they least expect it...and the heart is the key to solving a mystery that ended one life and saved another.",
