  "description": "𝐋𝐀𝐊𝐄 𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐑𝐋𝐈𝐆𝐇𝐓 𝐁𝐔𝐙𝐙 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐒 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄: Rumor around town is a certain matriarch of the Bailey family is having a 𝐁𝐈𝐆 𝐁𝐈𝐑𝐓𝐇𝐃𝐀𝐘! It’s even spurred a few of the Bailey kids to return home to celebrate with their beloved great-grandmother, Dori. In fact, now that there are twenty-six Bailey great-grandchildren the event is going to be overflowing with laughter and love. Also… I heard that Piper & Rayne have been speaking to some of the kids (i.e. Calista, Maverick, Easton, Brinley and Palmer) and so we’re getting some special POV’s. I can’t wait to report my findings the day after the party!",
