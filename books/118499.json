  "description": "In Katie Rose's delightful eBook original novella set in Victorian New York City, a remarkable woman with the gift of second sight must learn to trust her visions while following her heart.  Blond, angelic Penelope Appleton possesses breathtaking looks--and a troublesome secret. She and her two charming--and newly married--sisters have inspired quite a following posing as spiritualists. However, unlike her clever sisters, Penelope actually \"does\" glimpse the future. On the eve of her coming out at a Christmas ball, Penelope sees a vision of a rakishly handsome dark-haired man who she knows is her destiny. But her premonition comes with a terrible price: She also foretells his death.  Jared Marton takes one look at Penelope and his fate is sealed. He must possess her, heart and soul, even if his efforts to get close to this ethereal beauty are thwarted by her determination to deny the magic between them . . . until a perfect kiss dissolves all barriers to sweet surrender. But when Jared discovers the burden she carries, a perfect love is challenged by the cold winds of fate. Praise for \"Mistletoe and Magic\"\" \" \"A lovely bit of Christmas romance with love at first sight.\"--\"La Deetda Reads\" Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from the Loveswept title \"A Hint of Mischief.\"",
