As a teenager he was promoting major rock gigs. He was Billy Bragg's driver and roadie one day and presenting Whistle Test and Live Aid the next. A passionate music enthusiast, he is a man with an obsessive curiosity about the world. Over a twenty-five year career, he has worked for the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen, shared an office with John Peel and amassed a record collection that weighs seven tons. He has won more Sony Radio awards than any other broadcaster. He has visited 97 countries and as a foreign correspondent, filed numerous reports for Radio 4. He was also one of the few journalists present during the Rwanda genocide.     The past few years have seen him go through a turbulent time in his personal life, but he has put this behind him, written his story and returned to the airwaves fronting the BBC's Music Planet series.     Rebel. Maverick. Music fanatic. Andy Kershaw shares the story of his life with candour, insight, immediacy and incredible humour.",
