  "description": "Rupert Brooke was a man of his time, just not the man that Winston Churchill and the early Brooke Trustees made him out to be. He was delivered a serious disservice by being labeled a \"war poet,\" and was dealt further injustice when critics dismissed his poetry as detached from his life experience. This volume begins with a new introduction by Keith Hale tying Brooke's early poems to his Rugby romantic friendships and discussing Brooke's sexuality in some detail. The Collected Poems and Letters from America are then presented in their entirety together with the original introduction to the letters by Henry James.",
