Althea and Landon have been friends since childhood and are near inseparable, but the clock is ticking and pressure is building from their family to find their destined mate and finally commit.  But when the young boy that Althea has known all her life suddenly morphs into the imposing and handsome Alpha Landon, she finds herself drawn to him more than ever before and looking away from other potential suitors.  With their parents pushing to keep them apart and obstacles mounting around them, Althea knows that her and Landon are not naturally destined to be each otherâ€™s mate, but can fate be changed in the quest for true love?",
