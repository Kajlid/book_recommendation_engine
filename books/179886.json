  "description": "Morgan Falk thought his life was over. He stood up for his brothers and got himself a one way ticket to the Alpha’s personal underground bunker of hell. No one left the bunker alive. Morgan endured six long years of torture and torment at the hands of the Alpha’s sadistic enforcers and a gamma wolf with a sexual attraction to blood. Morgan sincerely thought he would never know a happy moment again, resigning himself to a painful death. All that changed when the bunker door cracked open, bathing the dungeon in sunlight and the smell of his one, true forever mate. Morgan, weak as he was, knew that rescue had come - and they say lives don’t have second acts.  Dr. Nick Barkley had all but given up on finding his forever mate. As doctor for the Rue Pack, he had spent his life on the sidelines, helping others and watching them find their happiness. All of this changed when he looked into a dank underground bunker and found his mate, barely clinging to life. Nick is determined to see his mate happy and healthy again, but six years of torture isn’t something that leaves a person - mental and emotional scars sometimes never heal as our physical body becomes whole again. Can Morgan face his demons and realize true love? Dr. Nick won’t accept anything else.",
