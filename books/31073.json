  "description": "A new Artist’s Way program that teaches readers how to seek and accept guidance, from \"the Queen of Change\" (New York Times) author Julia Cameron. In the thirty years following the publication of The Artist’s Way, Julia Cameron relied on an essential tool to help her through every juncture in life: writing for guidance. Now, in Living the Artist's Way, Cameron finally shares this method with the world as the fourth main Artist's Way tool.Over the course of six weeks, readers learn how to ask for guidance from a higher power within themselves, and trust the answers they receive.Revealing a more personal and vulnerable side, Cameron describes how she developed confidence in her own guidance and began using it not only to bolster her art, but to make sense of the world. This handbook to seeking and accepting guidance will help readers follow Cameron’s path, becoming creatively unblocked, happier, and more productive.Many who try guidance for the first time ask Julia, “What if it’s just my imagination?” This book asks, “What if it’s not?”Welcome to the creative act of writing for guidance.",
