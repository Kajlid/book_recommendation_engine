  "title": "Divine Days",
  "description": "As the unanimous critical praise that greeted this novel attests, Divine Days is one of the most significant works of African American fiction since Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. This huge oratorio of a novel unfolds over seven days in the life of Joubert Jones, an aspiring playwright making ends meet tending bar at his Aunt Eloise's Night Lounge. A Rabelaisian cast of characters and a Shakespearean range of voices crowd the pages of this book, an infinitely rich and suggestive tapestry of Black-American life and identity.",
