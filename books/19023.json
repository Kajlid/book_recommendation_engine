Each of the stories in the series begins with a scene set in The Wanderers' Club in London, where patrons take turns telling stories of their adventures and derring-do. Though the plots and characters of the various tales differ and each adventure is self-contained and independent, every story-teller starts out by referencing the story before his in some fashion before telling his own tale.\"Gentlemanly Horrors of Mine Alone\" is the ninth story in The Chain Story Project, following on the heels of Robert T. Jeschonek's \"Blazing Bodices\" and preceding Michael A. Stackpole's \"The Adventure of the Ghost Watch.\" For more on The Chain Story Project, go to www.chainstory.stormwolf.com.
