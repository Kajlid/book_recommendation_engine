  "description": "On one of the happiest days of her life, Opal Summerfield is ambushed by her secret history and inherits an enchanted necklace, magically super-charged by her adolescent emotions. Immediately, the strange gift attracts the attention of an evil conjurer named Amina and the masked vigilantes called the Hoods. After the Hoods attack her family, Opal flees her Ozark Mountain home and escapes into a parallel world called the Veil. Here she meets deadly wereboars, horses that burst into flame, mechanical steamwork fireflies, and the Wardens who guard the source of all magic-a strange cave formation called the Helixflow-hidden beneath the city of Fallmoon Gap.Opal soon joins the Wardens in their many quests: managing the destructive energy of the Veil that flows through the land like a wild river, wrangling dangerous creatures mutated by the Veil's magic, and hunting criminal magic-users.All the while, Opal tries to master the Agama Stone and its dangerous powers, in spite of being distracted by a budding romance and rumors that her father, long assumed dead, may be one of the worst criminals ever, and an ally to Amina who is trying to destroy Fallmoon Gap and everyone that Opal loves.With cover art and illustrations from emerging artist, Kitikhun Vongsayan, Opal Summerfield and The Battle of Fallmoon Gap, is the first installment of the Opal of the Ozarks series and a non-stop adventure full of familiar fantasy characters re-imagined in a unique American mythology-the fading lore and legends of the Ozark Mountains.",
