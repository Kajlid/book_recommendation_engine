  "description": "As an illegitimate son of a duke, James knew he would not easily be accepted by Regency society. Most days he didn't care.

After being injured fighting Napoleon, James returns home to discover that Katherine is pregnant and has been abandoned by her lover. Was this an opportunity to offer her marriage? Or was he risking his heart?",
