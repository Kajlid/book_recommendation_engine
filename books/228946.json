  "description": "Now in its FIFTH edition, here's the cult classic overture to the NARC series - complete, unabridged, 25,000+ words longer than the 1991 GMP and 2000 Millivres issues. Nominated for the 1992 SF Hall of Fame... DreamCraft is proud to issue the first NARC volume just as it was written, without ommission. MK personally performed the '04 revision, updating technicalities, restoring all 'lost' material. The classic is back, as you never saw it before! The '08 edition wears a fine new jacket. Meet this world, these heroes, at www.melkeegan.com. \"Unputdownable. Keegan has taken the two dimensional Marvel/DC comic strip and made it flesh ... and what flesh!\" - HIM.",
