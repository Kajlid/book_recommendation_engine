  "description": "\"Husk's rich, well-developed world building makes this dark tale of loyalty, love, and redemption equally appealing to both romance and fantasy readers.\"―Booklist The Goblin Prince defeated the dreaded Shadowlands, but winning the love of a woman may be his ultimate undoing He is like a prince in a fairy tall, outrageously handsome, and way too dark for her own good. Amanda has been hurt before, though. And with her daughter's illness, the last thing she needs right now is a man. But the power of Dai King is hard to resist. And when he threads his hands through her hair and pulls her in for a kiss, there is no denying it feels achingly right. After being trapped in the Shadowlands for centuries with the goblin horde a constant threat, Dai revels in his newfound freedom back in the human realm. But even with the centuries of magic he's accumulated, he still doesn't know how to heal Amanda's daughter―and it breaks his heart. Yet for the woman he loves, he'd risk anything...including a retun to the Shadowlands.",
