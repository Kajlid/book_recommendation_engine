  "description": "Two brothers. Two different journeys. The same hope of a magnificent future.Jake D'Arcy has spent most of his twenty-nine years trying to get his life just right. He's nearly there: great girlfriend, great friends, stable job. A distant relationship with his boisterous family - which is exactly the way he wants it. So why does everything feel so wrong?When his popular, irritatingly confident teenage brother Trick comes out as gay to a rapturous response, Jake realises he has questions about his own repressed bisexuality, and that he can't wait any longer to find his answers.As Trick begins to struggle with navigating the murky waters of adult relationships, Jake begins a journey that will destroy his relationship with girlfriend Amelia, challenge his closest friendships, and force him to face up to the distance between him and his family - but offers new friends, fewer inhibitions, and a glimpse of the magnificent life he never thought could be his.The Magnificent Sons tells the tale of two very different brothers, searching for the life they want - and for the person they want to be. Fans of The Last Romeo will delight in the same wicked sense of humour, for this timely coming-of-age story is as wise as it is witty and as sharply observed as it is deeply moving.",
