So when her brother returns home with his gallant English friend Brigham Langston, Serena knows the man can't be trusted. All it takes is one look at his friend's ravishing red-haired sister, and Brigham is captivated. But the hot-tempered beauty spurns his advances with a rapier-sharp tongue. However, as the snow rages, Serena's passionate anger soon melts into desire...In from the Cold\n\n\nAmerica, Christmas 1776: Injured minuteman Ian MacGregor is forced to take refuge from a winter storm in the home of young widow Alanna Flynn. As she carefully nurses him back to health, he can't help but fall for her.

Christmas is coming fast, and Alanna is determined to make it a joyful one--even if it means letting this stranger into her home...and her heart.",
