A Contemporary biker romance.  Maddie's life has always been hard. With an absent mother and a father who is beyond help. She's all on her own.  When her father carks it, she has no money, and some jerk with bad breath is always hovering around her to take advantage.  So she goes to the one person who owes her a favour - her mother. She's married to the president of the MC Outlaws. That's a motorcycle club. Maddie's never really been into that shit, but she doesn't have a choice. And surprisingly, she's going to come to rely on the Outlaws more than she ever expected.  Cole is one of those jackass guys who girls should keep away from at all costs. But he's hot, and Maddie finds she can't help herself. He's the club's VP, and so goddamned hot, he'd melt the panties off a nun.  She should run, she should stay as far away from her past as she can, but instead, she keeps running to that sexy biker, Cole.  Cole understands Maddie, you see - he's damaged too. Can these two tortured souls find a way to heal each other. Will Cole be her Champion?  ***Please note, this book was rewritten before release to adjust any similarities",
