  "description": "Jonathan Swift's classic takes a naughty turn in the savvy hands of the Italian Manara. Follow the bawdy adventures of lithe Manara-girl Gullivera through Lilliput, the land of the Giants, and the land of (horny) talking horse. Watch how thousands of tiny Lilliputians tie her barely clad beauty down to the beach, how she is used as a splayed-leg arch for their triumphant troops, how she lets a couple of young giants play with her willingly and how she meets an airborne group of women so desperate for attention from their inattentive men, they resort to loud S&M parties between themselves. Funny, light and beautiful Manara.",
