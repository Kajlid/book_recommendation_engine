  "description": "The tenth installment in the bestselling post-apocalyptic military thriller series THE MAD MICK. After Chinese missiles destroy Camp David, the Lightspeed organization is in shambles. Self-appointed president Walter Lightspeed is dead and he’s taken the secrets of his wireless power grid with him. After a brief respite from the apocalypse, America has been thrown back into the dark. China is taking advantage of the chaos, sending covert teams into America to target those likely to resist their plan to annex America. Conor and Ricardo are on that list, but they have been targeted before and they won’t go down without a fight. DISCLOCATED is jammed full of all the crunchy goodness that readers love about the Mad Mick Series – battlefield humor, biting dialogue, head-spinning chaos, and characters you might like even more than your own friends.",
