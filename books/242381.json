  "description": "My name’s Rosie and I come from a dynasty of sorts… the Sons of Templar, maybe you’ve heard of them.I just happen to be the daughter of one of the founding members and am the sister of the current president.The fact I’m a woman means I don’t wear the patch, but it’ll never change the fact that I'm a Templar by blood. We're known as royalty in the outlaw world. Though, the dynasty is dancing on the right side of the law these days.That doesn’t mean that the law and those who enforce it are friends.It will remain the one constant in my tumultuous life. The one rule in our law-free existence.Befriending the law and those that enforce it is a betrayal.Which means me being one half of a doomed love is that much more comical when he’s a cop.Or was.Before I went and ruined it all.Before he shattered that shield he wore to protect society in order to protect me.He saved me and I damned him.I damned myself too, but to be honest, I was damned long before that.",
