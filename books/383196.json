In exchange, the Dracule are given immortality and power…and a guilt-free life of pleasure, wealth, and freedom. No one can touch them. No man can control them. No mortal can destroy them…unless they find love.But Lucifer will not release those who are bound to him without a fight. In a battle of good versus evil, love versus hate, only the strongest souls can win freedom from the devil.~~Even after centuries of lust, hedonism, and women, Voss rarely finds himself bored. As a member of the Dracule, he is a rogue of the first order, a man who loves nothing more than a warm woman, excellent vintage, and even a puzzling challenge to keep his mind active.But when one of his seemingly harmless manipulations sets him on the path to seduce the beautiful Angelica Woodmore, things become a little less simple…a lot more passionate…and definitely more complicated.And when the most evil vampire of the Dracule puts Angelica in his sights, Voss will have to risk everything to save her…and possibly his own soul.",
