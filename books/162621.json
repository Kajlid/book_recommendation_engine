  "description": "After a disastrous marriage and divorce, Detective Cary Stevens vowed he’d never let another woman into his heart. But when his latest investigation puts him in the way of a bullet, his bachelor days—and one-night stands—may be numbered. On the brink of death, he finds himself in Room Six, a waiting room in the hereafter where in-betweeners’ fates are truly decided. He resigns himself to dying of boredom, if nothing else, in the lineup of senior citizens with their AARP magazines, when in walks the one woman who could make him want a second chance at life... and love.Chloe Sanders learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished when she pushes a little girl out of the way of a moving car and wakes up in some type of purgatory. Or maybe it’s heaven, because she couldn’t have asked for a hotter guy with whom to await her final judgment. The sweeping glances of his bedroom eyes and sharp-tongued flirtatiousness tell her Cary’s certainly no angel, but is he real? When she finally wakes up, Chloe’s determined to find out if he’s truly a man of magnificent flesh and blood or just a figment of her imagination. But before she can track him down, will the murderer that first put them both in Room Six come back to finish the job?Bonus At the end of the book, get a sneak peek at another new book in the Divorced and Desperate series, Divorced, Desperate and Dangerous, available now!And as an added bonus, you’ll also get a look at the first chapter of Reborn, the first book in the YA paranormal series Shadow After Dark, that Christie is writing as C.
