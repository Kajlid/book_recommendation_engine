  "description": "\"An illuminating insight...fascinating.\"―Amanda Grange, bestselling author of Mr. Darcy's Diary \"A journey through both a physical landscape and the geography of the human heart and mind...delightfully entertaining and often deeply moving, this book reminds us that Austen's world―and her characters―are very much alive.\"―Michael Thomas Ford, author of Jane Bites Back WHERE DO BOOKS TAKE YOU? With a suitcase full of Jane Austen novels en español , Amy Elizabeth Smith set off on a yearlong Latin American a traveling book club with Jane. In six unique, unforgettable countries, she gathered book-loving new friends― taxi drivers and teachers, poets and politicians― to read Emma , Sense and Sensibility , and Pride and Prejudice . Whether sharing rooster beer with Guatemalans, joining the crowd at a Mexican boxing match, feeding a horde of tame iguanas with Ecuadorean children, or tangling with argumentative booksellers in Argentina, Amy came to learn what Austen knew all that we're not always speaking the same language― even when we're speaking the same language. But with true Austen instinct, she could recognize when, unexpectedly, she'd found her own Señor Darcy. All Roads Lead to Austen celebrates the best of what we love about books and revels in the pleasure of sharing a good book― with good friends.",
