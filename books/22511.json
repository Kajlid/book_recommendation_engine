  "description": "ForeWord Clarion and doctor Larry Gattis reveals a highly tuned, vivid imagination in his debut novel. His well-written scenes of mayhem and fatal destruction may be best read during daylight hours, when lines like this one won’t result in “Joe clawed at the moss surrounding their hands. It was like cable, and the shears would not get underneath the bonds. The thorny plant lacerated Joe’s fingers as he pulled at the knots. There were so many tentacles coming through the window now that the origin was impossible to find.” One of my book comments for \"The Shade\"Shelly BerryhillDoc, just finished your book. Enjoyed it! What an imagination. I may keep you as my doctor, but I want a nurse present. I don't want to be alone with your mind!",
