  "description": "Supernatural & J2 Big Bang 2009 - Sam/DeanSam is trying to become the Antichrist in order to save the world. He has a small army of angels and demons, he has an adoring cult, he has a work of prophecy by Jack Kerouac, and he has Dean. Things are going pretty well until he accidentally signs Dean up as his Beloved Consort, a role that requires sex with the Antichrist on an altar. And that's when things stop going pretty well. Also, the soundtrack to the Apocalypse sucks.DOWNLOAD EBOOK: http://archive.is/fGNKuArtpost: http://wanttobeatree.livejournal.com/...48,000 words completeCover by vamptastica",
