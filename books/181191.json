  "description": "\"When it comes to fight or flight, I always choose to run like hell.”Isa planned the perfect summer: Tokyo and the Summer Olympics — check. Helping her best friend prepare for the marathon — check. Forgetting she's in love with Masa — double check. But when Isa's mother is hospitalized, she has to abandon her summer plans to run the family's Tokyo business. Masa’s offer to help makes it impossible for Isa to ignore him — and the firecracker kiss they shared half a world away. Everyone expects the world of her, but the pressure to please them all is as oppressive as the Tokyo summer heat. The simplest answer to all her problems? Run.Please note: This title was previously published in 2015 and that version is no longer for sale. This is a re-edited and republished version.",
