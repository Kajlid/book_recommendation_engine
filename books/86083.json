  "title": "Love Letter to America",
  "description": "My name is Tomas David Schuman. I am what you may call a \"defector\" from the USSR, and I have a message for you: I love you very much. I love all of you-- liberals and conservatives, \"decadent capitalists\" and \"oppressed masses,\" blacks and whites and browns and yellows, rednecks and intellectuals. For me you are the people who created a unique nation, country and society in the history of mankind,-- by no means a perfect one, but, let's face it-- the most free, affluent and just in today's world.I am not alone in this love. People all over the Earth, whether they praise America or bitterly criticize her, look upon you as the only hope for mankind's survival and the last stronghold of freedom. Some may not think in these idealistic terms, but they certainly enjoy the fruits of your civilization, often forgetting to be grateful for them. Millions of people in the so-called \"socialist camp\" or in the \"Third World\" literally owe their lives to America.",
