  "title": "The Customers Always Write",
  "description": "The Customers Always Write is a coming-of-age story of sorts in which one man begins a journey down an unfamiliar road and stumbles upon a path of enlightenment. Along the way, unexpected lessons about maturity, self-awareness and tolerance are learned from the unlikeliest of teachers such as a vagabond, a transsexual and a dominatrix. The collection of escapades captured in the book invites readers to insert themselves into the author’s place and determine how they would have reacted to certain situations and decide what they would have possibly done differently-and in the process, learn more about themselves. The book also provides a mirror affording readers the opportunity to look inside and find any emotional triggers surrounding sex that result in personal judgments, biases or stereotypes about themselves or others. At its core, this book makes the statement- in a fun and enjoyable way- that we as a society are still very miseducated about the topic of sex and the many sub-categories falling under its umbrella.",
