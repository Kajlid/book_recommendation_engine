I used to have a massive crush on Austin. Surely it’s faded by now, though, right? Then Austin shows up…and not only has my crush not faded, but it’s more intense than ever. And I see him looking at me with just as much desire in his eyes. But there’s no way he and I can do anything. No way. Absolutely not. If only I could get rid of the fantasies in my head…  IRRESISTIBLE is a fun, short, omyw romance with steam, sweetness, and a happily-ever-after!",
