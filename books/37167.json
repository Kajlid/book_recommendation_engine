  "title": "And I Held Her Hand: A Testimony Of His Love",
  "description": "A young boy and a young girl would sense a call to serve God but lose their way in their teenage and young adult years. God in His mercy had set a date in time when these two would meet on a blind date. They would carry loneliness and pain into this budding relationship but what had been instilled in the young woman would direct them back to God's planned pathway. This is a story of young love that struggles to find the way as the past and present intertwine ushering in the issues of life's challenges. There is a gradual, but continual change in priorities as the blessing of their relationship with each other and God grows despite the trials that come their way. It becomes clear to them that the God they serve is involved in their lives. This recognition brings a walk of obedience. The gifts of greater faith and trust in God are received as He reveals His desire for a deeper, more intimate walk with them. Your faith, trust and conception of God will be challenged and enriched by this testimony of two lives walked with the Master!",
