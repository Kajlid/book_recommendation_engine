In Pilgrim City, one such seductive costumed hero has taken things further.At night, she dances as Blaze or Ginger or Ruby at the city's strip clubs, scouting out and learning all she can from the seedy underbelly of her town. Later, she'll slip into her tight black outfit and her signature thigh-high red boots to patrol the streets as The Red Kick. She fights thugs, drug dealers and gangsters on the reg, but this time she has uncovered a sprawling plot that threatens to destroy half of her home and kill thousands.\"The Red Kick\" is an action-packed, sex-filled novel written like a comic book. \"BIFF! POW! BANG!\" punctuates the adventures both on the street and in the bedroom (or in the strip clubs or wherever else the mood strikes). Put on your mask, grab your junk, punch fools and enjoy THE RED KICK!",
