  "description": "As head of Snow Valley hospital's fundraising effort, Paisley Hackett barely has time to organize the craft show, cookie decorating party, and the annual Christmas Ball. What she doesn't have time for is falling in love with Clay Jett, the incredibly handsome bass player who sweeps into town. She's been burned by a tourist romance before, so with everything going on, Paisley will have to work overtime to protect her heart from Clay and his swoon-worthy ballads.",
