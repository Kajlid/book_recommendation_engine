  "description": "The Xeric-Winning debut graphic novel by Hans Rickheit, creator of the critically renowned The Squirrel Machine. Chloe is an estranged teenager living in a stifling rural New England town. After meeting an eccentric dwarfish hermit, she begins a descent into impossible visionary landscapes, sexual deviancy, and the forbidden realms of The Under-Brain. Contained in this early effort are the first explorations of the obsessive themes that continue to overflow in Rickheit's comics output: strange biological couplings, subconscious explorations and unspeakable erotic experiments.",
