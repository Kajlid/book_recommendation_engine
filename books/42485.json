  "title": "Making Love, Not Porn: A Romantic, Natural, and Emotional Guide to Sex in the 21st Century",
  "description": "Excerpt:\"When we learn how to have sex without consequence, without a real emotional connection, with ideas of body image that are not even close to reality, and in ways that can be demeaning and even painful and emotionally scarring for many, we have lost one of our greatest assets we have as human beings. That being the fine, natural, emotionally connected art of making love. In this book, I will discuss what it truly takes to differentiate what is real and what is not, and what it takes to truly separate ourselves from social constructs that have limited our ability to express our true passion in a way that is more human and less animalistic. In addition, I will give helpful hints on what it can take to allow yourself to be more connected with your lover in a multitude of ways, which will allow you to evolve towards a level many people may not have even known existed.\"",
