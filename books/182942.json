Featured as one of three Summer Reads! David Atlanta Magazine, August 05, 2015.Bo Mickey’s wanted to run away from home ever since his mom married his boyfriend, two months back. First time out of Arizona, though, and damned if they’re not both along for the ride. Worse yet, one too many sightseeing stops puts Bo in Kansas too late for a deathbed introduction to the dad he’s never met. The other Mickeys – his dad’s second family – put Bo and his lot up in the R.V. in the driveway to wait out the funeral. That’s mighty close quarters to share, though, with the drug-damaged party girl who raised him and her new groom, a know-it-all castoff from Arizona foster care who can’t shake dirty thoughts of Bo and won’t keep his hands to himself. The way, too, how the second Mrs. Mickey breaks glass and whatnot up against the walls inside her house; the mean streak that oldest daughter’s got: It’s near about impossible to pass the time in any sort of vacation-minded way. \t When a little yellow notebook sends Mom into hysterics, Bo decides now’s as good a time as any to make his escape. But he doesn’t want to go it alone. Who will he take with him: the man he loves or the woman who loves him? While he makes up his mind, changes it, and decides again, the heartbreaking choices of his father’s past come together in hints and whispers all around him. But will Bo notice in time to make the right choice himself?",
