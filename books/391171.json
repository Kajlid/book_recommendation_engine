  "title": "The 10 Most Popular Un-American Attitudes",
  "description": "America did not rise to the top of the heap with these attitudes, and we will not stay at the top very much longer with them.We have become conditioned to speaking in riddles because to talk plainly will inevitably offend someone.How can we claim that diversity is an asset when we constantly argue over our differences?The right to choose means nothing if we don't have the right to prefer.We are all shareholders in the government-Uncle Sam Incorporated. What better source of cash than all you other taxpayers-uh, sorry, I meant to say the government.We want warning labels on everything-from cigarettes to can openers.That businessman may be a greedy multi-millionaire, but by creating jobs he is doing much more for the \"little guy\" than any politician can do with taxpayer handouts.As an employee we hate to compete with all those imports, but as a consumer we love the competition from all those imports.When we constantly push for minority rights, the rights of the majority inevitably get pushed aside.We need to show the world that America means business, and it is hard to portray a business image with our pants falling down, our arms covered with tattoos and our hair painted blue.It sometimes seems that we, the people, are the pawns in the game of chess that the media are playing.",
