  "description": "Could my perfect match be my new stepbrother?\nI was in my room, bored out of my mind when my phone chimed. I looked down to read the dirtiest text I’ve ever received. Two words appeared that I normally would have ignored, but tonight, I feel something take over me as I read the words again. Sext Me. My body fills with excitement as I reply. And then I get a response. Oh, the naughty things he wants me to do. For this moment, I’ll pretend I’m the adventurous vixen he thinks I am. Tomorrow I can worry about the truth. Such as the fact that he obviously thinks it’s someone else. And that I’m not the hot cheerleader he thinks I am. I can’t keep up this pretense, but it’s too much fun. And then it’s too late, I’m in too deep. I can’t stop the inevitable. Only there’s a couple of problems… Number one - I’m not a student. Second, I’m his professor and his soon-to-be stepsister. What’s a girl to do?  Author's Note: This is a standalone novel with a HEA and NO cheating!",
