  "description": "Decision of Fate is a historical novel that follows the development of tank warfare through the eyes of a young British soldier wounded at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Suffering what we would now recognize as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, heâ€™s drawn-into the development of the tank as a means to break the defensive stalemate on the Western Front and finds himself playing an ever-increasing role in the tumultuous battles that follow. But it is also a coming of age story about a young man that discovers love and comradeship among the most tragic circumstances. As such it is the story of all wars, at once brutal and hateful, yet filled with moments of beauty and simple human decency.",
