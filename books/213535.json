  "description": "Ever-popular 2000 AD and Marshal Law writer Pat Mills, and fan-favourite artist Simon Bisley (Lobo, Batman/Judge Judgment on Gotham) present the return of the A.B.C. Warriors! Hammerstein, Joe Pineapples, Mongrol, Mek-Quake, Blackblood, Deadlock and Ro-Jaws have been summoned by Nemesis the Warlock, a co-zealot in Deadlock’s Khaos-worshipping religion, for a very special task. They must defy the plans of Nemesis’ crazed - and recently deceased - enemy, Tomas de Torquemada - and fight their way past his minions to prevent the end of time itself, and save the galaxy! But, as usual, the Warriors’ idiosyncratic personalities get in the way. Deadlock’s his usual unfathomable self, Blackblood has a knife ready for everyone’s backs, and Hammerstein... well, it seems that Hammerstein’s fallen in love!",
