  "description": "In the first installment of The Empathetic Enchantments Series, you will find out what kind of shape shifter lies dormant within the Randall families heritage—one never before written about in this light.  When trouble arises and laws must be implemented amongst the most powerful warlocks, an enforcer is sent in. Bad boy Acer Randall fears nothing—that is, except two things. The centuries-old family curse that transforms him into a bizarre freak of nature and the foreign emotions that stirs within himself by a seductive enchantress, Haven. Her pull, like that of a siren, cannot be ignored; yet for self-preservation he must stay away. Haven promised, on her coven's behalf, to end Acer's life, but can she bring herself to do what must be done when her feelings for him are so unbridled?  How is it that Acer, one of the most in-tune empaths on earth, is unable to read Haven's emotions? Has she clued into Acer's truth and cast a spell from which he cannot break free?",
