  "description": "Ridley Heller thought her life would be perfect and trouble-free once she had Bo back. Unfortunately, she couldn’t have been more wrong. Learning Bo’s true identity has left them with their most difficult decision yet. They have two options. One, they can run away together and spend eternity looking over their shoulder, hiding from both God and Sebastian. Or, two, they can find a way to kill Sebastian. Ridley feels like there’s really only one choice, but killing Sebastian has a major down side for her—it will leave Bo mortal and her a vampire. She’ll be doomed to walk the earth alone for all eternity. What will they choose? And who will have to die in order to see their goal accomplished? Find out in the exciting conclusion of the Blood Like Poison series, To Kill An Angel. What people are “Best in the series! There’s so much more Bo in this one. I loved it!” - A. Brooks “Brilliantly written.” - KB “M. Leighton grows before our very eyes with this one, proving that she is not only a fantastic storyteller, but she is a brilliant writer. I lost myself many times inside the lives of Bo and Ridley, and found myself genuinely sad to part with them at the conclusion of this series.” - Misty About I love coffee and chocolate, even more so when they are combined. I'm convinced that one day they could be the basis for world peace. I also love the color red and am seriously considering dying my hair.",
