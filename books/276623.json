Touring with her bandmates across the country, she’s content with meaningless sex: one-night-stands, no kissing, no personal details. These are her rules…and there are never exceptions.John Michaels lives a life of seclusion in Corolla, North Carolina. He works, eats, and sleeps—and is perfectly content with his lifestyle. He doesn’t have the time, or energy, to deal with people. Or relationships. Especially women relationships.When Sunset Revival gets stranded on the beach, it’s John who is asked for shelter. With his sexy-as-sin good looks—covered in ink with blue eyes so deep they shine—Dani finds herself desperate for one night in his bed. That’s all either of them wants, really…one night, no-strings, no promise of tomorrow. Yet, when one night turns into two, both find themselves breaking their own rules. Thrust into a whirlwind of passion and desire, the pair struggle to maintain the upper hand, with John learning the hardest lesson of all…never kiss a Rockstar. \n**NEVER KISS A ROCKSTAR can be read as a standalone, or as the second book in Sarah Darlington's NEVER TRUST Series.\nRelease Date: December 5, 2019",
