  "description": "In this startling debut, Ronan Hession tells the story of two thirty-something men who take care of their parents and play board games together. Who like to read. Who take satisfaction in their work. Who are resolutely kind. Leonard and Hungry Paul is the story of two friends trying to find their place in the world. It is about the uncelebrated people of this world. And it asks a surprisingly enthralling question: Can kind people change the world?",
