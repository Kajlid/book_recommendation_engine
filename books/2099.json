  "description": "Ryo is on the biggest case of his life! He and Dee are on the trail of a cold-blooded killer named Leo. They're certain he killed Ryo's parents, but don't have enough evidence to prove it. With a little help from Diana Spacey, FBI agent extraordinare, Ryo soon cracks the case when he witnesses Leo murdering a man. When Ryo threatens to shoot him, Leo tells him he did indeed kill his parents. Dee arrives and threatens to shoot Leo himself. Finally, they let Leo get away, and Ryo breaks down in Dee's arms. Back at Dee's apartment, Ryo kisses Dee but Dee abruptly stops his advances. He wants their first time together to be for the right reasons...not to escape a horrible memory. The second story centers around JJ and his old friend and police academy buddy, Max. Max was once a good guy, but now he's a bad cop. JJ's faith in his friend (and the system) is put to the test when a shooting goes horribly wrong. Somehow, Ryo and Dee must somehow make this right.",
