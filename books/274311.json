  "description": "Her parents burst into the room just as the crimson blood squirted like a shower over the stark white surroundings. What made the young angelic beauty walk down the dark path of suicide? Something happened that summer of 1978 that changed Valencia Huntington's life and those of her closet friends in the most deceptive way. One person mascarades as the picture of innocence, knowing that what brewed in her heart would rip the lives of her acquaintances apart for a long, long time.",
