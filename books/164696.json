In a tourist town at the base of the Tetons, Maya Conway, a mythical being known as an Elemental, stands at a crossroads.

Her direction is altered when Mother Nature taps her to guide Terran Forrester, an analytical scientist, on his journey to become the next Elemental—Earth.

When an ancient evil evolved from dark matter shadows their steps, which path will they choose—logic or love?",
