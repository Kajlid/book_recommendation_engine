  "description": "In Ireland’s lush countryside locals are buzzing with excitement over the reality-TV baking contest coming to town—until someone serves up a show-stopping murder that only Garda Siobhan O’Sullivan can solve.In Kilbane, opinions are plentiful and rarely in alignment. But there’s one thing everyone does agree on—the bakery in the old flour mill, just outside town, is the best in County Cork, well worth the short drive and the long lines. No wonder it's about to be featured on a reality baking show.All six contestants in the show are coming to Kilbane to participate, and the town is buzzing with excitement. Aside from munching on free samples, the locals—including Siobhan—get a chance to appear in the opening shots. As for the competitors themselves, not all are as sweet as their confections. Shenanigans put everyone on edge on the first day of filming, but that’s nothing compared to day two, when the first round ends, and the top contestant is found face-down in her signature pie.The producers decide to continue filming while Siobhan and her husband, Garda Macdara Flannery, sift through the suspects. Was this a case of rivalry turned lethal, or are their other motives hidden in the mix? And can they uncover the truth before another baker is eliminated—permanently?",
