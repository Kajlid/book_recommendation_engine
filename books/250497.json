  "description": "Read the hilarious, candid (and sometimes not-so-nice), diaries of Jamie Kelly. Now Jamie's first four diaries are together in one side-splitting set!Dear Dumb Diary,Here's the thing about Angeline. I know that she shouldn't really bother me that much. I mean, Angeline has even done nice things for me in the past, although I have come to believe that these were probably accidental.There's just something so infuriating about perfect people. When she's nice, it makes me mad. When she's pretty, it makes me mad. It never changes. I guess the only good thing about Angeline is that she can never bother me more than she does right now. Perfect people make me perfectly ill.",
