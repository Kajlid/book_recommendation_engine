  "description": "WINNER OF THE 2014 Next Generation Indie Book Awards for HUMOR/COMEDY The Inflatable Snowman. The Gigantic Inflatable Snowman. We thought that ‘Frosty’ would lead to our demise. That 20-foot monstrosity placed in our front yard by a not so helpful elf had me questioning our decision to move into this seemingly quiet neighborhood on a cul-de-sac. Read about the mayhem and mishaps that come into play when you mix together a potpourri of eccentric characters that live within a stone’s throw of each other. Take an Eco-friendly, high-strung type A neighbor, a demanding Italian Matriarch, men who are the embodiment of the words “More Power,” a troop of loving and mischievous kids and mix in two gay men who are hell-bent on making a home out of a charming half-million-dollar, 100 year old fixer upper and you have the residents of Altamont Court. Whether you're a weekend warrior who can't wait to get you're hands around the next \"improvement project\", a stiletto-wearing Texas woman who wields a gun in flawless makeup, or a queen from the city who eagerly awaits the next big sales event at Neiman Marcus - this memoir is for you. Pour a drink, or more appropriately a shot, sit back, relax and enjoy - and if you don't, then the words of a truly classy character from this book come to mind, \"What the F&%$’s wrong with you?\" Yes, it's that kind of party - bless our hearts.
