  "description": "Forty years ago, a small bear from Darkest Peru set out on the adventure of a lifetime. Carrying a battered suitcase containing several jars of marmalade, and wearing a tag around his neck that read Please Look after This Bear, he stowed away on a ship and landed in Londons Paddington Station. As luck would have it, the Brown family found him, named him Paddington, and welcomed him to their home and into the hearts of millions of readers.Since 1958, Paddington Bear has charmed readers worldwide with his humorous misadventures. In celebration of Paddingtons 40th birthday, Michael Bonds original story of Paddington Bear has been beautifully reillustrated by artist R.W. Alley.",
