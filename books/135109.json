  "description": "What Price Would You Pay for The Cure? Riley Keep, former man of God, former missionary, now haunts the streets, a ghost of who he used to be. Wife, daughter, and faith have all been lost in the aftermath of a single act of wickedness. Any chance at forgiveness seems a distant dream. Until he hears rumors…. There's a small town in Maine where miracles are happening. In a last bid for survival, Riley sets out and soon finds himself in Dublin, Maine, a coastal village nestled against the jagged shore of the cold Atlantic, a town he thought he'd never see again. This once-proud birthplace of mighty wooden ships, then idyllic seaside tourist destination and safe harbor for lobstermen, is now slowly suffocating underneath an avalanche of desperate people searching for help. But will they find their miracle? After all, sometimes the disease is not as dangerous as The Cure… From the acclaimed author of River Rising, selected by Booklist as one of the Top 10 Christian Novels of 2006!",
