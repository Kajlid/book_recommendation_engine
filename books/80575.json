  "description": "Dark, delicious and downright dirty. Kellah Slater is a demon sent to Earth for a crime she committed and she’d do it again. Why? Because F you, that’s why… foul mouthed and p*ssed off Kellah will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and what she wants is to get back home, to Hell.  Forced to live amongst the kind she hates the most, the human kind, Kellah does what she does best, steals, lies, cheats, and toys with the humans she despises. When she forces a human male to part with his wallet, she thinks no more about it. But the human male can’t forget.  Detective Darrion Hunter has lost everything. His wife, his daughter, his soul… and now his wallet. Kellah is everything he despises. He will sacrifice all to see the thief where she belongs, behind bars.  Darrion Hunter becomes Kellah’s personal demon, but the hell of it is, he might just be her path to her salvation.",
