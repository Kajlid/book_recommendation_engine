  "description": "\"[Thich Nhat Hanh] shows us the connection between personal, inner peace and peace on earth.\" --His Holiness The Dalai LamaNominated by Martin Luther King, Jr. for a Nobel Peace Prize, Thich Nhat Hanh is one of todayâ€™s leading sources of wisdom, peace, compassion and comfort.Exiled from Vietnam over thirty years ago, Thich Nhat Hanh has become known as a healer of the heart, a monk who shows us how the everyday world can both enrich and endanger our spiritual lives.In this book, Jesus and Buddha share a conversation about prayer and ritual and renewal, and about where such concepts as resurrection and the practice of mindfulness converge. In this unique way, Thich Nhat Hanh shows the brotherhood between Jesus and Buddha-- and in the process shows how we can take their wisdom into the world with us, to \"practice in such a way that Buddha is born every moment of our daily life, that Jesus Christ is born every moment of our daily life.\"",
