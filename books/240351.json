  "description": "GreerEveryone’s perception of an MC Princess is that she’s cherished and protected, but this MC “Princess” was left to the wolves. My father, the loved Southern Chaotic’s President, dropped me like a bad habit when I was thirteen. My mother went off her rocker when I was fourteen. I had my first of many abortions when I was fifteen. Life for me was a whirlwind of angst and torment, but through all of that the pain took the fear away and replaced it with yearning. I thirst for gratification that I’m not a replication of my legacy. I hunger for the day when my anxiety is replaced with reassurance.SpookI live my life for the Southern Chaotic’s. I have loved and lost to this club, but the brotherhood and acceptance have outlived the regret. I had a good woman or so I thought. She left me for a rival club. I long for what some of my brothers have. I yearn for a woman to desire all that is me and I crave to have a woman that I can depend on through thick, thin and the sh*t in between. I just need to find her so I can quench my thirst.This is a standalone book, but to better understand some of the situations you should read Minor Glitches and Major Conflict. This book is meant for an audience 18 and older. There are some scenes that may not be suitable for some readers.",
