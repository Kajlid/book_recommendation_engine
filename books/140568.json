  "description": "Forced to drop out his senior year, Nico tries to move past the loss of his parents and throws himself into the business his family built for his future, a future he's always resented. Torn between his dreams and reality, he discovers his goals might not be what his heart truly wants.With a new teaching career, Vera's life is neat and tidy, even if her shy nature keeps her from getting what she wants. When circumstances push her out of her home and into cohabitation with three guys from her past, the stress of living with her long-time crush, Nico, and the continued presence of a stalker, turns her tidy life upside down and makes her face a side of herself that should send her screaming.Despite a distant one-night stand - one she denies and he barely remembers - Vera and Nico work around an awkward friendship, but find that false assumptions and half-truths could forever drive them apart.Due to strong language, explicit sexual situations, and mature themes, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.A 76,000 word novel by tfc Parks, writing as Brandie Buckwine.",
