  "title": "The Race Card: White Guilt, Black Resentment & the Assault on Truth & Justice",
  "description": "This collection of provocative essays, edited by bestselling authors Peter Collier and David Horowitz, explores how Martin Luther King's dream of a color-blind society is being undermined by black separatists and others who profit from the cynical exploitation of racial pride. The writers expose the underside of this new Afrocentrism—the crackpot theories, the bullying of dissent, the naked appeals to violence. Three themes • Political trials—how the notorious cases of O.J. Simpson, Philadelphia's convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, and others have muddied our sense of truth, justice, and reason• Afro-fascism—how some influential black leaders such as Louis Farrakhan have fueled a separatist movement that seems to feed on the hatred of Jews, Koreans, and whites• The new racism—how racial pride, taken to its destructive extreme on the streets and in the schools of America, is leading to a society of bitter divisions.Academic partisans have rewritten the textbooks to enshrine Afrocentric orthodoxy inside Ivy League walls; politically correct media reports have ignored the troubling implications. The Race Card is a cogent, compelling, and long-needed call for a return to reason.",
