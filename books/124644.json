  "description": "Tucker Philips appeared in my life when I least expected him. And minutes after I swore off men. Forever. No matter how cocky as hell he is or handsome and devilish he looks in his tailor suits, I won’t listen to my traitorous heart. I know his type. And it spells “trouble” in big bold letters. Between us, Tucker Philips isn’t the only wild one, and I can hold my own. I’m about to show him I won’t fall for his ways, because I master the game too. If he wants a chance, he’ll have to play by my rules. Until one event we never saw coming shatters all the boundaries of our burgeoning friendship and sends us on the ride of our lives. What if our meeting wasn’t a coincidence, and we really needed each other in other to go through the ordeal we were given? Emmanuelle Snow will play with each string of your heart as Addison and Tucker fight for their happily ever after.",
