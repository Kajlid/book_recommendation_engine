  "description": "Hidden forces are willing to kill any and all who stand in the way of untold billions. To toss the authorities off track, they borrow the modus operandi of a brutal serial killer The Chessman who stalked the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. some yearsearlier. The ruse is working brilliantly except for one minor detail: the real Chessman is not pleased not pleased one iota that someone has stolen his M.O. Enter Drew Cady, ex-FBI agent, who finds himself being sucked back into the very case that almost took his life, a case that crippled him both physically and emotionally. By capturing The Chessman and his blood-spattered copycat, Cady has a last shot at redemption. If he can find a way to survive, that is.",
