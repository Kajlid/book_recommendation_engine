  "description": "It's not easy being a kitten. Don't get me wrong. I love being scratched behind the ears, chasing Butch the dog, and eating Mother's stew. My brother Toby and I learned about \"people things\" when we were adopted by Sarah and Ben. The only problem with kid-people is the games they like to play, like \"Dress the Cat\" -- and \"Snot Stew\". It's not stew! But what is it? It's making a bully out of Toby and a wreck out of me!",
