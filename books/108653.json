But on the Shepherds' annual summer vacation, Forrest discovers that her safe world of family and friends is riddled with deception. Her brother, her mother, Olivia, Scott . . . she really doesn't know them at all, and Forrest is left wondering what it means for the most important relationships in her life to be built on lies.
