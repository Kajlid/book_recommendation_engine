  "title": "Because a Little Bug Went Ka-choo!",
  "description": "When a little bug sneezes a riot breaks out as one accident leads to another, and another! until the whole town is caught up in the ensuing chaos. Young readers will delight in this action-packed tale of mishaps and mayhem! This title belongs to the highly acclaimed Beginner Book series developed by Dr. Seuss, in which the essential ingredients of rhyme, rhythm and repetition are combined with zany artwork and off-the-wall humour to create a range of books that will encourage even the most reluctant child to learn to read. Originally published under the pseudonym of Rosetta Stone, Because A Little Bug Went Ka-Choo! is being relaunched with a stylish new cover design which reveals, for the first time, the true identity of the author -- Dr. Seuss himself!",
