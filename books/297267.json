  "description": "The devil came to me in disguise. Too bad I didn’t notice until it was far too late.  \nVanessa:\n The devil doesn’t always wear an evil mask. Sometimes, he appears in the most beautiful form. Like the super-hot bad boy with the dirty-blond hair and a wicked glint in his blue eyes who swept in out of nowhere, stealing all the air from my lungs. I thought he was my savior. But he’s my ruination. And he’s just taken a machete to my heart.  \nJackson:\n For years, my rage seethed under the surface. Hidden behind a cloudy haze of my poison of choice. But now, the fog has cleared. And I’m out for blood. I will annihilate those responsible for taking my sister from me. Except he’s not here, so I go for the next best target. The woman he abandoned. Until it suited him to drag her into this messed-up elite world. Sucks to be her. Because when I’m done with Vanessa, she’ll wish she was dead.  An interconnected standalone dark romance set in the Rydeville High Elite world. Due to mature content and themes, this book is recommended to readers aged eighteen and over.",
