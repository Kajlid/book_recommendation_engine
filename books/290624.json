  "description": "Fake dating my sworn enemy to make my ex so jealous he can't see straight? Worth it. Silas and I agree on one thing, and one thing only: my ruthless, heartless, narcissistic jerk of an ex-fiance needs to be taken down a notch. So we do what anyone would do: we pretend to be a couple.Even though Silas and I are polar opposites. Silas is a loud, cheerful, over the top showboat. He’s his hometown’s golden boy, the Marine who came back to rescue kittens from trees and walk old ladies across the street. And me? I'm the awkward new girl who freezes up around strangers and can’t make small talk to save my life.It shouldn’t work. We can barely have a conversation without arguing. There's no way we should be friends, let alone dating, except... Everyone believes it.Especially my ex.Now I'm having way too many real fantasies about the man who gets on my last nerve. My fake boyfriend is starting to feel a whole lot like a real one.The kisses feel real. The way he protects me feels real.The night we spend together in a hotel bed feels very real.This was supposed to be fake, but I think I might have fooled myself most of all.",
