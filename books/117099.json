  "description": "THE YEAR IS 2045. CIVIL WARS AND FOREIGN ATTACKS HAVE SPLIT THE U.S. INTO THREE HOSTILE POLITICAL AREAS. CAN YOU MAKE IT HOME FROM YOUR SECRET MISSION IN TIME TO HELP? A once-proud country governed by freedom is torn apart. One section, Dorado, dominates the others with harsh police-state tactics. You are from Turtalia, a new democracy, and you are returning there with important information about Doradan's plans to invade. Two others, Matt and Mimla, join you in escaping to Turtalia. The Doradan underground has helped the three of you get as far as Albuquerque, but now you are on your own. They?re closing in on us, Matt says tensely. I can feel it. There is no sign of the Secret Police on the horizon; but you know they could appear at any moment. They are relentless killers. If you decide to follow Matt's suggestion to return to town to avoid capture, turn to page 10. YOU choose what happens next!",
