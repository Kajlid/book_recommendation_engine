  "description": "On Terra, the empire of Basur calls the shots and everybody else gets into line. Almost everybody…The Askar get into line for no-one. They don’t seem to know when they’re beaten. Ruthless, indomitable, they are capable of anything. Like kidnapping a DSS officer for interrogation from the streets of Basur’s own capital.Kendra Veiss, the officer in question, should be dead. Instead, she walks out of an Askari black site without a scratch on her. That’s enough excitement for a while, even for a girl who works for the Basuri DSS — the most powerful intelligence organisation on Terra. But it proves only the beginning of a cat and mouse game between her and Aran Reiner. Reiner, an Askari secret service agent, engineered her release. Now he’s hanging around her like a hungry stray. She’s indebted to him, but he’s bad, bad news. Untrustworthy, manipulative. Dangerous to herself and a crucial DSS asset she must protect at all costs. But his arresting looks pull her like a magnet, stopping her breath, making her ache to yield to temptation.What does Reiner really want? And how far would he go to get it?Strategic Entanglements is the first novel in a series set in the gritty, dangerous world of espionage on an alternative Earth of the future called Terra. For fans of spy intrigue, action-packed suspense, complex characters, forbidden attraction and inconvenient, deadly love triangles. PLEASE NOTE: This novel features adult language and situations, and is not for people of sensitive or nervous disposition. It is set in a physically dangerous and morally grey world. The characters in it are extremely interesting, but they are not nice. You have been warned.",
