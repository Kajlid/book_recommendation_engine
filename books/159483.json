  "title": "Far From Streets",
  "description": "Modern life constricts. The swarming city, homogenous suburbs. Overscheduled lives accumulate layers of obligation. We add more, more of what we think life should contain, until we can't stand it all. The clutter of life starts grinding us away. We dream of escape, a simpler life among open spaces. Forests and rivers. Mountain wilderness.Reverence for nature balances against the terror of isolation. Mutual dependency leads to resentment. Our fondest dreams drag us toward places that threaten our very survival. When the last remaining tether is cut, time spins away. We no longer recognize ourselves in the mirror. Our surroundings become strange. The end comes rushing.Far From Streets combines influences such as Von Trier's Antichrist and Blackwood's \"The Willows\" into a confrontational psychodrama of craving and repulsion, emotional drift and dislocation, set deep in the Cascade Mountain forests of Oregon.",
