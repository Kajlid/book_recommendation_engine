  "description": "A sensual and Gothic tale of obsession and sexual awakening, Sabine is a tasty literary treat by an anonymous author that features old money and older secrets, spoiled schoolgirls, lesbians, and a school that may or may not be run by a vampire. It is the 1950s and existentialism is flourishing in Paris. But Viola, a seventeen year-old English girl, is languishing in an elite boarding school in the dull French countryside. Under the distracted tutelage of Aimée, the students lounge about the crumbling gray château playing records and smoking Gitanes, awaiting the arrival of some suitable distraction. Then a new teacher arrives—Sabine—with her long tanned legs and mane of golden hair. Sabine questions everything and challenges the girls to look at their world anew. Passion strikes Viola. But there are sinister forces at play in the château and when Sabine becomes ill with a blood disorder, Viola uncovers a dangerous secret. Smart, sexy, and atmospheric, Sabine is a tale of schoolgirl love with a gripping mystery that leaves you turning back to the first page after you’ve finished the last.",
