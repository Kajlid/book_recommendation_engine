  "description": "This fiery redhead will defy her family to be with the man she loves…  On the verge of an engagement to Samuel Hardy, Madeline Ashton is a carefree young woman with the world at her feet. It’s not until her father arrests the notorious “Gentleman Bandit” that she meets Jared Stott, staring at the handsome outlaw through the bars of a jail cell.  Having come to the Colorado Territory to find a wife and open a shop, Jared Stott is stunned to be arrested, having been implicated in a series of robberies he did not commit. Being the identical brother of a bank robber, no one believes his innocence, except the beautiful redhead, whose father happens to be a lawman.  Surviving the hangman’s noose is only the beginning of Jared Stott’s troubles, because Madeline’s family is firmly against him. To compound matters, he is saddled with his brother’s wife and child, a burden worsened by the woman’s drinking. The only glimmer of light on the horizon is Madeline, who is steadfast in her love for him and her faith in the Lord, hoping that one day they can be together.",
