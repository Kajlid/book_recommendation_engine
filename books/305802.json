  "description": "VenomVenom runs through my veins the same way ice freezes to the midst of winter. I’m not a man to be crossed, nor one to be played with.Danger comes swirling around the club and I do what it takes to keep the targets off my brother’s backs. I’ve killed in war and I have no problem doing it again, whenever the day might come. When a blast from the past lands on my doorstep, I’m not sure what to say, or what to do. I have two options right now-- bring her in, or show her the door. That is, until she steps aside to show me my prize. Either way, the prize will always be mine.",
