  "description": "Graham Hudson has always been meant for one person.  Serenity Richards.  So what happens when his soulmate, the girl he spent the last seven years head over heels in love with, marries another?  He does the one thing he’s been fighting all along. He embraces the darkness.  Emma Daniels has tried everything in her power to help bring Graham back, but hasn't been able to break through. Left with no other alternative she does the unthinkable.  Graham is back and he seems to be better than ever, but no matter how fixed he seems, how close they seem to get, there’s always one fear resting comfortably in the back of her mind.  What is Graham going to do when he finds out what she did and better yet, will it break everything they've both worked so hard to build?",
