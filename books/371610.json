  "description": "Dolan Hermes is a cold and diabolical serial killer preying on Philadelphia. Finding him, however, is not difficult. He's in a freezer at the city morgue. The real problem is Hermes didn't actually become a serial killer until after he had died. Now someway, somehow people are falling victim left and right, just as Hermes had predicted. The cops already have their perpetrator. What they don't have is the means to stop the gruesome killings--killings set in motion by a dead man.",
