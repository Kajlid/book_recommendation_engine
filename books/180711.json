Delicately powerful.” –Darby Karchut, author of Finn Finnegan and Griffin Rising“First love, family ties, authentically imperfect characters.” –Nicole O’Dell, author of the Diamond Estates seriesThe ice cold fear I’d felt, not knowing if Wyatt was alive, pressed into the wall with other girls and surrounded by guys who were unspeakably brave, hit my body again in a wave. This was trauma—the gift that keeps on giving.When Meg Kavanagh finds herself in the unthinkable role of grieving sister, she discovers some harsh truths—parents aren’t perfect, life’s not always sweet, and the dead don’t write back. Her famous artist mom grieves by slowly disappearing, and her dad copes by moving them to a small town in Wyoming.What she finds in Wyoming blindsides her.His name is Henry, and he shows Meg that the best things in life—like falling in love and finding mercy—require uncommon courage.",
