  "description": "When British agent Commander Shaw learns that his partner, Felicity Mandrake, has been followed and attacked by an unknown assailant, it is clear that he has yet another case on his hands. And things go from bad to worse when Shaw himself is captured by the same perpetrators on the hunt for something very specific — Adolf Hitler’s brain.  For it is said that Hitler did not die in the bunker as commonly believed, but escaped to South America after Germany’s defeat in World War Two. A brain, said to be Hitler’s, has been discovered in the foothills of the Andes, and a group of Nazi fanatics in West Germany — known as the Werewolves — want the grisly trophy to reignite support for their cause. Commander Shaw must intercept its arrival — and prevent what could become a second Nuremberg Rally. But the mission is not without great risk, and Shaw soon finds that danger is unescapable … Werewolf is another thrilling instalment of the Commander Shaw series. Philip McCutchan grew up in the naval atmosphere of Portsmouth Dockyard and developed a lifetime's interest in the sea. Military history was an early interest of his, resulting in several fiction books about the British Army and its campaigns, especially in the last 150 years. He served throughout WWII in a variety of ships, including the cruiser Vindictive, the ocean boarding vessel Largs, and the escort carrier Ravager, ending the war as a lieutenant, RNVR. He is also the author of the Tom Chatto Naval Adventures series, published by Endeavour Media.",
