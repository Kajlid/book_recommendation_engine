  "description": "Johnny Ryan's utterly unpretentious taboo-tackling is an infectious and hilarious bombardment of political incorrectness, taking full advantage of the medium's absurdist potential for maximum laughs. In an age when the medium is growing up and aspiring to more mature and hoity-toity literary heights, Ryan builds on the visceral tradition that cartooning has had on our collective funny bone for over a century. Now, for the first time, all fourteen issues of Ryan's career-defining comic Angry Youth Comics (2000-2008) are collected in one place. All the comics, the covers, and even the contentious letter pages, in one toilet-ready brick shithouse. \"Johnny Ryan is the funniest cartoonist working today.\" -Peter Bagge",
