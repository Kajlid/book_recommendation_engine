  "description": "He is royal, dashing, and would become known as the greatest king that ever lived. Elena Watkins' father, Albert Malone did not have things easy.  His life is complicated, filled with prejudice, betrayal and intrigue. His father married his mother for all the wrong reasons and he rules the country with an iron fist. His overbearing mother means less to him than his childhood nanny. Just when he thinks things couldn't get any worse, he falls for a commoner at a fancy-dress ball.  Catherine Squires, a commoner, growing up in the poorest of circumstances struggles to help her family. The King's obsession with killing off Chromatic dragons are leading the country into another war. A war that will change her world forever.  The adventure of Catherine and Albert against the backdrop of the dragons' struggle for equality and justice is a fast paced page-turner.",
