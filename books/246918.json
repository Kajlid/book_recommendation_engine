When her father is offered a new job in a new city, Emberlee sees this as a way to finally make friends and finally be happy. After settling into their home on the bay, Emberlee starts getting plagued by visions of people disappearing and being lured to their deaths. Upon a run in with a local herb shop owner, Emberlee discovers that she's a witch, but that's not all she is. She meets a group of half-brothers, who end up showing her their furry side in order to protect her. Emberlee seeks help from a witch just like herself, in order to find out more about what's going on, and how to stop more innocent people from dying.
