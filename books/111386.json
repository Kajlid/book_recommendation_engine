  "description": "Over the course of eighteen books, C. J. Box has been consistently hailed for his brilliant storytelling and extraordinary skills at creating character, suspense, and a deep sense of place. All of those strengths are in the ten riveting stories—three of them never before published—that make up Shots Fired.In “One-Car Bridge,” one of four Joe Pickett stories, Pickett goes up against a “just plain mean” landowner, with disastrous results, and in “Shots Fired,” his investigation into the radio call referred to in the title nearly ends up being the last thing he ever does. In “Pirates of Yellowstone,” two Eastern European tough guys find out what it means to be strangers in a strange land, and in “Le Sauvage Noble,” the stranger is a Lakota in Paris who enjoys playing the “noble savage” for the French women—until he meets Sophie. Then he discovers what “savage” really means.Shots Fired is proof once again why “Box is a force to be reckoned with” (The Providence Journal-Bulletin).One-Car BridgePirates of YellowstoneThe End of Jim and EzraThe Master FalconerEvery Day Is a Good Day on the RiverPronghorns of the Third ReichDull KnifeLe Sauvage Noble (The Noble Savage)Blood KnotShots Fired: A Requiem for Ander Esti",
