  "description": "\"One life will make the difference.\" Macey Holsinger has been hearing that promise her whole life. But it hasn't saved anyone yet, not even her little brother.The disease has claimed countless lives in the last hundred years, and the government is working hard to find a cure through human testing. Testing that has killed nearly as many people as the disease.At sixteen, Macey has better things to think about than saving lives and submitting to any rule other than her parents'. As a budding artist, she has her whole life ahead of her, at least until she faces her own testing.Questions plague Macey. Questions that make everyone else nervous. How can death be justified with more death? What's the point of all this?Answers evade her until she's left with only one question: How much will she sacrifice in the name of the cure? If you liked The Hunger Games or Divergent, you'll love The Cure!",
