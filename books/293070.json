  "description": "They thought my compliance was a weakness. But it was only the beginning of my revenge...  My five bullies kidnapped me.  They locked me away and ripped away everything I had left to give.  Used as vendetta against my father, I'm left ruined and disgraced.  I don't have a future in Eden Falls, but there's no way they'll let me go now - not after what they've done.  I become a prisoner - of my fianc√©, of my father, of my messed up life as an Elite.  My maid told me you can't fix yourself by breaking someone else...  But I don't care about fixing things anymore.  All I care about is breaking up my bullies' twisted gang of Firstborns.  And I won't stop until I've had my revenge on every. Single. One.  ***  A HURT SO SWEET Volume Three is the third book in a series of full-length novels following Pandora Oakes and Dexter Booth. This book ends in a cliffhanger and has dark themes throughout.",
