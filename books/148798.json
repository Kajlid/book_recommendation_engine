  "description": "In Discontent and Its Civilizations, Mohsin Hamid traces the fracture lines generated by a decade and a half of seismic change, from the \"war on terror\" to the struggles of individuals to maintain humanity in the rigid face of ideology, or the indifferent face of globalization. Whether he's discussing courtship rituals or pop culture, drones or the rhythms of daily life in an extended family compound, he transports us beyond the alarmist headlines of an anxious West and a volatile East and helps to bring a dazzling diverse world within emotional and intellectual reach.",
