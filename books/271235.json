  "title": "Toujours Provence",
  "description": "Taking up where his beloved A Year in Provence leaves off, Peter Mayle offers us another funny, beautifully (and deliciously) evocative book about life in Provence. With tales only one who lives there could know—of finding gold coins while digging in the garden, of indulging in sumptuous feasts at truck stops—and with characters introduced with great affection and wit—the gendarme fallen from grace, the summer visitors ever trying the patience of even the most genial Provençaux, the straightforward dog \"Boy\"—Toujours Provence is a heart-warming portrait of a place where, if you can't quite \"get away from it all,\" you can surely have a very good time trying.",
