  "description": "Before Star Wars, there was The Star Wars! This is the official adaptation of George Lucas’s rough-draft screenplay for what would become Star Wars—the film that changed motion pictures and the world. You’ll see familiar characters and places—but not all is the same in this long-ago and faraway galaxy. Still, strap yourself in for high adventure and lazersword duels, Jedi Knights, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and a battle to defeat the evil Empire!* Trade paperback collects issues #1–#8 of The Star Wars.",
