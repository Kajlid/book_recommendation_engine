  "description": "Della is just like any other young woman, struggling to discover who she is and who she is meant to be. She's a student at an unusual school in which orphaned children are taught to manage the beast within. Della and her classmates live with what is known as the Moon Sickness, and as a result, her life is anything but normal. Della and her friends strive to lead normal lives. For them, life as a teenage Turnskin is difficult, to say the least-and Della tends to find trouble without ever looking for it. When she comes across a baby screaming in the middle of the forest, Della is horrified. She takes the child into her own care, at great personal risk to herself and the child. With the school's director breathing down her neck and keeping a close eye on Della, however, taking care of the baby and keeping it hidden becomes increasingly difficult. The director believes that Della can control her Moon Sickness, but the groundskeeper Yancy is lurking around every corner; Della finds herself sinking further into trouble. She discovers things about the school that the director and others thought they had hidden. She also learns truths about herself that she never expected-things that were meant to stay secret. Filled with secrecy, deception, and plenty of teen werewolves, Della's life is a journey where finding out who you really are means questioning everything you thought you knew.",
