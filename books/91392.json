She owns her own home and she has top-of-the-line friends. If she misses the feel of a man's arms around her, she'd never admit it. The shadows from her past are nobody's business but her own.Worldly restaurateur Roland Casey has had his eye on Alana for months, but and now he wants to speed up put their relationship.

Roland has no doubt that he can send her temperature racing, but can he mend her once-broken heart?",
