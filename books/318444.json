  "description": "Introducing Radhika Iyer’s debut collection, Why are you here? Twelve explosive short stories present twelve provoking female narratives. Iyer’s unique style is quirky yet powerful, as she illustrates a sense of otherness, as an immigrant and as a woman of colour. Iyer explores the struggle of being a woman in different cultures, as the stories take us from the harrowing results of a family scandal in Malaysia, to an internal cultural identity struggle in Dubai, to an abusive marriage amplified by the lockdown in Ireland. This collection is ultimately about the female experience, and being different culturally, and in terms of shape and size.The women of these stories face their internal and external battles, and as we follow their journeys, we come face to face with the struggle and the strength of women.",
