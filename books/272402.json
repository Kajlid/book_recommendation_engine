  "description": "My goal with this cookbook is to offer some easy to prepare healthy recipes for children, that will aid in their development. Providing our children with healthy foods is a good, sure way to know that we are attempting to do our part to keep them healthy and happy. It is indeed very challenging for parents to provide for their children on so many different levels, but a good start is making sure that they have healthy foods in their daily diets.Within these pages, you will discover a collection of healthy recipes that will help power your childâ€™s growth and development by offering the right kind of nutrients. With a little planning, you can help ensure that your child is getting healthy meal choices on a regular basis. It can be challenging to accomplish this, especially for parents who work outside of the home.However, I am sure that you will make that little extra effort to make sure your child is not surviving on fast foods and junk foods alone. Most things are best when they are taken in moderation, and this certainly includes junk and fast foods.With this collection of healthy recipes, you will be able to provide your child with a well-balanced diet to help keep them healthy and happy for many years to come!",
