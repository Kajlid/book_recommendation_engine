  "description": "Even psychics have their blind spots.Everyday I deal with personal prophecies and dish out guidance to the poor souls knocking at my door. I answer questions about their love lives, their hidden desires, and all the other incessant queries they can't seem to answer for themselves. And everyday, I do it with a smile on my face when I really just want to roll my eyes or tell them to get off their ass and make a move. Any freakin' move.Have I mentioned, people annoy the crap outta me?Don't look so surprised. You'd be annoyed, too, if you were 2 millennia old and had to deal with the same questions day in and day outâ€”when all you really want to do, is unlock the big gaping hole in your own damn memories.",
