  "description": "You don't have to be a spring chicken to fall in love.The residents of Heartsfield, Arkansas think Lynne Prescott has it all. The wealthy suburban divorcee captures everyone's attention when she blows into town to dispose of the family farm. But her nosy new neighbors don't know she ran away from home.Bram Hatchett's interest in buying the land adjoining his farm is yesterday's news, but the handsome widower's inability to contain his attraction to the land's beautiful owner quickly becomes fodder for the local gossip mill.A rickety old porch and a disturbing decrease in the poultry population bring them togetherâ€”but with wagging tongues and grown children against them, Lynne's inclination toward flight comes smack against Bram's aversion to fight. Can they whittle away the secrets of the past in order to scratch out a future together?",
