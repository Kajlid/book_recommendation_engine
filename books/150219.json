  "description": "From the outside, Dr. Christian Rinaldi has the perfect life. He is a good looking psychiatrist with a thriving practice, more than a dozen best-selling novels, a beautiful home and every toy that a man could possibly want. Sure, he also has a demanding boss, needy friends, recurring nightmares from childhood traumas, a nosy housemate, severe trust issues and a bad habit that he can’t seem to shake, but who doesn’t?   Christian’s issues are slightly different than the average person’s. His demanding boss is the head of a 700 year old secret society of serial killers. His friends? All but two are serial killers themselves. His nightmares are of his foster father who forced him to kill. Even his secrets have secrets. The biggest secret isn’t even that he is a killer. His biggest secret is that he doesn’t want to do it anymore. Unfortunately, his boss doesn’t let his employees walk away.   Special Agent Randy Brooks, Christian’s FBI liaison, doesn’t know anything about Christian’s secret life. He just needs Christian to help him solve their current case – a series of brutal but seemingly unrelated murders. Unfortunately for Christian, to get to the bottom of the crimes, he will have to confront his deepest fears.",
