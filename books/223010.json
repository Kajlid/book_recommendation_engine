  "title": "PHILOSOPHY IN THE BOUDOIR",
  "description": "Philosophy In The Boudoir is the most concise, representative text of all the Marquis de Sade's works, containing his notorious doctrine of libertinage expounded in full, coupled with liberal doses of savage, unbridled eroticism, cruelty and violent sexuality. The renegade philosophies put forward here would later rank among the cornerstones of Andre Breton's surrealist manifesto.This new edition includes Minski the Cruel, a brand-new, unexpurgated translation of a key episode from de Sade's Juliette.",
