I left the life of Cora Mitchell behind, seeking freedom from my real-life nightmare.But my freedom came with a cost. I lived a fictitious life for the next six years, never letting anyone close enough to see underneath the fa√ßade that was Andra Walker.I was content with my simple little life.Until I met Julian.And the moment I started allowing myself to open up, allowing someone to see through the superficial, was the very same moment the Monster from my past would return to find me.",
