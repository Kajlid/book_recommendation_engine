  "description": "Fourteen-year-old Luke begins to realize how much his views of the world and the people in it have changed when he wakes up from a coma after having meningitis. Suddenly he’s seeing two worlds at once. It’s like being in a computer and looking out, seeing first the things on the computer screen, and then the real other world beyond. What’s worse is there’s a strange ugly creature on the screen, who calls himself Dreeg. His voice oozes into Luke’s brain, offering to guide him. All Luke’s senses have changed: He associates days of the week with different colors, and music evokes tastes. He has a newfound way with words and begins seeing his annoying older sister, Laura, as a series of disgusting creatures.Luke is left feeling frightened but intrigued. He seems to be getting better, but his mind is slowly being poisoned by Dreeg. The creature offers him gifts of recovery, the return of his athletic ability, a “dream” girlfriend, and even the power to fly. In return, all Luke has to do is turn against his friends and join in Dreeg’s evil plans.",
