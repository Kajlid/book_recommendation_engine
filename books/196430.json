'G' is a street-smart Latino apprentice who creates radical, in-your-face art work. When these two NY opposites meet, something clicks, and wheels begin to turn. In this unique novel about Mental illness, Art History, and Time-travel, readers will experience Life in the 1960s and Life during the Renaissance (and other Great Periods of Art History) like they never have before! The two main protagonists each escape into their own fantasies (hearing voices, on the part of schizophrenic Sara; imagined interactions with Dead Master Artists, on the part of \"G\"), both ending up in a Compulsive-Obsessional World of Art & Desire!",
