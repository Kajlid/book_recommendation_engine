  "description": "The philosopher Hegel claimed that self-consciousness is desire. That which we covet reveals our true nature. Some lost souls wander the world with their heartâ€™s desire anchored. By daylight, they repress their wanton hunger for fear of revealing their true natures. It is only in the darkness of the twilight hours that the mask slips and desire will have its way. Read thirteen tales written and collected by Jason Andrew of lust, dark desires, and magic from 2006 to 2010.",
