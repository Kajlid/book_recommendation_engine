  "description": "Working the night shift at a five-star hotel in downtown Los Angeles, I get my fair share of weirdos. But none of them prepared me for the night I met Bolt. He saved my life.  Now, he's my super hero--the hunk I'm yearning to thank in more creative ways than a damn kiss on the cheek. Too bad he's actually Reece Richards, my full-on nerd of a real-life boss.  He's got some commitment issues thanks to his evil ex and global empire--and from having to save the city from a maniac out to destroy everything he loves.  But there's something that just may interfere with all those plans. My heart.*****Misadventures is a romantic series of spicy standalone novels, each written or co-written by some of the best names in romance.
