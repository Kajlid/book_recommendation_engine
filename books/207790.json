  "description": "EARTH HAS CHANGED. The old world order collapsed following the meteor impacts of 2031 when fire rained down from the skies, instantly vaporizing millions. Billions more died during the Long Winter and resource wars that followed. Over one hundred years have passed since those devastating events and new societies have formed around the globe. In North America, the fragile peace that exists among the continent’s independent nations and city-states is under threat. The ambitious Grand Guardian of the People's Republic of America is mobilizing his massive war machine in order to make real his dream of reunifying a former great power. But on the eve of the offensive, a leading scientist dies under mysterious circumstances, though not before he entrusts another with the key to unlocking a secret. A secret so powerful, it could not only unravel the Grand Guardian’s designs, but also doom, or save, all of humanity.",
