  "title": "The Noble Gases: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon",
  "description": "The majority of elements on the Periodic Table are able to mingle with other, thereby forming molecules, mixtures, compounds, and new substances. Some elements, however, are \"unreactive\" and don't mix easily with other elements. In this latter category fall the Noble Gases, so-called because they show an almost aristocratic reserve, standing at a remove from other elements. Readers will learn that while aloof, the noble gases have many practical uses including in lasers, blimps, hot air balloons, colorful illuminated signage, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lights, arc welding, window insulation, flash bulbs, strobe lights, and cancer treatment.",
