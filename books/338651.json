  "description": "Olivia Lockhart-GriffinCedar Cove, WashingtonDear Listener,I'm sorry to say that our good sheriff, Troy Davis, has suffered a disappointment in love. He was hoping to marry his onetime girlfriend, Faith Beckwith, who recently moved back to town. Well, the latest is that Faith ended the relationship last month, even though both of them are widowed and available. According to Troy, there were a few misunderstandings between them—some inadvertently caused, it seems, by his daughter, Megan.Troy's got plenty to keep him occupied, though—like the unidentified remains found in a cave outside town. And the break-ins at 204 Rosewood Lane, the house Faith just happens to be renting from Grace Harding….All of that's a distraction from what's happening in my life. I'm going through chemo right now, and I'm so grateful for my husband, Jack, my family and my friends, who give me the strength and support I need to beat this. But beat it I will!I'd suggest meeting at Troy's place, 92 Pacific Boulevard, so we can all talk, but the Pancake Palace is probably a better choice if you want a decent cup of coffee!Olivia",
