  "description": "William was at the bottom of his high school's social ladder. Given the nickname \"Crybaby Bill\" by his peers after a sudden emotional outburst, he had accepted his fate as a friendless loser... Until he joined the Normal Club. Led by the eerily robotic Alyssa Silverstein, the gang of weirdos participates in experiments, discusses love and relationships, and scrambles to put together a talent show performance.As his fourth self-published book, \"Do You Want to Be Normal?\" is a return to a genre that Koji Kojou is comfortable with: school-life comedy. Inspired by Japanese light novels like Oreimo and Oregairu, Koji has crafted an oddball adventure that's sure to warm hearts, and hopefully make people think about what it truly means to be \"normal.\"",
