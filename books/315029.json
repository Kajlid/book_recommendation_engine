  "description": "I have nothing left to give this twisted town, not a single ounce. I’ve let them beat me down, almost break me, but it’s time I fixed my ‘Grady’ jersey, and show them I will do anything to protect what is mine.Trying to survive Knight’s Creek without Xavier, Hunter, and Tobias is harder than I care to admit. I have to give it my all and try again; I have to run.I don’t know how far I’ll get, but I know I won’t give up fighting. I won’t let Ilana win. I never knew what fighting was before, but now I have something to live for. My reason for breathing.I will be more than this town. I will be more than they’ve made me to be, and I refuse to let history repeat itself.But when it comes down to it, will the Allstars be there when I need them the most?",
