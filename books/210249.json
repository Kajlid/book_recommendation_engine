  "description": "Evolution is killing innovation!''Just trust your gut'' is great advice when your instincts tell you to run from a lion in the jungle. But when it comes to thinking innovatively about your business, those same instincts can be your own worst enemy. Cognitive biases—the instinctual mental shortcuts we all have in our brains that shape how we see and respond to the world around us—can also be the archnemeses of innovation/innovative thinking. New ideas appear too risky. Data gets discounted if it doesn't match the hypothesis of the researcher. And even like-minded innovation enthusiasts can find that enacting disruptive change is tough when they all see things the same way.It's time to let go and learn a new way to think.Created by innovation experts, Outsmart Your Instincts cleverly merges behavioral science with business savvy. Using the trademarked Behavioral Innovation™ model, the authors provide an in-depth examination of eight unique biases (Negativity, Confirmation, and Conformity among them) that get in the way of creativity/creative thinking—and show us how we can overcome these barriers and break from the status quo.With clever, thought-provoking activities, accessible writing, and easy-to-follow advice, Outsmart Your Instincts shows us how and why we react to new ideas the way we do, and then—helps us rethink what-we-think. Once we learn to outsmart our own instincts, we can take on challenges as true innovators who rely on all of our brains' powers—not just our guts—and be equipped to outsmart the competition.",
