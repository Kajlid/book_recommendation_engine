  "title": "The Mystic Way of Evangelism: A Contemplative Vision for Christian Outreach",
  "description": "Although each generation searches for effective ways to be salt and light, Elaine Heath argues that the church is currently in an especially difficult place--a dark night of the soul. She calls the church to embrace, rather than ignore, its difficulties and find different ways of doing outreach.Heath brings a fresh perspective to the theory and practice of evangelism by approaching it through contemplative spirituality. By looking to mystics, saints, and martyrs of church history--such as Ignatius of Loyola, Julian of Norwich, St. Francis, John Wesley, Mother Theresa, and Henri Nouwen--she suggests we can discover ways of thinking about God that result in a life of outreach.",
