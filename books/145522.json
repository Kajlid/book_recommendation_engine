  "title": "American Angst: Stories about Lucy & Robin",
  "description": "Intimate, snarky, and completely relatable, American Angst is about two women grappling with love and pregnancy, sex and careers —while attempting self-discovery in a crazy world. Lucy needs to save her family. Robin needs to save herself. These tightly interwoven stories chart their growth as they make their way through Thanksgiving dinners, bad breakups, celebrity scandals and political campaigns. For laughter through tears, don’t miss American Angst, whether you’re new to these characters or you think of them as old friends. (Included in this collection are Lucy’s posts about the 2012 election, which were originally seen on her liberal blog, NovemberSurprises.blogspot.com. There’s new, additional material! Spoiler: Obama still wins.) Bonus: This edition includes an excerpt from The Holdout.",
