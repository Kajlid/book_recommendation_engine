Though petite and delicate usually isn't his type, he finds himself asking her out. Even more surprising? She says no.Paige has a history of being attracted to dominant, controlling men. The kind she swore never to get involved with again. But maybe she's trying to resist the one man who can give her everything she's ever really wanted...Warning: This book contains a feisty little blonde who likes to play with fire and a big wounded hero who won't let her get burned.",
