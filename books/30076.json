  "title": "Reading Water: Lessons from the River",
  "description": "Rivers. Life lessons. Boating culture. This book takes on these subjects and more. Readers will learn about rivers and the people who love them, not only as thrill rides and vacation destinations, but also as rich ecosystems and spiritual wellsprings. As Rebecca Lawton says, \"To those who come to know them well, rivers are home . . . Being on the river every day, all summer, for more than a decade, taught me to read water - to psyche out where rocks hid in riffles, find safe passage in inscrutable rapids, and keep moving in flat water.\" Here are the countless lessons to be learned from rivers and currents, living in the river community, and becoming part of a boating family for life.",
