  "description": "The award-winning cookbook that's not just for vegetarians Carol Gelles, one of the best-known authorities on the subject, offers hundreds of appetizers, entrees, soups, salads, and more, proving that vegetarian cuisine is anything but boring. The flavor combinations are limitless, drawing on the ingredients and spices from every international cuisine. Discussions of vegetables, grains, beans, and soyfoods are interspersed throughout the recipes, making the book easy enough for beginners to follow. And every recipe is coded as lacto-vegetarian (some dairy products), ovo-vegetarian (some egg products), or vegan (made without dairy or meat products).",
