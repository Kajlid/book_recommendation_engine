  "description": "\"All work and no play? Not for this girl. Not anymore. \"Melissa Sparks has had enough. Enough of being an overachiever, enough of having no social life, enough of being lonely. Just this once she wants a change. Something different. Something that looks very much like her business associate, Ben Cowley.Ben is all alone in the deserted offices of Preston Elks. He s gorgeous, he s single and he s been her secret fantasy for the last two years. It s a split-second decision, but there s no going back.When Ben looks up from his desk, the last thing he expects to see is his too-serious, straight-laced colleague stripping naked. It s been a year since his last relationship ended, and though he s still picking up the pieces, Melissa throws his carefully balanced world off its axis. So does her offer: a brief affair, no strings attached.Right about the time he realizes a simple affair will never be enough, she s back in professional mode and clearly as distant as ever. Now it s up to him to show her that what they have is no fluke and he ll do whatever it takes to convince her. Even if it means inviting another man into their bed.Warning: This book contains a man haunted by his past decisions, a woman determined to succeed, sex hot enough to steam up every office window on the block, and a voyeur who gets off watching those windows steam up. \"",
