  "description": "Jayson Wilraven, Captain of the salvage ship Marcene, takes on the job of raising a ship that mysteriously disappeared nineteen miles off the coast of Cuba, only to find he’s being played. Wilraven’s life and the lives of his crew are threatened when the charterer reveals that he doesn't want the sunken vessel lifted, but moved instead into much deeper territorial water to hide it. Two thousand miles away, along the coast of California, Jon Andreden starts underwater trials for Knowledgenix’s next generation of smart machines when a tiny organic-looking submersible rips through the test space, disrupting the trials. Catching the intruder and searching for its builder leads Andreden into an underworld of people who live in the sea—the seaborn, secret naval projects, killers who strike from international waters, and the first rumbling of a war of immortals and monsters over control of the oceans and the future of human civilization.",
