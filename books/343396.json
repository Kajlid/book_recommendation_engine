  "description": "\"This provocative novel explores the charged relationship between a girl and her teacher and exposes what is unclear and inconstant in human motives and behavior. The two discuss a variety of subjects, including whether ants are animals and dogs are really human beings, how to go about sabotaging a rodeo, whether or not a girl should fall in love with her English teacher, and whether cruelty to animals is worse than cruelty to human beings. This droll satire illuminates a variety of moral dilemmas that will prompt discussion among teenagers.\"",
