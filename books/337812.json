  "title": "Jackass: Short Story Collection",
  "description": "Short stories are a unique writing medium and a treat for a novelist and songwriter. Like songwriting, a short story is a way to deliver a punch with a single idea or \"hook\" as the Nashville cats call it.Jackass came from my second trip ascending from the bottom to the top of the Grand Canyon. Hiking the Bright Angel Trail, I saw a lush valley and fertile streams running down to the Colorado River, but the Kaibab Trail follows a dry lifeless but breathlessly austere path that is like no other. I was writing my first novel, The Purple River, at the time and was compelled to take a break from it to allow this tale to unfold.It's a Date is a fun dialogue the vibe of which I heard over and over again in thirty-five years living in Silicon Valley. Trust me, that's really the way it is.Balls on a Brass Monkey, The Seatmate is my lighthearted take on coping with the monotonous drone of political correctness. Lake Tahoe skiing is an enticing backdrop for this humorous yarn.The Blast was written during a fascination with psychic topics like telekinesis as well as a preponderance of tragic events from worldwide terrorism. The story takes a light approach with a hint of the paranormal.Two More Pieces of Pie was written after a long weekend wine tasting with my poker buddies. Yes, we found that Roadhouse near Paso Robles, and yes when the band finished, we jumped up on stage and rocked the house with our eclectic folk/jazz blend of jamming. And yes, there was a granddaughter who jumped on stage to help out between waitress duties. You can't make this stuff up!These are fun stories for your amusement!",
