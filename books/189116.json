  "description": "New York during the dawn of the new Millennium! Punk rock and teenage dreams! And cats...lots of cats. Becoming a great guitarist and being the member of a band: those are the hopes and dreams of a young cat-girl named Amy Edwards. Amy and her friends spend their days hitting up record shops in search of the best vinyl, listening to their favorite bands and playing music. But as the group begins to grow up, things between them begin to change. Their childhood dreams have a chance to become reality, and Amy and her friends have a shot at making it big. However, not everyone in Amy's life seems to be on her side. Will she and her friends succeed? Will the music be enough, or will the pitfalls of life and adulthood get in their way? Written in the style of William Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying\", this is an extended and UNCENSORED version of the story, with bonus material: samples from upcoming books and a fake \"Rolling Stone\" interview with Amy herself!",
