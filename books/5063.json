Ashford Blackburne cannot clear his debts or save his family's estates unless he comes into his inheritance, and his grandfather's will makes it perfectly clear that he must marry and produce an heir by year's end—or forfeit a fortune.

Lark has hidden her fondness for Ash for many years, thinking him above her. But now she must say yes—the Earl of Blackburne won her fair and square in a card game with her father. Ash has promised to educate her well and turn her into a lady fit for his grand house. Yet as Christmas draws near, Lark will teach the earl some lessons of her own...in the ways of love.",
