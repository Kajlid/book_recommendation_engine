  "description": "Bugspray is about Beetles. Not about the flashy show cars, but about the ordinary bugs people drive every day, and treasure as a member of their extended family. It's a book of inventive, low-budget hacks and fixes to keep your bug alive, preserved and even to make a few improvements.This book is the end result of one woman's more than twenty years experience with Beetles, and geared toward things you can do to keep your bug going without spending vast sums of money you don't have.Most of the things described in this book can be performed by a handy woman (or even a man) with the parts currently on your bug.Oh - and the pictures are nice too.",
