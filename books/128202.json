  "title": "The Book of Real and Imaginary Girlfriends",
  "description": "What goes on behind closed doors? What goes on in the shadows of alley ways? This book of erotic poems and fiction from Moctezuma Johnson yanks the doorknobs from the doors and throws the doors open like a Sexual Cowboy busting into a Rough Saloon. Each poem is a spotlight onto a private act. As you read you get to be voyeur to the most intimate moments. You get to see things most people don't want you to, things you have always wanted to see. You get to be the dirty things themselves in this blend of Porno-Literary Madness laced with sexual tension and an overriding sense of longing for women and love. This book chases the history of this sexual deviant's emotions.",
