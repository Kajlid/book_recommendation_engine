  "description": "Troy Delaney has spent her dating years compartmentalizing the men in her life. She never felt the need to settle down or foster any real connections with them. Men were necessary, but interchangeable. They were necessary because \"Like the four seasons each one of them served a purpose\" in her life. They were interchangeable because if they failed to fulfill their purpose they could be replaced by the next man who could.",
