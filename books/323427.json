  "description": "In Biton Savakis’ opinion, following the advice of Cavan’s therapist isn’t working. Refraining from dominant play with an abused submissive trying to heal is one thing. Biton is willing to forgo that part of his life. However, not talking to Cavan about making their arrangement permanent doesn’t make sense.Three months after his new master promises him forever, Cavan is afraid it won’t happen. Although the thirty day contract is long over, Biton hasn’t offered a new one. Nightmares about testifying against his former master don’t make life easier.Just as Cavan begins to understand what he means to Biton, Cavan’s past reaches out to steal his happiness and maybe his life.",
