  "description": "Everyone flocks to see that outrageous orangutan. But all he wants to see is the world beyond the zoo. So whenever his keeper, Mr. Frumbee, leaves his cage open the tiniest bit, Wallace takes off on an adventure -- to the department store, the museum, or even the beach. So it's up to Mr. Frumbee -- with a little help from you -- to find that errant ape within the nine action-packed, full-color panoramas. (And while you're at it, Wallace has six friends who tag along on each of those adventures. Can you figure out who they are and find them in each spread? Here's a Check out the totem pole in the Nature Museum.)",
