  "description": "In this collection of short stories, Starmer turns his attention to the topic of love. But don’t expect any burgeoning passion, glamorous ardour or sweet romance……. Starmer’s take on the subject is much darker than that. Silky, velvety, and soft red wines are chocolate's best friend. When you put together a dark, bittersweet chocolate with a powerful red wine that's high in tannins, whichever one is sweeter will increase your perception of bitter flavours in the other. Yet to imbibe both at once is to invoke a bitter sweet intoxication. Starmer seems to be asking is love real, or just a misguided, selfish delusion that stems from feelings of inadequacy and a fear of loneliness? If you’ve ever felt abandoned, betrayed, jilted or simply left out of all the fun – these tales are for you. Who knows, they may even offer some consolation.",
