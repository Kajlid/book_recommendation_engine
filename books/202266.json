  "description": "Kierra Centerand was once vivacious and outgoing, but that all changed the night her stepfather killed her family in an explosion that authorities wrote off as an accident. Now, ten years later, Kierra has returned to the small town of Briarview to find answers, confront her demons, and see if she can finally move on with her life. Not much has changed, Briarview is still the quaint, charming, small town Kierra left behind. Only now her high school boyfriend, Bryan, is the sheriff, and her stepfather is somewhere in the town, hiding in plain sight.When Bryan Donaldson sees Kierra again for the first time, he is surprised—she’s no longer the fun blonde he remembers, but rather she’s shy, prone to panic attacks, and hiding from the world. When Kierra’s stepfather starts making threats, Bryan is determined to keep her safe in his arms, and in his bed, for life.",
