  "description": "“In this insightful, warm and groundbreaking work of reporting, Abigail Garner addresses the most challenging issues that arise among gay parents and their families.”— Noelle Howey, author of Dress Codes: Of Three Girlhoods — My Mother’s, My Father’s, and Mine Abigail Garner was five years old when her parents divorced and her dad came out as gay. Like the millions of children growing up in these families today, she often found herself in the middle of the political and moral debates surrounding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) parenting. Drawing on a decade of community organizing, and interviews with more than fifty grown sons and daughters of LGBT parents, Garner addresses such topics as coming out to children, facing homophobia at school, co-parenting with ex-partners, the impact of AIDS, and the children's own sexuality. Both practical and deeply personal, Families Like Mine provides an invaluable insider's perspective for LGBT parents, their families, and their allies.",
