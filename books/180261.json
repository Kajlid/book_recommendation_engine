  "description": "Being the daughter of a supernatural monster makes it hard to have friends, especially when your father is determined to make you follow in his footsteps. It’s especially tough at Halloween, but AT makes do with her magical dogs and the local ghosts. And this is almost a life…  …until the Wild Hunt shows up.  On this All Hallow’s Day, they’ll finally be released to pursue their ultimate ambition: hunting down every ghost in the mortal world. The only way to stop them is to venture into the heart of a cursed city and steal the source of their power. That’s hardly a problem for the daughter of a monster–until she realizes she needs more than her magical dogs to get where she’s going. She needs friends, too.  That’s a lot scarier than a cursed city, but if she wants to save the ghosts, she’ll have to find a way.",
