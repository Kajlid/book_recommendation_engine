  "description": "Christopher Beckett is tired of being alone. His wolf is howling for his mate, and Chris knows it is only a matter of time before his needs override everything else in his life. He casts the spell all the Becketts have used to call their mates to them. What he wants is a woman of an older lineage and power equal to his own. And she has to accept the one aspect that sets him apart from almost every other his wolf.What Chris gets is Alannah Evans, a powerful witch of the Evans Coven. The petite, dark-haired woman has no problem with the wolf. What she does have a problem with is the fact that Chris is a wizard. Since wizards and witches don’t get along very well, neither should they, but the sparks flying between them can’t be denied. Chris isn’t taking no for an answer. When it becomes clear that an old enemy has targeted them both, Chris will engage his enemy in a duel that could cost him his life.Or Lana.",
