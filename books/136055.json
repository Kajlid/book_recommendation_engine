  "description": "The Oath “I solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic … “  Defending the Constitution against a foreign enemy? A no-brainer! Defending it against a domestic enemy? That becomes a little more complicated!  Forty years ago, two Naval Aviators took that Oath. Both were shot down over Vietnam and together endured years of torture as Prisoners of War in the infamous Hanoi Hilton.  Tom McGuire is now a San Francisco PD Homicide Inspector. He hasn't thought about the Oath in years. That’s all about to change.  A series of murders of former anti-Vietnam War protesters bring the two men’s lives together once again.  The Oath that once made them brothers-in-arms, now forces them into an explosive confrontation – a confrontation where shared histories will have little say in who survives.",
