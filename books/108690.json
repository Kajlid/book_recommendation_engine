  "description": "Heaven Mistrusts Him. Demons Fear Him. Only One Woman Will Love Him. Kaiden, a Security Guardian in Archangel Michael's army has never really been accepted-he's always on the outside looking in and he prefers it that way. Channeling his rage and injustice at life (and afterlife), he and his team ruthlessly track down demons on Earth and annihilate them from existence. When he learns that Zarok, a demon he sent back to Hell three hundred years ago has resurfaced, Kaiden vows to vanquish the demon for good. His mission becomes complicated when a beautiful human soldier witnesses a massacre by Zarok and gains the demon's attention. Miranda \"Randi\" Elon, a wounded war veteran, returns home from Iraq only to watch a deranged killer slay her two physical therapists while she stands trapped in the shadows. No sooner has the murderer left when Kaiden shows up with his exotic good looks and bullying demands. She has to decide if she can trust Kaiden to protect her or listen to the voice in her head telling her he's more than what he seems. Kaiden must figure out how to keep the existence of Guardians and demons a secret while also trying to contain his attraction for her because relationships between Guardians and humans are forbidden. But when Zarok targets Randi as his next victim, is his willingness to break every rule enough to save her in time?",
