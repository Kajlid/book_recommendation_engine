Billy Gogan, American, opens with recently orphaned Billy Gogan fleeing Ireland on the eve of the Great Hunger — either because he is the son of a dangerous revolutionary, or because his cousin doesn't trust him around his daughter.

Billy searches for them in the dangerous Five Points, ground zero in the collision of Americans, ex-slaves, and Irish refugees.Here, Billy completes his education. Already able to declaim Cicero and construe Aristotle, he learns voting fraud from Bill Tweed, the future head of Tammany Hall. Charlie Backwell teaches Billy the numbers game. Finally, Brannagh O’Marran, the beautiful mulatto daughter of the Irish madam of Gotham’s finest knocking shop, teaches him about love.Billy eventually finds Máire and Fíona, and the three of them plan their future together. But that future is taken in a cruel stroke, and Billy must flee for his life.",
