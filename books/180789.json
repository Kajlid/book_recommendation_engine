  "description": "The dramatic conclusion to the Rewind Agency Saga starts now. If you loved scifi like the Continuum and Orphan Black, you're going to flip over Lara Crane.  Life was easier in the cage, now Lara Crane’s life is under a microscope.  She thought she was out, ready for a normal life, but with the Feds endless questions and tests, Lara realizes she might never be free.  Things would be worse if not for Donovan. They promise to ride it out together as Lara is fitted with a time travel restraint, designed to not only stop her, but to save her life as her mind spirals out of control. No more second chances. No more time travel to revert everything back the way it was once before.  As the danger increases, so does Lara’s headaches and nightmares. Her brain is desperate to be free, loose, and as the future begins to flash all around her, Lara is terrified the end might be near.  And maybe she doesn’t have a future at all.
