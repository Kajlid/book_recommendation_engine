  "title": "Palaplia",
  "description": "More than a decade after the defeat of the ancient demon Forla, Dominhydor is at peace. With King Palaplia governing in the east and Queen Yven and Prince Telinhe in the west, Hohmara and Lyraera are united, renegades are coaxed into retirement, and war seems like a distant nightmare. But not everyone is content with peace, and a secret that has haunted Palaplia since childhood threatens to break free.  In the third installment of the Tales of Dominhydor, an unlikely foe rises against the sovereigns of Dominhydor, a deadly race that long laid dormant is hatched, and the truth about the battle between Yaliwe and the Dark Lady starts to unfold.",
