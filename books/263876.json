  "title": "Ordinary Mind: Exploring the Common Ground of Zen and Psychotherapy",
  "description": "Is meditation an escape from--or a solution to--our psychological problems? Is the use of antidepressants counter to spiritual practice? Does a psychological approach to meditation reduce spirituality to \"self-help\"? What can Zen and psychoanalysis teach us about the problems of the mind and suffering?Psychiatrist and Zen teacher Barry Magid is uniquely qualified to answer questions like these. Written in an engaging and witty style, Ordinary Mind helps us understand challenging ideas--like Zen Buddhism's concepts of oneness, emptiness, and enlightenment--and how they make sense, not only within psychoanalytic conceptions of mind, but in the realities of our lives and relationships.This new paper edition of Magid's much-praised book contains additional case study vignettes.",
