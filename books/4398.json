Alexander Steele, Nick’s boss and lover, grows impatient and threatens to strip Nick if he doesn’t cooperate. But Nick has a very good reason for keeping his shirt on -- a notorious tattoo that would reveal his criminal past. The last time someone discovered his secret, Nick had to abandon his life and begin anew. This time around, Nick can’t bear the thought of leaving everything behind -- especially Alex. Is there anything Nick can do to avoid from having his secret exposed, or will he be forced to start again?",
