  "title": "One Hundred Demons",
  "description": "In this graphic novel that's part memoir and part creativity primer, Lynda Barry serves up comics that delve into the funk and sweetness of love, family, adolescence, race, and the hood. Name that Demon!!! Freaky boyfriends! Shouting Moms! Innocence betrayed! These are some of the pickled demons you'll meet as Lynda Barry mixes the true and the un-true into something she calls \"autobificitionalography.\" From her nattering and intolerant/loving Filipina grandmother to the ex-boyfriend from hell who had lice,Â Lynda Barry's demons jump out of these pages and double-dare you to speak their names. Called by Time magazine \"a work of art as well as literature,\" One Hundred Demons has been hailed for its shimmering watercolor images and unforgettable stories about life's little monsters.",
