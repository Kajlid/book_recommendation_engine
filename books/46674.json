  "title": "Fairwil: Wilfair Book 4",
  "description": "Fairwil follows Los Angeles hotel heiress Fair Finley and her two handsome motel-managing neighbors, Gomery and Monty Overbove, as they attempt to solve a caboodle of metaphysical mysteries (like if a whole world is beneath their feet, where the guys’ parents are, and if Fair and Gomery will ever kiss beneath the diving board that sits at one end of the motel’s swimming pool). Movie stars, teleportation, kittens, balloons, finding one’s power, mystery, club sandwiches, stringless banjos, and intimate handholding round out the humorous and heartfelt coming-of-age tale.",
