We were rolling down the highway at sixty-five miles an hour, a trailer full of miniskirts and leather jackets latched onto our deluxe truck – the one she had insisted we buy so that we could have more than a bunk in back during the long hauls.“Leave me where?” I asked.

One of us staying behind was impossible.“Not where, you idiot. I’m leaving you for Kent.”“Kent who?”“Sir Kent…you know, the guild leader.” She turned her computer to face me and I saw the buff, tanned avatar of our Guild Wars guild leader.
