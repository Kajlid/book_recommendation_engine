  "description": "She walked away from him once…Struggling to live with her decision to walk away from the only man she ever loved and watching helplessly while her brother succumbs to his battle with severe PTSD, NSA analyst Claire Tierney’s life is at an all time low. The final hit comes when she accesses classified information at work that might get her fired. Instead, she’s assigned to a joint taskforce charged with hunting down a Taliban assassin planning an attack on American soil, and finally has something productive to focus on. Until she meets the rest of the team and learns she’ll be working with the last person on earth she wants further contact with; her ex. She knows letting him go was the biggest mistake of her life, but just when she thinks things can’t get any worse, new intel points to the assassin’s intended target. Her.  This time he’s not letting her go…As a former Special Forces Master Sergeant and second-in-command of his Titanium Security team, Gage Wallace can handle anything, except being forced to go through life without Claire. When she abruptly walked out on him six months ago, his whole world caved in. It’s clear she’s still determined to keep her distance, but when she’s named a possible target of the very cell they’re trying to dismantle, Gage will stop at nothing to ensure she’s safe. When tragedy destroys Claire’s defenses and the explosive desire between them ignites once more, this time he’s not letting her go. Too late they discover that the danger confronting them is far greater than anyone ever realized, and it’s a race against time to stop a terrorist from unleashing hell on them all.",
