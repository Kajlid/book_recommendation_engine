𝑰𝒕'𝒔 𝑱𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝑯𝒊𝒈𝒉 𝑺𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒐𝒍.⠀⠀Here’s the 411 about high school—well, at least for my high school, Clintwood Academy.⠀⠀💋It’s a fucking warzone.⠀💋Everyone has a grudge against someone else. ⠀💋It’s the breeding ground for losers, jealous broken-hearted girls, and acne covered fools with zero game.⠀💋The disgustingly rich kids are vile, vindictive, popular, and the mecca of a social life worth a damn.⠀💋Lastly, high school is simply survival of the fittest.⠀⠀And I was the fittest of them all. Once.⠀⠀Once, before I set up to take the fall for an attempted murder of one of the Fitz brothers, the golden boys of St. Jude High, our sworn rival enemy.⠀⠀Before I was played for a kiss and it worked. ⠀⠀Now, the Fitz brothers hate me.⠀They suspect me.⠀They want to destroy me.⠀They know everything about me, and I hate them for it.⠀⠀And now, we’ll all be living together, like one big, happy step-family. With secrets brimming, hatred festering, and other feelings I have no business having for my step-cousin-brothers or whatever, haunting me night and day.⠀⠀Now, let’s kiss and be forever rivals…⠀",
