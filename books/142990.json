She gets a pair of pliers, yanks off her dental cap, and calls Drew on his after-hours emergency number.When Drew shows up with his stylish leather doctor's bag, and snaps on his latex gloves, the dental procedure goes horribly wrong and the romance goes surprisingly right.Once Meenie's tooth is repaired, the only thing left to fix is the enormous problem she won't admit she has.
