  "title": "I Was A Teenage Know Nothing: Illustrated Version",
  "description": "Illustrated Color VersionDating, motorcycles, car races, and The Movie Theater Club await you. Life can seem rough for a young man growing up. There are lessons to be learned, experiences to be had, and emotions to be tested. Not all of which will have a positive outcome. Through the lens of youth, all may seem over-dramatic at times. He must rely on his soul, and then what he assumes is instinct, to guide him along the way. Take a journey back to a time before Amazon, smartphones, and streaming media dared exist. A time known as the early 1990's. It may seem simple today, but to someone who has lived it, the world surrounding a teenage-know-nothing could be turbulent and confusing. Patience and optimism must be found somewhere and somehow along the way.",
