  "description": "London is rife with impoverished French nobility who have escaped the horror of the French revolution and journeyed to England to enlist the help of their fellow Catholics. Quentin de Morlaix, already sympathetic to these disenfranchised French aristocrats, finds that he too has his own personal reasons to pray for an end to the Revolution. He sets off for France, and enters a life of confusion, mystery and suspense â€“ and bloody execution.",
