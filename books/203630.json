  "description": "She might be on her way to becoming a lawyer, but that doesn’t mean Devon Hart plays by the rules. And when one night, she bumps into a man fleeing a crime scene, she’s intrigued and feels compelled to lie for him. When a number of chance encounters between them turn intrigue into something much deeper, Devon must choose between what's right and what's terribly wrong. All the while, she’s preparing for her father’s wedding to a woman she despises, looking after her recovering drug addict brother, and deflecting advances from another law student at her college. How far will Devon go for a man she's fallen for but barely knows? Black Roses is the first book in the Black trilogy romance, and it reminds us that love can be dark, funny, and all encompassing.",
