  "description": "Jesse and Eric have ten minutes to save the world. In those ten minutes, they’re supposed to dive into a massive video game universe, track down an all-powerful madman, and stop his evil plan before it’s too late. Sound impossible? It’s super impossible. There will be fire-breathing pterodactyls, angry green giants, and unicorns that shoot lasers out of their hooves. If Jesse and Eric are going to survive long enough to fight the final boss, they’ll need to rely on each other like never before. Do they have what it takes? The clock is ticking.",
