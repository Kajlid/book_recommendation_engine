  "title": "The American Civil War and the Wars of the Industrial Revolution",
  "description": "The social and political changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution transformed everything from the balance of power between nations to arms manufacturing to battlefield tactics and strategy. Using three wars as examples -- most dramatically the American Civil War -- trace the development of land fighting and the effects of higher command during this period of tumultuous technological change. Unlike histories that downplay the connection between the outcome in the United States and the conflicts in Europe, this one reveals their interconnection.",
