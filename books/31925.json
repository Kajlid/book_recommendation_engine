  "description": "An epidemic that transforms humans into zombie-like creatures has swept over the eastern United States and quite possibly the world, and Flex Sheridan doesn't like it one bit. In an effort to save his younger sister, Flex re-connects with perhaps the strongest woman he knows - Gem Cardoza, his former girlfriend. Together they take his six-year-old niece Trina, the only uninfected survivor of his sister's family, and his infected sister Jamie, and make a run from central Florida back to his isolated home in Lula, Georgia. As they head north, they encounter another uninfected, Hemphill \"Hemp\" Chatsworth. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Hemp is British, and extremely smart. He holds a degree in Epidemiology and Mechanical Engineering, both of which this group will need. Along with the crossbow-wielding Charlene \"Charlie\" Sanders and a pregnant Great Pyrenees dog, this small group uses street smarts, book smarts, and technology to defend against the new \"Abnormals\" that walk the earth. But Hemp is also compelled to learn how they got this way, and if possible, how to reverse the condition and save Flex's sister. So grab your machine gun and take a ride in their fortified vehicles and mobile lab; you're going to want these people on your side when the Dead Hunger...
