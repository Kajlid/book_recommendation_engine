Living in a beautiful cottage with her two adorable-sometimes-kids in an idyllic village, on good terms with her ex-husband, and with friends all around, everything is going just fine. But when she meets her new boss, her peaceful world is thrown into delightful, exciting, and frustrating chaos. Tyler is perfect for Lottie, but her kids do not agree. To make matters worse, the handsome and mysterious Seb appears on the scene, intriguing-and distracting-Lottie and charming her children, making it more and more difficult for her to make up her mind... \"Very nicely done... Jill Mansell's chorus of sharp-witted youth, shaking sticks at the foibles of their elders, is delightful.\" -Daily Express\"A smashing read that both delights and surprises the reader.\" --The Sun Praise for Thinking of \"Mansell is like a Michelin-rated She may use common ingredients, but under her sure hand the results are deliciously superior.\" -Kirkus\"Humorous, sometimes poignant...

Mansell excels at creating relationships that are dynamic and complicated.\" -Savvy Verse and Wit",
