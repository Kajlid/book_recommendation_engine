Again working undercover as private detectives, the two mingle effortlessly among the ship's other passengers. Soon after it leaves port, the vessel is battered by severe weather that confines the passengers to their cabins. Then one of the passengers vanishes, complicating already unpleasant circumstances.Feeling that the man was simply swept overboard in the storm, Dillman and Genevieve soon come to wonder if his disappearance is in any way linked to the presence on board of a record shipment of gold bullion - twelve tons in all - sent from the Bank of England. Rich in atmosphere and turn-of-the-century historical detail, and populated by a lively assortment of characters from all walks of life, 'Murder on the Mauretania' is a magical novel of romance and suspense.",
