  "description": "This is a new edition of a major document from World War II with additional, previously unavailable texts assembled from the stenographic record of Hitler’s informal conversations ordered by Martin Bormann. These texts remain the classic collection of Hitler’s nighttime monologues with his entourage, covering mostly nonmilitary subjects and long-range plans. Hitler lets his thoughts wander, never failing to provide an opinion on every subject. Additional documents from various archives make this the most complete English-language edition in print.",
