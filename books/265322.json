  "description": "What will endure…love, revenge, or Archibald?It’s the summer of 1990 in West Vancouver. Maggie, a 23-year-old nursing school drop-out, has just started a job as a live-in personal assistant to Archibald, a flamboyant, elderly novelist with a quick wit, sharp tongue, and a penchant for nasty practical jokes. In between picking up his medications and groceries, Maggie desperately tries to hold the unravelling threads of her life together. She’s stuck between the competing attentions of Sam, the young building caretaker, and Michael, the rich, successful novelist with an enigmatic past. At the same time, her seemingly straightforward (albeit aggravating) relationship with Archibald takes a shocking turn. Buried secrets are exposed and ugly truths revealed. Archibald has taken one step too far. Pushed over the edge, Maggie decides to plot revenge against her employer. Archibald Full Frontal is a hilarious, no-holds-barred story about becoming an adult and finding your feet, by any means necessary.",
