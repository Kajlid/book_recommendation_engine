  "description": "Violet Pham can see sounds. She believes she was born to become a painter, but after being labeled as good-for-nothing by everyone around her, she questions that belief. As she falls deep into the pits of depression, the colors around the sounds become a curse rather than a gift. With her future unsettled and her family mired in debt, Violet decides to run away from everything. Turner Nguyen—the gang enforcer tasked with browbeating Violet’s mother—is the last person she should turn to. However, her impression of him changes after he escorts her out of town, away from her troubled past. She finds herself increasingly dependent on him, but with his gang's political conflict reaching its climax, Turner can barely steer his own life. And when salvation comes at the cost of morality, a wrong decision can send them down the path of destruction.Sets in 2010s Vietnam, 'The Color of Your Voice' poses the question of universal expectation toward traditional social class, gender roles, and mental illness. Following the love story of two individuals walking on the knife's edge between chasing their dreams and surrendering to their fates, Daniel Newwyn’s debut novella is bound to break some hearts.Disclaimer: 'The Color of Your Voice' is a novella set in Vietnam, dealing with heavy themes such as prostitution, drug trafficking, and depression. The author in no way encourages or glorifies prostitution and drug trafficking.",
