  "description": "This book, Vol. 2, is part of \"To Move A Mountain - The Series.\"\tSummit accompanies \"To Move A Mountain.\" After several defeats, and many disappointments, Arrancies reaches a plateau in his early 20s. Summit is the beginning of his thoughts. Here, he lays the groundwork of his future, oblivious to his fate. In part one \"Common Ground,\" his rudimentary descriptions seem childlike and rehashed, some, on the brink of clichés. Still, his underlying grasp and knowledge are infinitely deeper as he discovers the basis of human behavior in preparation for a new vision. Suddenly, as with many unexpected events in life, he dies, his life released into the cosmos, returning home, to our origin. However, this is only the beginning. Realizing that his death is temporary, he retains the experience in memory. Messages and visions, like glimmers of life, flash in a blur through his mind as he travels at blinding speed at the source of our energy. These messages appear as notes, unedited in part two of Summit, “The Book Of Explanations.” His descriptions are the messages he received as the foundation for what he is about to learn. Also, for what we are about to witness through his eyes.",
