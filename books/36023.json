But Danny manages to escape the worst of the hounding thanks to genetic treatments that mask his werewolf side. So far, he’s been able to live the privileged life of a vampyre. Vamps are society’s elite, while wulves like Danny’s father are less than second-class citizens.

Now his new girlfriend, a human named Juliet, is wondering what’s wrong with him. She’s asking questions… questions he can’t answer.  If his fears turn out to be true, everything in Danny’s life could be destroyed. Is there any way he can get through the next full moon without everyone finding out what he really is?Set in a paranormal world not too far from our own, Peter Moore crafts an unforgettable coming-of-age story that will raise readers' hackles.",
