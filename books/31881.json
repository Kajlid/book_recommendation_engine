  "description": "Edwin A. Abbott (1838â€“1926) was a schoolmaster and theologian well known as the author of the religious and mathematical allegory Flatland (1884). This book was originally published in 1913, forming the second part of two volumes on the historical significance of various elements of the Bible. The elements analysed within the books are diverse, ranging from differences of phraseology between the Gospels to the significance of ritual. The key aim is to contextualise these elements as a means of gaining a greater understanding of the meaning behind the Scriptures. Both books will be of value to anyone with an interest in Biblical exegesis and the history of theology.",
