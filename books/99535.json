  "description": "\"A beautifully written, engrossing family epic...\" Kirkus ReviewsFrom a mill town in eastern Canada to a convent in the French Alps, from the heights of the Himalayas to the jungles of Southeast Asia, and an opera house in Sydney, Strum is a sweeping tale told against a backdrop of forbidden but enduring love, war, and the legacy of six generations of a family torn by tragedy but bonded by a music destined to reunite them. It is an intricate cross-cultural tale with damaged, yet deeply compassionate and ultimately human characters, each discovering along their paths the inevitable hardships of passionate love, cultural boundaries and heartbreak, before experiencing redemption. Bernard, a deaf young woodworker, is drawn into an old growth forest in rural Qu√©bec by the spirits of his Iroquois and European great-grandparents, where he witnesses a colossal 800-year old cedar fall literally at his feet. He nearly loses his life salvaging a portion of the great tree to craft two instrument worthy of the music he hears. His creation of two exquisite guitars imbued with the spirits of Isabelle and Walk Tall sets in motion a complex yet intimate story of love and loss across six generations, intricately woven with the threads of an unifying theme of music. Strum gives us a glimpse into a very personal North American-European-Asian universe that reads like biography, historical fiction, romance, fairy tale, ghost-story, travel-guide, music appreciation text, and prayer all at once.\"A richly human, spiritual and magical tale of family, love, struggle and redemption... an audacious and marvelous first novel...\" The Fairy Poet of New York",
