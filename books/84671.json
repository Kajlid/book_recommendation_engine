  "description": "Nebraska sheriff, Dewey Truet wishes for a more exciting police career than barking dogs and domestic disputes. Life is good in small-town, Nebraska, but a car chase once in a while would be nice. Kicking in a door would get his blood flowing. Anything would be more exiting than deciding if he should get rainbow sprinkles or chocolate glaze on his donut. A woman's doorbell rings and she's alone and frightened. Can she trust the man at the door? He seems so kind…and handsome. She lets him in. Another man is watching them from the tree line. That man is filled with rage and vengeance. The next morning, a shed is on fire, a man is bludgeoned to death, and a dead blow hammer stained with blood lies by his side. Sheriff Truet arrives at the scene. The woman is missing. Murder and abduction—there's real crime in his county now. Turn on the cherries and crank up the siren, Sheriff. Your wish for something more exciting has just come true.",
