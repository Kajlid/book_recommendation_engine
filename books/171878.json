  "description": "Michael and the rest of the Electroclan are facing their greatest crisis yet. The resistance movement has been compromised. The safe house has been destroyed. The voice is in hiding, and they have no idea if their families are alive…or dead. What they do know is that the Elgen won’t stop until they’ve destroyed the Electroclan.And the Elgen are on the move. They’ve launched a new assault on the small island nation of Tuvalu. If they are successful, it will be the first domino to fall as part of Admiral-General Hatch’s master plan to take over the rest of the world. But cracks are beginning to appear in the ranks of the Elgen elite, and while Hatch still rules with an iron fist, there are signs of dissent. Could he find himself facing enemies within and without? Or will he strike first?If the Elgen are beginning to turn on one another, can Michael and the rest of the Electroclan use it to their advantage? Or is it just a trap to destroy the Electroclan once and for all?The stakes have never been higher, and Michael and his friends are about to be tested in ways they never imagined.",
