  "description": "Losing your virginity is a big deal, but voluntarily offering it up on a silver platter at an exclusive sex club . . . that’s just messed up. It was dark, and in my defense, he was tall, muscled, and smelled like the most tempting sin.I couldn’t resist, and the second he touched me, I knew I was never going to be the same. It was a night filled with the kind of intensity a woman could only ever dream of. Nothing could have tainted such perfectness. At least . . . that’s what I thought.Because the delicious man I let rail me into oblivion isn’t the perfect stranger I thought he was. No, he’s anything but. The man who growled desperate filthy words in my ear and made my skin shiver with desire is a man I’ve known and craved all my life.My brother’s best friend.Izaac Banks has been off limits since the beginning of time, going out of his way to make sure I know that he’s unattainable. But despite my brother’s objections, I love him. I always have, and now that I’ve had a taste of the sweetest forbidden fruit . . .There’s no turning back.I need more, and there’s only one way to get it—I’m going to offer him an ultimatum he simply can’t refuse.",
