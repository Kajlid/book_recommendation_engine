  "description": "It's Christmas time, and all the kids are talking about the presents they hope to get. It's also Chris's eleventh birthday--which he figures will get lost in the Christmas shuffle as it usually does. And this year, with his father out of work, there probably won't be any Christmas presents either. But Chris's family also observes another holiday. It's called Kwanzaa, a seven-day celebration of African-American heritage. If it weren't for Kwanzaa, Chris might be spending all his time feeling sorry for himself. Instead, he's busy making some very special presents for the holiday celebration-- a celebration that puts magic in the air, transforming it into a time of discovery. And Chris and his family are about to find out that with the celebration of a great ancient heritage, they will find a future full of happy surprises.",
