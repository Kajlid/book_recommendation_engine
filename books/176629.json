  "title": "Samurai: Cherry Blossoms Fall",
  "description": "Samurai commonly describes a warrior in Japan who serves a lord, using combat skills and living by the code of Bushido. But not everyone followed the code so directly, nor was every samurai so bold and courageous. So while the truth is somewhere between the idealized icon of fidelity and bravery, and bullies with swords, this work features the samurai who lived by their code. Through short story, poems, and quotes, this work is meant to evoke, however briefly, life from the viewpoint of the samurai.",
