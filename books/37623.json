  "description": "The breathtaking suspense of Kiss the Girls and the authenticity of N.Y.P.D. Blue: Welcome to James Patterson's classic superthriller, Black Friday. A courageous federal agent, a powerful and resourceful woman lawyer - only they can possibly stop the unspeakable from happening. New York City is under siege by a secret militia group - and that's just the beginning of the relentless terror of Black Friday.\nI love to lose myself in a thriller â€” especially the rare one that moves along like an out-of-control freight train. The thriller that actually got me started writing was The Day of the Jackal.\nWith Black Friday, I wanted to concoct a shamelessly manipulative story that the reader couldn't wait to finish, but didn't want to end. Now get on this freight train!--- James PattersonOriginally published in 1987 as Black Market, also by James Patterson.",
