  "description": "Two weeks ago, 20 year old Rachel Kain vanished on her way home from classes. Now she's back, strange designs cut into her skin and no memory of what happened. With no memory and minimal evidence, the case looks destined to go cold. It's well known that Rachel will do anything to protect her little sister. She's been looking after Renee for most of their lives. This time, however, Rachel has a much larger task cut out for her. Now she knows - all those nightmares Renee has had are all real. There's a world of shadows just underneath ours, and Rachel has been there. She knows what torments her sister at night. She just doesn't know how to stop them. Between parents that like to pretend the nightmares don't happen anymore and shadows that taunt them by night, Rachel and Renee have found themselves in a fight for their lives and their sanity. They do have allies - the soldier Gabriel and his artist friend Amy, who seem to know more about this world than they let on. Most importantly, Rachel might just have more than an ally in a creature of the shadows, the one who protected her those two weeks they tried to destroy her - the dragon who is called Chunio. The more Rachel fights to protect her sister, the more she realizes this was never about Renee to begin with. This has always been about her, Chunio, and what they are capable of together. Every choice has a consequence, and Rachel's choices will change her far beyond what she ever thought possible.",
