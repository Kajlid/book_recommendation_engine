  "title": "Prey By The Ganges",
  "description": "1948. A cold, rainy night in a forest across the Ganges, deep in the heart of eastern India. An unarmed man with anger in his heart and a fortune on his person. A handsome Thakur with evil on his mind and blood on his hands. Both chasing a rare diamond, but for completely different reasons. There are the others too-the Thakur's beautiful wife, the sleazy psychopath, the angry muscleman and the corrupt dairy manager's stunning daughter. Each is a pawn in this bizarre game of life and death, and each with a story to tell. Or hide.",
