  "title": "In the Company of Others",
  "description": "Father Tim and Cynthia arrive in the west of Ireland, intent on researching his Kavanagh ancestry from the comfort of a charming fishing lodge. The charm, however, is broken entirely when Cynthia startles a burglar and sprains her already-injured ankle. Then a cherished and valuable painting is stolen from the lodge owners, and Cynthia's pain pales in comparison to the wound at the center of this bitterly estranged Irish family. In the Company of Others is a moving testament to the desperate struggle to hide the truth at any cost and the powerful need to confess. Of all her winning novels, Jan Karon says this \"dark-haired child\" is her favorite-a sentiment readers everywhere are certain to share.Another stirring page-turner about Father Tim—this time set in County Sligo—from the bestselling author of At Home in Mitford, Somebody Safe with Somebody Good, and other books in the Mitford Series.",
