  "description": "TV producer Rand Jennings isn't looking for love -- he's looking for a flirty female contestant for his reality show, The Fishbowl. Pretty bartender Lissa Pembroke is bright, outgoing, and the perfect \"Fish\" to play the part. Although sparks fly between them when Rand approaches her with the role, she wants nothing to do with him or his show ...Law student Libby Pembroke is too busy with school and work to have time for love -- or reality TV. She's temporarily switched places with her identical twin sister Lissa, balancing Lissa's job with her own studies and preparing for a summer internship. So while the handsome and charming Fishbowl producer knocks Libby off her feet, there's no way she's going on national TV, and acting like, well, her sister.The irresistible chemistry between Libby and Rand can't be ignored, however, and soon Libby discovers that pretending to be Lissa gives her a freedom she's never known before. She goes on the show to be close to Rand, even though Rand still thinks she's the \"flirty\" twin.When Libby decides to reveal the truth, will Rand forgive her deceptions? Or will exposing her secrets -- and her heart -- ruin everything?",
