Jeff Ryan shares the story of how this quintessentially Japanese company found success in the American market. Lawsuits, Hollywood, die- hard fans, and face-offs with Sony and Microsoft are all part of the drama.  Find out about:  *\tMario's eccentric yet brilliant creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, who was tapped for the job because was considered expendable.  *\tMinoru Arakawa, the son-in-law of Nintendo's imperious president, who bumbled his way to success.  *\tThe unexpected approach that allowed Nintendo to reinvent itself as the gaming system for the non-gamer, especially now with the Wii. Even those who can't tell a Koopa from a Goomba will find this a fascinating story of striving, comeuppance, and redemption.",
