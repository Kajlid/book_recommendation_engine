A man of few words who undresses me with his bedroom eyes. He's beautifully flawed with a past as mysterious as his scars. It wasn’t what I planned, but Cassian seized me— heart, body, and soul. He's my first. He's my everything. I fell for him. Then I found out his secret. He's not my protector. He's my worst mistake.  ----- CASSIAN I'm in love with my enemy's daughter. She was young.

A girl whose joy cracked through my armor. I couldn't hurt her. When I met her, my plan shattered. She was mine. She brought light to my endless night. And I was destined to destroy everything that made her shine.  \nAuthor's Note: A moody, overprotective bodyguard bends his rules for the girl he's supposed to hate.
