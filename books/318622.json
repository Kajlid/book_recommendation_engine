  "title": "The Vikings",
  "description": "The Vikings hold a particular place in the history of the West, both mythologically and in the significant impact they had on Northern Europe. Magnus Magnusson’s indispensable study of this great people presents a rounded and fascinating picture of a nation who, in modern eyes, would seem to embody striking contradictions. They were undoubtedly pillagers, raiders, and terrifying warriors, but they were also great pioneers, artists, and traders—a dynamic people, whose skill and daring in their exploration of the world has left an indelible impression a thousand years on.",
