But the breathtaking detective was strictly by-the-book and had no use for Colt's easygoing renegade style. Thawing the heart of this enticing ice goddess just might be the toughest challenge Colt had ever faced.\nNight Smoke\n - He had a reputation for being abrasive, aggressive and annoying -- but if Natalie Fletcher was going to save her business, she needed arson investigator Ryan Piasecki's help. The classy executive was accustomed to being in control and Ry's arrogance was utterly infuriating -- and oddly irresistible. Only, as the sparks flew, danger was hot on their trail.",
