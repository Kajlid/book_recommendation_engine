  "description": "Pleasure is what I enjoy the most. I can have anything in the world that I want, as many men with power do, but with power comes great responsibility.I'm to do as I'm told if I want to keep my life the way I like it, so a contract was presented to me . . . but not any type of contract--a proposal. I'll marry the woman he picked for me, although it doesn't mean we'll have any sort of connection other than in the eyes of the law. I don't expect it, but I will welcome it if something does transpire between the two of us. With enemies to keep at bay, nothing is for certain.",
