  "description": "My arch nemesis is my new fake boyfriend. Can you say drama?\nI should be a glitter bomb of excitement about my college friends getting married. But all I can think about is running into my uber-successful ex and his new boyfriend at the wedding…while I’m flying painfully solo.I need a plus one, stat. Enter Raleigh Marshall.As luck (or misfortune) would have it, a picture of me and South Rock High’s too-blessed-to-be-stressed football coach accidentally finds its way on social media, making people believe we’re an item.Raleigh is hot, charming, and one of South Rock’s most popular teachers. The problem is that he knows it. He also seems to derive a twisted pleasure from getting under my skin.Yet once we stop bickering long enough to have a conversation, I have a hard time remembering what I hated about him.Pretending to be in love with Raleigh Marshall will be my toughest role to date. But…am I still pretending?Drama! is an enemies-to-lovers, fake boyfriend, theater nerd/football jock romance filled with humor, heart, and hot guys. Everett and Raleigh will put the A-plus in HEA, and like all good students, there’s no cheating. It’s the second book in the South Rock High series, which revolves around a found family of nerdy gay high school teachers, but can be read as a standalone.",
