  "description": "Lesbian Fiction: Romance Crime - Sequel to Conflict of Interest. Sex crimes Detective Aiden Carlisle is slowly getting used to being in a committed relationship with Dawn Kinsley-a relationship that isn't always easy since Dawn is not only a psychologist but also a former victim in one of Aiden's cases. Aiden's private and professional lives collide when Dawn's newest patient gets in trouble with the law. Will she be able to stay objective enough to solve the case without pushing Dawn away? The same case also throws Deputy District Attorney Kade Matheson's well-ordered life into chaos. In the last few years, Kade has taken case files and law books, not lovers, to bed. She has been focused only on her career and fought hard to win cases like Dawn's, but now the case forces her to finally face her attraction to women. She suddenly finds herself with two secret admirers-but which one is more dangerous, the threat to her life or her heart?",
