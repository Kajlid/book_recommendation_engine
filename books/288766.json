  "title": "How Ike Led: The Principles Behind Eisenhower's Biggest Decisions",
  "description": "How Dwight D. Eisenhower led America through a transformational time--by a DC policy strategist, security expert and his granddaughter.Few people have mad decisions as momentous as Eisenhower, nor has one person had to make such a varied range of them. From D-Day to Little Rock, from the Korean War to Cold War crises, from the Red Scare to the Missile Gap controversies, he was able to give our country eight years of peace and prosperity by relying on a core set of principles. These were informed by his heritage and upbringing, his strong character and his personal discipline, but he also avoided making himself the center of things. He tried to be the calmest in the room, not the loudest. So instead of seeking to fulfill his personal desires and political needs, he pursued a course he called the \"Middle Way\" that tried to make winners on both sides of a situation.In addition, Ike maintained a big picture view on any situation; he was a strategic, not an operational leader. He also ensured that he had all the information he needed to make a decision. His talent for envisioning a whole, especially in the context of the long game, and his ability to see causes and various consequences, explains his success as Allied Commander President. Then, after making a decision, he made himself accountable for it, prizing responsibility most of all his principles.Susan Eisenhower's 'HOW IKE LED' shows us not just what a great American did, but why - and what we can learn from him today.",
