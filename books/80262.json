  "description": "Something's rotten in Ludlow, Pennsylvania. Something in the water. It's turning townspeople into thoughtless apparitions, pale and lifeless reflections of themselves--the Brethren--who serve the Angel in the Depths, crave only the Light in the Dark. Led by the shadowy Mal Lazarus, who is intent on taking over the town, the Brethren stalk through the streets and alleys of Ludlow, taking victims to the Mercy River, where they face something far worse than death. Standing in their way, a handful of people--a photographer, an art teacher, a high school student, a priest, a federal agent--all try to stop the Brethren from taking over Ludlow, all try to prevent Lazarus from realizing his dire dream in the service of the Light in the Dark. But is it too late for the town, and, in the end, too late for them?",
