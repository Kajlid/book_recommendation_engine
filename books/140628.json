  "description": "I’m beyond pissed off with Callum Connors. Yeah—THE Callum Connors, star of my favourite TV show…and all my most private fantasies.He’s a self-confessed Dom, and he wants me, even though I told him outright that I’m not interested in submission or in him.But then I kissed him.What possessed me? I don’t even remember who started it, me or him—just that I brushed against him, and then we were on the way to third base in the middle of the set.Maybe I should have told him no again afterwards, but I just wanted to escape before he tried to take it further. I didn’t think I’d be able to resist him.I still don’t.Now he’s somehow thrown us together for two whole weeks, getting the studio to temporarily change my job from set decorator to his personal assistant. I can live with being his assistant, but I am not his damn submissive.No matter how sexy he is.",
