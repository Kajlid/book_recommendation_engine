  "description": "One man looking for love in all the wrong places. Another always in the wrong place. Brokenhearted and love-scorn, Johnny finds himself forced back into the dating pool by his overbearing mother and meddling best friend. Is it fate, interference, or a dating app glitch that keeps pairing him with his complete opposite, a handsome brick mason with a smile that makes bad decisions worthwhile? While Aiden is seemingly perfect inside and out, Johnny is a realist. There's no way that man's peanut butter goes with Johnny's clumsy, nerdy jelly. If only he could convince his libido and the determined brick mason that he's not on the market, he could get back to his safe, solitary life. Aiden wants more than just being a pretty face and a night of fun after years of fumbling through encounters that never went deeper than the surface. When he meets Johnny, something behind the skittish photographer's snarky facade speaks to his wanton heart. There has to be a reason they keep crashing into each other in more ways than one. Maybe attraction isn't supposed to make sense and love, even less. An MM romcom about the ripple effect of broken trust and learning to love yourself before you can love another.*TW - mature language, graphic consensual sexual content, discussion about assumed biphobia",
