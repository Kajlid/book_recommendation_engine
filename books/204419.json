  "description": "The story brings out womanhood at its best in the context of the contemporary times – for India, and for the world as a whole – the quintessential womanhood being a fine balance between the characteristics of sacrifice, forbearance and loving on one hand; and the characteristics of strength, perseverance and the fighting-spirit on the other hand. The two friends, Sharmi and Ankita, are characters with whom any woman in these times can relate to – one who overcomes through time a sense of insecurity and a desperate craving for love and affiliation, to become a self-confident, yet somewhat an introvert, individual; the other who blossoms from a bubbly and playful child to a highly confident and extrovert, though whimsical, individual.",
