  "title": "A Taste of Oz",
  "description": "This is a parody of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Of course, we all know the story: Dorothy is off to see the Wizard to seek his help in getting out of Oz. Along for the ride are the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, who believe the Wizard will grant their wishes too. Itâ€™s just a matter of a little stroll down the Yellow Brick Road. Or so they think. But does the Wizard have other plans? Did Glinda set them up? And what if Toto turns out to be the greatest threat of all?",
