  "description": "Andi O'Day believes her mundane, corporate lifestyle can satiate her desires for more in life...until the caress of two supernatural men reveals a dark underworld of new possibilities. One that Andi may never escape from. Or want to. First, she must come to understand her own heated origins.  Wicked Demons is an extremely steamy, dark fantasy, reverse harem, erotic insta-love/lust romance full of hot situations, devilish twists, and cliffhangers. This is a short novella series. Each book is a fast-paced, quick read.*2021 edits and storyline updates*Note from author: I hope you enjoy Andi's sexual journey as she discovers the truth about herself and her family! Book one has a lot of sex. A LOT! But I promise the plot thickens as the series progresses. Book one shows how easy it would be for Andi to surrender to the sway of her emotions, as well as to these men. But Andi is no pushover. Her inner strength is tested at every turn, and her story will not end where you expect it to.Wicked Demons is currently NOT available on a retail platform, but is free to read on Wattpad profile @RVAsher.",
