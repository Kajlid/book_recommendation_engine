  "description": "Poised to at last escape the treacherous planet of Skaith, the swordsman Eric John Stark falls victim to a grim betrayal that turns old allies into dogged enemies. Chased through dangerous jungles and across predator-infested seas, the fugitive warrior dodges death at every turn in Leigh Brackett's final science-fiction masterpiece. Talented enough to co-write The Big Sleep film with William Faulkner and imaginative enough to pen the original screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back, Leigh Brackett is a giant in the science-fiction field, and Eric John Stark is her finest character.",
