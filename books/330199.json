  "description": "One week. No names. No expectations.That was our agreement. We were supposed to walk away after our time in Hawaii was over. No matter what.That was before…Before I learned who she is.Before I realized how interconnected our lives are.Before I fell in love.But our love isn’t the stuff fairy tales are made of.Demons lurk around every corner.Good doesn’t necessarily prevail over evil.And the knight in shining armor may not save the day. Not if her murderous ex-husband has anything to do with it.But Julia’s never been the type of girl who needs a knight in shining armor to save the day.She’s the type of girl who will pick up her own sword and fight for what she believes in.I just hope she’s finally learned to believe in herself.",
