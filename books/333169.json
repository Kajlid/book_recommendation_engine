  "description": "From the West, Chinese coolies push the Central Pacific Railroad into this barren wilderness; from the East, rawboned Irishmen drive the rival Union Pacific closer to a historic meeting in the Mormon's land. But warpainted Shoshoni wait above the mountain passes, while below a ruthless landowner sabotages America's spectacular transcontinental plan. To Toby Holt, son of legendary wagonmaster Whip Holt, falls the challenge of keeping law and order. Beside him, his stalwart friend Rob Martin. Behind him, a sinister stranger who threatens the lovely Clarissa Holt and tempestuous Beth Martin with a legacy of murder and shame... while amid the rainbow canyons and everlasting hills, brave pioneers make manifest a mighty nation's greatness.",
