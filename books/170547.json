  "description": "The famous detective Piet Van der Valk has been kicked upstairs to a quiet desk job to work out his days until retirement. But he is still the maverick of the Amsterdam police force and too restless for paper work alone. A seemingly minor incident -- a young man concerned about a gold antique watch -- sets him off on a personal investigation that also involves his engaging French wife, Arlette. It is she who embarks on a quest that leads through the rarified world of art and antique dealers to a squalid sex shop -- \"The Golden Apples of the Hesperides\" -- as she scours Amsterdam for a nameless, faceless killer.",
