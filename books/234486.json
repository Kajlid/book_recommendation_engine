  "description": "On a planet with three women for every man, eugenicists believe Teakh Noahee is innately nurturing, monogamous, and altruistic. Teakhâ€™s DNA, coded for altruism, may hold the key to male survival on the harsh ocean planet of Fenria. He could father a generation of men willing to sacrifice themselves for others, but Teakh has no knowledge of the plans. Unaware of his value as a sperm donor, he loses his virginity and a spoonful of his seed to a mysterious trio of women. They are succubi, professionals who sell semen on the black market. True to his genetics, Teakh falls in love with one of them. Determined to assist in raising his children, he rebels against the Fenrian matriarchy and sets his own course, founding a new clan that treats men and women as equals, all for the love of the woman who cheated him.",
