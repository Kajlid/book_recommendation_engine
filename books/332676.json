But there’s a catch: first, they have to live together for ninety-two days.Winter is determined to dislike her rival, but soon finds Hannah isn’t what she expected at all. Thanks to a hilarious doormat war, a cuddle dare from Winter’s half sister, and a kiss in the most unusual of places, the frosty fortress around her heart begins to melt.Will she be able to accept that love might be just a touch away? 120,000 wordsTags: enemies to lovers romance, forced proximity romance, ice queen romance, opposites attract romance, roommate romance",
