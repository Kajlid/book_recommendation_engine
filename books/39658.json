Now they are coming to the end of a road trip which has taken them from their family farms in the rugged Victorian high country to the red dust of the Queensland Outback. For almost a year they have mustered cattle stations, cooked for weary stockmen, played hard at rodeos and danced through life like a pair of wild tumbleweeds. And with the arrival of Patty's brother Will and Bella's cousin Macca, it seems love is on the horizon too..Then a devastating tragedy strikes, and Bella's world is changed forever. So she runs from the only life she has ever known. But can she really turn her back on the man she loves? Or on the land that runs deep in her blood?",
