  "description": "David R. Bunch's short, idiosyncratic stories have, almost invariably, been met with varying degrees of outrage from readers unwilling to work with his convoluted prose to reach the plot that to most is opaque. In his own way, Bunch is one of the most original and creative writers in the genre, and it is unfortunate that the conservative bent of most readers is such that he is not given the attention he deserves. - 20th Century Science-Fiction WritersContents:• The College of Acceptable Death • In the Time of Disposal of Infants• They Never Come Back From Whoosh!• That High-Up Blue Day That Saw the Black Sky-Train Come Spinning• Any Heads at Home• Routine Emergency • A Vision of the King• Training Talk No. 12 • Moment of Truth in Suburb Junction • Breakout in Ecol 2• Riders of Thunder • Somebody Up There Hates Us • In a Saucer Down for B-Day • Let Me Call Her Sweetcore • In the Jag-Whiffing Service • First Day, First Job, Girl • In the Empire• Awareness Plan • A Small Miracle of Fishhooks and Straight Pins • The Survey Trip• Up to the Edge of Heaven • Control• On the Sunniest Day of Spring • Please Help!
