  "description": "A hilarious record that no Durrell fan will want to miss. - Sunday TelegraphIf you looked you would think that his mind was full of beautiful and poetic thoughts...A ball of food would make its appearance at the base of the long neck and would travel upwards with all the majesty of a department store lift. The ball was generally the size of a coconut and would end its travels by rolling into his mouth. A satisfied expression would replace the look of thoughtful genius and Peter's lower jaw would recommence its monotonous movement.A loving chronicle of jitter-bugging gnus, singing duets with a bear, stealing eggs to feed the Arctic foxes, practising tiger sniffs...Highly entertaining and informative. - The TimesDurrell manages to convey not only that he loves animals, but that he enjoys life too - and wants you to enjoy it with him. - Daily MirrorCover Illustration: Arthur Robins",
