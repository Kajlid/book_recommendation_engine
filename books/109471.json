  "description": "When Mary McCarthy wrote Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, a friend told Bettijane Eisenpreis, only half in jest, that she should write “Memories of a German-American-Jewish-Pennsylvania Girlhood.” And she did.From Generation to Generation: The Longs of Wilkes-Barre is a series of stories of a family – German Jews who migrated to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in the mid-19th Century, and in the words of the Bible, \"were fruitful and multiplied.\" It traces the fortunes of Great-Grandpa Simon Long from his birthplace in Bavaria to his own tiny corner of the New World. There his family grew, prospered, and told stories of the old country and the new. Author Bettijane Long Eisenpreis listened and has added a few tales of her own in this marvelous family history. Our fascination with genealogy is growing, as evidenced by the popularity of the TLC program “Who Do You Think You Are?” and the tremendous success of Ancestry.com. Into this moment in time, we introduce Bettijane’s tales, which will delight nostalgic readers of all ages.",
