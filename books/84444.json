  "description": "Unreachable. Dell Rosales gained her nickname, “inalcansable,” or “unreachable,’” the old-fashioned way, earning it with every new rip in her heart.Unwanted. Dell returns home to salvage her father’s ranch by opening the place to a group of girls with problems and pain not unlike her own. With her outlook on love soured--perhaps beyond salvation--she clings to Becky, the tiny little girl whose own mother preferred a life of drugs and men to motherhood. Unwinnable. Former DEA agent Jovani Treviño has seen that the war isn’t winnable: people keep dying. Drugs keep killing them. But pleas for help from the DEA make him agree to one last battle for the good cause—checking out heiress Dell Rosales, whose ranch on the Rio Grande provides a perfect spot for traffickers to cross if she allows them to. Unattainable. Suspicions, passion, and their respective pasts draw Dell and Jovi into a tumultuous relationship that both must to avoid. Love seems distant, foolish to seek--unattainable. When an epic flood threatens not only Dell’s ranch but the surrounding area, will anything survive?",
