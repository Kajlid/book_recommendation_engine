  "description": "Dear Author,He’d lost everything dear to him in one devastating moment. His family turned their backs on him; his friends no longer took his calls. It was the one moment that he was totally true to himself, the moment he told them that he was in love with another man.With all of that loss you’d think the universe would be at least a little nice to him… no, the man he loved so dearly and risked everything for was on his couch with the twink from downstairs.Is it bad that I had a hard time holding in my elation? I have wanted him from the moment I saw him. Could it finally be my time? Could he ever really want me?Please give us our HEA.Photo Description: The photograph shows a close-up of two young men from behind. Both are wearing white tank tops.
