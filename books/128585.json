  "title": "An Aviator At Heart",
  "description": "All he wanted was to fly. A teenage pilot with an itchy throttle hand, a DaVinci-esque knack for sketching, and four generations of aeronautical heritage can’t wait to manifest his passionate aversion to the ground. He sees every hard earned dollar as a tick on the Hobbs meter. Every unencumbered swath of dirt is a potential landing strip, legal or not.  His head literally in the clouds over airplanes and girls, the young Aviator can’t take a hint. Oblivious to the opportunities and history right under his nose, his jaunts over the Cascade Mountains of Washington State to fly 1940s era taildraggers at Evergreen Field land him in the company of local aviation legend, Wally Olson.  Three decades later, the reminiscent Aviator gets 20/20 vision from Dr. Hindsight.  Over 250 pages including 120 illustrations offer a uniquely personal account. Contact me for autographed copies.",
