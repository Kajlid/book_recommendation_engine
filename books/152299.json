  "description": "Bobbie's room is full of stuff—SO full, that it's hard for her and her \"best cousin,\" Joanie, to find space to play. When Bobbie's mom gives her a two–week deadline to clear out the clutter, Bobbie has an idea–instead of taking stuff out of her room, she brings garage–sale finds and other glamorous garbage in. Will Bobbie transform the chaos into a beautiful big–kid room? This title weaves together three appealing letting go of toys and dealing with a messy room, turning trash into treasure, and recycling and repurposing—a part of every school curriculum from kindergarten up.",
