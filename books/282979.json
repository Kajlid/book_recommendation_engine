  "description": "What started as homework ended in fireworks.Emma has one foot out of her small Southern town. She spends her weekends memorizing facts and figures and spending time with Alex, her best friend, while she still has time. In six months, they’ll be out of there.Nonetheless, every day that the quiet, determined high school senior hops in Alex’s hand-me-down car and goes to school, she spends more time within the confines of her favorite books than hanging out with the high school entourage—that is, until an English project becomes so much more than an assignment.Suddenly, with the help of a bad boy on a horse, Emma embarks on a journey to find herself and escape her comfort zone, all the while learning lasting lessons about friendship and the power of love. Yet, in the end, she has to make the choice—to love or to leave?",
