  "title": "Do You Think What You Think You Think?",
  "description": "Is your brain ready for a thorough philosophical health check? Really, it won't hurt a bit...Is what you believe coherent and consistent? Or is it a jumble of contradictions? If you could design yourself a God, what would He (or She, or It) be like? Can you spot the logical flaw in an argument (even if it's hiding from you)? And how will you fare on the tricky terrain of ethics when your taboos are under the spotlight? If all this causes your brain to overheat, there is a philosophy general knowledge quiz to round off with. Do You Think What You Think You Think? presents a dozen quizzes that will reveal what you really think and what it all adds up to (brace yourself: it might not add up to what you expected). Challenging, fun, infuriating - sometimes all at once - this book will enable you to discover the you you never knew you were. Think of it as an MOT for your mind.",
