  "title": "Brighton Rock",
  "description": "In this classic novel of murder and menace, originally published in 1938, Graham Greene lays bare the soul of a boy of seventeen, whose shadow seared the lives of the men who followed him, who walked the bright esplanade of tawdry Brighton with apathy on his face and murder in his heart, and whose ruthless crime is tracked by a singular woman who cared little for convention and a great deal for fair play. Pinkie, the boy with death at his fingertips, was not just badâ€”he worshiped in the temple of evil as his parents had worshiped in the house of God. Crime, in his dark mind, was a release so deep and satisfying that he had no need for drink or women or the love of his fellows. He is an astounding character, sinister and fascinating. Brighton Rock is a novel of profound psychological mystery and chilling suspense, a novel that, when it is finished, seems to have been injected into the veins.",
