Combining art deco style with pulp fiction sensationalism, the more than 150 movie posters in Cine Mexicano are culled from the Agrasánchez Film Archive--the largest print collection of its kind. With a bilingual introduction that surveys the history of Mexican cinema, Cine Mexicano is an unforgettable exploration of gorgeous graphic art and exotic cinema at its finest.",
