  "title": "The Red Badge of Courage",
  "description": "The Red Badge of Courage is much more than a story about the Civil War. It reveals the secret insecurities and deep-rooted anxieties of a young man as he gropes toward maturity and manhood. It delivers one of the most powerful statements against war that can be found in all of literature. It is a hymn to a special kind of courage, the ability to raise a heroic figure from the ashes of cowardice. In short, it is Stephen Crane at his best.This Enriched Classics Edition contains a 48 page Reader's Supplement prepared under the supervision of a distinguished editorial committee. The center insert Supplement contains a biographical background of Stephen Crane, a historical background of the story, a pictorial background of the Civil War and more.",
