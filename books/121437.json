  "description": "They are here among us . . . Far from home, gifted with special abilities, hunted for their powers. And they are desperate to find their other, the one who completes them . . . before it's too late . . . Sometimes, Time Really Does Stand Still Mila Adams has always known she was different. For as long as she can remember, she has had the ability to shift time, and who would believe that? Certainly not the obnoxious blind dates her mother keeps foisting off on her. But Mila can't help feeling there's someone out there for her, a soul mate who might understand her unique ability. And when she looks into the dark eyes of financial whiz Garrick McClellan, she can't but feel her time has finally come. Any man would lust after a beauty like Mila, but the moment Garrick touches her-feels her shifting time just as he can-he recognizes her as his partner in power. Their connection is immediate, passionate, raw, and beyond anything either has ever experienced. But who are they? What is this gift that joins them so intensely? Are there others like them? And why do they feel that time is running out? Praise For The Novels Of Jessica Inclan \"A magical, mystical tale, one you won't soon forget\" -Amanda Ashley on Reason to Believe",
