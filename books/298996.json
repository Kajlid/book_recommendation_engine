  "title": "The Debutante Divorcee",
  "description": "In 2004, Plum Sykes jet-setted to bestellerdom with Bergdorf Blondes, a wholly entertaining debut novel that introduced readers to the glamorous world of Park Avenue Princesses, and became an instant sensation. With THE DEBUTANTE DIVORC\"E, Sykes again delivers the wit, humour, and sociological observations that made Bergdorf Blondes such a memorable smash hit. Lauren Blount's life is beautifully arranged: she's very rich, very young, very thin, very pretty-and very, very divorced. The most reckless and glamorous of Manhattan's Debutante Divorce set, Lauren captivates newlywed Sylvia Mortimer. But while Lauren sets out on a morality-lite, orgasm-heavy Make Out Challenge, Sylvia discovers her marriage isn't exactly an Eternity ad-especially when the city's most notorious Husband Huntress zeros in on her spouse. Navigating a world of Divorce Showers and Power Christenings, Socialite Babies, Professional Friends, Gorgeous West Village Wives and Un-Googleable Men, Sylvia fears her husband is straying and starts asking, as Lauren says, Who needs a husband anyway With her delightful mix of playfulness, cheek, and satire, Sykes has written a second novel that promises to be every bit as beloved as her smash debut.",
