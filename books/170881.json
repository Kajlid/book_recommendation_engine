  "description": "How do we tell the good from the bad when they look the same? Elemental Witch and Magic Shop owner, Samantha Hawthorne, faces her future with the knowledge she was raised, taught, and groomed by the very evil responsible for the disappearance of her mother. Threads of Arcane Magic linger alongside the guilt Samantha endures for killing an innocent in her failed pursuit for revenge. Now Clerics, the Witch’s Judiciary Branch, appear and request her aid in proving the self-appointed Witch Queen of New Orleans possesses the rumored Malleus Maleficarum, The Witch’s Hammer. They believe her command of the book’s Arcane power is responsible for the death of three Witch Elders. But something else is rising in the city as reports of ghost sightings and evil shadows increase. Faced with a lingering fear her own use of Arcane Magic has tainted her in some way, mounting pressure with the threat of a warlock from the Clerics, and suspicion that the evil that escaped her is still influencing her decisions, Samantha calls upon her friends to weave their unique magic together to stop the rampage of Elemental Shadows. Elemental Shadows is the second book in the Eldritch Files series.",
