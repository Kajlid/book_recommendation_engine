  "description": "Sometimes willpower isn't enough.Cam Social anxiety's been my constant companion for twenty-three years, sometimes in the background, sometimes silencing me and yanking my guts out in the nearest trash can. No matter how much I love playing music, I'm never going to get up on a stage and perform in front of a crowd. But since I met Erik, and was asked to join his band Hellsbane, that knowledge hurts worse. No heart (even Erik's) or dick (even Erik's) is big enough to carry me past my limits, but God, I wish there was a way.ErikLife's damned unfair when a guy with the voice of a hard-rock angel and a songwriting talent like Cam's can only post anonymous videos online. But you can't cure anxiety with wanting, or willpower. My drummer needs to quit trying to push Cam onstage with us before he breaks. Rocktoberfest's still our goal, and touring with Hellsbane was my only ambition, until I met Cam. Now I can't have everything I love in one place, but dammit, I wish there was a way.A first-times, life challenges, coming out, rockstar romance. Hidden Blade is part of the multi-author The Road to Rocktoberfest 2022 series. Each book can be read as a standalone, but why not read them all and see who hits the stage next? Hot rockstars and the men who love them, what more could you ask for? Kick back, load up your kindle and enjoy the men of Rocktoberfest!",
