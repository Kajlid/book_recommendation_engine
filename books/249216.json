  "description": "When Bite Me! was first released in Fall 1998, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was two seasons old, the characters were still in high school, and Buffy had just killed her soul mate, Angel. Four years later, the show is still a smash hit and a critical darling; Angel has returned and then gone on to his own eponymous spin-off show; Buffy has graduated from high school, entered university, found a sister, lost her mother, and died only to be resurrected in the sixth season by her friends. Now on UPN, the former WB show is the top-rated non-WWF show on the network. It has appeared in almost every critics year-end top 10 list, and every time Emmy season rolls around and Buffy is snubbed again, critics use their column space to lambaste the academy for its shallow vision. Bite Me!",
