  "description": "This bounty hunting tiger has a curvy girl in his sights…  Jace is tall, dark and handsome. He’s also a super rare tiger shifter, with orange eyes and a keen sense of justice that has him constantly on the hunt for the worst criminals in the shifter world. When a particular case brings him in contact with a beautiful, vulnerable woman needing rescue, he has no choice but to step in and offer protection. But the longer he spends time with Amber, the more he isn’t sure he can ever let her go. And that’s dangerous for a man in his position.  Amber never expected to be in this situation. An average woman working on her degree in special education, she has no idea who would kidnap and target her. She only knows that the hot, leather-wearing man who rescued her and is now guarding her is the sexiest thing she’s ever seen. And somehow, he seems to want her too. If only he wasn’t holding back so many secrets, maybe they could actually have a chance…  As Jace and Amber work to discover who is behind it all, they find themselves drawn closer, into hot kisses and hotter nights. But as much as Jace is coming to realize that Amber might be his mate, he also knows his life is too dangerous for someone as precious as her to be in it. Somehow he has to stay focused and keep them both safe, even if the only target he truly wants to capture is her heart.",
