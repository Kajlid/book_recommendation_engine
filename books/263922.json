  "description": "Life is a series of moments.Like making my first million—it was amazing, but nothing compared to the moment I saw Emery. She was the one…the game changer. The long-time, self-pronounced bachelor was ready to give it all away with one look, and luckily, she felt the same. We fell in love despite the haters and laughed at the nay-sayers who swore we would never work. It didn’t matter to us that we were from different worlds.We loved each other and the life we had planned. It was perfect. Until they took her away from me.The moment I saw her life leave her eyes, I became something she would never recognize. Revenge colored my world, and nothing would make me happy until I filled the hole Emery left behind. Years of searching, of fighting against those who wronged me and punishing others who never deserved my wrath led me to Willow Summer’s door. Something shifted, leaving me to wonder if I’d release her from her pain, or if she’d release me from mine.Love created a monster, and maybe now, love can set him free.",
