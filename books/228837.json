Written with wit and gripping insight into what it takes for young individuals to stand up for what is right, The Adventures of Lola is dazzling in its magic and excitement.  To thirteen-year-old Lola, the world is not a very magical place. She often gets in trouble, whether it’s with her parents, who find her rich imagination a bit tiresome, or at school, where the teachers see her as being far too dramatic. But Lola knows she is meant to do more in life, like maybe save the day…someday.  But when Lola and her friends realise that something disastrous is about to strike their town, they gather their strengths and are determined to solve the mystery. Their sleuthing soon brings them all the way to the King, who is less than pleased with Lola’s fearless hunt for the truth.  As Lola struggles to remain in the good graces of the people in her life, she starts to realize just how unique she truly is…and just how magical her life might actually be.",
