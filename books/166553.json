  "title": "Self-Aware: A Zombie Series With A Fresh Twist!",
  "description": "In this original thriller about a zombie who wakes up Self Aware, Stephanie Bradford finds herself torn away from everything she's ever known and loved, only to be thrust into a harsh and unforgiving world where anything goes. Her one saving grace is that she has a mutated version of the zombie virus that stands her apart from the rest. Instead of death and decay, her mutation regenerates and heals, but at a cost that maybe to much. Praise For This \"Romance, Companionship, Gore, Humor, Suspense, Betrayal, Violence...this book has it all!\" \"I'm giving Self-Aware five stars because I enjoyed the time I spent reading it. That's what I read a book for - enjoyment of the story. And Mr. Wolff told a GOOD story. It was compelling, it pulled me in, and he made me care about the characters. Sympathizing with a zombie, even! Who knew?!?!\"",
