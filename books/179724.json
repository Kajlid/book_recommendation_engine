  "title": "The Narrator",
  "description": "“Michael Cisco is of a different kind and league from almost anyone writing today, and The Narrator is Cisco at his startling best.” —CHINA MIEVILLE, author of Perdido Street Station “An extraordinary story of war and the supernatural that combines the creepiness of Alien with the clear-eyed gaze of Full Metal Jacket. Like The Other Side if it included soldiers who could glide over the water, a mysterious tower right out of early David Lynch, and infused with Kafka’s sense of the bizarre. Destined to be a classic.” —JEFF VANDERMEER, author of the Southern Reach trilogy “The Narrator is not a subversive fantasy novel. It eliminates all other fantasy novels and starts the genre anew. You must begin your journey here.” —NICK MAMATAS, author of Move Under Ground and Love is the Law",
