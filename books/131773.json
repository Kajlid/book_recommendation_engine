  "description": "SO IT GOES… When security guard Edward Waters is arrested for aiding and abetting a known fugitive, former college roommate, Citizen \"Cid\" Goodman, is shocked. The ‘Eddie’ he knew was ambitious, studious and straight-laced - the kind of guy you could depend on with your life, your money or your girlfriend. But what really pricks Cid’s conscience is how quick the local media and the public are to label Eddie as a criminal, trying him in the court of public opinion where he is guilty until proven innocent. Cid sets about the task of reconstructing Eddie’s story, from his time as a dedicated college student to the moment he is arrested, in an attempt to alter public perception. But as the case unfolds, and fantasy intersects with reality, the line between guilt and innocence blurs.",
