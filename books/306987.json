  "description": "Gods. Angels. Myth, right? Nah. Kary's about to find out they're all real. And she's one of them.Kary thought she was a normal human girl. She didn’t think anything strange about the cliched way her adoptive parents found her on their doorstep one night. That is, until she meets someone (something?) that shows her otherwise and she begins having visions of past lives. Visions that look a lot like the myths she never believed in and that reveal that everything bad that’s been happening was her fault to begin with.",
