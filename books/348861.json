  "title": "Secret and Suppressed: Banned Ideas and Hidden History",
  "description": "There are two ways of looking at the world. You can take the morning paper at face value and believe the world oscillates between the dumb-show of \"left-wing\" and \"right-wing\". Or you can begin to question this national hypnosis. A guidebook to alternative views of contemporary events and world history, Secret and Suppressed confronts the reader with disquieting revelations on mind control, secret societies, media disinformation, cults, and elite cabals. The hard evidence supplied by many of these articles is startling. Other entries veer into the twilight realm of paranoia, speculation, and horror. If you believe that ignorance is bliss then Secret and Suppressed is sure to make you very unhappy.",
