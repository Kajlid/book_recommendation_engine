One enchanted sword.The lives of well-born twins Kismet and Taso are easy and carefree--endless days of bedding women and fighting battles among the gods--until sorcery drives a wedge between them that slices deeper than flesh. Kismet has striven to be the ultimate warrior, but a mistake costs him his brother, his family, and his homeland.He carves out a new life in the desert, rising to the command of a realm and an army, yet can't escape his past. When two women beg for his aid against tyranny, he must sacrifice his freedom and his long-scarred heart to help them.Swords and Scimitars is a 7,000-word short story (approximately 25 pages) about the immortal founders of verdant Teganne and desert Kad, rival realms divided by magic and bound by blood, mistrust, and love. The celebrated Alaia Chronicles series continues with the fantasy romances Sword and Lute, The Source of Magic and Kismet's Kiss.",
