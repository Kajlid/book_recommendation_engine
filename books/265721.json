  "title": "The Case of the Banishing Spell",
  "description": "If you could banish something in your life, what would it be?  When a local innkeeper calls Penny in to investigate a bloody paw print, Penny suspects that foul play is afoot. With the help of her telepathic cat, PI Penny takes on the case.  One clue leads to another, and soon Penny suspects that magic beings could be causing the trouble! Who else would she call on for help but her smokin’ hot neighbor, Dr. Max Shire -- who has a PhD in all things magical and happens to be a vampire?   At the same time, Penny and her coven of witchy sisters are learning the Banishing Spell. The problem is, it’s not really going well! In fact, it’s going terribly. Each attempt leads to worse results -- until the sisters are tempted to give up altogether!  Can Penny banish trouble from her little mountain town?",
