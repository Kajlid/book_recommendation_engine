  "title": "You Saved Me, Too: What A Holocaust Survivor Taught Me About Living, Dying, Fighting, Loving, And Swearing In Yiddish",
  "description": "Aron Lieb approached Sue Resnick at a Jewish Community Center fifteen years ago, and found a companion and soul mate who was steadfastly by his side for the rest of his life. You Saved Me, Too  is the incredible story of how two people shared the hidden parts of themselves and created a bond that was complicated, challenging, but ultimately invaluable.   Sue was first attracted to Aron's warmth and wit, such a contrast to his tragic past and her recent battle with postpartum depression. Soon she would be dealing with his mental illness, fighting the mainstream Jewish community for help with his care, and questioning her faith. The dramatic tension builds when Sue promises not to let Aron die alone. This book chronicles their remarkable friendship, which began with weekly coffee dates and flourished into much more. With beautiful prose, it alternates between his history, their developing friendship, and a current health crisis that may force them to part.",
