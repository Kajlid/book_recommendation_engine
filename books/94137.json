  "description": "Delight in the gothic charm of these dainty little dolls and their peculiar pets! Four wide-eyed little misses, cute in a creepy way, model a variety of colorful, old-fashioned frocks. Raven, Skye, Marigold, and Rosie echo the macabre appeal of the Addams Family and the drawings of Edward Gorey. Dress them in their ruffled outfits and send them to play with their saucer-eyed poodle, deer, and hedgehog.",
