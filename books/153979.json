  "description": "Like the Broadway show tune, Daniel Fine prefers his relationships to be for “One Night Only”— hot, hard, and gone the next morning. Daniel is looking to never, ever be in a relationship again. He’s been there, done that, and has the scars to prove it. And then he meets Steven … Steven is looking for that forever relationship; someone who matters, someone to come home to. So, of course, they want each other. Daniel has baggage, eight years of baggage, to be exact. He has an ex-partner, rampant trust issues and a recently developed allergy to anything real, anything beyond the heat of writhing bodies. Steven is starting over; new city, new job. He has worked hard to recover from a hurt hidden in his past, but unlike Daniel, he still has faith in the possibility of forever. Can mutual lust become mutual trust? Can for now become forever? Fireworks explores what it takes to be truly happy.",
