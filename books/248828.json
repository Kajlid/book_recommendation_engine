  "title": "Going Roswell",
  "description": "Just when personal trainer Sean Michael ‘Finn’ Finnegan thought he’d got used to dating a movie star, he finds himself getting used to dating a Hollywood producer.  Superhero star Chase Morrow has moved on. Following his dramatic disappearance – when he fell in love, out of the closet and into a Bigfoot costume – he’s producing a TV pilot about the Roswell Incident.  Finn and Chase are no strangers to the odd, but even they have to admit that spending their Valentine’s getaway with a sleep-deprived New Mexico space cult is pretty bizarre. And even the open-minded Chase is unprepared when – between all the sex and drugs and UFOs – his skeptical significant other experiences the kind of close encounter that would give even Dana Scully cause to pause. Is the truth really out there, or has it all just gone a bit Roswell?  This Valentine’s themed novella can be read as a standalone or a sequel to Going Sasquatch.",
