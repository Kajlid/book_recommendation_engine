The man whose words she'd fallen in love with isn’t James at all…Jasper Holland, a gentleman rogue of the first order, is trapped. Talked into a scheme by his best friend, he pretended to be James for eleven years as he wrote to Gemma, even though he'd promised James he’d break it off. But now with his return to England, his secret will come out—and he’ll lose the one woman he can’t live without.What began as a game of words, now becomes a game of hearts, and Jasper will pay any price to call Gemma his.",
