  "description": "Now Available on Audio! Sexy male narrator! http://www.audible.com/pd/Erotica-Sex... Fourth installment in the Dormant Desires Lycanthrope series. This is a STAND ALONE in the series and can easily be enjoyed without reading the first three. This episode revolves around Samantha and the Chimera, Cain. After heading out in search of her Alpha male, Samantha is wounded battling a grizzly bear. Cain lives in the farthest remote location Alaska has to offer. He finds Samantha near death and tends to her, bringing her back to life. Can a were-wolf and a chimera fall in love? Is Cain her elusive alpha mate she's waited a hundred years to meet? This installment has a lot of action which includes the entire Alpha Pack along with a few new characters. As always, my stories have steamy erotica, some comedy and brevity, deep emotional moments and lots of really fun, on the edge of your seat entertainment. This title is approximately a six hour read and is intended for only a mature audience.",
