There is no flinching from things as bad as they can be, especially but not only for women. And yet, this passionate powerful writing radiates affirmation. \"This good o, good old world\" is livable still in acts of pure verbal magic.\"Jane Eaton Hamilton is not a poet content to whisper in your ear or take you on slow walks through pretty fields. She sits you down in her hardest chair, litters tacks on the floor about your naked feet, and holds you there petrified but alert as she speaks the body's news.\" - Leon RookeSHORTLISTED for the 1991 Pat Lowther Memorial Award for best book of poetry written by a woman in the previous year\"Does not read like a first book of poems.\"--Canadian Literature\"We are moved and astonished that a first book of poems can exhibit such vitality and confidence\"--Event\"Hamilton displays an impressive range in style and tone. There are moments of unbearable beauty.\"--Whig Standard\"Throughout there are good lines, strong metaphors, a high level of skill.\"--Toronto Star",
