  "description": "The 60s generation are in their sixties and are determined to have some fun.  \"What have you done with your life?” This is a question that Cass is anxious to avoid when she attends an old school reunion. She is ashamed of her dull life: forty years of wasted talent and unhappy marriage to an abusive husband. Whatever happened to the promising musician who left school full of ambition in the 1960s?  But then Cass finds out what happened to her best friend George on the last day of school, and this makes her angry enough to walk out on her husband and old life for ever. Re-united, Cass and her other old school friends form the Crone Club and pledge to recover the lost dreams and aspirations of their youth. None of them has any intention of ‘acting her age.’ This raises another question: Is the world ready for the Crone Club?  The Crone Club is the first in a series of six books. Each book will be told from the point of view of a different character and will continue the story from the point where the previous book ended. George’s book, Clone Club Mayhem, will be published in Spring 2013 and four other books in the planning stage including The Crone Club USA.",
