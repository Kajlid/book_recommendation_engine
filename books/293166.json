  "description": "Born in the land where \"The Kamasutra\" originates, I have never taken eroticism lightly.  Even though sex is one of the most basic needs, humanity still shies away from talking about it.  With this book, through my poems I urge you to tastefully feel, visualise and just enjoy something that comes naturally to all of us. Enjoy the image depicted with each poem to enrich the surge of emotions you will feel! Another journey, another path, discover some more of your emotions and let love flow through...  \"Enigma is a compelling book that will make you see love making in a mind-blowing way. A decent, elegant, erotic book with nice poetic content well put together by author - Chriselda Barretto. A perfect book celebrating quality time with one's mate!\" - Debb",
