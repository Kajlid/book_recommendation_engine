  "description": "Life is a wonderful journey of discovery and adventure with many roads to travel to achieve inner peace and happiness. If we pause and stand still for a moment to enjoy the amazing world that we are part of we realise that everything is unfolding as it should and that there are lessons in life that teach us to be more fulfilled and to take every chance that makes us feel alive. We all have days that we feel different feelings depending on the circumstances that we find ourselves in and these inspiring, joyful and thought provoking messages will remind you that your heart is your compass in every situation, that leads to light and love. We are all unique and our presence is a gift to those we meet along the way.",
