She's armed with an ancient mystical family heirloom which reflects people's misdeeds back onto them. \"Do unto others as you would be done by!\" she warns people - and they'd better take heed because if they carry on with their mean and cruel behaviour, they're going to find out what it feels like to be on the receiving end! The exciting adventures of Reflecto Girl are recommended for readers aged 8 and up. Book One includes the first four episodes of the popular comic from Violet's Veg*n e-Comics.",
