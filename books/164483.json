  "description": "Alice in Wonderland meets Wolves of Wall Street in Jerry Jay Carroll’s brilliant and witty debut novel. Revised and available for the first time on Kindle. William B. Ingersol sits in an office high above Wall Street conducting cut-throat corporate takeovers. Just another day at work, it seems, business as usual. He puts his head down on his desk and wakes up as a big dog, trying to survive in a strange new world of wizards, fairies and monsters. To get back home, he has to choose between good and evil, devil or angel. That’s not as easy as you might think for a man used to playing with a stacked deck, not to mention both sides against the middle.",
