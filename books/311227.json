  "description": "It all starts when I get an email.Let me rephrase. It’s a sextortion email from someone claiming they tapped into my computer and recorded me while I was watching a graphic adult video. If I don’t send them money, they’ll forward it to everyone in my Contacts list.As a chemistry teacher at a private school, I panic. Not only do I love my job, but I also need it.Desperate and afraid, I run to the police station and ask an officer for help.A very gorgeous, very arrogant officer—Dax Harder.Dax is a mixture of a fearless warrior and an undisciplined child. After he proves to me that it’s a spam email and they didn’t actually hack into my computer, he uses the incident to tease me. I leave the police station in a huff, hoping to never see him again.Fate has other ideas.Everywhere I go, I run into Officer Harder. Our tension turns heated, and soon, we’re embarking on a fiery and bold romance. The more time I spend with him, the more I learn about the dark past that lingers behind the eyes of the closely guarded cop.And whatever it is, it’s enough for him to push me away.",
