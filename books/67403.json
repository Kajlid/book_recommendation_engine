  "description": "\"My love, the child almost died.\" Lissa looked up at Roff's words. His wings rustled after he spoke--he normally didn't involve himself in the politics of Le-Ath Veronis. Not to this extent, anyway.\"I know, honey. And now two other children are likely to die as a result. Yes, I know they did this, but I'm not convinced we have all the ones involved in the crime.\"Toff's life is in danger--someone from the Green Fae village wants him dead. In fact, the entire Fae community has begun to grumble as Kifirin's judgment looms. With only a few exceptions, the Fae focus their anger (and the blame) on Toff, who fails to understand why everyone now seems to be against him.",
