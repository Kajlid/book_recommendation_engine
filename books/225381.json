  "description": "Emotionally numb from her divorce 18 months earlier, Nell Dysart is about to waken with a vengeance. When she takes a job as office manager for McKenna Investigations, she`s determined to reorganize, redecorate, and revamp the stuck-in-the-`50s surroundings, but she runs smack-dab into senior partner Gabe McKenna, the immovable object to her irresistible force. Gabe likes the dated ambiance just fine and doesn`t want a thing changed, but he soon learns that nothing in his life is going to stay the same now that Nell has arrived.Rough and gruff, but with a heart of gold, Gabe is just what Nell needs tojump-start her hormones. Nell`s formerly dull life is suddenly wildly active, for not only is she lusting after Gabe (and vice versa), but there`s also a case of embezzlement to uncover, a dog to steal, and bribery to investigate. And, oh yes, there are those very cold, very dead bodies in the freezer.Fast Women has well-rounded characters, an interesting mystery to resolve, and author Jennifer Crusie`s trademark humor. In addition, Crusie gives readers a little something extra in her exploration of the emotional stages of divorce, the viability of marriage, and the value of self-honesty--all of which add up to an excellent fictional tale layered with a thought-provoking look at contemporary culture. --Lois Faye Dyer",
