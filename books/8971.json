  "description": "Secret Service Agent Cameron Roberts made a promise to Blair Powell, the President's daughter--not to place her own life in danger protecting Blair--but a request from the Commander in Chief forces her to break her word. In this sequel to Above All, Honor, Cameron places duty before love and accepts reassignment as the chief of Blair's security detail, despite knowing that this decision may destroy their tenuous new relationship. As the rift between them widens, more than one woman is happy to offer Blair the company that Cam cannot. Amidst political intrigue, an escalating threat to Blair's safety, and the seemingly irreconcilable personal differences that force them ever further apart, these two unusual women struggle to find their way back to one another.",
