While healing from a bullet wound, and on limited duty, he is charged with helping find out what’s happening to young women who are disappearing without a trace. But that’s just the beginning. Someone is beating and raping women in town, women who are related to his godfather, Detective Russell Coleman. And then the bodies of men start showing up, eviscerated. Are the crimes related? Or are has the town become a haven for all sorts of criminals? Wile, Rocky, and Drew, three children from a violent home, take matters into their own hands and soon the small town of Raven Bayou, Louisiana is brimming with dead bodies. But the only victims are those whose background proves them to be deserving of such justice. Can Special Agent Trey Fontaine stop the violence? Or will he only figure out the truth after someone he loves is dead?About the AuthorA graduate of the University of California and former officer for a large sheriff’s department, Ryder Islington is now retired and doing what she loves: reading, writing, and gardening.
