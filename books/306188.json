  "description": "Rumor has it, the radio once belonged to Santa Claus…And once it starts playing, those who hear the magical melodies fall in love.Holed up in her room at Harper’s Inn, Grace Easton is bound and determined to write the next great American novel. But the jolly strains of Jingle Bells drift through her door and soon she finds herself on a last-minute, snowy excursion with the inn’s surly sleigh driver.She doesn’t know much about driving sleighs, but oh what fun it is to ride with a man who does. Boone is attractive. Just being around him ties Grace into brighter knots than those on the presents surrounding the inn’s Christmas tree. But he’s also cold, uninterested, and because of his painful past he’s determined to keep his distance from the perky, blonde writer.During their ride, in the middle of a perfectly sunny day, music plays and snow begins falling and shows no signs of stopping. Boone and Grace have no choice but to wait out the storm at his nearby cottage.Romance is the last thing Grace and Boone have in mind. Santa and his magic radio have other ideas…If you like to snuggle inside with a book on a snowy day and sizzle inside with all the feels, this book is for you.",
