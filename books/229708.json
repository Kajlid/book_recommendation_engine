  "description": "ABOUT A GERMAN-AMERICAN TALEA stormy, courageous, and incredible memoir of a German immigrant who crossed the Atlantic Ocean together with his two young daughters in 1834 in hope of finding a better life.As this book’s title suggests, Gustav Streckfuss tells the compelling story of his voyage from Bremen to Philadelphia, and his struggle to make a living in the New World.In this compelling memoir, the author recounts his hopes and dreams, his regrets and hardships, the times fortune smiled upon him, and his desperate attempts to start a business to avoid losing his daughters to indentured servitude. As the clock ticks down, the German immigrant’s financial struggles reach new lows and push him to the edge of despair.A German-American Tale is much more than a memoir; it’s an adventurous saga and historical account of life in the United States in the early 19th century, filled with many surprising incidents and stories of real people that transport the reader back in time.",
