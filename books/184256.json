Each corpse is posed in a way whose meaning no one can fathom. Which is precisely the point the murderer is trying to make.Elisenda Domènech, the solitary and haunted head of the city’s newly-formed Serious Crime Unit, is determined to do all she can to stop the attacks. She believes the attacker is drawing on the city’s legends to choose his targets, but her colleagues aren’t convinced and her investigation is blocked at every turn.Battling against the increasing sympathy towards the killer displayed by the press, the public and even some of the police, she finds herself forced to question her own values. But when the attacks start to include less deserving victims, the pressure is suddenly on Elisenda to stop him. The question is: how?With City of Good Death Chris Lloyd launches a gripping new series sure to appeal to readers of Val McDermid and the Inspector Montalbano novels. Rich in atmosphere, local detail and featuring an unforgettable heroine, it also announces the arrival of a major new British crime writing talent.Chris Lloyd lived in Catalonia for over twenty years, besides brief spells in Bilbao, Madrid, Grenoble and a mill in Devon. He has written and contributed to several travel books about Spain for Rough Guides, travelling extensively around the country. Now back in South Wales, he works as a Catalan and Spanish translator.
