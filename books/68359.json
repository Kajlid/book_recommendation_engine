  "description": "Peter goes off to the village wise man to find out what he could do about his noisy house. It seemed like a simple enough problem at the beginning, but more and more complications set in—in the forms of a donkey, a sheep, and a cow, to name a few, until it looked as though an entire farm had come to life right there in Peter’s house!But with the proper, if overwhelming, application of true folk wisdom, the trouble was ended. Peter’s house was finally quiet.Or was it?“This is a funny book, a very funny book.”—Publishers Weekly “The too-crowded house of a familiar old tale becomes a too noisy house in this entertaining picture-book story.”—Booklist",
