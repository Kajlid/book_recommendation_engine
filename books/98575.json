  "description": "He’s Hope’s assignment.\nHope is sick of being sent to cover stories like the wallaby’s birthday at the local zoo. But why does her big break have to involve him? She grew up with rock star, Chase Hatton. Then they dated and fell in love. But it all came crashing down the night of her senior prom. Sure, her boyfriend Phillip may not be the love of her life, but the good looking reporter is fun, steady, dependable…predictable. In this case predictability is good.\nShe’s Chase’s heartache.\nWhat starts out for Chase as an average publicity trip to Chicago suddenly becomes complicated when his manager tells him Hope Creswell will be interviewing him in the morning. He spent eight years trying to forget Hope, and now she would be in his penthouse in a matter of hours? Some things are too painful to forget.When Chase opens the door to his penthouse and finds Hope on the opposite side, his heart beats a rhythm the rocker has never captured in any of his music. Their mere proximity fans the smoldering embers of their former romance. But should he abandon hope, or chase the love that once rocked his world?More \nROCKIN' ROMANCE\n\n \"Trapped Under Ice\" \n\n \"Between Rock and a Hard Place\" \n\n \"Rock Me, Gently\" \n\n \"Midnight Melody\" \n____________________________________",
