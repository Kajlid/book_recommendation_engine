  "description": "It’s 1994 and, growing up in a forgotten top corner of Australia, Abby’s life consists of backyard cricket, Nintendo and underwater wrestles with her best friend, Justin. But when she hears a recording of a Dvorak violin concerto, Abby becomes determined to one day perform the piece in the concert halls. Suddenly, music is everything and not even her blossoming relationship with Justin can pull Abby away from her goals. At eighteen, she is given a chance at her dream: a place at the Melbourne Conservatorium. But when she falls for charismatic composer Matt, Abby discovers love for a person can be as consuming as love for music. Their passionate relationship has her questioning everything she thought she ever wanted. Abby realises that to face the future, she must first confront the past; uncovering some uncomfortable truths about herself, her family and the passion that has shaped her life.",
