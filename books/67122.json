  "description": "Somewhere in the Missouri River Breaks, heading across Montana through hostile Sioux territory, prospector and Civil War veteran Bill Dawkins and the wrongly accused ? now fugitive ? Miller twins must find a way to elude the US Army and an angry lawman who stalks them with a pathological obsession. US Marshal and notorious former vigilante John X. Beidler will never give up the chase for Dawkins and his human cargo as long as they?re alive, and Dawkins can only hope to delay Beidler long enough to reach the Missouri River and flag down a steamer. And when Dawkins discovers he is losing his heart to a strong-minded doctor with pair of beautiful brown eyes, he?ll have to consider something he never thought of at the beginning of the journey: Will he lose his life before he can claim the woman he loves?",
