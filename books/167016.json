  "title": "The Aelfheim Gateway",
  "description": "Long ago, for their horrible misdeeds, the elves were banished by the most powerful known magic from the realm of Midheim. And in their years of isolation in Aelfheim, the elves polished their hatred, sharpened their swords, and awaited the return of the fabled Eulidean—she who was prophesied to bring glory to the elves over all known realms. But the Eulidean is not yet born. And to open the gateway between the realms of Midheim and Aelfheim is nigh impossible. Now, Oudrin All-Father knew that one day, the elves would return to Midheim and return with such a fury as to be blind in their vengeance, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake. So before Oudrin fell, he planned for that day as on that day, Midheim would once again need heroes to rise up and defend the realm. This is the story of those heroes and their adventures.NOW AVAILABLE! Read the second book in the series: THE JÖTUNHEIM GATEWAY!",
