  "description": "NOTE: The latest edition of Star Princess (Kindle B00CQPB4UM) with a new cover is HERE.Ilana Hamilton isn't an adventurer like her pilot mother or a diplomat like her do-right brother; she's a brash, fun-loving filmmaker who'd rather work behind the camera than be a \"Star Princess\" in front of it. Heiress or not, she's a perfectly normal, single woman...until Prince Che Vedla crashes into her life.With six months to choose a bride, the sexy royal wants to sow his wild oats. Ilana can't blame himâ€”but fall for the guy herself? Not a chance! Hotshot pilot or no, Che is too stuffy, too arrogant, and too old-fashioned. But when he sweeps her off her feet, Ilana sees stars, and the higher he takes her, the more she loves to fly. Only her heart asks where she will land.",
