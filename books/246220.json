  "description": "When this realm was created, three races were formed. Humans, jin, and angels. That’s all that Camila knows for certain in her life.  After her time traveler’s dial gets stuck she is forced to live the same day on repeat until she is saved by four handsome strangers. They aren’t human or angel, and they definitely aren’t part of the jin.  Camila’s life is flipped upside down when she follows them into another realm. Is it possible that more creatures exist? Are they all as sexy as the four that need her now?  Recommended for ages 18 and up.",
