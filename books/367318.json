  "description": "In this riotous satire of urban life, generational conflict, and the battle of the sexes, Japanese best-selling sensation Ryu Murakami introduces us to six aimless young men who find themselves at war with a group of divorced, fiercely independent women.The young men are lost.The highlights of their lives are eating beef jerky and spying on a neighbor undressing. The women – the “Midori Society,” for they came together over their unusual name – lead insular lives, barely tolerating the interruption of a child or ex-husband.Taken by an inexplicable urge, one of the young men spontaneously attacks and murders a Midori, which leads to a fiery, meticulously strategized war between the two groups. Best of all, having found a sense of purpose, they’re having the time of their lives. Who knew that plotting revenge could be such fun? Murakami builds the conflict into an explosive, hilarious meditation on modern life.",
