  "description": "Rae Taylor has a bucket list. You know, things to do before you kick the bucket.She's had it for more than a year now as a way to come to terms with her mother's death. She's done most of sky diving, scaling the Himalayas, threesomes, foursomes––the lot.But disaster strikes and it forces her to travel to Orlando to see Corey. He's the famous bad-boy fighter with whom she's had many threesomes with. The man who mothers warn their daughters about, the man who fathers lock their daughters away from.This was it. The beginning of the end. Standing outside Corey's hotel room, she is here to carry out the last few things on her bucket list, the hardest things.To fall in love.And to say goodbye. 18+ for strong language and scenes of a sexual nature.",
