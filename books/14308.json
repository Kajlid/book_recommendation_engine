  "description": "A deliciously imaginative story about friendship―from the author / illustrator of The Scrambled States of America.Arnie was fascinated as he watched the customers stream into the bakery. One by one, doughnuts were chosen, placed in paper bags, and whisked away with their new owners. Some went by the dozen in giant boxes.\"Good-bye!\" Arnie yelled to each doughnut. \"Have a good trip!\"\"This is so exciting!\" Arnie beamed. \"I wonder who will choose ME?\"At first glance, Arnie looks like an average doughnut―round, cakey, with a hole in the middle, iced and sprinkled. He was made by one of the best bakeries in town, and admittedly his sprinkles are candy-colored. Still, a doughnut is just a doughnut, right?WRONG! Not if Arnie has anything to say about it. And, for a doughnut, he sure seems to have an awful lot to say. Can Arnie change the fate of all doughnuts―or at least have a hand in his own future? Well, you'll just have to read this funny story and find out for yourself. This title has Common Core connectionsArnie, the Doughnut is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",
