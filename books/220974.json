  "description": "The long, hot summer of 1989. A teenage boy and girls' paths cross purely by chance. But Jack is no ordinary boy - brought up in isolation and hidden from the world till the age of sixteen; a dirty secret, his father's cross to bear. Music mad Daisy sees it as her duty to introduce Jack to the real world - and a lot more besides along the way - a task easier said than done with Jack's numerous phobias and fears. But as the summer goes on and the temperature rises, so does the body count, as together they search for the truth of Jackâ€™s real identity.",
