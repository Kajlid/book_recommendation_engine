  "description": "Growing old doesn’t have to be so hard with this “important and valuable book for baby boomers and their children” (Florence Henderson).   We’re all going to die.   A jolting thought, yes, but an important truth. We all must come to terms with our mortality and move beyond the overwhelming fear and horror many Americans feel when confronted with the realities of growing old. Far too many of us feel powerless to do anything about it. But it doesn’t have to be that way.   In It’s Never Too Late, Scott Page offers us easy (and even fun) ways to develop a workable plan for living out our lives with greater security and peace of mind, regardless of our current age or station in life—leaving us wondering why we didn’t do something about it sooner.   With easy, fast-acting steps to restore faith in ourselves and hope for our future, Scott offers a holistic methodology anyone can follow if they’re willing to take action and pave the way for a safe, secure future.",
