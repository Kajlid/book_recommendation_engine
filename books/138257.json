  "title": "Mathematical Olympiads 2000-2001: Problems and Solutions from Around the World",
  "description": "This book is a continuation of Mathematical Olympiads 1999 2000: Problems and Solutions From Around the World, published by the Mathematical Association of America. It contains solutions to the problems from 27 national and regional contests featured in the earlier book, together with selected problems (without solutions) from national and regional contests given during 2001. In many cases multiple solutions are provided in order to encourage students to compare different problem-solving strategies. The editors have tried to present a wide variety of problems, especially from those countries that have often done well at the IMO. The problems themselves should provide much enjoyment for all those fascinated by solving challenging mathematics questions.\"",
