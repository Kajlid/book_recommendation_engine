  "title": "I Met a Moose in Maine One Day",
  "description": "A boy and a moose become fast friends in this rhyming charmer from the creators of The Boston Balloonies, The Cods of Cape Cod, and Champ and Me By the Maple Tree. Together, boy and beast play hide-and-seek (not the best game for a moose), walk to the general store, then take a tour of Maine. They fly about in a seaplane, they run the Penobscot River on a raft made of logs, they hang out on a dock in Camden, and they finish off with some chocolate moose cake at a cafe in Portland!",
