  "title": "Poppy's Babies",
  "description": "It was early summer in Brambly Hedge. Outside, everything seemed quiet and peaceful, but inside the mill there was chaos. Poppy's new babies were crying, Dusty's mill was clattering and clouds of flour dust filled the air. This was no place to bring up a family. But what was to be done? The mice of Brambly Hedge come up with a plan in no time at all, and even Wilfred manages to keep it a secret from Poppy so that she has a wonderful surprise on the babies' Naming Day.",
