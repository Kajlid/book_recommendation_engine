  "description": "I’m a priest, a messenger of God, a good man. At least that’s what I would have them all believe.  She’s a lost lamb, cast adrift from her flock and seeking shelter from the wolves snapping at her heels. She’s looking for salvation, protection, forgiveness for her sins. I’m not the man to give it to her. But for the first time in my life, I want to be.  Little does she know…  For even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.",
