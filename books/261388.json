  "description": "Who understands the compulsions of addiction better than the addict? Who understands the fear of loneliness better than the one who was left behind?  Faith House: A Journey to Faith is the story of how God intervened in Pat’s dark and desolate places to bring discovery and recovery to her life. When everyone else walked out of her life, Jesus walked in. And with Him came a passion and a purpose – that every woman would know she is enough. That her past is forgiven and her destiny is the purpose God created her for.  “For Nothing is Impossible with God.” Luke 1:37",
