  "description": "The #1 \"New York Times\" bestselling author presents a riveting novel of a canine Search and Rescue volunteer who fights danger and finds love in the Pacific Northwest wilderness.  To most people, Fiona Bristow seems to have an idyllic life--a quaint house on an island off Seattle's coast, a thriving dog-training school and a challenging volunteer job performing Canine Search and Rescue. Not to mention her three intensely loyal Labs. But Fiona got to this point by surviving a nightmare.  Several years ago, Fiona was the only survivor of the Red Scarf Killer, who shot and killed Fiona's cop fiance and his K-9 partner.  On Orcas Island, Fiona has found the peace and solitude necessary to rebuild her life. But all that changes on the day Simon Doyle barrels up her drive, desperate for her help. He's an intensely private wood artist and the reluctant owner of an out-of-control puppy named Jaws.  As Fiona embarks on training Jaws, and Simon begins to appreciate both dog and trainer, the past tears back into Fiona's life. A copycat killer has emerged out of the shadows, a man whose bloodlust has been channeled by a master with one motive: to reclaim the woman who slipped out of his hands . . .",
