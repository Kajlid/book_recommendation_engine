  "title": "Incurable Blues: The Troubles & Triumph of Blues Legend Hubert Sumlin",
  "description": "Incurable Blues explores the life and genius of Hubert Sumlin, a highly influential guitarist who has survived cancer, alcoholism, and personal and professional tribulations to testify to the classic days of Chicago blues. Sumlin's incendiary guitar playing is heard on most of Howlin' Wolf's classic Chess sides. Sumlin's pick-less playing has inspired countless blues-rock luminaries. Author Will Romano places Hubert's playing and performing style in context, showing how it formed the basis of blues rock and rock n roll and how it bridges the gap between African folk; the work of early masters like Robert Johnson, Charley Patton and Peetie Wheatstraw; the revisionist British invasion guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Keith Richards; and the modern-era blues styles of Stevie Ray Vaughan and John Mayer.",
