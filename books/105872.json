  "description": "When religion is responsible for breeding killers… …innocent people will die.Angie Hicks has dreamed of owning a Halloween store since she was a kid. When she inherits an old abandoned grocery store in Huber Heights, Ohio, she hits the ground running. With the help of her best friend and famous mask designer Derek Green, she sets up shop in time for the Halloween season. It doesn’t take long for the nightmare to begin, starting with Matt Campbel, a local newspaper reporter who informs Angie that the Dunnes, Ed and Eddie Jr., a father and son team who ran the store forty years ago, were executed in Ohio’s electric chair for butchering their customers. If that isn’t enough, local prostitutes are being murdered quicker than the coroner can autopsy them and the killer has a morbid fetish—the women’s face and hair are peeled off before their bodies are disposed of.As the investigation into the deaths escalate, a bigger mystery unfolds, revealing the true motivation behind the Dunne’s crimes, which links them and the modern day killer to an ancient form of ritual killing born from Catholicism and the Ancient Aztecs with the Illuminati thrown into the mix.Seventeen women will lose their lives before the killer makes the first mistake and Detective Bryn Oakley wants to know why every clue leads her and her partner back to The Halloween Store.",
