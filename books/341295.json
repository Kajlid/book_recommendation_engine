After a distant relative manages to secure a place for Stuart in the court of King Henry VIII, Stuart quickly learns that the court is really a wicked cauldron of vices, power plays, and temptation. As Stuart rises at court, he is asked to find and deliver for execution an enemy of the king—William Tyndale, an acquaintance of Stuart’s whose sole ambition is to translate the Bible into the language of the common man. Does Stuart fall prey to his dangerous ambition and accept the assignment? Or is he willing to face death at the stake for the sake of Christ?In Honor in the Dust , bestselling author Gilbert Morris captures the tone of the Tudor period beautifully, chronicling the period’s excesses with skill and prudence.
