  "description": "Imagine life without the London Underground. The iconic Tube has been transporting Londoners around Britainâ€™s capital for 150 years, and today 150,000 passengers use the Underground every hour. This fascinating miscellany takes us on a round-trip through every aspect of the London Underground, from the history of its construction to its many appearances in books, films and popular music, giving a glimpse into the technical marvels beneath our feet and the many human stories that play out in its trains and tunnels every day. 1845: A pamphlet is published in which Charles Pearson, a London lawyer, pushes the idea of an underground railway to transport both passengers and goods to the city centre. 1863: On January 10 the Metropolitan Railway goes down in the history books when it opens the first subterranean railway in the world. 1998: A previously undiscovered breed of mosquito, adapted to life underground, is discovered living in the Tube network. 2012: Close to one million people use the Northern line alone, every day.",
