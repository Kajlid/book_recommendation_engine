  "description": "Alice Mertie Underhill writes a story of adventure, magic, love and ultimately redemption set in the lonely jungles of India. Big Mo is well-known in his tribe as a great fighter and an alcoholic. A rich, four-cow man, he doesn't feel the need of anything. That is, until the day he attends a burning of a dead mother and her still living child. Feeling pangs of injustice, Big Mo tries to save the infant, but is too late. The witch doctor condemns his actions, and Big Mo begins a journey to find meaning in his life and answers to his questions. During this time he finds Dookie, an abandoned infant about to be devoured by wild dogs. After saving the child, Big Mo attempts to raise the child on his own. As the child grows, she makes friends with another girl who is her own age and who is a Christian. This sparks a feud between himself and the tribal witch doctor who curses Big Mo and Dookie with the \"curse of the snake.\" Ironically, the young child is bitten by a poisonous snake a few months later and becomes deathly ill to the point that a cure seems hopeless. Is the power of the evil spirits stronger than the Christian magic that Big Mo is learning about? Follow the tales of Big Mo and his adoptive daughter, Dookie, in their Indian village as they learn about the Great Spirit from the Christians. A must-read for all ages, Dookie, Sookie, and Big Mo will make you laugh and cry, and bring you closer to the Christian God they are learning to love, Jesus Christ.",
