  "description": "She's a thief.And he's a tracker. It's not every day one of those fabled Renegade Souls MC outlaw finds himself on the end of a con.Grinder is a skilled hunter and he got played by the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. What else is he to do, but go on a year long retaliation crusade.Only, he wants more from Luxe Reyes. He wants everything. She's a swarm of temper and allure and she becomes his obsession. Criminally minded, Luxe didnâ€™t anticipate being tied and gagged.It's not the ideal setting for a budding seduction, not when she wants to punch the face of her handsome captor. She's his hostage.He's ... hers. They say romance is dead. The moment Luxe is free she's going to kill the damn biker. If she doesn't kiss him first. No one ever said you should fall in love with your kidnapper.They didn't say you shouldn't, either...Disclaimer: Intended for 18+ due to the biker kidnapping his woman, because who hasn't done that in the name of romance and all the sexy alleyway shenanigans that follows.",
