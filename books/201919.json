  "description": "Kiera is the daughter of the notorious Richard Boyd, the man responsible for the death of hundreds of shifters. She’s also the most recent victim of her father’s experiments. Once human, Kiera was genetically altered with metamorph DNA. She barely survived the transformation, and now must learn how to control the animal within. Alpha werelion, Jacob Oliver has always prided himself on being reliable, loyal, and practical. He’s the youngest ever, Director of Therian Affairs. When the first survivor of spontaneous morphing ends up in his care, Jacob finds himself struggling to maintain his composure. There’s always been something wild and untamed within Kiera, but if she’s ever going to be able to rejoin society, she’ll need someone to teach her how to control her new animal nature. Jacob Oliver is just the man for the job, or at least he thinks he is. What happens when you add fire to ice? Steam! Will Jacob extinguish the flame within her, or will Kiera finally melt Jacob’s icy exterior?",
