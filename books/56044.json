  "description": "LORD'S LAMENT Within moments of meeting young Samantha Ardsley, the devilishly handsome Zachary St. John, Earl of Royston, had proposed. The mischief that danced in her emerald-green eyes held the promise that marriage to Samantha would provide him with heirs and entertainment. But the high-spirited Lady Samantha was more than the Earl of Royston had bargained for. He had agreed to give up his notorious bachelor life for his bride, but his new lady apparently had no intention of curtailing her own activities. Her outlandish behavior on the streets of London proved to be more than her adoring husband could endure. The threat of losing his young bride, however, was enough to deter Royston from trying to subdue her. Life with Samantha was completely unpredictable, but the one certainty in his life was that he could never live without the delightfully irrepressible woman he loved.",
