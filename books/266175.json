  "description": "Second star to the right, and straight on til' the zombie apocalypse.JM Barrie's classic masterpiece, Peter Pan, gets a cannabalistic sequel in this action-packed, high-flying, horrifyingly funny novel. Set years after Barrie's original tale, Zombies in Neverland begins as a mysterious infection sweeps through the earth, putting a swift end to all civilization. Amid the breakout of the zombie apocalypse, 16-year-old Laney Higgins finds a fragile sense of safety in the form of an abandoned house in Bloomsbury - a house that once belonged to Wendy Darling.While hiding out in Wendy's old nursery, Laney is visited by a pair of familiar Peter Pan and Tinkerbell. Believing Neverland to be zombie-free, Laney joins them on a flight to their fantastic, otherworldly home. But due to an unfortunate kidnapping at the hands - hand, rather - of Captain James Hook, the infection that all but destroyed the world found its way to the shores of Neverland.What follows is a harrowing, frantic adventure with a robust cast of characters, familiar and new, living and undead. Zombie mermaids, pirates, and Indians have overrun Neverland, but Laney and her new friends are determined to seek out the secrets of this fantasy land and find a way not only to survive, but to remedy the infection completely.",
