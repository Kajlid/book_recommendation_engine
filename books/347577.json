  "title": "The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Other Stories",
  "description": "A vibrant translation of Tolstoy's most important short fiction by the award-winning translators of \"War and Peace.\" Here are eleven masterful stories from the mature author, some autobiographical, others moral parables, and all told with the evocative power that was Tolstoy's alone. They include \"The Prisoner of the Caucasus,\" inspired by Tolstoy's own experiences as a soldier in the Chechen War, \"Hadji Murat,\" the novella Harold Bloom called \"the best story in the world,\" \"The Devil,\" a fascinating tale of sexual obsession, and the celebrated \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich,\" an intense and moving examination of death and the possibilities of redemption. Pevear and Volokhonsky's translation captures the richness, immediacy, and multiplicity of Tolstoy's language, and reveals the author as a passionate moral guide, an unflinching seeker of truth, and ultimately, a creator of enduring and universal art. \"From the Trade Paperback edition.\"",
