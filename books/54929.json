  "title": "Some Understand 1 + 6 = 7: Finding Wisdom and Receiving Promises",
  "description": "\"Some Understand 1 + 6 = 7 is instructions for finding wisdom and receiving Wisdom + Promise = Covenant. At the beginning of each chapter is a Wisdom and Promise Workshop. The Workshop is a search for Wisdom as hidden treasure (Proverbs 2:4). The remainder of the chapter is a practical application of the wisdom and promises found in the Workshop. The forty-four chapters, two pages each, cover a wide range of basic topics from both the Old and the New Testaments. By searching for Wisdom as hidden treasure and studying the practical applications in each chapter, you will be equipped to search for wisdom, receive the promises and make the same practical applications to your own life. The person who meets the Author while reading His Instructions and does what He says receives from Him what He has promised. It is like 1 + 6 = 7. \"",
