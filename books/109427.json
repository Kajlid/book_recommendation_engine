  "description": "alternate cover edition for ASIN B00FW79VEMWilson McKenna never wrote a bad check in his life. So how did he end up with $4,000 in returned checks on an island he’s never been to? He knows one thing, make that two, the bank wants their money, and he’s going to Kauai to track down the crook who stole his checks. Before you can say “welcome to the island,” he’s almost arrested for impersonating himself, the woman who trashed his credit turns up dead, and McKenna feels like he’s up to his ‘umi’umi in hot lava. Too late, McKenna realizes that some temptations can get you killed.",
