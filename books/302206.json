He’s only meant to be a stand-in, to fulfill my needs under Clay’s watchful direction, yet these two men couldn’t be more different. The one thing they share? Well, I guess that would be me.One gets off on my pain, the other on my pleasure, and it awakens a desire none of us knew existed. But it can’t last.Eventually I’ll have to choose.And it’s going to destroy us all.",
