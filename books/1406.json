A few fake ghosts away from throwing in the towel, the Tripping staff get the tip of a lifetime when they get a call from Charlotte Baskerville, the rich founder of a clothing company for small dogs. Charlotte thinks that her Chihuahua, Petey, has come back from the dead, and she’s desperate for someone to come verify his appearances.The magazine’s three-person reporting team travels to Manitou Springs, Colorado, sure that the ghostly dog will be a work of fiction. But, when they arrive, they see evidence of Petey with their own eyes. And he’s not just floating by – he’s howling advice and spelling out threats with tiny paw prints. Is the ghost real, or is the whole phenomenon an elaborate ruse?The Tripping team must navigate the kooky world of coffin races, scheming husbands, and doggie fashion to solve the mystery – and get their story written at the same time. Uproariously funny and a great mystery to boot, Chihuahua of the Baskervilles is sure to leave you in stitches.",
