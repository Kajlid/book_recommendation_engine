  "description": "Devlin Ward was a ruthless man. A man born among violence with a heavily burdened mind.He wasn't the sort of man fairy tales were made of, but he was sinfully beautiful, and addictively seductive. Dark and dangerous, yet utterly alluring.I’d fooled myself once, only allowing myself to see the beauty in him despite the shadows I’d glimpsed in his eyes.When that darkness took over, I ran.And now he’s found me.He’d trusted me with his love and now he wants it back. And he’s all too willing to crush my heart to make his whole again.Juliana betrayed me.Went against everything I believed in and pushed the monster I tried to keep hidden out into the open.Our love was twisted—and I’d made it that way. But I wasn't prepared to let it go.I hunted her for years, picking up traces of her scent as she moved from city to city to escape me.Now that I've found her, I’m not sure even her fiery light can brighten the blackout she left me in when she walked away.Mature content This title is darkly romantic and intended for Adults 18+ due to explicit sexual content, language, violence, and dubious consent.",
