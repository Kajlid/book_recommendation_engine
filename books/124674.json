  "description": "The last thing Diem Krause wanted to do was ask for Tallus’s help.The too-hot-for-his-own-good records clerk was so far outside Diem’s league that he became tongue-tied in his presence. Six months ago, after an embarrassingly unimpressive exchange in the bedroom that accentuated Diem’s flaws, he swore never to go near the sultry man again.When a new case lands on Diem’s desk, one involving a dead, allegedly unfaithful husband, Diem exhausts every means of investigation until he has no choice but to seek out the man he swore never to see again.Tallus has skills Diem doesn’t. In addition to being confident and sociable, Tallus can act and help him get answers.But inviting Tallus into his case means relinquishing control, and Diem hates not being in control. Not only is the Toronto Police Department’s records clerk fanatical about investigative work, but he also has a thing for making Diem uncomfortable and pushing his boundaries.When the case takes a dark and dangerous turn, the two spend far too many long nights trying to puzzle things out. Tallus’s flirty, suggestive behavior is going to get them in trouble, and the last thing Diem wants is to end up in bed with him again. It was a disaster the first time, and Diem doesn’t want to revisit the shame.Will Diem be able to resist Tallus’s charm?Can the two work together to solve the unusual case without crossing lines?Diem isn’t so sure. He doesn’t want a partner. He doesn’t need a lover.But with Tallus Domingo, he somehow ends up with both.",
