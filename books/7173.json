  "description": "Fallen angel Kokabiel's slice of life. When you come home from the battle you should be able to cuddle with your lover, right? Not deal with missions and Lucifer's demands to autograph pictures for demons. Written for The Supernatural Song Fiction Contest over at Aarin. Have chosen the song Indestructible by Disturbed and used it as inspiration for the fic and for the characterization of the main character, and went with angels as the supernatural creatures.Since I'm using Hebrew source in which Lucifer is an angel, who was exiled from Heaven, while Devil = Satan is an entity that challenged the religious faith of humans, Lucifer is in here the Main Director, while Devil is the Owner of Hell. Well, the Devil is only mentioned once, but I just thought you should know.WARNING: This is GBLT/LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) themed fiction with explicit contents that is NOT appropriate for minors.",
