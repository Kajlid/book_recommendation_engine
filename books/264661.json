  "description": "A break-in at Westminister Abbey fans the flames of nationalism as both the IRA and Scottish patriots are blamed. Parliament member Andrew Trentham is drawn into the investigation, but can not focus because of problems of his own. The love of his life broke a well-arranged engagement.The legend of the Celtic Stone comes alive as the story shifts from present to past, weaving tales of ancient Caldonia with a modern whodunit. Andrew rediscovers his heritage through the story of Ginevra Maclain, the Maiden of Glencoe, and the Christian Patriarch Columba, who brought the faith to the Scottish Highlands. In his exploration, Andrew finds out he can love again.",
