She didn’t belong, no matter how hard she tried. So when a vicious, invasive plant called Deadweed overruns her village, she’s blamed and sold to the Dragon Traders for fear of her powers and the mystery surrounding her origin. After years of service to the ruthless Dragon Traders, Dayie wants her freedom. To repay her debt, Dayie steals a dragon egg. But she winds up with far more than she bargained for when her egg hatches before she can get it to them.

There, she may have the chance to avenge her parents’ deaths and solve the mystery of ever-spreading Deadweed.Dayie’s destiny awaits, if she’s brave enough to follow it…",
