  "description": "Dr. Kristen Johansen is a respected pediatrician. With her sexy plus-sized figure and long blonde hair you'd think she'd have a man. But her demanding career has put her love life on hold, until she's attacked late one night and becomes an addict-of vampire venom. Now she has no choice but to go out after sundown, offering herself to anyone with fangs who wants a late-night snack. Which is how she runs into Joe, the last person she would have suspected of being a vampire. Blue-collar and hard-core, Joe works as a mechanic and hides his intellect behind his skill with a socket wrench. But what he really longs for is an extra-curvy woman with appetites to match his own. After an explosive sexual encounter, Joe offers Kristen the chance at a cure. But as they work together to find the rogue vampire who attacked her, Kristen begins to wonder if her addiction is turning into love. And whether regaining her old life is worth losing the only man she has ever cared for.",
