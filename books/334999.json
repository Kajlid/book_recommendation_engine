  "description": "This marriage of convenience is anything but…A Scottish earl, Éamon MacLeod is also a Highlander shifter pack alpha. He has no interest in love, marriage or true mates, but his stepfather's will leaves him little choice. Marry and Englishwoman within the year or forfeit the fortune he needs to improve his estates and help his pack. The wolf shifter attends the Season with a list of requirements for his wife: she must be plain, moderately dowered and above all, practical. He finds the perfect candidate in Lady Catherine, and his wolf approves.Labeled The Ordinary in her first season, Lady Catherine is a suffragette who abhors the loss of a woman's few legal rights to marriage. Nevertheless, she finds Éamon intriguing. Irresistible even. Until he makes his insulting proposal.He's determined to have her for his wife and his mate. She's determined to keep her freedom unless he loves her. It's a contest of wills that even an alpha wolf shifter isn't guaranteed to win.Note from author: Highlander's Moon was previously published as Annabelle's Courtship, but has been rewritten for the Children of the Moon world, with a different ending and other significant changes. Long time readers of that series will be happy to hear that characters from previous COTM books will be making an appearance.",
