  "title": "Lamentations of the Father: Essays",
  "description": "Ian Frazier is unquestionably one of America's greatest living humorists, a writer with a distinct, generous sensibility and a thousand different voices. His work is hilarious, elegant, and piercing, drawing on high and low cultureto expose the warped line of thought running beneath our public selves. When The Atlantic Monthly published four humorists among the best writing ever to appear in the magazine, they chose essays by Mark Twain, James Thurber, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ian Frazier's \"Lamentations of the Father.\" This collection, gathered from the past fourteen years of his career, once again proves him worthy of that great company.",
