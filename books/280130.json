  "description": "Today's the day I was supposed to say ‘I do’.Kiss the groom, cut the cake, and dance our first dance as husband-and-wife.So much for forever.Instead of sipping fruity cocktails and soaking up the sun on my honeymoon, I’ve escaped to Lonesome, Oregon. It seems as good a place as any to lick my wounds. It's peaceful, remote, and my favorite person in the world lives my grandma. She needs help running the Sweet Escape Bed and Breakfast, and I need a place to lie low while I attempt to recover from the mess my life has become.And it appears I’m not the only person here who’s running from something painful. A gorgeous man with sad eyes has been holed up in cabin seven since he arrived. I told myself to stay away from him, but my curiosity got the better of me.If only I hadn't knocked on his door.That’s when things got a whole lot more complicated.I came to Lonesome to recover from a broken heart, but with a man like him around? Something tells me I’ll be leaving with a heart more damaged than it was when I arrived.Author's One Good Thing is a standalone, but it features a main character from Beyond The Pale. If you're cool with spoilers, start here. If not, grab Beyond The Pale first, have your heart broken, and then let me rebuild it with One Good Thing.",
