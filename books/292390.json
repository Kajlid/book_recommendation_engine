  "description": "Cady Grey is invisible. One of the 'perks' of being in a wheelchair.  Sometimes it's better that way, when you're a sweary, spitty teenaged girl and all you want to do is get through sixth form in one piece. But when a sinister shell company wants to knock the school down, she's the only one who cares enough to do anything about it.  When Cady finally gives up being invisible to fight, she finds being noticed by the wrong people might get her killed.",
