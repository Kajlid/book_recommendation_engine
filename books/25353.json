  "description": "Having a pack isn’t even on the radar for Dr. Piper Blake. Her focus is strictly on her surgical residency. There’s no time for dating when the standards you set for yourself are sky high.Unfortunately for Piper, the captain of the New Haven Foxes has a different idea. Alexi Badnin is ready to make this his best season yet, by winning the Cup, and building his dream pack in the process.The larger-than-life Alpha is playing his own matchmaker when it comes to the stubborn Piper and the team’s new broody goalie, Owen. He becomes obsessed with the three becoming a pack, and will do just about anything to make them both his.The three have to unpack insecurities, self-doubt, and secrets to make this work. Time will only tell if they can make it to the end of the hockey season in one piece, or completely shattered.This can be read as a standalone, but it’s recommended to read One Pucked Up Pack first.",
