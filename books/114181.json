  "description": "In Success Martin Amis pens a mismatched pair of foster brothers--one \"a quivering condom of neurosis and ineptitude,\" the other a \"bundle of contempt, vanity and stock-response\"--in a single London flat. He binds them with ties of class hatred, sexual rivalry, and disappointed love, and throws in a disloyal girlfriend and a spectacularly unstable sister to create a modern-day Jacobean revenge comedy that soars with malicious poetry.",
