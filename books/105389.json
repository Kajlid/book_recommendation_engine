  "description": "Kay and Tom, who are both 18, meet on a coach taking 30 young adult children of diplomats working in the USA to a camp in the NY Finger Lakes. Kay is a Canadian Mohawk. Her mother works at the United Nations. Tom's father is the Kenyan ambassador to Washington. With four others they are assigned a hut for the girls, and a tent for the boys. There they chop wood, spear fish, debate and sing round the camp fire. Kay tweets her friend Suzy about all that is going on. Another camper is a Saudi prince. Tom and Mohammed have been going to school at Eton College in England. Mohammed's expensive dagger is missing and Tom is accused of stealing it. The prince has an FBI guard because of a threat that he will be taken hostage. Kay and Tom share musical tastes. They play for each other and are quickly falling in love. Then, when out for a walk, men with guns mistake Tom for the prince and take them prisoner. Fortunately, Kay has brought her tweeter with her. (Some sex talk, not erotic: Multicultural)",
