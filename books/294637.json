  "description": "A note from Audrey: Some series can be read out of order - this isn’t one of them. Start with Alpha and welcome to Ghost Mountain!  Shelley Martins thinks she needs sensible and practical and steady—but that isn’t what the big truck from HomeWild is about to deliver.  Ghost Mountain is getting their school, the first building of their new den. The construction teams are ready, the big strong men are planning to be as useless as possible, and Shelley has the kitchen piled high with baked goods to fuel their work.  Except what comes off that big truck isn't just a building. And Shelley, who walked into hell six years ago to save her pack, isn't just a baker.",
