  "title": "Pussy On A Pedestal : Women’s Journey From “Everyone” To “Herself”",
  "description": "This book is about how women can and have moved from a place where they feel the need to please everyone to realizing that the only person whose opinion should really matter is themselves – from conditioning to self-empowerment.Women have long been dictated to, conditioned into selflessness and held to arbitrary standards that ensure they exist not for themselves but for everyone around them. This book attempts to break that cycle, to show us that not only is it ok to be selfish but even necessary.My hope is that after reading this book, you will get the inspiration and impetus to see the world, and most importantly, yourself in a brand new light, one that emanates from you and your newfound power. Put yourself on a Pedestal. You are strong , you are wise , & you are beautiful!",
