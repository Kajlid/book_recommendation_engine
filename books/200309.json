  "description": "Can love overcome prejudice? Even in the worst days of the recession, the McQueen family remain upbeat. This is what keeps them strong â€” when all else fails, you can always laugh. Like many of the residents of Fifteen Streets, they are as blunt as they are big-hearted. So imagine their shock when Bridget McQueen brings home her African husband. Colour Blind is an absorbing story of prejudice, racial tension and family feuding in the 1920s.",
