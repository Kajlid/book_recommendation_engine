  "description": "Far beneath the seas of Venus the descendants of Earth now live in impervium domes. The citizens reside securely and comfortably within the safety of their Keeps, but through their midst stride men whose grim, sunburned faces make them seem like a different race – the Free Companions.These are the surface dwellers – the mercenaries who fight out the wars of Venus's cities so that the rest of civilization can survive in peace.The prequel to Henry Kuttner's classic novel Fury, this enthralling story follows one of their military campaigns. Not many of the Free Companions ever questioned their way of life – but Clash by Night tells of one who did...In these five gems of imagination the talents of Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore combine to produce a powerful and shocking blend of science fiction and horror.Contents:- Introduction by Peter Pinto- Clash by Night (1943)- When the Bough Breaks (1944)- Juke-Box (1947)- The Ego Machine (1952)- Vintage Season (1946)",
