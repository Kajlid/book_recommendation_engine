  "description": "The world sees Fletcher Weschel as a mild-mannered actuary, but it could be the world has vision problems. Still, Fletcher wonders what the point is of having a wild heart if it's ultimately harnessed by a timid soul. In his fantasies, he returns the call of adventure with a bellowing, \"here I come!\" In reality, no one hears his whispered, \"me too!\" ... except for an unlikely group that descends upon him one cold November night. With the help of these visitors, Fletcher's life will never be the same, and the adventures he's about to undertake are truly out-of-this world. \"Mayor of the Universe\" has the heart and humor that readers of Lorna Landvik's books have come to expect . . . and a big dash of the unexpected, for the sheer fun of it.",
