  "description": "The Story of three closely related Oxfordshire communities - a hamlet, the nearby village and a small market town - this immortal trilogy is based on Flora Thompson's experiences during childhood and youth. It chronicles May Day celebrations and forgotten children's games, the daily lives of farmworkers and craftsmen, friends and relations - all painted with the freshness of observation that makes this a precise and endearing portrayal of country life at the end of the last century.",
