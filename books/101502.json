  "description": "Drug War - The Smell of DutyTwo countries and two species together in the fight against heartless drug traffickers and their unknown accomplices.A story inspired in separate real events, and put together with fictional characters. It addresses the violence related to drugs and weapons trafficking. A situation that has practically created a war in Mexico. Executions, shootings, kidnapping, and extortion have become daily events. The menace gets closer to the US every day and most people don’t know or think it’s somebody else’s problem. The objective is to create awareness and deal with drug trafficking and violence in a way that can be read and discussed in a family environment.The characters represent agents and dogs of law enforcement corporations on both sides of the border. Tragedy, deception, greed, and corruption collide against friendship, hard work, family values, and lots of courage. Situations range from confronting vacuum cleaners, to confronting armed bank robbers; from tracking alley cats, to tracking cold blooded killers. Places range from the mountains of central Mexico to the San Diego Bay marinas. Add slices of humor, a pinch of love, a few drops of mythology, and an angelical touch to the recipe of the story.In the war against drugs, you are the last line of defensewww.drugwar101.com",
