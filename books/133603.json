  "description": "She traveled millennia into the future. Staying wasn’t part of the plan.\nLife in Avice is a welcome contrast to the oppressive city Amaline grew up in. Escaping echoes of the past isn’t easy, and her new life doesn’t need the complication of an irritable ward steward. However, a secret looms: alien symbiotes known as Tians runebound Amaline to another—but she’s in no rush to entwine their lives by seeking them out.\nHe’s known for avoiding others. The time travelers from New Rapids are no exception.\nControl is key to Rauve’s structured life as Ward Zabel’s steward—and the way to bury his past. When he discovers that Amaline is his runebound partner, he resolves to make amends and gain her trust. What Rauve doesn’t expect is that slipping off the shroud of enemies will unveil that things aren’t as contentious as they seem.\nThe Tians, eager to communicate with humans, push Amaline to her limits—and only Rauve can provide the missing fragment to a puzzle that’s plagued her for months.\n***Each book in Runebound Earth features a different couple with their own HEA. It can be read a standalone, with guest appearances by prior characters and some references to earlier events in the series.Runebound Earth Series\n\n   Citizen 4473 (Willow & Tam) \n  \n   Fractured (Amaline & Rauve) \n  \n   Perfectly Imperfect (Kimara & Qaze) - coming Fall 2024",
