  "description": "Enrolling at BCU was supposed to be my chance at freedom. An escape from my parents who insist I follow in their footsteps as a Guardian of the Society. Keep the members safe—that’s what I’m supposed to do. But how can I safeguard the students when I can’t even protect myself?Someone has been watching me. His eyes burn into my soul like a branding iron. At night, he haunts my dreams and transforms them into nightmares. And sometimes when I wake, he’s there. Standing at the foot of my bed in awe of my existence. He isn’t the one I fear most, though. His best friends—Maddox and Lev— have their eyes on me, too. Only their obsession runs deeper than Ridge’s and I fear if I fall under their thumbs, I won’t make it out of here alive. There once was a sicko who lurked in the mist. He preyed on my soul baring a closed iron fist. His stare made me itch while his eyes locked me under his spell. But taking his hand may be my only escape from this hell.",
