  "description": "Sometimes life can be a real witch.  Meet Maxie Duncan. Your average 23-year-old blonde. If you can call being wealthy, gorgeous, and knowing what the future holds at times, average.  After her fianc√© blindsides her with a breakup at their favorite restaurant, she leaves Maine for a shot at being Hollywood's new 'it girl.' There's only one problem. She's never acted a day in her life.  When a big Hollywood director sends her packing, she realizes if she wants to stay in L.A., she may have to become a normal girl after all. But normal has never been in the cards for her. Strange things keep happening wherever she goes, a red-eyed shadow no one else sees is stalking her, and to top it off, she may be falling in love again, with either the bookish guy next door, or Hollywood's hottest leading man.  But everything isn't what it seems. Someone's keeping secrets from her. Is it her new friends at the apartment building she moved into? Or is it Ryan Everheart, the actor who wants to sweep her off her feet? And why are her feet suddenly floating off the ground?  It's enough to drive a girl insane. All Maxie wants to do is ride off into the sunset with her one true love and find a killer pair of Manolo Blahniks on the way. But how's a girl supposed to focus on a love life and shopping when everywhere she turns someone or something is trying to kill her?",
