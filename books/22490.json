  "description": "Since we saw him last in Sober Justice , Mike Connolly has moved on from his live-in girlfriend and he's still sober, but his law practice remains on the skidsâ€”until he's asked to represent a former police officer suspected in the bombing death of a wealthy Southern heir. Mike needs all the help he can get to solve this case that involves infidelity, drugs, money, and espionage. He finds himself unraveling a knotted case with a kind of foresight and help he hadn't even believed in before. Double Take is set in Mobile, Alabama, against a backdrop of shrimpers, strip clubs, and rowdy bars with dog-fights for entertainment. It's not gratuitous but realistic, and satisfies readers of gritty mysteries. Download the Readers' Guide.",
