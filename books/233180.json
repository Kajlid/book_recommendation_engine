  "title": "Made Men",
  "description": "With bodies piling up, and supernatural murders on the rise, independent contractor Jim Shaw is busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking contest. That's oddly appropriate, as disabled veteran Jim Shaw only has one leg. He's also got silver bullets, a little help from local law enforcement, and a smart mouth. Shapeshifters, fae, and vampires beware, as the Jim Shaw Universe debuts with an action packed novel of magical realism, set in small town Midwest.",
