  "title": "The Captains Mermaid",
  "description": "Lavinia Stewart was raised in Jamaica, footloose and fancy free--and returning to England to become a lady at last has proved most difficult. Though she must make her debut, polite society and its endless rules only make her head ache. She would just as soon not dance with dukes and converse with countesses, and her older brother refuses to spend so much as a shilling on a London Season for her. Yet Captain William Braedon Chartwell is delighted that Lavinia is to remain in the country for months to come...By great good fortune, his estate and that of the Stewarts lie side by side--and his charming new neighbor is simply irresistible. Though Captain Chartwell has spent years at sea in the service of his King, his greatest adventure awaits: wooing--and wedding--his very lovely Lavinia.",
