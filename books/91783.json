  "description": "Abe Jennings’ parents finally got him out of the zone and into Keystone. A decent town where everyone looks normal and the streets aren't filled with sludge. The best part is the lack of giant monsters destroying the place. That’s all fine and dandy for his parents, but Abe has no interest in staying there.The kids treat him like a second class citizen. And thanks to the radiation back home, he was born with a face only a mother could love. But Abe tries his best to make it through school everyday. Which isn’t easy until he finds his true calling: fighting. Now that’s all he can think about which doesn’t make his straight-laced parents too happy.",
