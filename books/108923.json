Trouble follows Noir as she escapes the vampire culture into The Fringe, where the most rebellious humans dwell. Well, at least she thought – other creatures of the night and day call the fringe home too. Among them, she might just find the witch to make her one wish come true, if he does not find her first. Being juiced used to be her biggest fear until she finds out the alternative. Mandatory service sounds a lot like slavery to Noir. Good thing her sexy captor has a bigger problem, they all do… With the city on lockdown, trying to flush out the designers of the latest zombie virus, talk of a rebellion puts everyone on edge. The bleeders get caught in the middle, enforcing curfews and sanctions to punish all humans. Noir may be busy fighting her own battles with the men in her life but she can’t ignore her place in the upcoming conflict for long.Even if she is more like a vampire than she ever thought, Noir tries to resist giving into the most basic of her desires as she struggles to free the man she truly loves. With demons reappearing, friends changing and her world crumbling down around her – how does someone who can not die cope? Is she a pawn in a more sinister plot or the key to saving the city? What will happen when Noir decides to seize the night?",
