  "description": "Fight or flight only works when you know who you're up against.There's no running from an enemy who is constantly several steps ahead. The best you can do is stand and face them.Finding my mate should have been a time to rejoice, not the catalyst for disaster. The closer we become, the more danger we find ourselves in.Shocking revelations and buried secrets surface, only reinforcing the truth that Griffin and I are in big trouble.One thing is clear, we can’t win if we don’t even know who we’re up against. I’m not quite sure if we’ll be able to make it out alive.If you can't get enough of books by Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Leia Stone, and Jaymin Eve, then you'll love this paranormal romance.",
