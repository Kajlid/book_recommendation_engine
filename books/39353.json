  "description": "A full-length novel from the award winning author who brought you One Crazy Summer, Ghosts of Ophidian, Dominion, and the international bestselling series, The Mystic Saga. Eddie inherits a house that people believe stole the life of his cousin many years ago. Some say the house is haunted. Eddie is about to discover something much better... There's a door in his basement that leads directly to a local amusement park, but this particular park was razed some time in the 50's. Now the year is 1928 and Patience Webb is at the top of her Hollywood game. Unfortunately, at the age of 25, her successful movie career comes to a sudden and mysterious end… Patience Webb is gone! That same year, nearly 2400 miles away in Silver Falls, Nena Brooks – also known as Brooksie appears out of nowhere and she wants nothing to do with anyone and she seems to be hiding something. Eddie tries to remain just a sightseer in the 1920's because he knows that getting attached to the past can cause problems. But what happens when he stumbles upon an intriguing woman named Brooksie? And what if history still demands a tragic ending?",
