  "description": "In 1974, Ian 'Molly' Meldrum was working as a record producer and music journalist when he was offered the chance to host a new music show called Countdown. It was a show that would run for the next 13 years and become one of the most loved and most watched programs on Australian television. It also turned Molly into a national institution (or 'mental institution' as one of his friends put it). During that period he not only became the most influential voice in Australian music, he endeared himself to millions of viewers with a uniquely unpolished interviewing style and a tangible on screen passion. For better or worse, weather interviewing Prince Charles or Sid Vicious, Molly was always Molly. Along the way he talked, partied, argued, exchanged blows and became firm friends with a rollcall of the world's greatest musical names. Filled with outrageous anecdotes, an incredible cast of musos, deadbeats, transvestites and international superstars, The Never Ever Ending Story is Molly's hilarious, vivid, warm and always compelling memoir of these incredible years.",
