  "description": "There are over 825,000 employees of the United States Postal Service including 65,00 Postmasters, letter carriers, and 72,500 agents of the United States Postal Inspector's Service. All of whom share one thing in a desperate need for a hero. Postmaster Alex Bentley of Crystal Lake, New York is that hero and \"First Class Male\" is his story. Content with his life as a small town postmaster, Alex Bentley never intended to become a hero, much less a media sensation, but fate had different plans. When unpublished author Rachel Clark walked into his lobby to pick up yet another rejection letter, the disappointment in her vibrant green eyes compelled him to do whatever he could to help her realize her dream. Even secretly edit her manuscript. Little did he know his one impetuous act would lead him through a complex maze of jealousy, blackmail and revenge. From deep within the splendor of the Catskill Mountains, to the majestic skyline of Manhattan, First Class Male delivers an intricate tale of a small town postmaster who triumphs over a ruthless District Attorney, a mysterious adversary, an unsympathetic public and finally his own heart.",
