Liberation doesn’t come easily. War, death, betrayal, love, and revenge will all cross her path - and if she wins, the angels should be very afraid.With updated storytelling to suit a modern audience, you can explore a world of magic, technology, time travel, the true story of the Grim Reaper, and the real mystic past of angels – all in this beautifully crafted novel.",
