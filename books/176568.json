  "description": "He is a Welsh battle lord, and she is a Saxon village girl. They come from different worlds--but together they will make history. When Merwenna of Weyham's betrothed does not return from war, she goes in search of him only to discover the bitter truth--he is dead. Instead she meets Cynddylan, a Welsh prince who has just returned from a campaign to the north and has made an uneasy pact with the Mercian King. Arrogant and ambitious, Dylan is determined to take back lands for his people--yet King Penda of Mercia is not a man to trust. As the shadow of conflict between Mercia and Wales deepens, Merwenna and Dylan's fates are entwined. From the green heart of Mercia, to the woods and mountains of Wales, Merwenna sets off on a life-changing journey. On the way she struggles between grief for the man she has lost, and her powerful attraction to this battle lord who appears to love only power and glory.  The exciting first instalment of THE KINGDOM OF MERCIA series is for fans of Historical Fiction, Historical Romance and Adventure. Readers who enjoy Diana Gabaldon, Bernard Cornwell and Elizabeth Chadwick should enjoy this epic romance adventure set in Dark Ages Britain. Although each novel follows on historically, this series can be read as separate, standalone, romances. THE BREAKING DAWN was a semi-finalist in the 2016 Chatelaine Award for Romance novels (Chanticleer International Awards).",
