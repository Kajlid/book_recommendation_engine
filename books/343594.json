  "title": "The Tudor Rose",
  "description": "Two princes battle to determine England's destiny: whoever wins will take Britain's most rightful heir as his bride and her kingdom for his own. On one side is her uncle Richard, the last Plantagenet King, whom she fears to be the murderer of her two brothers, the would-be kings. On the other is Henry Tudor, the exiled knight. Can he save her from a horrifying marriage to a cutthroat soldier? Thrust into the intrigue and drama of the War of the Roses, Elizabeth has a country within her grasp--if she can find the strength to unite a kingdom torn apart by a thirst for power. A richly drawn tale of the woman who launched one of the most dramatic dynasties England has ever seen, The Tudor Rose is a vibrant, imaginative look at the power of a queen.",
