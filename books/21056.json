Age has nothing to do with it. Oz belongs to the young at heart and always will. All that is needed is an adventuresome spirit and a genuine affection for classic fantasy.” —Terry Brooks, author of  The Sword of Shannara“I was raised with the Oz books, and their enchantment, humor and excitement remain with me. They are still a joy and a treasure. I welcome this Oz revival.” —Stepehen R. Donaldson, author of  The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant“The land of Oz has managed to fascinate each new generation. . . . The Oz books continue to exert their spell . . . and those who read [them] are often made what they were not—imaginative, tolerant, alert to wonders, life.” —Gore Vidal,  The New York Review of Books",
