  "description": "Temp worker Kyle Shannon is plagued by more than the messy office at Bright Hope Equestrian Center. She's about to confiscate a deadbeat owner's horse, one of Bright Hope's partners is missing, and Sunny Disposition has suddenly gone berserk. To make matters worse, the two-legged clients are more high-strung than the four-legged ones.As the police investigate the human remains discovered behind the barn, many think the bones belong to a missing farmhand who was dealing drugs. Kyle isn't convinced but after she stumbles over a piece of evidence and lands in the hospital, Kyle knows one thing for sure: there's a murderer out there who isn't horsing around.",
