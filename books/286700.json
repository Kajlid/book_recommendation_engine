  "description": "While still twelve years old, Janina Hescheles wrote this harrowing report from her hiding place in Cracow. The notebook, filled with clear childlike writing, was fortunately preserved. She tells about the German occupation of Lvov, the loss of her parents, about the Ghetto and mass murder in the notorious forced-labor camp Janowska in Lvov. Thrown into the abyss of horror, Janina understood and sensed more than could be expected of someone her age.With the help of the Underground she managed to escape in the autumn 1943 shortly before the liquidation of the camp, and lived in occupied Poland with false papers and identity until the end of the Second World War. Janina, who has been called \"the Polish Anne Frank‚Äù, has given the world a moving and important report that has been presented here in its entirety.",
