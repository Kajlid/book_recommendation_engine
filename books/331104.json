  "description": "Eliyahu Benamozegh (1822-1900) was the rabbi of Livorno in Italy; he held that brotherhood can be accomplished by finding common principles among different systems of thought, all of which, according to him, are derived from divine precepts. Nowadays, this approach retains all its relevance, as it was the case in its time which corresponds to the years before the two world wars. \"AlSadiqin Press\" thus presents the original and unabridged version of \"Israel and Humanity so that readers can take cognizance of Rabbi Benamozegh's broad, inclusive vision and his many approaches to the role of the Jewish people vis-Ã -vis the nations of the world. This will allow the readership not to be deprived of the slightest editorial omission. It will also serve as a useful tool to build a framework for a just society, as Rabbi Benamozegh envisioned. Book 1 is very philosophical, Book 2 is applicable to society & current events. Book 3 is specifically for those who are interested in Noahism.",
