  "description": "alternate cover edition ISBN 1477633731/9781477633731“The odd scent she’d picked up earlier, combined with this girl’s unnatural speed, suddenly clicked in her mind. Rage flooded her when she realized what it meant. 'They've turned her,' she thought as she followed the girl into the woods. 'They turned a child and set her loose to hunt her. Sick.'” When the immortals have an eternity, the games they play become more macabre. It’s Sanaan’s job, and personal mission, to see the game’s masters annihilated. After all, they are the same people who destroyed her life and all her hopes for the future, creating a monster with an obsessive need for revenge. Vendetta is the first book in Amaranthine Blood series—the tale of a vampire whose only desire is to annihilate the Xul, once and for all. Sanaan thinks she’s got it under control, until the arrival of a stranger finds her precariously balancing on a knife’s edge between change and a descent into darkness. And there’s more going on in the fight than she ever knew—things that could change the course of the world’s fate forever.",
