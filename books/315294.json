  "description": "Maybe my time in Rainy Dale has run its course. Things are spiraling out of control for our indelicate, but occasionally loveable, Doctor Thornton. His romantic life is already in turmoil, but when someone sets fire to his medical practice his finances are also in jeopardy. Sheriff Royce Callum offers Maxwell a safe place to stay, as he searches for the arsonist. Maxwell can easily rub people the wrong way, which makes it challenging for Royce to figure out if the attack on Maxwell’s business was personal or random. When other fires begin to pop up in Rainy Dale, it becomes obvious there’s a serial arsonist spreading terror through town. Things go from bad to worse when one of the fires turns deadly.",
