Diaries of the Damned is an international bestseller having sat in the number one position on the British Horror rank on Amazon.com for several weeks, and has been in the top ten since its release.  The flu is spreading through the English county of Norfolk. A nasty virus that has hospitals overflowing and people are being transported out of the county for medical attention elsewhere. What nobody realizes however is that they are spreading much more than a bad case of the flu.  When the dead start to rise people are caught off-guard. Trapped in the town of Norwich people are battling their way to the local airport, where the military have established a base.  Separated upon arrival, with no word of explanation, the survivors are herded onto planes and evacuated to safety.  Paul Larkin, a worn our journalist who once harbored Pulitzer-sized dreams starts talking to several passengers on his flight, and soon people begin to come together, each telling their tales to Paul, whoagrees to document it all for the sake of ensuring that their tale of triumph is heard by the world. Little did this group know, that their tales would uncover a truth far more sinister than anybody could have thought possible.  When the dead rise, they bring all of your secrets with them, and sometimes, the truth is worse than the fiction.",
