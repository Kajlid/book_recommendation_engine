  "title": "Temperature's Rising: An Oral and Visual History of Galaxie 500",
  "description": "Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste is a fascinating oral history of one of American indie rock's most enduring and influential acts. Slow, deliberate and deceptively simple, the music of Boston-based band Galaxie 500 was wonderfully at odds with the prevailing underground sounds of the mid-to-late-1980s. The primary contributors are the three band members 혰 Naomi Yang, Damon Krukowski, and Dean Wareham 혰 but dozens of people were interviewed in all 혰 fellow musicians and record business folks, music critics, and scenesters. This book provides a complex, sometimes contentious account of the band's rise to indie stardom and their acrimonious breakup 혰 a multiperspectival view of the events Wareham describes in his acclaimed memoir, Black Postcards. It also includes dozens of rare and never-before-seen photographs, as well as posters and other ephemera from the collections of the band members and their friends and colleagues.",
