Eloquent and inspiring, The Gift of Faith celebrates religion in the lives of children. Jeanne Harrison Nieuwejaar draws from her own personal stories and experiences to illustrate how religious community plays an integral role in deepening the faith of parents, who are children's primary educators. She encourages parents to communicate their beliefs in words and in actions and to become part of a religious community that supports these beliefs. She offers ways to foster spiritual awareness in the home and includes practices for marking the many events in children's lives as religious occasions.",
