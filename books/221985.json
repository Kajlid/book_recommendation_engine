  "description": "It's been three years Bethany Anne and her team have been building, trying their best to stay off the radar and not fight with those they are trying to save.  The emotions have boiled to the surface.  The is a line drawn in the sand, and some idiots just have to step across it.  Those that thought the cat didn't have claws are about to find out how very, very wrong they are.    **Please note, as mentioned in a review, there is flagrantly foul language in these novels. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.",
