  "description": "In POSTMODERN SPIRITUALITY IN THE AGE OF ENTITLEMENT, impatience, quickness, and the need for instant gratification unconsciously push the postmodern person towards \"social and spiritual shallowness.\" Attempting to cope with an ever-increasing flow and flood of information, knowledge, and data, we skim and scan, instead of deep reading and absorption. David Robson weaves numerous thoughtful and stimulating viewpoints from other noted experts combined with his timely insights into how our world was affected by the shift to a post-modernism society. This substantial work was written after years of research, study, and contemplation with the goal of stimulating each reader on their own path of spiritual awareness and personal growth.David John Robson begins by leading the reader through an overview of postmodernism, and how it affects and changed Western Society, Western Christianity, and, in turn, Western Spirituality. Also addressed are chapters on the major trends surrounding postmodernism spirituality. The author poses questions are at the end of each chapter for the individual reader or discussion group to consider and discuss. Throughout this work, David challenges the reader to embrace the future of both community and corporate spirituality, and especially the exploration of one's own spirituality in the age of our dominating, \"It's all about me\" society.",
