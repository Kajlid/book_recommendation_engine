  "description": "I'm just trying to find a way to honor the memory of the only person who ever cared about me, my Grandma Rose, when I walk into his tattoo parlor.Maybe it’s the emotion of everything that’s happened this last week. Maybe it’s my subconscious crying out for help, that I need someone. But not just anyone. Someone who can fill a role for me that I never thought I needed.The man whose name I don’t even know. But what I do know is that he’s a no b.s. kinda guy, demonstrated by the way he carries himself and how he goes about his business.And the moment he sets his eyes on me he goes from zero to sixty in no time at all.He’s batshit crazy, at bunny boiling levels, and possessive to boot, and the scariest part is I’m right there with him. But I’ve got debts that need clearing and I’m the only one who can fix them. Or so I think.I’ve got a lot to learn, and he’s ready to teach me. But will I learn that love, at first sight, goes just as quickly as it comes, or can this experienced man show me that things can be different than the life I’ve lived up to this point?There’s only one way to find out and that’s by jumping in headfirst. I just hope he’s there to catch me because I’m falling for him…fast.My possessive daddy.",
