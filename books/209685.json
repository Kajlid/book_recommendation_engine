  "description": "“If I have learned anything in life, it is that love is dirty and cruel. Love is frail, too easily shattered by lies and betrayal. Real love is a pipe dream, something I never wanted anyway. Or so I thought…”Baddest of the bad boys, Justin Dorsey is all about the pleasure life can bring. As bassist for the Bangin’ Mofos, he has reaped the rewards of his life on the small stage of the Copperline Bar by night and paid the bills as a college professor by day. He's kept the two totally separate. Isolated.Then he finds himself captivated after a night that cannot be undone. He’s suddenly tempted by his sole taboo. A thirst he must not quench. An itch he must not scratch. A craving he simply cannot satisfy.The bigger they are, the harder they fall, and Justin's world crashes down around him. Everything he thought — everything he knew — tells him to stay away.But the need only grows stronger. The memory only intensifies until it consumes him. That one forbidden touch.That taste of hot, dirty love.",
