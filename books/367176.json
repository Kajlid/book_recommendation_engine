  "description": "As a boy, Ailean MacLachlainn dreamed of living an adventurous life and longed to be a celebrated warrior of his clan. Until a shy smile and a glance from MÃ¹irne's blue eyes turned his head and escalated his rivalry with Latharn into enmity and open conflict. When Ailean became a man, his boyhood dreams faded. Until Bonnie Prince Charlie came to reclaim his father's throne. The Jacobite loyalties of Ailean's clan chief involved the MacLachlainns in the uprising and set Ailean on a course toward a destiny of which he could never have dreamed. What happens when a man's dreams turn to dust? And when a man loses everything, does he have what it takes to go on?",
