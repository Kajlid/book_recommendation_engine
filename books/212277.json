  "description": "Dante saves Rin from her abusive husband only to face an even greater enemy--her. But the web of deceit trapping Rin may go a lot deeper than any of them know. He takes her to California to lay low and dig around for dirty details on her abusive ex only to run into his own past in the form of a jealous brunette. The sh*t storm ushers in an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, f**ck for a f**ck fight that he never saw coming.",
