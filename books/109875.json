  "description": "“Have you ever wondered about the dark water?”When surfer chic Lu meets Morgan, a peculiar boy who swims in the forbidden, shark-infested cove water at night, her sleepy beach life suddenly gets a whole lot less sleepy. Her teacher assigns a paper that casts Lu into an investigation about coastal urban legends - one in particular that is eerily connected to her own family history. More gets wacky, and quickly: she loses patches of time, has vivid nightmares, gets into a huge fight with her BFF, and is fiercely attracted to the new weird kid in town. Then Dad sends a warning. Only problem is...he’s been dead for twelve years. Will Lu unravel the dark water mysteries before it's too late? Or will time land her on the wrong side of an urban legend?",
