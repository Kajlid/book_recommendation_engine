  "description": "Charlie Nolan hates Christmas.Mainly because Christmas for him means being trapped for four days with his parents and extended family along with their swirling vortex of lunacy and drama. Mum is going crazy trying to find the cake forks. Dad is building a Christmas light display that could potentially burn down the house. Grandma has a sexy young toy boy, and Uncle Jack is dressed as an elf. The Nolan house is a powder keg waiting to explode.When a friendly party game sets emotions on high, it initiates a chain reaction that the Nolan family may never recover from. Secrets will be revealed. Lies will be exposed. Hearts will be broken. Juicy Scandals will be made public. The fruit mince pies will be disgusting. In other words, a fairly standard Nolan family Christmas.This year, amid the usual chaos and insanity, a little Christmas magic could see some past mistakes corrected, leading to an old romance rekindled for Charlie. But only a Christmas miracle will spare this yearâ€™s family gathering from being a total fiasco!Warning: this light-hearted holiday novella contains some coarse language, sexual references, smutty humour, inappropriately named cocktails, more drama than a telenovela and is suitable only for persons 18+",
