  "description": "Editorial \"I really enjoyed that Jo wasn't chasing too hard ~ that it really was Edith coming to realise that her preconceptions about service personnel that's stopping her from getting what she wanted. The ending gives the story an unexpected twist ~ I'd love to read more about these characters, but the closing lines are perfect just as they are.\" -- Rainbow ReviewsBook For over 250 years, the use of the tarot for divination has been a mainstay of mystical and occult practices. The themes and forces represented by the cards are said to govern our lives and our destinies. Whether you believe that or not, the story of the cards is nevertheless the story of our lives -- the accomplishments and the pitfalls, the path from soaring joy to crushing defeat and back again. \"Cast the Cards\" is a collection of six all-new short stories that explore snapshots of remarkable individuals trying to make their way along that path.Edith is a woman who has been burned too many times to play the Fool again. That is, until she meets Jo, a naval communications officer, and finds herself questioning all of her assumptions about life and love. Edith's rule to never again date someone in the military first bends, and then breaks under the weight of her attraction to easy-going, confident Jo. But when duty and desire collide, Edith fears being left behind once again.",
