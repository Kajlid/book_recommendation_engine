Just going into college in 1944 as a young adult, she met Lord Simon Baldevar who entranced her into his bloodlust life. Lord Baldevar, Simon, then becoming her Master, took Meghann into his dark realms of lust and destruction. For 13 years her pride could not adjust to this torture and possession. She leaves her Master on the roof, impaled and forced to meet his death with the sunlight.Decades later, Alcuin, Meghann's mentor and a different bloodline of vampires from the Black Plague Age, tells her that Baldevar has survived. Simon Baldevar was not expecting his estranged consort to be so strong; to have learned from Alcuin more than Simon ever meant to teach her. Along with Jimmy, Meghann's companion of six years, and Charles, her dearest blood friend, Meghann and Alcuin vow and plan to hunt down and kill the Master of her past and life blood of her being.The second book in this trilogy is Crimson Night and the third book is Crimson Shadows.",
