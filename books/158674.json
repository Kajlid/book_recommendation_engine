  "description": "Della Comb is the queen of her hive. She's only in her early twenties, but she's already managed to build an empire selling drugs to junkies who are looking for the ultimate escape. The key to her success is that she manufactures her drugs with a secret ingredient: a very specific blend of pesticides.Her only problem is the two bumbling exterminators she's come to rely on for product. They spend more time playing video games and making armchair philosophies than actually working. Thankfully, they realize they too are short on supplies—pizza and breakfast burritos—so they give her a call, asking to meet up at the Chase High Rise, a building known for its unique brand of squalor.Immediately, she feels sick to her stomach. Not only is the place absolutely disgusting, but it's also home to Bill Krang, a man who claims to hear insects speaking. The things they say don't make sense, even to him, but the words are causing him to physically deteriorate at a rapid pace. Della's ultimate fear is meeting this man and contracting his disease. However, business is business, and Krang's apartment is abundant of product. Before long, she finds herself thrown straight into her worst nightmare, and the experience...changes her.HEARERS OF THE CONSTANT HUM challenges its readers to work against instinct by exposing the dangers of our own curiosity. It's more than just a story, it's a warning of a much needed social change. We either take its advice, or risk rewriting what it means to be human in a world ran by insects.",
