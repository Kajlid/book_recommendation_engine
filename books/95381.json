Young, beautiful, and yearning for love, Heather Bancroft meets the \"perfect\" man...and is lured into a game in which she begins to make more money than she ever imagined.

Her thirst for revenge takes her halfway around the globe, to the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean, where her nemesis secludes himself in obscene wealth that he's gained from the financial ruin of others. Heather is playing for the highest stakes in a lethal game. Only one man loves her - he's handsome, confident, and just as determined as she is. Only one man can stop her - a criminal mastermind who is intent on her destruction.",
