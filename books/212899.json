  "description": "The shocking inside account that has outraged the Bush administration, Chain of Command gives the most revealing and terrifying picture yet of what really led to war in Iraq. Seymour Hersh, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist whose sensational reportage has revealed the stories the others can't or won't get, traces the chain of events that turned America from victim of terrorism on 9/11 to perpetrator of a dirty and disastrous war. Plumbing an unrivalled list of top military and CIA contacts, he uncovers an astonishing story of corruption, intelligence failures, secret Pentagon operations and behind-the-scenes deals and provides the closest answer we have to why it went so wrong.",
