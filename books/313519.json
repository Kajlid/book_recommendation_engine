  "description": "Reading \"Notes To Myself\" is one of those rare experiences that comes only once in a great while. The editor who discovered the book said, \"When I first read Prather's manuscript it was late at night and I was tired, but by the time I finished it, I felt rested and alive. Since then I've reread it many times and it says even more to me now.\" The book serves as a beginning for the reader's exploration of his or her own life and as a treasury of thoughtful and insightful reminders.",
