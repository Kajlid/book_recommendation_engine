  "description": "Caroline Abbott knows her way around bridezillas. Working at a stationery store means helping engaged couples pick out the perfect save-the-datecards and invitations for their dream weddings—a dream job. Until the bridezilla of the day belongs to her first kiss, Alexander Wilder. He’s all grown up now, running his family’s luxury hotel chain, and even hotter than she remembers from that scorcher of a smooch. So when Caroline catches his fiancée half-naked with another man, she has to tell him. And Alex has to break it off. And of course, the ex-bridezilla goes completely bonkers. Good thing Caroline has plenty of experience—and friends to help save her. She also has the sudden interest of Alex, who has a proposal of his own for her. Is it just a rebound for him, or does he also feel the same spark that drew them together all those years ago?",
