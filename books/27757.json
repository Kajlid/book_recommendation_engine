  "description": "Hilda Hopkins is up to her old tricks. After a close shave with her old nemesis, PC Barbara Grey, at Victoria Station, Hilda finds herself a cushy billet as Maid to a Madame. Madame Tempest to be precise! While Madame busies herself handing out discipline, lines and lashes to a steady stream of middle aged and otherwise highly respectable naughty schoolboys, Hilda knits up some lovely outfits for them to wear, just like Nanny used to make!Of course, before she can crochet a bonnet to match that cute man-size buster suit with the teddy on the front, Hilda has to knit herself a garrotte and hand out a little BDSM of her own. Inspired by some old Alec Guiness movies and a nearby railway line, it isn't long before Hilda's victims are turning up in goods yards across the country!",
