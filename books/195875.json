But an accidental collision between the boats triggers a terrifying series of events, as an explosion leaves Kastamarov struggling to save his crew. While their own government denies knowledge of the incident and refuses international aid, the men of the Kursk must fight fire, rising water and the onset of despair. Their plight ignored by their President, they are on their own against the elements in a desperate attempt to survive as Mitchel James is caught between a cover up and his own rescue plan. Based in part on a true story of bravery, tragedy and the lethal folly of pride, Kursk is a not to miss political drama.",
