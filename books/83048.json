  "description": "\"Then, why don't you run, eh? Right back to school.\"The Old School stood alone and abandoned on the edge of the Old Town, somewhere in the South-East of England. It was a place of horror and old nightmares; where shadows gathered and the silence was haunted by the voices of the dead. Clayton, Jennifer and Louisa are being drawn back to the Old School, drawn by something shaped from their own darkness and despair. It waits for them, it calls to them, and it yearns to take everything from them. Because it was once like them but now it is something else.Forgotten and unloved. Unforgiven and hated.It is the Thing Behind the Door.",
