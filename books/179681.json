On the verge of their adulthood they are visiting their wise, old grandmother in Ireland on a very special day, and finally learn why their life has been strangely affected by something they have not previously understood.

Dana performs an irreversible deed that opens the gate to the strange world of Aldheim, and they meet the strange creature calling for them. In this world they find their true calling, their very special talents, the truth of the gods and also a world of mystery, cruelty and adversity.

Much is demanded of Shannon, who is struggling with her loyalties. Despite the many dangers and their apparent hopeless situation in the new, dangerous world, there is hope, for Shannon has some very special, coveted powers of healing, reserved to the chosen of the gods. If she perseveres, she can change the past and bring back even the gods. But the price will be great.",
