  "description": "“Nazi intrigue in a homosexual brothel . . . a spy thriller that breaks new ground.”— Kirkus Reviews Hank Fayette, Seaman Second Class, had enlisted in his Texas hometown, used his shore leave to visit a movie house on 42nd Street, and ended up in a gay brothel near Manhattan’s West piers. It was the wrong place to be at the wrong time. When this big, lanky blond with a country boy’s drawl—and a country boy’s hard muscular body—couldn’t fight his way clear of the Shore Patrol who raided the place, he figured he was on his way to the brig or a dishonorable discharge. But in 1942, a few months after Pearl Harbor, the Navy was more interested in capturing spies than in punishing “sex offenders,” and Hank was just the kind of sailor they had in mind. Their offer to Hank was simple: go back to the brothel, work undercover as a prostitute, and risk your life to entrap Nazi spies. This erotic, suspenseful novel captures the big-band feel of New York City in the forties, the intensity of a nation at war, and the passion of men for their country—and for each other. “Entertaining, sexy, and touching . . .”—Stephen McCauley “Strong, action-filled . . . a tightly knit plot . . . a very engaging story about murder and intrigue that is hard to put down.”— Lambda Rising Book Report",
