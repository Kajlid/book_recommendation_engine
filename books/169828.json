  "description": "Higher Education 101 is not about furthering one’s academic education: it’s about evolving as a human; about rising to be the best one can be; about defining success; and choosing the life one wants to live. For anyone interested in seeking personal development, not only for oneself, but for the greater good, Higher Education will provoke readers to take a hard look at their beliefs to see if they are up to the challenge – and inspire others to do the same.",
