She transfers to a new school, determined to leave the past behind. But when she's paired up with Lucas McNamara, the 'boy next door' all deliciously grown up, she knows she's in trouble. Back then she didn't understand why her mother, who used to work for Lucas' family, told her not to get attached. But they were inseparable -until her mother was fired because the McNamaras don't mix with the help.He never thought he'd see her again...Lucas McNamara knew there was something familiar about his biology partner and is floored when it hits him. She's 'Julie'--the barefoot beauty who was unlike any girl he'd ever met then or since. While years have passed and he's far from the carefree kid that Juliet once knew, one thing remains the same. He wants her. He's always wanted her--but he's the heir to the McNamara multi-million dollar empire and his family is hell bent on keeping them apart.",
