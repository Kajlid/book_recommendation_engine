At night, it murmurs lies in my ears; by day, it manipulates everything I see. I no longer know what’s real. I’m living a nightmare, but I can’t wake up to escape.The demon threatens to destroy everything I care about, and now it wants me to kidnap and murder a paranormal creature. Refusal means excruciating pain or sleepwalking into oncoming traffic … again. Or worse, it will hurt someone I love.I don’t dare refuse, even if I have to steal from my friends, sell my body, or ruin my college career. Anything to stop the feeling of its claws scraping the insides of my skull.If I make a deal with the devil, what price will I pay?**NOTE: This book can be read as a standalone.**__________________ Praise for Breaking Angelinaa Paranormal Investigation novel The New Adult Dark Paranormal Romance readers love!
