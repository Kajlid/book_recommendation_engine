  "title": "Not Far from Aviemore",
  "description": "Indeed, there have been numerous overlooked scientific advances over the last decade on the interpretation of paranormal experiences, some of which have provided creative inspiration for this chilling tale set in the Scottish Highlands.This innovative approach is based on true accounts of notorious supernatural events recorded within the history and folklore of the Cairngorms, which have been blended with current scientific theories to reach a fresh perspective on what might really be behind the demons that became the source of fireside tales warning children of the terrors of the Underworld.Our appreciation of the supernatural is in desperate need of a more authentic form of engagement and storytelling, because excitable folk running around abandoned buildings and crying ghost every time someone farts is doing plenty of harm and no good whatsoever.A spirit of validity is crucial to Reuel’s storytelling and he has only drawn on genuine sources of unexplained phenomena to inspire the investigation undertaken by co-protagonists Adam Forrester and Becky Green. There are no wild interpretations or fabricated spooks within these pages, and yet the supernatural happenings are absolutely jaw-dropping. Did you know that for over a hundred years mountaineers have reported a ghostly figure of giant proportions as frequenting Scotland’s second highest peak of Ben Macdhui, for example?It is this cold and lonely peak that becomes the epicentre for Adam and Becky’s investigation… but there is so much more. What begins as a personal mission soon turns into a supernatural clash with far more at stake than either of these intrepid scientists envisioned upon setting out.Enjoy this horror adventure at your peril! This book is not for entertainment purposes.",
