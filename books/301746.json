  "description": "Whatever you do, never, ever blow your cover in front of a devil….I traded my dress shoes for leather boots, my badge for a hog, and my friends for the club. It’s supposed to be temporary, but if I don’t live, breathe, and bleed Devil’s Pointe MC for even a second, it’ll all be over.But one little distraction may prove more powerful than the entire club.One day, they’ll call me Lilith and bow at my feet….Like a weed, I thrive where I’m not supposed to. I stand tall despite my infertile upbringing and the surrounding hostiles who threaten me every day. No, “despite” isn’t entirely correct, I do it all to spite them.Mark my words, I’ll prove who’s tougher and who’s the Devil in this narrative.I’m a She-Devil and I intend to show them all what it really means to be a Devil.",
