  "description": "Fishing for the TruthSeasiders,News on the docks is Sutton Bradley may be adding new stock to her little boutique store, Coastal Chic, on the square. Now, I can neither confirm nor deny that it is sexy lingerie, but seeing as Ms. Bradley has been seen on more than one occasion in the company of Brody Wilson, who, let me remind you, was voted as the catch of the season. One can only come to a certain conclusion and that is…Love is in the air.I, for one, would love to see Sutton move on from that terrible first marriage of hers, and in my humble opinion, Mr. Brody Wilson would do a fine job of making her forget all about…what’s his name.Next on my list of to do’s for today…stop by Coastal Chic! Stay tuned for more on Lingerie Gate!Fair winds and following seas!",
