  "description": "Editorial \"Carlson does a grand job packing clear world building, strong, engaging characters, hot sex, and well-rooted relationships into a short story, whilst not skimping on plot. The sense of time passing is palpable, and Hope and Bea are a fantastic couple.\" -- Rainbow Reviews\"Sexy and soothing. Odd descriptions for a story, I know, but that is what I felt as I read as intruded on the world of these two women.\" -- Coffee Time RomanceBook For over 250 years, the use of the tarot for divination has been a mainstay of mystical and occult practices. The themes and forces represented by the cards are said to govern our lives and our destinies. Whether you believe that or not, the story of the cards is nevertheless the story of our lives -- the accomplishments and the pitfalls, the path from soaring joy to crushing defeat and back again.Bea is a mind reader, weary of battle, but still with the Star in her eyes. Her lover, Hope, returns to Bea's sanctuary in need of comfort and guidance, which Bea is only too happy to give. But the respite is short-lived when other Hunters show up at the sanctuary with news of an impending battle. Bea knows she must let Hope go, even though it may be for the last time.(This is a 9,800 word short story.)",
