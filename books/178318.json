  "description": "One moment. One moment can shape our entire life.One deep breath.One slow exhale.One painted sunrise.One taste of forbidden love.One word spoken too soon.One word spoken too late.One dance with a stranger.One wayward memory. One secret kept just a moment too long.That’s all it takes.But what I didn’t know when we locked eyes that first time was that every moment we shared was just another moment leading up to that one that would forever change the course of our lives.It was the moment that I knew he knew. It was just a hunch, a feeling, a soft whisper to my soul. But it was in that moment—that one, life-altering instant—that I knew I had lost him.When Omaha-native Ashley Westcott suddenly shows up in Remington Jude’s small, Missouri town, she’s the talk of the town. When she leaves abruptly one day, the rumors fly. But only Rem knows why she left, and he’s not talking.",
