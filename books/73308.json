  "description": "Ris­ing Sun is a stand-alone, a pre­quel to David Macin­nis Gill’s acclaimed Black Hole Sun. Jacob Stringfel­low, aka Durango, once had a promis­ing career in the elite armed forces. That was before. Before his father betrayed him and his unit. Before he almost died and had an arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence flash-cloned to his brain. Now Durango and Mimi (the AI) are fig­ur­ing out how to get along and fig­ur­ing out how to stay in the game. Set on a vio­lent and unfor­get­table dystopian Mars, this is a must read for fans of the author’s Black Hole Sun tril­ogy and for any­one who loves intense, action-packed sci­ence fiction.",
