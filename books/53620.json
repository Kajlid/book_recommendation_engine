Before long, Roberto finds himself in the land of promise in the midst of golden fields and fertile fruit orchards where he can make more money in a week than he could have made in a year back home. Quickly he learns that the backbreaking work in vegetable fields under the powerful sun does not gain him the wealth, freedom, and power that heÂ’d hoped. But even in that world of cramped trains, deadly deserts and horrifying conditions, Roberto is determined to make a place for himself.",
