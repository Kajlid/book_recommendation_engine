Frost.In 1897, Bram Stoker’s iconic DRACULA redefined the horror genre and had a significant impact on the image of the vampire in popular culture. But encounters with the undead were nothing new: they had electrified readers of Gothic fiction since even before Victorian times.DRACULA’S BRETHREN is a tribute to those early writers, a collation of 19 archetypal tales written between 1820 and 1910, many long forgotten, celebrating the vampire stories that both inspired and were inspired by Bram Stoker’s iconic novel.A companion to Richard Dalby’s definitive anthology, DRACULA’S BROOD, itself 30 years old, these rediscovered stories are a genuine treasure trove for classic thrill-seekers and all lovers of supernatural fiction.",
