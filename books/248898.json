  "title": "The Flight Of Falcons - Nez Perce Bride",
  "description": "From the author who brought you Walks With Him, Comanche Bride... One must hold on, the other must let go… Born with the warrior blood of both the Scots and the Nez Perce, Falcon is as free and as fierce as the raptor for which he is named. As a young boy, he saw his life’s path, and he has sacrificed to find it. After the loss of her husband and child, Leigh travels the Oregon Trail, desperate to lay roots that will grow a family tree. In a Nez Perce village, two cultures and two hearts collide. Leigh (Morning Song,) might be Falcon’s destiny, but, another man has a claim on her, and he is the enemy. For Falcon to fulfill the dream of his youth, he must win Morning Song’s heart and face this man—even if it means fulfilling the prophecy of his own death. For Morning Song to have the family she always wanted, she must set herself free from the ties that bind, and learn to fly with the raptors. Each book is a stand alone, and does not need to be read in order. This is a longer length novella for the over 18 reader due to adult situations, sensuality and language.",
