  "description": "It's Not You, It's Me. . . For Gabby Pearson, being dumped in public before the dessert course has to be the lowest of the low--especially when it's the old, \"It's not you, it's me\" speech. Honestly, how about something \"I have five minutes to live\" (very possible);\"It's not you, it's the voices in my head\" (thanks for the warning);or \"I am such a powerful sexual being I could put you into a coma with one kiss\" (wishful thinking). Not that Gabby would ever know since Reed Larkin never bothered to take her to bed. Why does a girl bother (to shave)? The only thing left to do is offer the guy a goodbye-forever drink. . .on his head. It's Me Wanting You Completely. . . Damn. Reed did his job--he walked away from Gabby rather than drag her into his unstable life and danger. Now he's wearing her full glass of wine instead of throwing her onto his sheets. It doesn't help that the woman is smart as hell and could stop a man's breath with that wide smile and those shapely curves. Gabby has it all, and Reed wants every inch of her. And now the joke's on him, because new intel says Gabby has just become his He has one day to win her back, get information from her she may not know she has, and somehow protect her at the same time. Right Here, Right Now. Problem? The stakes are high. The odds are impossible. And the mutual attraction is as hot and strong as Gabby's anger. And Reed can only hope his next speech--\"It's you, baby, it's definitely you. . .\"--will be the start of something wild, something crazy, something dangerous, something wonderful. . .",
