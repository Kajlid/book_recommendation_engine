  "description": "Philip Hall is the cutest, smartest boy in the class, and Beth Lambert loves him. The fact that he beats her in classwork, conniving, and just about everything else doesn't particularly bother Beth at first. Then she realizes that Philip might be best in everything because she's letting him beat her. And coming out on top is just too natural a thing for Beth to hold back for very long, especially when it comes to catching turkey thieves, or winning calf-raising contests, or making mountain-top rescues, or capturing the affections of a young boy.",
