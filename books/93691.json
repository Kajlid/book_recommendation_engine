  "description": "It's Mardi Gras in post-Katrina New Orleans. With only one week until the big day, thousands of tourists have flocked to the city, paralyzing traffic and jamming the French Quarter with drunken crowds and garbage. City officials are hoping for record crowds to generate the biggest boost to the Crescent City since the \"big storm.\" Alexander Lee Destephano, legal counsel for Crescent City Medical Center, a prestigious, world-class hospital, is excitedly anticipating her third Mardi Gras Season and most of all, her date with dashing art historian Mitch Landry. The couple has tickets to the Edition Extravaganza, the biggest Mardi Gras Ball in New Orleans at the Super Dome on Saturday evening. After several years, life is good again and Alex is determined to experience everything it has to offer. She can hardly wait until Saturday evening. But, things change. Alex is stat-paged to the Medical Center at 6:00 am on Monday morning only to learn from her boss, Don Montgomery and her former husband, Dr. Robert Bonnet that Grace Raccine, a cancer patient at CCMC and the first lady of Louisiana has been found unconscious in her room covered with blood. To make matters worse, patients are leaving CCMC against medical advice and staff are refusing to work creating crisis and chaos in the Obamacare hospital environment. By the end of the day, the much anticipated night with Mitch Landry dancing under the lights at the Endymion Ball is the last things on Alex's mind!",
