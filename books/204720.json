  "description": "Gods and demons wage a never-ending battle with the mortal realm of Earth as their battlefield. As with most long-standing feuds, the reasons are no longer important--hatred is a way of life. But it is foretold that one will arise who can restore harmony between gods and demons. Enter Raenef, heir to demon royalty. But he is hardly regal material. Therefore, the demon king assigns Eclipse to be his tutor and to mold Raenef into proper demon shape. The two begin a journey of discovery, and are soon joined by a human knight and a god-blessed priest.",
