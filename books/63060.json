  "description": "As the last of the mourners departed the ornate Catholic Church, Emily entered a side door unnoticed, walked to the coffin, and punched her dead father in the face. “You’ll never be dead enough,” she whispered. “Never.”Determined to recover from the hands of a father who sexually abused her and an emotionally distant mother, twenty-seven-year-old Emily seeks the peace she’d lost in her youth. Yet she is shattered by the betrayal of those she was taught to respect and love, and torn by the fear that she may never overcome the devastating effects of generations of abuse. Will she ever truly learn to open herself to know the power of unconditional love? Set in the rich backwoods of New Brunswick, Canada, Run, River Currents is inspired by a true story of abuse, pain, and the struggle to find healing and forgiveness.",
