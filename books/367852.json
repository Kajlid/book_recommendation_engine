  "description": "ANNE PAGET HAD SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.That's what the doctors told her. Even so, when she was offered the leading role in the newly discovered Beethoven opera Regulus to be debuted in the tiny European principality of Lissenberg, Anne knew it was the chance of a lifetime. Her lifetime.But someone wanted the opera to fail. Strange accidents had already caused chaos. Then murder brought a new terror.Who was behind all this? Certainly not Michael, the charming, handsome, Oxford-educated man to whom Anne was so attractedâ€”the man who knew too many things, and who somehow managed to be very close to Anne when she faced her greatest peril.",
