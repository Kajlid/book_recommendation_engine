  "description": "The saying goes 'love conquers all' but sometimes love walks out the door. At the end of the road, luck is nowhere to be seen, how do one cope? In a fight, with one's back against the wall, does one have the courage to protect or will they run away? with death and darkness everywhere, there is always hope.",
