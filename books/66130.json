Trapped in modern day Denver, during the annual Zombie Pub Crawl, he is surrounded by humans with their strange language of moans, and hisses. Joined by a growing number of living dead, the new arrival helps them organize into a well-organized army during the zombie uprising. Only they are not here to destroy the living, they have come to save them. The future of the human race relies on the necromantic secrets inside the shadows of the Village of Dead Souls.",
