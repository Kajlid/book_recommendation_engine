  "description": "Welcome to Pineapple Cay. Nina Spark bought a house off the internet. On a sunny Caribbean island she'd never heard of before. Things seemed to get off to a good start. Nina's new hometown is the charming village of Coconut Cove, with its narrow lanes lined with candy coloured houses and gardens overflowing with tropical flowers. Her back yard is a white sand beach and the mesmerizing turquoise sea. Her next door neighbour is the handsome Ted Matthews, owner of a fishing lodge. But local big shot Barry Bassett has his eye on Nina's cozy little beach cottage with the aim of tearing it down to build condos. Then Barry's obnoxious wife Tiffany goes missing, and Nina finds herself sitting across a desk from the very serious chief of police, Blue Roker, wondering how her day dream of easy living in the islands got so far off track so quickly. Join Nina and her new best friends the philosophizing mailman Danish Jensen and the ever cheerful Pansy Gallagher, as they careen around Pineapple Cay at the maximum speed of fifteen miles an hour in a golf cart, trying to figure out what on Earth is going on. This is a story Jimmy Buffett and Agatha Christie might have come up with if they'd been holed up together for a weekend at some slightly faded beachfront hotel with a pitcher of pina coladas and a box of fireworks. A Caribbean beach holiday in book form and an action-packed comical caper.",
