They tell me my past and promise me a future where I can be free, where all people of the galaxies can exist in peace without the oppressive Gretar Fleet.But the more I learn, the more I realize the Sentients and the Fleet aren’t what they seem. Neither am I. I’m so much more than I ever knew, but will I be enough to re-ignite the circle and save the galaxies?",
