But she has no idea how her curves make me feel. How bad I want to touch her skin. But she’s not safe with me. Not until I exterminate this threat. The Dark Legions are going down. For good this time. Oz (Marked Skulls MC) is a full length bad boy motorcycle romance. The next book in the series, Dash, will be available on August 9th!",
