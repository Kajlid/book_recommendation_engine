  "description": "From the USA Today and New York Times bestselling author Jo Raven comes the fourth installment in the Inked Brotherhood series which began with ASHER.  When you’ve tried your best for years and never managed to please your demanding parents… When you’ve fallen head over heels for someone who keeps ignoring you… When you’ve hit rock bottom.  Tessa is this close to giving up – on her authoritative parents and their demands, on her studies, on everything in her life.  Including Dylan. The one boy she has loved since she can remember. The one who dated her and promised her forever when they were fourteen, and then dumped her without an explanation only to ignore her ever since.  The one who shows up to save her from violence before the stroke of midnight, who kisses her and holds her close, only to tell her in the course of the same night he doesn’t love her.  Tessa knows Dylan has gone through some tough times, and they’re only getting tougher - but is he telling the truth about his lack of feelings for her, or is he running from his own demons?  The way Tessa sees it, she has two options: run away, leaving it all behind - or stay to fight against her controlling family, and win back Dylan. She has a feeling he needs her, and how can she leave when he's the only man who’s ever made her feel alive?  Standalone novel. No cliffhanger. *Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young readers.*",
