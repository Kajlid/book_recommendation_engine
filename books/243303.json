  "description": "To protect you, with the only life I have been given in this world, would be a privilege and an honor, my Lady.Exiled to Earth for crimes committed against the ruling government of Kavalrye, Arika Sheeno lives without the knowledge of who she was, along with any memory pertaining to a life outside of the one she was assigned. Arika is stuck in a routine of waking up as if the day has yet to change. Prisoner in her own head, Arika's memories fracture, stacking up on the already shaky reality programmed into her mind by The Committee. As her search for memories leads her into an entirely different world, Arika finds herself surrounded by guardians, descendants of the Zodiac, sworn to protect her at even the greatest cost. Why would anyone in her shoes need a collection of bodyguards? And why does it feel like they're the ones hiding something? Challenged by even her own memories, Arika's discovery of truth forces her into a fight for survival and retribution.Sometimes it's best to forget and keep it that way.",
