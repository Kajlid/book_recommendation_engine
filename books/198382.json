  "description": "\"The Mist Stage Two\" is the second and final part of THE MIST series where what was once fiction is now fact, politics is intricately a part of the individual's life and re-colonisation is fast coming into fruition. Tanya is beginning to question her faith and if all she is doing will be enough to cause a significant effect at all or is it inconsequential... In any case, she must steer Pakistan clear of this war and all coming wars so that Pakistan could once again regain it's sovereignty and get away from distractions that prevent it from taking its role in maintaining world peace.",
