  "description": "Highlighting issues of environmental protection, human identity, and the pursuit of self, this remarkable modern fable brings philosophical subjects to the forefront through humor and imagination. When a brown bear awakes from hibernation, he is surprised to find that a modern factory has been built right over his den. His bewilderment only grows when a factory guard mistakes him for an unshaven human and, failing to prove his identity, is forced to become a factory worker.",
