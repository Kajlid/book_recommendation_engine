  "description": "One accident. One man. One dance. She'd never noticed Levi Grant. Not really. Everyone knew about him, though. Everyone remembered the accident, the tragedy. It was hard to forget. Especially since he had no arm. She only said yes because of her soft-heart-syndrome. He'd never asked anyone to the dance. Never even had a girlfriend. How could she say no? But as she's thrust into a whirlwind of misunderstandings and danger . . . the whole world seems to change. Will her heart change with it?",
