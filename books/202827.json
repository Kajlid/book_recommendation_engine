  "title": "Passport to the Supernatural: An Occult Compendium from All Ages & Many Lands",
  "description": "Intended to serve as a graphic evocation of mankind's universal interest and belief in the supernatural, this is a knowledgeable, leisurely ramble through the timeless corridors of the occult. Beginning with the Ancients and drawing on authentic, diverse international sources encompassing Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America, the collection strives for maximum variety in order to highlight both the similarities and differences between various cultures. In addition to the stories themselves, many of which have rarely appeared in print, Mr. Hurwood furnishes much introductory and transitional material of an informative nature, tracing, where possible, the origins of a particular belief and showing how and why it originated and spread until it finally attained its present universality. A new book by the author of The Hag of the Dribble, this able study entertains while enlarging our understanding of man's ageless preoccupation with the unknown.",
