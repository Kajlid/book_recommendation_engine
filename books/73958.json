  "description": "Jessie Wetherell has atrocious luck with men. Even her father abandoned her before she turned ten. Trying to fill the void in her life has become a never ending struggle. Every guy she meets takes advantage and then leaves her. When Ike Harris enters the picture, things start looking up. Handsome and sexy, Ike stirs her heart and Jessie hopes he could be 'the one'. Except he keeps disappearing and she can't trust him with her heart if he's not around. When an old boyfriend comes back, Jessie faces a difficult choice--the ex who wants a second chance or Ike, the potential man of her dreams with the power to break her heart.",
