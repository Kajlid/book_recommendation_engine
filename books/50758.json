You are a curse to anyone and everyone who knows you! You are evil! It shows on your face!\" Her breath was shaking then. \"You will call me Cinders, because that is all that is left of me, since you destroyed it all.\"Before Cinderella meets the prince, before she loses her glass slipper, before the happily ever after, there was the stepmother.Thrown into a forced marriage, she is haunted by her past, by her love for another man, and by her inability to hope for her own happily ever after.
