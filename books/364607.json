  "description": "They're the Savage Seven-a ragged group of mercenaries who trust no one, risk everything, and get the job done, no matter what it takes . . . J.P. Lazarus is an ex-Navy Seal who's parlayed his technical expertise into a lucrative and dangerous career. Laz has never lost any sleep over his choices, but then again, he's never met anyone like Dr. Daphne Barrett. She saves lives; he takes them. He changes his persona with every mission; she's straight as an arrow. His latest assignment-setting a trap for Somalian pirates-was risky before, but with the doctor on board his tanker, it's a matter of life, death, and off-the-charts desire . . . Working in Africa for a summer seemed like a good way for Daphne to regroup after her divorce. But when her vessel is hijacked, Daphne's status as a senator's ex-wife makes her a perfect target for ransom. If there's one man equipped to protect her, it's Laz. But the more she learns about him, the more questions arise-about the secrets he's hiding, the chemistry that feels too good to fight, and a future that neither of them can take for granted . . . \"Katherine Garbera rocks\" -Cindy Gerard",
