  "description": "The Dante family line has been in the fires of an ancient war between humanity and the nine circles of hell for generations. As a self-proclaimed “Aristocracy” the circles have now set their sights on the one chosen to fight the raging war … Haven Irena Dante. But soon after the tragic death of her mother, Haven endures the vile theft of her innocence and disappears. No one has seen or heard from her in two years … until now. Somehow she has been changed. And when all nine circles of hell conspire to recreate their realm on the surface there is no one that can stop them. No one, that is, except Haven. Steeped rich in history, Haven races at the speed of thought into the realms of action and adventure with fantasy and horror while seizing the places where pain can fuel staggering powers and generational wars are fought to the death.",
