  "description": "Being Queen of the Underworld isn't all it's cracked up to be.The last six months have been torture for me. My only constant, it seems, is my new, hotter than hot Alpha Wolf and my beloved Louboutins, of course.The struggle to get my life back on track is foiled, not only by the sexy-as-sin Demon Overlord, who shows up unannounced, but by the mysterious Vampire Hunter who has made me his target de jour. And then there is my sire's first ever charge. A stranger to me that feels far too familiar for my liking. Forbidden doesn't even cover it, which just makes him even more appealing to me.As my ever-growing group travels to discover more about my role in all of this, my world gets shaken to the core by an event that leaves me twisting in the wind. How will I fix it? Your guess is as good as mine.",
