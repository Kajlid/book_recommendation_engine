  "title": "The Bulpington of Blup",
  "description": "This volume contains H. G. Wells’s 1932 novel, \"The Bulpington of Blup\". It is an analysis of the psychological origins of opposition to Wellsian ideology, and was heavily influenced by the author’s relationship with Carl Jung and his seminal ideas. It concerns the inner turmoil and psychological metamorphosis of the protagonist, who is overcome by a complex that he calls \"The Bulpington of Blup\". This complex manifests itself as an egotistical, romantic, heroic personality that comes to dominate his entire existence and falsify his relations with the world. This antiquarian volume will appeal to fans and collectors of Wells’s seminal work, and would make for a worthy addition to any bookshelf. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author.",
