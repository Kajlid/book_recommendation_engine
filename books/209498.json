  "title": "Christmas Truce: The Western Front December 1914",
  "description": "During Christmas 1914, in a war already famous for its horror and brutality, enemy shook hands with enemy in No Man's Land, exchanged souvenirs, even played football. The truce between the trenches extended over at least two-thirds of the British line and there were similar cease-fires in the French and Belgian sectors. In some areas the peaceable mood lingered well into 1915. Originally published in 1984, this book is one of the finest accounts ever assembled on one of the most overlooked stories of World War I.",
