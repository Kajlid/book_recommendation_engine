  "description": "I’ve never had a place to call home. Growing up in foster care, I learned not to get attached. The day Easton Chadwick walks into my life, my sense of self-preservation falls by the wayside. When I’m in his arms, it’s easy to believe in the fairy tale. Then, tragedy strikes, serving as a soul-crushing reminder that nothing lasts forever. Suffocated by fear, I pack my bags, leaving Easton and the town of Maplewood Falls behind. Several months later, I come face-to-face with the man who still owns nearly every part of me, but one night fueled by alcohol and bad decisions doesn’t change anything. At least, that’s what I tell myself … Until those two pink lines appear. For the first time in my life, I’m willing to lay my heart on the line for a family and a place to call home. Because home is where love lives.",
