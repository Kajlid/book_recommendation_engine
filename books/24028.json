  "description": "LOVE LIKE A HURRICANE is a closely plotted foray into family secrets, lies, betrayals and the crushing cost of keeping a secret. It is the story of a storm that weaves together the sins of a man in Florida with the secrets of two families that live a thousand miles away. And it is the story of fated love; a passionate romance between Lettie, whose idyllic childhood started with an unfortunate birth and a fatal car crash, and Christine, whose tragic and ultimately violent past simmers just underneath her skin. A broken promise and a box of long hidden letters reveals a truth that is both beautiful and terrible. As the past unravels it shatters the illusion of Lettie's perfect family and ultimately forces her into an unthinkable moral dilemma.Told in short and multilayered chapters, LOVE LIKE A HURRICANE finishes with a deeply intimate and stunning climax.",
