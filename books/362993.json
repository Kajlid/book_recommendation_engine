  "description": "Two great Nero Wolfe novellas narrated for you by the inimitable Archie Goodwin.In \"Black Orchids\" we find that not much can get Wolfe to leave his comfortable New York brownstone, but the special showing of rare black orchids lures him to a flower show.Unfortunately, Wolfe's much-anticipated viewing is soon overshadowed by a murder as daring as it is sudden. Itâ€™s a case of weeding out a cunning killer who can turn up anywhere - and Wolfe and his assistant Goodwin, who has fallen in love with one of the suspects, must do so quickly.Why? Because a second case awaits their urgent attention, \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death.\" It concerns a society widow on a mailing list of poison-pen letters and leads to a plot as dark as any orchid Wolfe has ever encountered.Librarian's note #1: this book consists of two short stories: the title story, \"Black Orchids,\" and \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death.\" Both are shown in the Nero Wolfe series as #9.Librarian's note #2: the second novella, \"Cordially .. ,\" has its own GR entry elsewhere.",
