  "description": "\"Name?\" he demanded.  \"Sarah Mackenzie.\" She swallowed hard. She would be like the ones who had fallen, her remains something to be cleaned from the floor.  \"Age?\"  She tried not to tense when he brought his face to her neck and inhaled deeply.  \"Twenty-two.\" The lie tried to stick in her throat.  He pulled back and gave her a dark look. \"Try again.\"  \"Eighteen,\" she whispered, tensing when his lips pulled back from his teeth in a shark smile.  \"A lie, Sarah? How nice that you are not as innocent as you look.\"  In The Corridor, there are the immortal Dems and the human handlers who guard them. When the leader of the Dems gets a handler straight out of training, she is not expected to live beyond her first day. She is everything he hates and he is everything she fears, but an accident permanently binds them together. With corruption growing among the humans and the threat of war, they must escape The Corridor and find common ground in a place with No Light.",
