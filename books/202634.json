Yet Suzanne has failed to find the son she put up for adoption thirty years ago. In an ironic twist, a serial killer dubbing himself \"The Searcher\" contacts her, claiming to have located her now-grown son. He also begins to murder her clients——vowing to kill her son and his family——if she tries to stop him. Who is The Searcher, and why has he targeted Suzanne? These are the horrifying questions she struggles with, and her attempts to answer them turn Search Angel into one of the most harrowing thrillers of our time. Ingeniously plotted and nightmarishly realistic, Search Angel is a fearsome tale steeped in love, hate, and the unbridled terror that can link them both.",
