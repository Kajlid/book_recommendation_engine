  "description": "She made a deal with the Dakkari devil. Now, he owns her.On the unforgiving planet of Dakkar, I did what all the humans in our village did: kept my head down, worked to provide for my family, and I certainly didn’t break any Dakkari laws to risk inciting the alien race’s merciless wrath.Unfortunately, the same couldn’t be said for my brother and one careless mistake brings a horde of the nomadic, barbarian Dakkari straight to our doorstep, led by their powerful horde king—a cold, ruthless, battle-scarred warrior demanding retribution.In order to save my brother’s life, I do the unthinkable.I sell myself to the horde king as his war prize. I agree to warm his furs, to travel with his horde across the wild lands of Dakkar, and to never see my family again.But as I struggle with my new reality, I discover that the surly, mysterious, dominant horde king never intended for me to be his concubine…He wants me as his queen.",
