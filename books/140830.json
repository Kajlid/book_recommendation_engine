A meditative urban noir.In October of 2013, a man from across the world arrives on the doorstep of a struggling young family. He tells them that his name is Manu. But in the quieter circles, he is infamously known as Gulab.Set against the backdrop of the farmers’ plight in India and the fall-out of the 2008 economic crisis, Gulab flees to London, England with his two trusted men, British-born Saleem and hardened Indian native Rajesh.Seeking refuge, Saleem arranges for Gulab to stay with the family of his close childhood friend. But from the outset, it is fast-apparent that this stopover is destined to be an unconventional one, especially when the visitor opts to sleep in the family’s lock-up garage.Faced with an unforgiving ticking clock and a relentless string of entities in pursuit, Gulab, for the next vital days, must keep his true identity a secret. Not only for self-preservation, but for the lives of the innocent family, who have opened their humble home to him.Gulab is an unflinching story of regret, perseverance and absolution. A fierce study in human morality that spotlights the corruption of media and government, and its lasting impact on the working class.",
