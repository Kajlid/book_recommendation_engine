  "description": "So much screaming. Roger Huntington is home from college for the summer, and he and his best friend, Tooth, can't wait to start having fun. It's going to be a summer full of beer, comic books, movies, laughs, parties and maybe even girls. So much pain. The sun is high and the sky is clear as Roger and Tooth set out to shoot beer cans at Bobcat Mountain. Just two friends catching up on lost time, two friends thinking about their futures, two friends-- So much blood. --suddenly thrust in the middle of a nightmare. Forced to fight for their lives against a sadistic killer. A killer with an arsenal of razor-sharp blades and a hungry dog. So much death. If they are to survive, they must decide: are heroes born, or are they made? Or is something more powerful happening to them? And more importantly, how do you survive when all roads lead to . . . death!",
