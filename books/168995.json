Some of our most memorable historical figures were outspoken, dramatic, brave, feisty, rebellious and downright ornery.Cranky Ladies of History is a celebration of 22 women who challenged conventional wisdom about appropriate female behaviour, from the ancient world all the way through to the twentieth century. Some of our protagonists are infamous and iconic, while others have been all but forgotten under the heavy weight of history.Sometimes you have to break the rules before the rules break you.CONTENTS:Introduction by Tansy Rayner Roberts\tQueenside by Liz Barr\tThe Company Of Women by Garth Nix\tMary, Mary by Kirstyn McDermottA Song For Sacagawea by Jane Yolen\tLook How Cold My Hands Are by Deborah BiancottiBright Moon by Foz MeadowsCharmed Life by Joyce ChngA Beautiful Stream by Nisi Shawl\tNeter Nefer by Amanda Pillar\tThe Dragon, The Terror, The Sea by Stephanie Lai\tDue Care And Attention by Sylvia Kelso\tTheodora by Barbara Robson\tFor So Great A Misdeed by Lisa L.
