  "description": "Sofie is six months pregnant, feeling hormonal, and totally not looking forward to wearing a bridesmaid’s dress at her cousin’s wedding.  As if it isn’t bad enough that that her favorite cousin is getting married and leaving her behind, Sofie’s unexpected pregnancy—and noticeable lack of boyfriend—is causing quite the scandal in her overbearing and overly traditional family.  To make the wedding extra embarrassing, the guest list includes Jackson Coles, friend of the groom and international movie star…who just so happens to be the hottest man on the planet. Sofie has been dying to meet Jackson, the subject of countless fantasies, for ages—she just never expected her big chance would come when she was knocked up.  When the ceremony ends and the party gets started, Sofie will find that weddings—and movie stars—can be full of surprises.  And that Jackson Coles is a much better kisser than she had ever imagined.  **11,000 words or approximately 30 pages. This is a stand-alone short story of 11,000 words (approximately 30 pages).
