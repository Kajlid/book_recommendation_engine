  "description": "After the tragic romance of Jane the Quene, this second book in The Seymour Saga trilogy takes a dark turn through an era in which King Henry VIII descends into cynicism, suspicion and fits of madness – and in which mistakes mean death.  Edward Seymour’s future is uncertain. Although his sister Jane bore Henry the son he’d sought for twenty years, when she died in childbirth, Henry’s good nature died with her. Now the fiercely ambitious Edward must carve a difficult path through Henry’s shifting principles and wives. Challenged at every turn by his nemesis, Bishop Stephen Gardiner, Edward must embrace ruthlessness in order to safeguard not only his own future but England’s as well.  This is the account of Henry’s tumultuous reign, as seen through the eyes of two opponents whose fierce disputes over religion and common decency fuel epic struggles for the soul of the nation. And for power.",
