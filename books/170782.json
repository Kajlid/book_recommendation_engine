  "description": "Marin is a cursed merman. He once walked the streets of Atlantis where he found his true love, he now swimsâ€”alone. He is offered a way out of his curse and into the heart of another. But will he be able to love another as he did his true love?  Marley's a loner. He's a treasure hunter who fantasized about mermen. He'd always felt a little out of place, always searching for something, and wanting nothing more than to belong to someone completely.  Between them are several lifetimes and a wicked sorceress bent on possession. Is a soul deep connection enough to bring them together to break a curse that was never meant to be broken?",
