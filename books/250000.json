  "description": "The kid is now a man, and he’s got something to prove…..  Caleb “Cruise” Harrison  “A Dad is a son’s first hero……”  All my life I’ve looked up to my Dad, there’s nothing I ever wanted to do more than be a member of the Moonshine Task Force right next to him. I said no to playing football professionally to stay in Laurel Springs and fulfill my dream.   I’m biding my time, paying my dues, and soaking up any bit of information my fellow MTF members slip my way. To most of them I’m the kid they watched grow up, and while they’re proud of me, they don’t take me seriously.  Life is status quo until the morning all hell breaks loose in our small town threatening everyone I know and love – including the one woman I can’t get out of my head.  Ruby Carson  “My favorite place? In his arms……”  Caleb saved me from the worst date of my life, swooping in like the fixer he is. Smiling his panty-melting grin, he grabbed my hand, and extricated me from the longest ninety minutes known in the history of the world.   Instead, he took me on the best date I’ve ever had. We’ve been inseparable since that crazy night.  It hasn’t been picture-perfect. His job is dangerous, it worries me, even when he tells me not to. One gorgeous summer day, it all comes crashing down on us.  The man who has my heart is in the middle of a FUBAR situation that has no good ending. My hope is, when the smoke clears Caleb walking towards me, arms out-stretched, with that grin on his face, before he envelopes my body into the hug only he can give.  That’s what would happen in a perfect world – but I’ve never known a perfect world – not even with Caleb……",
