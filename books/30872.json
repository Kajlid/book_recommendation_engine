  "description": "One night, everything changed. It wasn't guns or bombs. It wasn't tanks and artillery that killed. It was inevitable. A virus either mutated or was created that had no antidote, and it spread worldwide. As days turned into weeks, and then into months, the virus showed no signs of abating. Entire countries were either dying or had died. Civilization didn't go out with a bang, as many thought it would, it died with a whimper. Follow an average person along as he faces the trials and problems of waking up in a world... Alone!",
