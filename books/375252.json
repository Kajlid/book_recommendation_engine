  "description": "If your child or grandchild has ever wondered where Santa fits in with the traditional Christmas story, now you can read them Santa's Birthday Gift. Finally, a book that ties two holiday traditions into one inspirational tale of wonder - as Santa brings gifts to baby Jesus. The cleverly-written, rhyming book reveals Santa's adventure from toymaker to star follower -- right into the heart of Bethlehem where he meets Baby Jesus in the manger. Delivering toys to a king is a touching experience for both Santa and readers alike, as they discover where the tradition began -- Santa makes a promise to Jesus to bring gifts to good boys and girls each year on Jesus' birthday. This delightful story is engaging and delivers meaningful lessons using recognizable nativity characters, and of course, Santa and Jesus. Author Sherrill S. Cannon says her inspiration for this book came from her granddaughter who, after hearing the Christmas story, asked, \"But where's Santa?\" Cannon has been weaving stories and poems even before she could write. She enjoys the creative process and says her goal in each book is to teach good manners, as well as caring for others. Her background is in physical education, sports photography and she also had a column in a newspaper. Cannon is already working on several new children's books.",
