  "title": "Receiving Financial Blessing",
  "description": "There are over 70 blessings that could result after giving God your tithes. When Christians are not giving Jesus what is “necessary,” it keeps them from receiving the blessings He intends for His followers to have. \"Receiving Financial Blessing: How to Walk in Truth, Righteousness and Honesty With Money\" is the most comprehensive book on biblical financial blessings. All Christians, especially church leaders, need to know the truth about tithing and how it still applies to them today.Stephen Kirkendall has helped Christians with their financial investments for many years. But Kirkendall realized early on that most Christians were not being financially blessed. So he decided to dig deeper to find out the truth on biblical blessings of money. The result is this biblically-driven study, which is a must-have for every believer.",
