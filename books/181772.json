  "description": "Life with his new alphas is like nothing Evan had ever dreamed possible. It's just... wonderful. While Chad and Peter couldn't be more different, they fit together perfectly. Chad is playful and exuberant - like an impulsive puppy - while Peter is stern, steadfast and always in control. They're just what the other needs, and Evan slots into their relationship like a dream. Can Evan's future really be as bright as it seems? (This is the first book in the Evan's Alphas series. It features two scorchingly hot alphas, a sweet submissive omega, and a delusional alpha hell bent on breaking their relationship apart.)",
