The land between the normal human world and Fairy is called \"The Border,\" a place where one can easily become lost—or found. In the rements of evacuated cities from this rebirth the two worlds come together in Bordertown, where magic and technology don't always work. The town is teeming with the outcasts, runaways and dreamers of both Fairy and Earth children.NOTE: all the \"Bellamy Bach\" stories in the Borderland series were written by the editor/Borderland founder, Terri Windling.",
