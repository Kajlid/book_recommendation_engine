Make it so that what happened before can never, ever, happen again.  \nTwo:\n To help others find their own strength so that what happened to me, what happened to my Olivia, doesn’t happen to them.And \nthree:\n My favorite—to find the bastards that took my life away and make them pay for what they did. This is what my life is now. A dead man, inside a scarred body, living only for revenge.*This is part one in a five part novella serial.\n**Due to sexual situations and violence, this series is recommended for 18+.",
