He travels around the country, working hard, partying harder, and engaging in no-strings attached fun whenever the urge strikes. But when he returns to his home base in Texas to find that his business partner has hired a new accounting manager, he’s not amused. She’s gorgeous, intelligent, and clearly not interested in him.After a bitter divorce, Alana Holmes moves to Austin to start over. Her previous position, working for her husband’s company, was a nightmare. She was living under his powerful thumb, forced to follow his rules, at home and at work. Not that she’s finally broken free of him; she’s determined to make it on her own. She has a new home, new job and new opportunities. The only complication is Grayson, who bears a striking resemblance to her ex, in more ways than one.",
