  "description": "Reverent Knight Drystan Kempe has no use for the rumors that have swirled around him for the past two centuries. There is no way he could be the former emperor of the dragons. All they share is a common name. After all, Emperor Drystan had a love that has become legendary since his death and the fallen knight Drystan is very much alone. As a man over six hundred years old, he’s waited impatiently for the other half of his soul. When he finally finds him, he is unamused to find him bearing the name of the former emperor’s mate.  Reverent Knight Conley Gylde is confident that whoever he was before his resurrection it has no bearing on this new beginning. When the pair finally become blood-bonded, they get a great deal more than they could have ever bargained for.",
