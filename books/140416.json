  "title": "Champagne",
  "description": "Haunted by the abuse of his now missing father, seventeen-year-old Sammy stumbles upon the seedy world of drug addiction and prostitution of Londonâ€™s West End in the 1980s. Cold, desperate and exhausted, he takes shelter in a trash-filled alley behind a strip club, unaware that what is about to unfold will change the course of his life.Set during a period of significant social and cultural change in the early 1980s, Champagne opens up a world of seedy revue bars, prostitution, abuse, drug addiction and the devastating effect of AIDS. Centred around the events of a declining revue bar and its regeneration, a young man comes of age and finds his first love whilst looking for his estranged, abusive father. Through dark humour and strong characterisation the book is not only eye opening but also manages to capture a truly unique time in popular culture.PLEASE NOTE: this is gay fiction, with elements of MM romance. As such, it does not have a HEA or even a HFN, but there is a sequel planned for 2015.",
