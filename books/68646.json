  "description": "Private Damien Stone is living in a nightmare. He's out on exercise on Salisbury Plain with Lance Corporal Michael Scott—who also happens to be a huge pain in the arse. He's a teacher's pet who seems to delight in bossing Stone around. But that's not the real reason Stone appears to dislike him so much. It's because Stone—who's bisexual—is seriously attracted to his superior, but he can't do anything about it, because Scott is straight. Or is he?",
