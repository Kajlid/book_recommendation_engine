  "description": "This beloved book was rebound twenty five years ago; the front and back covers were cut out and placed on the new white cover. They, along with the spine, show the most discoloration. The pages are all intact and with a few exceptions (noted below), are without blemish or tears. The inside front cover has \"This book belongs to Mary Eldridge\" written on the very top left (by my mother), and there is some discoloration on the lower portion and on the endpaper opposite, possibly water stains. I obviously liked the first story, Caroline's Party, best because it shows some wear. The title page, where Caroline is writing out her invitations, has a rip that was repaired with scotch tape on the other side (Leon putting on his After that, all the pages are nearly pristine, and they are solidly bound in place. Some have a little 'softening' on the lower edges where they were handled, but there are no tears or even dog ears.",
