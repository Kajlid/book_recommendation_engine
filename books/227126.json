  "description": "Single mum and superwoman Sally Freeman wants a better life for herself and her son Charlie. But it's not going to be easy when their home is on a run-down Liverpool council estate. Just as Sally's mission to improve their surroundings gets under way, she's offered a ticket out of there, in the splendid form of Spencer Knight. He has everything she could wish for â€“ the looks, the charm, not to mention the wallet. But is he the answer to her prayers, or does her hapless ex-boyfriend Johnny still hold the key to her heart? As Sally decides what to do, she discovers that if The Beatles are right, and all you need is love, then everything else will fall into place.",
