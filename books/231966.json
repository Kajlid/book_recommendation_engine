  "title": "Particularly Dangerous Work: At Waters' Edge",
  "description": "It was the spring of 1939, Francisco Franco marched triumphantly into Madrid, and Adolf Hitler plotted his invasion of Poland. The Vizconde Rodrigo Mendoza was a diplomat representing the government of Francisco Franco at the Spanish Embassy in Berlin, but when the United States recognized Franco’s regime, he was transferred to the Spanish Embassy in Washington. Rodrigo, a former Olympic champion, was a dashing and handsome example of European aristocracy in the mid-twentieth century. He was also gay. He ran afoul of the Abwehr, Nazi Germany’s intelligence agency, and found himself caught up in the seamy world of espionage and international intrigue on the eve of World War II. Particularly Dangerous Work is his story, told in three parts. The story is full of gritty action, inopportune romance, harrowing escapes, and thrilling adventure. Readers will find themselves immersed in the world of the early war years, dancing to Tommy Dorsey hits, sailing aboard classic ocean liners, and witnessing the invasion of France. Parts 2 & 3 will take readers through the remainder of the war and beyond, where Rodrigo’s adventures grow evermore dangerous. This book, and its subsequent parts, should appeal to most adult audiences. Particularly Dangerous Work is historical fiction.",
