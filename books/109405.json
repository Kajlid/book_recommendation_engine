The more he learns about her incredible abilities, however, the clearer it becomes that Sam’s visions have put her in the killer’s line of fire. Now Brandt must save her from something he cannot see or understand…and risk losing his heart in the process.As danger and desire collide, passion raises the stakes in a game Sam and Brandt don’t dare lose.",
