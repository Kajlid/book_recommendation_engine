  "description": "WINNER OF BEST NONFICTION BDSM BOOK OF 2015 by BDSM Writers.con Golden Flogger Awards.FINALIST in the 2016 NATIONAL LEATHER AWARDS Writing Competition.You'll laugh. You'll shake your head in disbelief. You'll wonder how in the world Summer Sterling got the idea she could ever submit to a man full time. \"Confessions of a Bad Submissive\" is the true account of Summer's ten-year struggle to earn the right to call herself a fully surrendered woman. At times tragic, at times hilariously funny, this tell-all memoir is a refreshingly honest account of the challenges of service and surrender to a man year after year, seven days a week--- well, every day she can pull it off, that is. Unlike other accounts you may have read of women committed to lifestyle submission, Ms. Sterling has no problem admitting to often being clueless, frustrated, na√Øve, inconsistent, stubborn, impetuous, overly dramatic, and any combination of the above. Join her and her long-suffering Master on their bumpy road to 24/7 D/s. You'll say time and time again, \"Oh no she didn't!\"",
