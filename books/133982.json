  "title": "The Taste of Lightning",
  "description": "High adventure, romance, worldly ambition, and magical power all come into play when three extraordinary young people escape from the Palace of Arvestel and flee on horseback, pursued by the army-and by sinister magic Tansy, Perrin, and Skir could hardly be more different-a laundry maid, a swordsman, and a young priest-king whose countries are at war. But their frantic escape from Arvestel thrusts them together. Pursued by soldiers and haunted by the witch-woman's sinister magic, they ride for their lives through hostile lands. To survive they must learn to trust each other, strip away the layers of deception that surround Skir, and challenge the tyranny of the witch-woman. But what will happen if all truths are revealed? And will the power of the priest-king be enough to bring peace to the Threelands? This thrilling adventure set within a storm of secrecy takes place within the world of the Chanters of Tremaris series. Picking up 20 years after the last book in the trilogy, in a different country, fans of the series will love it, as well as newcomers looking for strong girls and believable worlds in the style of Tamora Pierce.",
