  "description": "This is a continuation of \"Deliverance for Amelia\".  WARNING: If youâ€™re looking for a knight in shining armor, a princess or a fairy godmother, then this is not the story for you. This is a dark novel. Read at your own risk.  Gabriel: I hate the word yesterday, just like I loathe the idea of tomorrow.  Where would I be without them? Not here. Not anywhere.  Because, where I am dwindling away in the madness is neither here nor there.  My mind is my tormentor, and I am the masochist.  No-matter how I justify it - the blood will always be on my hands. The shadow that lingers wins. He always does, and he will eventually lead me to my demise.  All in due time.  The truth will soon be uncovered.",
