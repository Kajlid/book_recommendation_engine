  "description": "“Death is different for everyone. Like a thief in the night she takes what she wants with no regard for how much it means to you.”They always say to expect the unexpected. Little did I know the unexpected also meant the unthinkable. No longer a wife or a mother, what was once a full and meaningful life was now obliterated; leaving me with nothing but emptiness in its place. I was hollow; the shell of the a woman who had no plans to change.Until him. Armed in warmth and healing, Lior was determined to bring me back to life. To be my sun after the storm. Gentle, yet fierce, he came knocking on darkness’ door, challenging me. Wanting me. Loving me.He was the possibility of more, a vision of brighter days. He was a future I didn't think I wanted. A risk–one I wasn't yet sure I was ready to take.",
