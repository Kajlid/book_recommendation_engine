  "description": "A spiritual odyssey begins...a tale of magic, love, spirituality and adventure...Follow the dragon as he awakens, as he comes of age, as he discovers life and as he finds The Creator...a story of lost love, friendship, magical beings and evil sorcerers; a spiritual odyssey that takes the reader as a companion and co-discoverer! An allegorical and philosophical message for our times...The beginning of a series of books centered around the dragon's world and the journeys of the creatures therein, with the next title being the second part to this introduction. Future titles are \"The Sorcerer's Kingdom\"; \" The Wizard and The Dragon\"; \"The Secret Garden\"; \"Where The Man Burns\"; \"The Mysterious Island and the World of the Sea People\" and lots more!\"What a great read. I loved the characters and the fantasy aspect of it. It's well-written, and takes you to another world. Would recommend to anyone.\"\"I really enjoyed this book, in fact I couldn't put it down! It's one of those books that I keep finding myself thinking about, a book thatwill stay with me forever! definitely recommend it!\"\"What a pleasure to read! Using fantasy as a genre is a smart choice because most people resonate with the setting and the ability to escape to another world. It also makes it deceptively easy to read (and hard to put down). However, upon reflection, you realise how wonderfully layered the story is and how applicable it is to your own personal journey. Beautiful, magical, inspiring and yes, fun, this is a gem of a find and one I know people will share with their friends and loved ones.\"\"This wonderful story hides hidden layers throughout its many glitter- sparkled, drug-hazy, humour-filled adventures, meandering through the meanings of life and love that resonate with all of us. Fly with the curious dragon, with his endearing character and tender spirit, as he launches into the ultimate journey; the journey of self-discovery. The to know one's self truly and be proud and accepting of that truth. A lovely tale of making mistakes and dusting yourself off again, of not finding the answer straight away, and not finding life as simple as it first appears, and most importantly, of whole-heartedly living a life enriched with learning and loving all the way. An enchanting escape for a world-weary generation. A must-read.\"\"A kind, innocent yet epic tale. A read-in-one-sitting love story between the protagonist and the world. The author really captures a fantastical folkloric feel, whilst taking the reader on a deep yet accessible philosophical journey. The big questions have never been so fun to read!\"“Such an enjoyable read. Light on the outside, but with an underlying depth full of morals, life, love, drink, drugs, religion, sex, fun, style, magic and so much more. It is a spiritual book… really touches well on the heart and soul of us all in the modern world. Although set in a magical world full of mythical creatures, it does feel like there is an autobiographical side to it, and so feels quite personal. Like a warm and loving friend is reading it nearby.Above all though, it is the wisdom that drives this book; both the Dragon and the writer.”\"I was reading this magical book and fell in love with every line. I felt so connected because it describes what we may go through in our life's journey. As you read through the lines you will feel the honesty, purity and clarity in every word. I enjoyed reading this book, inspired me to feel hope and love again. I strongly recommend you read it.\"\"I love it you are brilliant! Very nice and easy to read...\"\"Lots of deep moments and sooo inspiring!\"\"Thank you, I really enjoyed it! Great talent, please use it, I think you've got a lot to tell!\"\"I will recommend to my friends for sure, when I started reading it I couldn't stop, and it got really addictive from chapter 6, I read all night!\"“Spiritual and uplifting”",
