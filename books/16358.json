  "description": "Here are three contrasting works from Theodor Storm's middle period--the 1870s. The title story is an affectionate portrayal of the vanishing world of the marionette theatre with its guild-dominated society of the traveling puppeteers and their gypsy-like way of life. \"The Village on the Moor\" is seen through an investigating lawyer's eyes, and is the case of a mysterious death out on the moor, the chief suspect being a girl of sinister aura with whom the young deceased was in love. Both these stories are translated into English for the first time. One of Storm's most moving stories, \"Renate,\" records the memories of an eighteenth-century Lutheran pastor and his love for a farmer's daughter who is persecuted by the local community for alleged witchcraft. Denis Jackson also translated Storm's The Dykemaster.",
