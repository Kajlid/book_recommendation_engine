  "description": "He was called Nevada, a name he took to lose his past. As a boy he had been thrown among brutal and evil men. He had worked himself above their influence time and again, only to be thrown back, by his own desire for justice or vengeance, into the midst of strife. With a new identity he made a new reputation, but old troubles and old enemies haunted him wherever he went. Nevada was the quiet type who would rather work hard and plan for better days. Skilled with a horse and a rope, he could also shoot fast and straight. As he got closer to thinking he could get back to the woman he loved, a gang of rustlers threatened everything. Once again, he had to choose between risks, if his passions didn’t choose for him. First published in 1926 and 1927, Nevada, the suspenseful sequel to Forlorn River, continues to be one of Zane Grey’s most beloved novels. Never out of print, it is now available in an Authorized Edition with a new foreword by Zane Grey’s son, Loren Grey.A sequel to Forlorn River.",
