  "description": "Reviews from readers:\"Revolutionary.\" \"A must learn system. 11/10.\"\"Extraordinary book of such an extraordinary Master in acupuncture, breaking every paradigm and confirming that in Acupuncture everything is not yet said.\"\"After 25 years of practice, this is without a doubt the best system of acupuncture l have ever learnt. It focuses on the cause of disease not the signs and symptoms. The brilliance is in the palpatory diagnosis that leads to 1 needle being selected for treatment of either elements or branches with outstanding results. What used to take 10 treatments to fix now only takes up 1 to 5 in most cases.\"\"This book is so beautifully written taking one through the history of the thinking behind the historical progression of elements theory in Chinese Medicine, it’s politics and misunderstandings. And shows an acupuncture method that is simpler and effective.\"\"It’s sort of a love story/whodunnit, about the six element paradigm and a loyalty to the Ether/Heaven and its associated organs (Pericardium & Triple Burner). It navigates through historical texts and, through time, to achieve that love’s validation. To scrutinise the various phasal and directional models, and unravel the mystery of that odd disappearance and ultimate return of Huainanzi and the Six Elements.\"\" Part 3 - the practical - is where this book impresses most. It’s in the detailed explanations; the case studies with real examples of disease processes; how it takes us step by step through diagnosis and gives precise needle treatments. The techniques seem easily doable, with evidence of concrete and repeatable results. Brilliant!\"",
