  "description": "Cathy Harlow, a brilliant young painter, has at last given in to the pressures around her and agreed to marry rock musician superstar, Paul Devlin, and to keep his baby. But Cathy is still filled with doubts, for her art is the most important thing in her life and at only seventeen she desperately fears being overwhelmed by Dev and his fame and money. Her relationship with Dev has inflicted wounds, which she can’t forgive or forget. She feels threatened too, by Dev’s best friend Chris, who sees Cathy and Dev and himself, as bound in a kind of mystical triangle. Cathy’s struggle to overcome the stresses of her new life and her attempts to find herself and regain her lost freedom makes an unusual and compelling love story that leads to a moving climax. Set in the vivid worlds of rock music and art, Easy Freedom is a gripping story about redemption and forgiveness, and also has much to say about the real problems faced by a girl with a vocation.",
