  "description": "Immortal Poems by the Cats of the Major PoetsLyrical or jaunty, the world’s most sophisticated felines display their talents and are every bit as erudite as their human counterparts. From the puss that munched a thousand mice to the single soul who concluded that a furball is a furball is a furball, this is an anthology for cats, cat lovers and discriminating poets alike.From Cat Yearsby Ogden Nash’s CatThe next time you put on your waterproof togsAnd venture outside while it rains us and dogs,Ask which you’d rather have land on your noodle:A cute little cat or a ninety-pound poodle?Shakespeare’s cat soliloquises, Milton’s cat muses on territory lost, Wordsworth’s cat wanders hungry as a hawk while Dylan Thomas’s cat urges its fellows not to go peaceable to that damned vet.The joys of cat concerns - napping, chasing mice, raiding the larder, catnip, fish, bunnies and wriggling rodents - are immortalised in these learned poems.",
