  "description": "Kalos and Musides are two Greek sculptors who are asked to sculpt statues for a competition. But while they are preparing their statues, something terrible happens – Kalos becomes ill. As the two of them are very good friends, the sickness of Kalos makes Musides very unhappy.When Kalos is about to die, he asks Musides to bury olive branches with him. The result, however, is something beautiful and horrifying at the same time.H.P. Lovecraft (1890–1937) was an American horror writer. His best known works include ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ and ‘the Mountains of Madness’. Most of his work was originally published in pulp magazines, and Lovecraft rose into fame only after his death at the age of 46. He has had a great influence in both horror and science fiction genres.",
