  "title": "Mission Mongolia: Two Men, One Van, No Turning Back",
  "description": "The story of an epic road trip in an old van. David and Geoff were two BBC journalists who took voluntary redundancy as their mid-fifties approached. Deciding there had to be more to life than golf or gardening, they set off on an 8,000 mile drive for charity to the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar. Their trip takes them across Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Lying in wait are corrupt cops, bent border guards, mountain tracks and the Gobi desert - but there are also welcoming and curious locals keen to help the two men on their mission and keep them supplied with beer.",
