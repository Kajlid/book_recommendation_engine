  "description": "Herja, Devastation is a tale of myth and mortality, wielder and implement, love and destiny. Free-verse poetry combines with short prose in the style of an Eddic tale modernised.* * *The legend of Valkyrie breathes, as Herja, Devastation, once wronged, aims her mortal agent at her enemies.Her man bears this tale of vengeance in service to a higher, eminently more noble being. He is her assassin and tool, and she is his destiny and dignity.In the dirty business of death on demand, a purity of purpose lights the path as he seeks questions, provides answers and justice on her word.This blending of literary forms creates a unique nouveau noir style for the 21st Century. Do you dare to tread the dark side?",
