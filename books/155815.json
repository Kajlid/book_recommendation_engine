  "description": "Orgasm in females is a more complicated affair and often takes much longer to achieve during a session of sexual acts. In particular, her first orgasm is the most difficult to accomplish, requiring persistent stimulation, concentration, and relaxation. Most of us still grow up in a world where being straight or heterosexual is seen as the norm. People often make assumptions that just because you are female you will be attracted to certain people and you will look, behave and feel a certain way. This book helps you discover new sensations and provides different ways to love yourself and your partner and provides variations for your sexual pleasures.",
