She can't ever know.When I look in the mirror my reflection is of who I'm afraid I'll become and not the man I am.It makes me feel like a poser, no better than all the others pretending to be exactly who they aren't.How does a man keep it together when everything is unraveling right here in his hands?I didn't start any of this.I never asked for it.But it came knocking at my door.When secrets and threats knock, I don't hide.I open the door.Because the best way to take down a poser is to be one.",
