  "description": "Catherine still had her French accent despite twenty four years in the United States. She was forty two years old, divorced for more than fourteen years, and restless. She had started the 'Le Caf√©' business, helped by borrowed money from her aging parents, and worked hard to support her only child. Nowadays, she spent most of her time doing the shop's accounting and purchasing requirements. She thought about beginning a new way of life. 'Perhaps in France', she told herself - until she met Anna. Both women are from different cultures and from different generations. Yet Catherine and Anna discover a passion that is constantly being challenged in pursuit of their dream to be together.",
