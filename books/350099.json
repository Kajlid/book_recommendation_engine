  "description": "Australian sheep shearers always have sheep dogs--smart, well-trained dogs with names like Brute, Tiny, and Fang, who bark commands--\"Woof! Arf arff arff! Grrrr!\"--to round up the sheep for shearing. But sheep shearer Shaun doesn't have a sheep dog. Instead, he has a sheep-sheep named Pete, who speaks politely to the other sheep. And no one shears as skillfully as Shaun. The sheep are delighted! But the other shearers--Ratso, Big Bob, and Bungo--are not.",
