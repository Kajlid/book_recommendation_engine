  "title": "Angel Claw",
  "description": "In a series of highly erotic and frankly kinky fetishistic illustrations which Moebius had been exorcising from his system, Jodorowski spins the complete tale of Angel Claw, a young woman who undergoes her sexual and spiritual initiation. Already in her name one can sense the impossible marriage of violence and tenderness, of flesh and spirit, of beast and beauty. Moebius' genius is for the first time harnessed to the service of unabashed lust and lasciviousness.",
