And when he saw what she had discovered there...no one would be fishing any time soon! This would begin a wild, wooly, wacky and dangerous worldwide mission that would take them and their allies deep into the realm of mystical encounters and supernatural evils that could challenge mankinds very existance. But first, Ulysses needed to get a damn good hot dog! Have a bite and come on along!",
