  "title": "The Postmaster",
  "description": "The Postmaster, an amazing short story was written in 1891 when Tagore was living in East Bengal, during the border of the river Padma, executing his family acreage. The two important characters- a young city-based postmaster and Ratan, an orphan girl have common ground in their loneliness. Considered one of his best stories—included in this selection—recreate vivid images of life and landscapes. They depict the human condition in its many forms: innocence and childhood; love and loss; the city and the village; the natural and the supernatural. Tagore is ’s great Romantic. These stories reflect his profoundly modern, original vision.",
