  "description": "In London in 1019, a few months have passed since Thorgils escaped the clutches of the Irish Church, only to find himself at the center of a capricious love affair with Aelfgifu—wife of Knut the Great, ruler of England, and one of the most powerful men of the Viking empire. As this passionate relationship between the two begins to unfold, it forebodes inevitable consequences. When Thorgils is finally on the run again, he meets Grettir, an outlaw feared for his volatility, and the two become travel companions and sworn brothers. At the gates of Byzantium, Thorgils’ loyalty is put to the ultimate test.",
