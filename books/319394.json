  "description": "It is not a shiver. It is not a shimmy. It is FULL BODY SHAKING. A woman dissociates after childhood abuse and goes on to live a glamorous life far removed from her small hometown in South Africa - and herself. She travels to Cape Town, Phuket, Dubai, Paris, Venice, Cairo and Munich, tying to find her place as a woman in the world. Being a pretty girl, many exciting opportunities open up to her and she moulds herself to fit each role, from film presenter to flight crew, fashion model to fetish dress-up, like a showgirl on a stage. Yet with every move and every smile, she keeps losing more of herself to the greedy hands of men who are drawn to her submissive and alluring beauty.'The more I sleep, the more I can start over when I wake up. Refresh. Rethink. Colour my hair pink.'Thrilling, shocking and tremendously sexual, FULL BODY SHAKING is the story of Poppie, a woman who crosses borders, boundaries and personas in a glamorous attempt to travel and dance her way around abuse, toxic relationships and emotional trauma.",
