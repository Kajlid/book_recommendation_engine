  "description": "A classic romance from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Cathy Maxwell.I believe the most difficult challenge any of us encounter in life is overcoming other people’s expectations. However, once we do, life opens up. In ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL, I wrote a heroine who, in spite of her fears, her doubts, was willing to risk all—and met a man who fell in love with her spirit. Isn’t that what we all want?”—Cathy Maxwell Lady Julia Markham was the toast of London Society—until an ill-advised attempted elopement ended in betrayal and left her good name in tatters. Now ruined, penniless, and desperate, she has agreed to wed the magnetic and possibly dangerous Brader Wolf. A dashing, phenomenally successful self-made businessman, Brader wants this union to help gain him entry into the drawing rooms of the aristocracy, nothing more. Julia, however, is a woman of rare passion and daring, irresistibly drawn to this enigmatic, infuriating man, and no mere marriage of mutual convenience will do. But how far will the spirited beauty have to go to satisfy a heart that will settle for no less than the love of a lifetime?",
