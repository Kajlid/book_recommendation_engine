Rising to the top of the scene, the Hollywood Cowboys lived like gods of thunder and rock 'n roll. Behind the music, they saved their fans, and the world, from the forces of darkness lurking beneath the neon glitter of everyday reality. Addiction, sleaze, fast cars, and demonology... Welcome to the jungle and hang onto the saddle. The Hollywood Cowboys are about to take you for a ride.",
