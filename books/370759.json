  "description": "What is this world he has awoken into—where metal \"monsters\" roar down smooth stone paths and people parade in unfamiliar costumes? Where is the home that once stood on this pile of ancient rubble? And who is this woman who sees him when no one else can . . . and who stirs the fire in his soul? Her research into the legend of a notorious 18th-century Highland chieftan has brought Arabella Ryan to Scotland's storm-swept Loch Fasail. And now the Black Maclean himself has invaded her dreams. The sensuous caress of her mysterious \"ghost lover\" is no mere fantasy, lifting Bella to heights of ecstasy she never imagined existed. But fate has a reason for bringing them together across the centuries—a perilous mission that could change history as it tests the power of their desire and their love.",
