Invitations have been sent out to the noble families to put forth a Champion to participate in the 43rd King Trials, a grueling competition that has left former competitors permanently injured, disabled or dead.

When soldiers from the empire of Mezerah invade Elthare, the Trials are cut short, and the Eltharians must prepare for a war no one ever saw coming. Many lives are lost, but with the help from their allies to the north, Elthare may have a fighting chance against the Mezerans.  At the end of the Ten Day Battle one Champion will be crowned the new monarch of the now fractured kingdom.   But who will be left alive to claim the throne?",
