  "description": "A delightful little story (64 pages) which begins on Christmas Eve when there is no money available for gifts. Philip (dad) Garland has already lost his engineering position. He is so despondent he cares nothing for helping Shirley (wife) decorate the tree while Polly and Junior (children) are in bed. In his den, Philip considers the suicide route other bankrupt business leaders have taken recently. He knows he can't do that. While in his den, he steps on a needle, driving it deep into his foot. He is able to finally get hold of it and pull it out with pliers, but only half the needle is removed. Phil decides the remaining half of the needle will soon take his life and his family will be provided for through his life insurance. He avoids doctor treatment, but tells nobody. Since Phil no longer is looking to the future, only one day at a time, his spirit is lifted, he again interacts with his family, he even acquires a day job, leading to more work. He know, however, it is only a matter of time till his life ends. Tomorrow, likely. This carries on for a year and the story ends at the next Christmas Eve. I'll stop here, because it's too good an ending to spoil the story. (on-line review)",
