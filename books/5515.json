  "description": "This paranormal Regency romance by the New York Times bestselling author “will have readers beaming from the first page to the last” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).England, 1790. When Lorelei Sundun first finds Sir Argus Wherlocke in her garden, she's never heard of the mysterious Wherlocke clan, or their otherworldly abilities. That changes the moment she watches Argus—the most tantalizing man she's ever seen—disappear before her very eyes. What she's witnessed should be impossible. But so should falling in love with a man she's only just met. Pursued by a madman intent on harnessing the Wherlockes' talents as weapons, Argus meant to seek help from his family, not to involve a duke's lovely daughter in the struggle. But now, the enchanting Lorelei is his only hope for salvation—and the greatest temptation he's ever faced.",
