  "description": "Perfect for fans of Jay Crownover and Jennifer L. Armentrout, this edgy, seductive novel from Jessica Lemmon (“An author to keep your eye on!”—Katee Robert) introduces the ultimate bad boy . . . and a love that crosses all boundaries.   Morgan Young had a perfect upbringing, and now she’s got a perfect boyfriend and a perfect future—until her twenty-first birthday changes everything. First Morgan finds out, in the most painful way possible, that her relationship is a sham. But that’s nothing compared to the nightmare about to unfold.   It’s too late for Tucker Noscalo. A brutal childhood left him with a bad reputation and a criminal record. Fresh out of jail, Tucker has a score to settle with Baybrook’s crooked chief of police—his own father. Nobody will believe Tucker’s explosive accusations without proof and a good lawyer, neither of which he has on his side. Until he sees someone he used to know, someone who just so happens to be the daughter of the best lawyer in the county.   He needs Morgan to convince her father of the ugly truth. But first he has to convince her, and he’ll do whatever it takes to get her to listen. Confronted by the story of Tucker’s dark past, Morgan feels utterly compelled to help him. And as their connection grows into a fierce bond fueled by raw passion, Morgan finds herself falling for the wrong guy—but never has the promise of love felt so right.   Praise for Jessica Lemmon   “You’ll be adding Jessica Lemmon to your bookshelf for years to come!”—USA Today bestselling author Heidi Betts   Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.",
