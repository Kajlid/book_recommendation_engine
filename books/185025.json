  "title": "Night Cycles: Poetry for a Dark Night of the Soul",
  "description": "awaken. revel in the heat of your own flames. feel the drum beat throbbing in your gut, the searing nearness of the sacred fires, the slap of your bared soles against earth as you dance in the ash and embers of your own waking.  you were made for the light, for spirit and sinew, for the uncertain dark, for hands holding hands holding hands.  the song begins. you are not alone.  - from \nNight Cycles\n  \nNight Cycles\n is the story of spiritual loss and rebirth, drawn from author Beth Morey’s experience of that desert place Saint John of the Cross called “the dark night of the soul.” Morey beckons us along as she descends into the deep yet vividly beautiful realms of mystery and unknowing, shedding layers and stale beliefs before returning to the light with vital new life and knowledge. In the tradition of the mystic poets, including Mark Nepo, Mary Oliver, and Rainer Maria Rilke, these textured poems from a fresh voice nourish the seeker within us all.",
