  "description": "Part 3 of a short story series set in mythic Viking Age Finland.The midsummer is the time for midnight sun, festival fires and rituals for the future. Bright is the future for Vierra as well, as she sets off to hunt as her mothers have done before her in the same ancient tradition. But the fate of one woman can be a fickle thing. It can change as fast as the northern weather â€” or the mood of ancient spirits.We welcome you to step into the dark northern forest. A place where no plow had touched the ground this far in the wilderness. Where the tall shapes of Viking ships struck terror and awe everywhere they set their sails. This was the age of dreams and legends, of powers now long forgotten. Tales carried by whispers in the cold wind in this dark land.Vierra is a young woman among the Kainu people, a tribe of age-old traditions and ways. Hers is the grim and solitary existence of a woman cursed with greatness and destiny.Can she break her path painted in stone and find a place for herself in her tribe and in her turmoil-filled world? Or will she become 'the Fargoer?'Fargoer is a series of fantasy short stories that draws its power from the harsh yet beautiful nature and folklore of Finland. The combination of fast-paced action and wonder for the long lost worlds of yesterday borrows heavily from pulp-literature of the 1930's... with a bit of human touch and drama in the middle.",
