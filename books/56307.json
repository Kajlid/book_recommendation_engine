  "title": "The Oxford India Anthology of Tamil Dalit Writing",
  "description": "This landmark anthology presents for the first time a clear picture of the different phases of the writing and activities of Dalits from the late nineteenth century to the present in Tamil Nadu. The selections comprising the volume open ways and means of addressing issues to do with the literary, aesthetic, political, and cultural spheres.With 78 selections from poetry, fiction (short stories and excerpts from novels), drama, and prose (autobiographies, speeches, biographies, and archival materials), this collection represents the work of 42 writers and 15 translators. The selected pieces look at issues relating to identity/subjectivity, nationalism/colonialism, and the caste-gender nexus beyond the existing framework of what is widely known as 'Dalit Studies'. The General Introduction analyses the historical and socio-cultural contexts of Tamil Dalit writing, and provides the contextual framework of the selections to further the understanding of this hitherto marginalized discourse. With all the selections translated by experts, the volume includes short bio-notes on the authors and translators. This is a significant volume establishing the rise of writing by Dalits as a shaping force because it is one of the most important developments in 20th century Indian literature and politics.",
