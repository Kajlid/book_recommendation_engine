  "description": "This novel opens on 17 year old girl living in New York City. Oh, excuse me, did i say 17? Elyswyth, or Ellie, as her few friends call her, is immortal. She's lived in the city for as long as she can remember, not knowing who- or what- she is. Until one day, she meets a guy who brings snakes onto public transport (snakes!) and tells her she's a dryad. Ellie, the boy, a werewolf girl, and a cast of wild characters hurtle through the plot and though the city, trying to preserve the secrecy that surrounds their small society of Magiks.",
