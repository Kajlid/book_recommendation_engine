Left alone with her three year old brother, she becomes fiercely protective and self-sufficient to a fault.  Eight years on, Pia is summoned to 'volunteer' as one of a ten person crew to seek out The Refuge, a rumoured sanctuary free of Age Sickness. The volunteers embark on a sea voyage and soon realise they are not the only cargo onboard.  Early in the journey the vicious murder of one volunteer ignites suspicions among the crew and sparks a series of events that leads Pia to unravel dangerous truths.  Unsure of who to trust and fighting her feelings for fellow 'volunteer' Tomas, Pia walks a fine line between truth and lies. One shocking discovery changes everything leaving Pia questioning her past and hiding from her future.  Cargo, the first book in The Cargo Trilogy is soon to be followed by Ruin (Book 2) and Refuge (Book 3).",
