  "title": "Michele Bachmann: Tea Party Champion",
  "description": "On June 27, 2011, an energetic crowd gathered in Waterloo, Iowa, to hear Republican congresswoman Michele Bachmann make an important announcement. The crowd roared as Bachmann delivered her news she was running for U.S. president in 2012. To Bachmann's supporters, the announcement represented hope for change in politics. They view Bachmann as a fresh face in Washington and a strong advocate for conservative values. To her detractors, the news was concerning. They point to her short time in politics as a liability, and they believe her views are too extreme. However one feels about Michele Bachmann, there's no doubt that her rise in politics is remarkable. In just ten years, she transitioned from state senator for Minnesota's District 56 to prominent member of the U.S. House of Representatives and spokesperson for the Tea Party. What position will she hold next? Only time will tell.",
