  "description": "The authoritative Grove Dictionary of American Music says they are \"probably the greatest traditional country duo in history.\" The music of the Louvin Brother has influenced almost all revered rock-and-roll singers and country singers, from the Everly Brothers to Emmylou Harris.The essence of country music for many aficionados is harmony singing, and country harmony, for most of these, is synonymous with the blended voices of Ira and Charles Louvin.This book is the first full study of the Louvin Brothers' remarkable career and of their rich, complex music. Based on extensive research, including substantial interviews with Charles, the surviving brother, In Close Harmony provides a detailed portrait of the Louvins and the turbulent country-music world of the 1950s.",
