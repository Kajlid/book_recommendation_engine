  "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Peace and order have been restored to the kingdoms of Tsaia and Lyonya, thanks to the crowning of Mikeli of Tsaia and the half-elven mercenary Kieri Phelan as their respective kings. But trouble is brewing. Mikeli cannot rule safely as long as the few remaining Verrakaien magelords are at large. And a strange rift has developed between Kieri and his grandmother and co-ruler, the immortal elven queen known as the Lady. Meanwhile, both monarchs are targets of the ex-pirate Alured, who plots to seize their thrones for himself—and to the north, the aggressive kingdom of Pargun seems poised to invade. As threats of war, from without and within, divide the two kings, old alliances and the bonds of friendship will be tested as never before. And a shocking discovery will change everything.",
