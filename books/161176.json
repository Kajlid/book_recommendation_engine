  "description": "*Dark Short Story*Find out who or what is haunting Mary Clarke...She does not sleep, but paces the halls beneath her veil of black and lace. For at night, monsters creep. The floorboards creak with phantom steps, and through the keyhole to Williamâ€™s library, there is a light. Brilliant at first, but dims the closer she becomes. The hairs rise along the nape of her neck when she takes notice she hears the hum, a vibration, which stirs the chilled air next to her ear.",
