  "description": "With the innocent first-years Nazuna-chan and Nori-chan rounding out the quirky cast of residents at the Hidamari Apartments, every day is shaping up to be quite...erm, interesting! When Yuno manages to lose a battle with a toilet for her house key, her clumsiness leads to, among other things, a sleepover, which in turn becomes something of a habit. But with homesickness making the rounds through Hidamari, school trips for some residents resulting in others being left to their own wacky devices, and the pressures of college entrance exams looming, a girl like Yuno can use all the dedicated friends and fun sleepovers she can get! Grab a pillow and settle in for another sunny, heartwarming romp through Hidamari!",
