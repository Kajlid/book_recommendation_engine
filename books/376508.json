Khan, the star-studded lineup of authors includes: Phyllis Gotlieb, Robert Sawyer, Jay Lake, Gary Markette, John Park, Bronwyn Elko, Marian Powell, Kurt Kirchmeier, Kaori Praschak, Ian Rogers, Paul Carlson, John Rogers, Dwight O. Allen, Jr.\"My contribution, “The Shoulders of Giants,” is a reprint — but also, I think, one of my very best stories.\" - Robert J. Sawyer",
