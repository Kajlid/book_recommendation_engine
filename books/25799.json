  "description": "An antagonists-to-lovers, grumpy-sunshine, surprise pregnancy rom com The last thing single dad and surgeon Nate Sullivan needs is more stress and distraction in his life.  That makes his best friend’s gorgeous, mouthy, doesn’t-respect-schedules, hates-authority, has-no-boundaries sister a huge threat to his carefully balanced life.  Nate is the kind of guy Emma Dixon hates: buttoned-up, rigid, his-way-or-the-highway. So why is he the guy she can’t quit thinking about and who she most loves sparring with? They’re like oil and water. But when they’re thrown together on opposites sides of a “project”–Nate trying to keep his son from falling for the wrong girl and Emma playing cupid for the couple– they find they’re more like gasoline and a match. this book was previously published as Best of Three (Just Everyday Heroes: Night Shift/ the Dixons)  The Series:Why You Should Never Kiss Your Boss (Ben & Jessica)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Blind Date (Sam & Dani)Why You Should Never Kiss A Grump (Mac & Sara)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Fake Boyfriend (Dooley & Morgan)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Ex-Husband (Kevin & Eve)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Brother’s Best Friend (Ryan & Amanda)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Ex (Shane & Isabelle)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Enemy (Nate & Emma)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Best Friend (Cody & Olivia)Why You Should Never Kiss Your Roommate (Conner & Gabby)",
