  "description": "A woman hiding from her past.A man searching for his. Megan Summers has been on the run for over a year. After witnessing a murder, she fled as fast and as far as she could go, landing her in the remote coastal village of Victory Cove. Even with a new name, she knows it's only a matter of time before the murderer finds her. Jake Grogan has come to Victory Cove to unravel the mystery of his heritage. Instead of finding his grandmother at Wakefield House, he  discovers an attractive stranger who will do anything to get him off her doorstep. Trapped by a storm, he’s forced to stay the night with Megan—a recluse who keeps a handgun under her bed and closes herself off from the outside world. As Jake tries to unearth his past, he’s distracted by his fear for Megan’s safety and his growing feelings for her. Danger is drawing near and he’ll do anything to protect her. Will it be enough, though? Will it be enough for them to survive the endless night?",
