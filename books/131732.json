  "description": "In 1814, at the age of seventeen, Daniel Graham sacrificed himself to save another. Recruited at his death to be a Protector of the Night, he has spent the last 200 years as a Dreamcatcher, guarding humans from Nightmares—clawed, red-eyed creatures that feed off people’s fears while they sleep.Then he’s given an assignment to watch over sixteen-year-old Kayla Bartlett, and the job becomes more dangerous than any Daniel’s ever experienced—because someone with the power to control the monsters seems to want her dead.Driven by his growing feelings for her, Daniel whisks her away to Rome where others like him can keep her safe. Under their roof, the Protectors discover what Kayla is and why someone who can manipulate the nightmares has her in his sights. But before they can make a move, the Protectors are betrayed, and Kayla is kidnapped. Daniel will stop at nothing to save her—even if it means giving up his immortality.He thought she was just another girl to protect. He was wrong.",
