  "description": "Ian McAllistor has always thought of himself as an Alpha werewolf. Born last in a pack of dominant females, he always felt as if he had something to prove. A chance encounter with a very special couple opened his eyes to his own submissive nature. As his desire for supplication grew, Ian needed a lover of his own, someone he could submit to. When he first laid eyes on Khalid Diya al Din, Ian knew that the golem was just the one to bring him to his knees. One of the ancient races, Khalid had nearly everything necessary to make Ian tame: smoldering eyes, massive chest and four arms! Yet just when Ian thought that things couldn't get any better, his mother and sisters appear. They don't like the idea of Ian being submissive, especially not when a power-hungry Alpha wants the McAllistor sisters for his own and is more than they can handle. They need a male Alpha. They need their brother. Left with little choice, Ian has to make peace with his past, accept his present and learn that sometimes submission is the heart of strength. Publisher's Note: Obedience Training contains elements that may be offensive to some readers: bdsm practices, mnage, male/male sexual contact.",
