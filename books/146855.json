  "description": "David Fuller believes he owes his life to a wounded man who got away with murder. The murder of David’s dangerous mother. Now a writer gaining national attention, David looks back on the critical events that moved his path from dark to light and in doing so, he creates not just a new version of history, but a story so much closer to the truth.David’s troubled and callous mother, Renae, dragged him and his brother Matthew back to Avry, Colorado, when they were young boys. She had designs on the family home that her parents were leaving behind. A free place was just the kind of thing Renae kept her radar scanning for. She was angered – though she couldn’t have been surprised – when she learned that her steady younger sister, Lauren, would be taking over the house instead. Renae and her sons subsequently ended up in the worn ranch house of a notorious local man.University cosmologist Harding Campbell stumbled into Avry not long after Renae. He was seeking solace following the death of his beloved wife, Annalee. Harding hoped the small mountain town and its hot springs might help him find it. His wandering led him to a chance entanglement with Renae … and from there to her sons and her beautiful sister. David and Matthew unexpectedly remind wounded Harding of the possibility of life, of possibility incarnate, even as he continues to ache for his cherished Annalee. His growing affection for Lauren only intensifies the experience. He’s been blindsided by tragedy twice now, first in his own childhood and then again by the loss of Annalee. In Avry, he has to decide what he’s willing to do when he actually sees lethal danger coming. Whether he’s willing to stand in the breach … no matter what.Sometimes it takes destruction for life to correct itself.",
