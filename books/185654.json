  "description": "Brooke Leighton had finally come to accept her new life as a werewolf when everything was pulled out from underneath her, catapulting her life into further chaos.  Again.  Cold and disoriented, Brooke wakes in a prison with walls made of stone. She’s been collared and drugged and struggles to remember how she got here. Images flash, reminding her of Nick’s involvement in her attack several months ago and her decision to leave. It wasn’t her intention to leave for good; she just needed a little time to clear her head.  She never thought that she’d fall victim to a trap set by the vampire coven they’ve been at war with, and she most definitely didn’t expect to find something her pack had thought lost to them for the better part of a decade  As time passes, Brooke is subjected to various tests, and it isn’t until she comes face to face with the new Coven leader that she finds out why Gianna had gone after her back in Scottsdale in the first place. The former vampire queen’s plans force the Pack to search for answers, but they only uncover a complex web of deception expertly woven by Gianna and her coven.  When tragedy strikes, will Brooke be able to keep the Pack from falling apart in order to derail the coven’s plot once and for all? Or will the coven succeed in using Brooke as their ultimate weapon in their war?",
