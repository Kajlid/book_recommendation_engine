  "description": "Betty Dravis shares behind-the-scenes happenings of some of her favorite celebrity interviews. She tells what led up to the interviews and her feelings and impressions during and after the meetings. Among those interviewed Actor/Director Clint Eastwood, Senator Ted Kennedy, 40's Star Jane Russell, Singer/Actress Tanya Tucker, Mayor Joseph Alioto, and Actress Ann Sothern.\"As always, Ms Dravis's interviews have a warmth, charm and delightful quirkiness that draw you in, fill you with enjoyment, and leave you wanting more. Ms. Dravis always adds that special personal touch that leaves the reader with a true sense of who these icons really are as people, not just as idols.\" - Karen McCord Zabalaoui, Texas, Amazon Top Reviewer\"...Dravis offers us a very human picture of the reporter conducting interviews. At times it is entertaining, as for example when she reflects on her \"bad hair day\" when meeting Clint Eastwood. At other times, it is poignant, as when she reflects on her meeting with Senator Ted Kennedy years before his prolonged struggle with cancer. But in all her anecdotes, Dravis offers readers a picture of how the interviewer, far from being a neutral questioner, is affected by the meeting with her subjects.\" - Fritz Ward, Southern California, school teacher and avid day-hiker",
