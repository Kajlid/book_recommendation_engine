  "description": "There is a place hidden away in Cornwall, unremarkable from the outside, but a haven for the most daring of pleasure seekers...and every husband and wife willing to indulge their most intimate fantasies.Even the primest Victorian garb cannot mask Gwendolyn's delectable attributes - yet her handsome husband regards her with icy disdain. She has but one chance to save her marriage and avert a future of dashed hopes and despair...and it requires a visit to a house where sensuality reigns.Unable to satisfy the needs of the man she adores, Lillian is devastated when he seeks the amorous attentions of another. But there are passionate lessons to be learned if she joins the lovers in their erotic hideaway...To possess a bride as voluptuous and exciting as Cora would be any man's dream, yet Gareth cannot understand why the woman he wed despises him so. Still, he will not give her up without a fight, though it may take extraordinary imagination to make Cora's most wicked secret fantasies come true.",
