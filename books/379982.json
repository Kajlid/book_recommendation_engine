In 'The Dragon's Treasure', a dragon obsessed with cleanliness quietly pines over a regular customer to his shop. In 'The Selkie No One Wanted', a selkie who is nothing like his beautiful siblings winds up helping the fisherman he has long admired. A demon finds himself dealing with two troublesome humans in 'The Spawn', and in 'Mad Finnegan', a mad wizard reunites with the person who first drove him into the 'madness' that has made him infamous. A young chef winds up with an unusual assistant in Dragon Stew and a man finds that life has not quite yet passed him by in 'The Innkeeper's Story'. 'The Quest' sends a loud-mouthed demon to earn the affections of a mate who does not want him, and in 'Spellbound' a talented thief longs to find a way to steal the heart of his latest client.Warning! The story 'Mad Finnegan' contains incest.",
