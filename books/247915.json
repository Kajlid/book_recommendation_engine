  "description": "Tess is dying. Her only chance to live is an untested, experimental, and illegal treatment. She doesn’t know it, but taking that chance will destroy the lives of her family and friends, not to mention her ability to trust them. Worse, it will put her in the crosshairs of every government, paramilitary group, and biotech company in the world.Before her world comes crashing down around her, she bumps into Adam on a bus. He’s exceptionally odd and doesn’t understand the way the world works. He fills Tess and her family with laughter, hope, and a few days of happiness before people start to die around her. She lets Adam in and immediately has more questions than answers, especially after he gets hit by a truck and walks away unscathed. But that’s not the weirdest part about him, and it doesn’t explain why he shows up in her life days before an attack shatters her life. That tragedy reveals a web of lies and secrets that threaten to destabilize not just Tess’s life, but the entire world.If the treatment fails, Tess is as good as dead. Whether it works or not, questions remain... who or what will kill her first, why is Adam protecting her, and will there be anything left for it to matter?",
