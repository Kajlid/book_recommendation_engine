  "title": "Death in Holy Orders",
  "description": "From the award-winning master of literary crime fiction, a classic work rich in tense drama and psychological insight.On the East Anglian seacoast, a small theological college hangs precariously on an eroding shoreline and an equally precarious future. When the body of a student is found buried in the sand, the boy’s influential father demands that Scotland Yard investigate. Enter Adam Dalgliesh, a detective who loves poetry, a man who has known loss and discovery. The son of a parson, and having spent many happy boyhood summers at the school, Dalgliesh is the perfect candidate to look for the truth in this remote, rarified community of the faithful–and the frightened. And when one death leads to another, Dalgliesh finds himself steeped in a world of good and evil, of stifled passions and hidden pasts, where someone has cause not just to commit one crime but to begin an unholy order of murder. . . . “Gracefully sculpted prose and [a] superbly executed mystery . . . Death in Holy Orders is among [James’s] most remarkable and accomplished Dalgliesh novels.”–The Philadelphia Inquirer“An elegant work about hope, death, and the alternately redemptive and destructive nature of love.”–The Miami Herald “Absorbing . . . [James’s] plotting and characterization [are] impeccable.”–Orlando Sentinel“P. D. James is in top form.”–The Boston GlobeOpen the exclusive dossier at the back of this book, featuring P. D. James’ essay on penning the perfect detective novel.",
