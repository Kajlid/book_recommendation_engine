But when she starts dating mysterious transfer student Sebastian Weber, her friends become determined to break up the fledgling pair.

What starts as a simple intervention turns deadly when Sebastian initiates the process that will change Stella into a vampire. Suddenly, the clock is ticking—and to make matters worse, Sebastian’s vampiric family comes to town, bringing their own drama and complications. Stella and her friends have to find a cure for vampirism, stay one step ahead of Sebastian’s sinister maker, and somehow survive high school. And there’s one more wrench in the situation: As the friends quickly discover, most legends agree that there’s one cure for a vampire-to-be … killing the vampire who turned them.Sometimes, breakups really are a matter of life and death.",
