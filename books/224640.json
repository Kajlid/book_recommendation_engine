  "title": "Arcanum: An Irish Mystery",
  "description": "When a troupe of Irish dancers disappear, the police and the world are left baffled. While Silas Murphy and Clodagh Trevor embark on their own desperate search for their friends and colleagues, a strange and complex labyrinth of events unfold, influenced by the age-old divinatory symbolism of the Tarot cards. Arcanum is a supernatural novel set in past and present Ireland against the background of Irish dance, which tells of the human spirit’s desire to overcome adversity. With the force of determination, plus a little magic, the veil between past and present is briefly lifted and the two are united in order to restore harmony, but not before the tragedy of loss is experienced on either side. This novel takes the reader on a journey through Ireland and weaves a story combining fact and fantasy, mystery and romance. Arcanum will be enjoyed by readers with a strong interest in Ireland as well as those who enjoy watching Irish dance and those who take part in the popular art-form themselves. A fascinating and gripping read, this book will not only serve to entertain readers, but also to enlighten them. “A very descriptive and lively read” – Gloria Hunniford, author and broadcaster “Haunting and suspenseful. A delightful read.” – Ireland Today “Ann Mann’s enchanting and compelling story takes us on a dance through time and keeps the reader guessing until the final page. Pure magic!” – Louise Keegan, The Keegan Academy of Irish Dance “A wonderfully fascinating and charming story that will take you through the historical periods of Irish identity, religion, dance and music. It’s a page-turner that you don’t want to miss!” – James Keegan, Lead Dancer, Lord of the Dance “The rhythm of the dance runs through this exciting story like a heart beat and tension is maintained until the totally unexpected but completely believable denouement. I just loved this book.” – Caroline Graham, creator of Midsomer Murders \"Magical and mysterious and wonderfully entertaining.\" – Niall Buggy, Actor",
