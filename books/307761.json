  "description": "A Small Town Second Chance New Year's Eve RomanceColeMaking wine in Napa Valley once upon a time was a dream, one I held close before I ﻿returned home to start a business with my brothers.﻿But what I brought home with me wasn't just a valuable skill. I also brought the memories of a young winemaker who I fell for, fast and hard. However, a family emergency pulled her to the other side of the world, and I was sure I'd never see her again...or get over my broken heart.﻿When she shows up in town unexpectedly, I'm shocked, and all those old feelings come rushing back. I'm sure our time has passed, but when a New Year's Eve blizzard locks us in together, we might have one more chance to rekindle the flame we both thought was snuffed out.﻿﻿",
