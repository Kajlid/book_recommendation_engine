  "description": "In RUNNING SECRETS, flight attendant Chris Stevens is bent on self-destruction until she meets Gemi Kemmal, an Ethiopian home healthcare provider. Gemi and Jake, a paramedic, help Chris heal from and confront her difficult past, and regain a passion for living. In the process, Chris and Gemi forge an unusual friendship that bridges cultural, racial and age differences. Their friendship gives both women the support each needs. Gemi comes to question restrictive traditions dictating her immigrant life, such as the headscarf she’s worn since entering puberty and the celibacy she’s practiced since the brutal death of her husband and infant in the violence that destroyed her homeland and family. Chris uncovers family secrets that challenge everything she's ever known to be true. Together the women learn that racial identity is a choice, self expression is a right, and family is a personal construct.\"William's focus in sensory details - colors, smells, sounds- will heighten the awareness of everyday circumstances that ought not be merely taken for granted. And the celebration of both cross-cultural and trans-generational friendships provides an outlook that is relevant and valuable.\"- Barbara Lloyd McMichael, The Bookmonger",
