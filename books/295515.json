  "description": "I’m the nightmare they never see coming.  You, the one reading this right now. Yes. You. I’m going to warn you this one time. Don’t decide to like me.  I’m not a good girl.. I’m manipulative. I play games. I’ve done it countless times and I’ll do it again. I can promise you that.  With more funding behind me than you can imagine, I can become anyone.   I mess with men’s hearts. And when I am done, it is more than just their money I take, it’s their very sense of self.  The football star. The politician. The surgeon. The artist. They all gave over their love. I hate to tell you how easy it is to make them my own. A little smile. A batting of my big, beautiful eyes. The most powerful fall the hardest.  Did they take part of my soul with them? Try to get me to admit it. I dare you to try. I’ll never say the words you all want to hear from me. I’m never sorry.  Those stupid boys.  I warned you. Don’t. Like. Me. You’ll regret it.  *The authors strongly suggest you read the forward to this book before you go any further. This is the first book in a trilogy with strong, sometimes dislikable characters in a world where few people are as they seem and love comes at a cost not everyone is willing to pay.*",
