  "title": "Fault Lines: The Nightmare Novel Of A World Gone Out Of Control",
  "description": "Without warning, cataclysmic tremors shake the San Andreas fault line in California, tumbling vast sections of the West Coast into the Pacific Ocean. Compensatory earthquakes throughout the other fault lines of the earth set in motion giant tidal waves that flood the Gulf and East coasts of the United States and activate dormant volcanoes in the Caribbean. Slowly the warning currents of the Gulf Stream are forced away from what remains of the United States and a new Ice Age threatens to descend on the North American continent. Was it a natural disaster or nuclear sabotage? What is to be done to feed, clothe, and shelter the people? Can the Gulf currents be reversed without throwing the earth out of orbit? Only the President can decide. Only he can determine which advisors to follow - superpatriots such as Sophocles Spiros, young radicals led by Jake Lambert, or the warhawks in the Pentagon. And the American people, a have-not people living in a have-not country, attempt to survive. Ultimately, the fate of the United States is decided by as strange a collection of political bedfellows as can be imagined - revolutionaries, radicals, middle-of-the-roaders, conservatives.",
