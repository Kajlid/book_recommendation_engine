  "title": "Lewis's Dream",
  "description": "Detective Lewis Keating has had enough of cheating men. When a crooked cop steals a stack of files, it's Lewis's job to go through them and close out the ones he can. When a familiar case is found among the files, Lewis decides to question the one person who should be on his list. Evan Triamade was once told he looked like he breathed pain. A control freak since childhood, the wolf quickly loses his handle on things when his aloof mate shows up to question him about an assault that supposedly happened months ago. Their relationship is volatile from the start, and Evan is forbidden to see his mate by Alpha Maverick until their differences can be settled. Evan soon finds that convincing his mate not all men are cheaters is harder than he imagined. To make matters worse, Lewis has a drinking problem. When Lewis is taken by the ex-alpha, Jackson, it isn't Evan who rescues him but the smaller mates of the house and a Xiamen tiger. Lewis thought living among humans was hard, but living in a world of were-creatures tests his very sanity. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
