  "title": "That Close",
  "description": "Suggs is one of pop music’s most enduring and likeable figures. Written with the assured style and wit of a natural raconteur, this hugely entertaining and insightful autobiography takes you from his colourful early life on a North London council estate, through the heady early days of Punk and 2-Tone, to the eighties, where Madness became the biggest selling singles band of the decade. Along the way he tells you what it’s like to go globetrotting with your best mates, to sign away your entire song rights ‘in perpetuity’ and cause an earthquake in Finsbury Park.",
