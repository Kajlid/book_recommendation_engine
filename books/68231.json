  "title": "The Icon of the Divine Heart of God the Father: Apologia and Canon",
  "description": "In this book, the background of the revealed, diptych, ecumenical icon of the Divine Heart of God the Father Encompassing All Hearts is presented, together with the related Consecration (Seal) Prayer to the Almighty Father. The icon apologia and canon are elucidated. The ecumenical importance of the icon of the Divine Heart for the universal Church is addressed, together with the basis for the icon in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, as well as its meaning for our present times and eschatological future. The aims of the icon, history of God the Father in iconography, and pertinent Church Council decrees are explored. The history of the first icon of the Eternal Father in the Catholic Church is given, with evidence of the Divine Paternal Heart, including Scriptural evidence, and the history/revelations of this second icon of the Father in the Catholic Church. A summary theology of the Divine Heart icon is outlined, with relevance to the sacred liturgy, Catholic/Orthodox mysticism, the era of the eighth day and deification of man, the universal call to holiness, and the de-Christianization of our times.",
