  "description": "Kaidos Vailinn is a man trying hard to overcome his past. But being a Wanderer-born thief does not leave him many opportunities in life. So when a stranger comes bearing a contract to kidnap a prostitute and deliver “her” overseas, he’s hard-pressed to find a reason to turn it down. Veyl is the highest paid “companion” at the Silver Tree Manor, an upscale brothel in the village of Aaullsworthe. At the tender age of twenty, he is steeped in ennui and still reeling from a broken heart. When he is called to a room at the local inn, he is charmed by the handsome dark-skinned man who has paid for his services. However things get ugly once Kaidos realizes it's not a woman that he's brought to his bed.What begins as a journey full of discord slowly evolves into love. But when the ruthless ambition of a dying tyrant tears the lovers apart, Kaidos must convince an army to help him rescue the man who is worth more to him than a king’s ransom.",
