  "description": "A forbidden love. A daring escape. And a mind blowing twist.  In an effort to ensure peace and a reversal of the millennia of subjugation they’ve endured, women have banded together to make the planet Venus a technological marvel and a world where only they hold the reins of power. While women are revered, men are kept in bondage, destined to a lifetime of abuse and servitude. Love between men and women is strictly forbidden, punishable by mutilation or death.  Empress Terra, though, has broken the most sacred rule of her people: she has fallen in love with her servant, Nic. When her best friend’s servant runs away, it will trigger a series of events that finally allow Terra the escape she’s long dreamed of as they find themselves journeying to the deadliest place in the galaxy: the forbidden planet, Earth.  But Earth is not as it should be.  Flung back through time, the friends find themselves in the middle of the American Civil War, where their skin color puts them in grave danger. As they struggle to understand this new planet’s bizarre rules and the concept of race, peril awaits them at every turn and to stay alive, they must once again escape.",
