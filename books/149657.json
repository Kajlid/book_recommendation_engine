When Monroe Donovan, former crime reporter busted down to the obit desk by her boss and ex-lover, receives another obituary with a \"wrong\" future date, she sees a story. Detective Lane Brody sees a suspect in Monroe, accusing her of hiding her connection between her ex-lover and the latest victim, while Monroe can't deny the attraction between herself and the unhappily married Detective. The same kind of attraction that landed her in obits. Then Monroe walks in on her former lover and his girlfriend, half-naked and being held at knifepoint by the killer. Now Monroe can only hope Detective Brody stops suspecting her and starts looking for her--before her name appears in the obits. ..\".twists and turns, beautiful character development.
