  "title": "Irrelevant Experience: The Secret Diary of an Assistant Psychologist",
  "description": "\"Life after graduation is tough. I want to be a clinical psychologist. Unfortunately it seems so does everyone else who has a psychology degree. I need excellent grades, lots of work experience, and a job on the first rung of the ladder as an Assistant Psychologist. Then there is the tiny matter of getting onto a clinical doctorate course. Add into the mix a stressed out best friend, an over-sexed house-mate, a pal who makes it a habit of getting regularly fired, and it's a sure-fire recipe for a quarter life crisis. Still, no one ever said that helping other people was going to be easy...\" Irrelevant The Secret Diary of an Assistant Psychologist is the story of how one hopeful applicant fares in navigating her career, friendships, romance and rivalries. After graduation, those first steps into the big wide world are scary, and not every experience fits neatly on your CV.",
