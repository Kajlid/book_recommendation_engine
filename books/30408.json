  "description": "Too often our Christmas season is filled with such questions as What do you want for Christmas? or What do you mean it is sold out? or Did decorating the tree take this long last year? only to find that when the season has come and gone a more vital question Is that all there is to Christmas? In Shepherds, Why This Jubilee? Elder Jeffrey R. Holland celebrates the Christmas season and spirit by focusing on the birth and life of Jesus Christ the true meaning of Christmas. In three essays, Elder Holland traces the path of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem and sheds new light on familiar scriptures. He reflects on the sweet refrains of the carols and hymns that so eloquently recall the glorious first Christmas night, and he shares his own personal stories and memories of Christmas to testify of his deep feelings about Jesus Christ. When details overwhelm the holiday spirit, Elder Holland reminds us to remember why the shepherds were so joyful because in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord was born beneath a shining star. He reminds us that Jesus Christ is the answer to all our questions and the source of all our jubilee.",
