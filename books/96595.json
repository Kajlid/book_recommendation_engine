  "description": "When sixteen year old Deb heads to a roller derby tournament in Vegas, she hardly expects to skate against so many dangerous fairies -- much less for The Realm to experience a coup in her absence. What follows is an odyssey among fairy night life, beastly derby girls, blown out casinos and a mermaid with a hankering for a Philly Cheese Steak. Separated from her best friend Harlow, can Deb keep her head, or will she lose herself to the Dark Queen Sardonica? Join fairies, trolls, gypsies, wizards, mermaids, devils, elves, and more in this over-the-top, action-packed adventure through teen angst, sugar addiction, and roller derby.",
