  "title": "Livia and the Corpuscles",
  "description": "Rome: city of glass and steel, where thousand-year-old stadiums mix with newly constructed airship towers. It is the eighth century of the Second Roman Republic, founded on the basis of citizenship for all: slavery is repellent to the people and labour-saving devices do the work of servants. But there is a canker at the core of this technological wonderland, a conspiracy which strikes at the soul of the Republic. Livia and Helena are two friends who both work in the Hall of Records, sharing a flat to afford the rent in the centre of the city. Livia discovers evidence of the cankerous conspiracy, then both she and Helena must make choices that will change their lives and the future of Rome itself. Within this technological utopia live two friends, each with their own secrets. When they learn of a conspiracy to keep the true nature of this golden age hidden from the masses, they must both make choices that will change their lives forever.",
