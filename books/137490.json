The Suicide Forest is full of demons, drawn to those who come to kill themselves. Steven and Roy find themselves here, facing down an evil greater than any before. The evil starts in the haunted Seattle home of June, grandmother to Robbie, a ten-year old boy who shares \"the gift\" with Steven and Roy. Steven suspects the ghostly attacks on June and Robbie are much more than a mere haunting and soon realize they are in over their heads. They seek the help of Judith, an elderly eccentric, who guides them to a climactic confrontation in the dark clearing of The Suicide Forest. The Suicide Forest is the fifth book in The River series.",
