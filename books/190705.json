  "description": "Paralian [Pa`ra´li`an - one who lives by the sea]Curious and determined from the very beginning, I left the warm, flowing blanket of my mom’s amniotic fluid five weeks too early. There I was. Stranded in a body not quite my own, soon to be taken away from her to be handed over to a young couple who were just as lost in this world.It was the beginning of an incredible journey, which brought me to the surging rivers of my childhood in Germany and later to the deep, glacial lakes of Switzerland. Then, one day, on the shores of Lake Zurich, an epiphany amidst bags of aromatic popcorn helped me to grasp the entire truth about my gender identity.Still searching for a place to truly call home and longing for a deeper understanding of the world and myself, my quest continued. I explored different cultures and oceans through work and travel, continuously fascinated by the inspiring individuals I encountered along the way. Several years of refreshing yet challenging Maldivian island life led me to the Philippine jungle and onward to the South China Sea, to Macau and the largest aquatic show in the world. It was there inspiration struck like never before but passion also brought me to the very limits of my endurance…Paralian: Not Just Transgender is about living life authentically, about independence, compassion, and the beauty of our often-troubled existence. Written with profound honesty and a fine sense of humor, Paralian hopes to touch your heart while leaving you slightly breathless all at the same time.",
