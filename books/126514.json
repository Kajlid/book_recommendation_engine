  "description": "Darren didn’t mind college. If it wasn’t for his lack of friends, and a girlfriend who would rather party her semester away than see his face, he might even call it a good experience. But his education was interrupted when he found the tunnel hidden below the library, because what was down there was something that could destroy everything he knew. And when Audrey steps into his life and into the tunnel with him, life would never be the same again.",
