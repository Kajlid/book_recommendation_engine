  "title": "The Little Book of the End of the World",
  "description": "From the Mayans to modern-day survivalists, a tongue-in-cheek look at the best and worst predictions of Armageddon Whether it's a mighty battle between ancient gods, the Second Coming of a Biblical savior, or a pesky Millennial computer virus, we’ve always wondered how the world would end. And whether we’d be (un)lucky enough to see it. This book explores some of the theories about the end of days, looking from religion to science and everything in between. Some are silly enough to laugh at, others might scare you to death. Either way, you’ll find the End is nigh; it's right between these pages.",
