Read along and find out how Marc tries to convert Earth into a spacefaring world capable of defending itself and of being united as it meets the other civilizations in the galaxy. Marc and his crew need to accomplish all this without tipping off the U.S. government and before the Paraxeans come looking for their spaceship.
