  "description": "Coming in 2009, the major motion picture from the director of SlackerThe irresistible story of a stagestruck boy coming of age in the golden era of Broadway--with some very famous supporting characters--Me and Orson Welles is a romantic farce that reads like a Who's Who of the classic American theater. Called \"one of the best depictions of male adolescent yearning ever to hit the page\" (Kirkus Reviews), it is sure to translate wonderfully to screen in 2009.",
