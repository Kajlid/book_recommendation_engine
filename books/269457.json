Now, her grandfather’s war with local boss Darius Bell has drawn her out of hiding and put her in the crosshairs of not one but two merciless crime lords. Her decision to intervene in their war has endangered everyone Alice cares about and threatens to destroy the life she’s built for herself, including her relationship with alpha werewolf Sean Maclin.Meanwhile, Alice’s new case is the most dangerous of her career. Hired to find a missing child with a rare magical ability, she and her ghost sidekick Malcolm quickly become targets for the boy’s ruthless kidnappers. To stay alive and free from both Bell and Moses, she must rely not only on her growing powers but also her alliances with Sean’s pack and the Vampire Court.When Alice’s conflicts with pack members turn violent and the Court betrays her, the truth becomes clear: freeing the kidnapped boy and finding her place in the pack will cost Alice her secrets, her safety, and—if she isn’t careful—her life.",
