  "description": "The English island called Abandon, enshrouded in ancient legend, has been home to warriors as well as enchanting women -- and none more spellbinding than lovely Morwenna Halliwell. Determined to fight when Abandon is offered to the highest bidder, Morwenna confronts the enemy: the Earl of Pentargon, Anthony Hartstone -- or \"Lord Heart-of-Stone\" as she indignantly calls him. Yet little does Morwenna realize she will soon be forced to marry the forbidding lord who holds her future in his strong hands.Anthony arrogantly dismisses Mzorwenna and her litany of complaints against him -- all the while drawn to her beauty and courage. But when danger confronts Morwenna, Anthony knows he must call upon all his power to protect the innocent miss he desires. It is up to him to unmask the villain who threatens her, and also to convince his bride that he is not her opponent -- but her most passionate and devoted admirer.",
