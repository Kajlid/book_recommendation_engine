  "description": "Aurora Rose Norquest is different from her neighbors, different from most people. Still single at thirty-five, she spends every hour of her days and nights in an elegant Manhattan apartment, quietly caring for her invalid mother. Then her mother dies, and Aurora's world spins on its axis. Reality shatters into startlingly realistic nightmares, and the shards of troubling memories slice into her sleep. Everything Aurora has believed about herself and her world fades into murky dreams that will not let her rest. Something, someone is pursuing Aurora--growing more threatening by the day, testing the limits of her sanity. Will she find the courage to confront her unseen pursuer? Or will she surrender to the destructive melancholy that haunts her days and nights? What will it take to satisfy the relentless intruder whose voice presses her toward The Awakening ?",
