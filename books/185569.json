  "description": "Sometimes, doing the right thing is not always an option when it comes to family.  With bill collectors calling and the mortgage company wanting its share, Shawn is driven to the edge. He loses his temper and unintentionally takes it out on his boss. That ends with him in jail and deeper debt. While in jail, he runs into a man he used to torment in high school. Fourteen years later, that guy still has a chip on his shoulder.  When Shawn’s friend gives him a piece of information to help him out of his funk, it ends up changing his family’s life forever. That change brings with it good and bad, and an unexpected visitor arrives at his home—greed (also known as the root of all evil). When greed leaves, it takes with it one of his family members.  The FBI unknowingly misses acquiring a videotape that captured part of the event, and when Shawn gets his hands on the tape, he learns it reveals important information about the person responsible. He turns to his friends Kyle and Jonny for help.",
