While adapting to her extraordinary gifts, such as amplified hearing, acute eyesight, and “freakishly strong feet”, she is drawn to three other students in her high school. Possessing unique abilities of their own, Gabe and his two sisters befriend Mia and invite her along on their rescue missions.
