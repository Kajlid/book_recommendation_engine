  "description": "When a homeless young omega comes by Burke’s pub asking for work, Burke doesn’t have the heart to send him away. He lets the boy help with some chores in exchange for food, and soon, Emerson’s visits become regular. Then one frosty December night, the boy keeps his head down, hiding in a corner until closing time and looking like he wants to disappear into the ground. Emerson is about to go into heat, and he has nowhere to hide.People say Burke is ugly and scary, but Emerson has never been afraid of the burly pub owner. The big alpha has scars down the side of his face, but so what? He must have been in a lot of pain once, poor man. When snow covers Dalton City, and Emerson realizes he’s only days away from his first heat, his feet carry him to the pub by themselves. Burke is the only alpha Emerson trusts not to hurt him. And given the choice between freezing to death or getting abused, Emerson would much rather offer himself to Burke.Except Burke is probably the nicest man in the entire city. Stunned, Emerson finds himself safe and warm during the snowstorm, without having to sacrifice anything. Maybe he’s even a little bit in love with his rescuer.",
