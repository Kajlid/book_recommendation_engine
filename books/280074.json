  "description": "Pop. It’s a drink. It’s a name. For me, pop was the sound my cherry still hadn’t made. I was twenty-two and still a virgin. I thought it was because of my curves, but my friend said it was because I’m too picky. Maybe she’s right. In this small town, there aren’t a lot of eligible men to choose from—especially when your brother warned them all away from you in high school and the ‘don’t touch’ rule kinda stuck. Meaning I’m stuck being a twenty-two year old ‘maiden’ who works in a 50s style milk bar and has zero prospects in life.  That is until a blast from the past comes riding into town.  Derek Star. The baddest boy our sleepy town has ever seen. He was the one guy willing to go against my brother’s rule. My first kiss. My only kiss. Will he be the first man to pop my cherry too?    Warning: this quick read contains over-the-top declarations, insta-love and molten hot moments between a curvy girl and a dirty-talking bad boy who knows exactly what he wants. He’ll do anything to be the one to break this innocent girl in and make her his.",
