  "title": "Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present",
  "description": "A landmark collection of writings that define the intellectual and political underpinnings of contemporary feminism, from Simone de Beauvoir to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In this important volume, the respected feminist historian Miriam Schneir completes the work she began in her bestselling The Essential Historical Writings , presenting contemporary writings that define the women's movement todayâ€”and revealing how radically transformative a force it is throughout the world.Here are the words of Doris Lessing, Betty Friedan, Germaine Greer, Anita Hill, and many other important feminist figures. Ranging from intensely personal statements to ringing manifestos, from diagnosis to outright rebellion, and incorporating both public records and works addressing such specific issues as religion, rape, women's health, pornography, and the concerns of lesbians and women of color, Feminism in Our Time is a thorough record of women's ongoing struggle to control their own destinies and provide alternative visions of a just society and true human equality.",
