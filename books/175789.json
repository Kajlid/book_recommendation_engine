  "description": "Olivia Gregory, whom we met in the The Fine Line, the first book of the Between World’s series, is all grown up, and despite her stable upbringing, makes life choices that lead her down a very destructive path. Attempting to run from the horrors of her past, these choices lead her far away from her family and the safety of Pikeview Manor. After a near death experience, Olivia is forced to look through the glass darkly and her life takes another dramatic turn. Influenced by a special companion, Olivia becomes a cop in the K-9 division. One fateful April afternoon, she stumbles upon the hanging body of a murdered young girl—one of a soon to be long list of victims of the Tic-Tac-Toe killer. Along with her smoking hot partner, Daniel Knight and Dr. Lauren Harris-Bennette, a nationally respected forensic psychologist and the key crime solver in The Phantom murders, Olivia is drawn into a case that could cost her everything.",
