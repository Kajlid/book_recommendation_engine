  "title": "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte",
  "description": "\"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\" is one of Karl Marx' most profound and most brilliant monographs. It may be considered the best work extant on the philosophy of history. On the 18th Brumaire (Nov. 9th), the post-revolutionary development of affairs in France enabled the first Napoleon to take a step that led with inevitable certainty to the imperial throne. The circumstance that fifty and odd years later similar events aided his nephew, Louis Bonaparte, to take a similar step with a similar result, gives the name to this work-\"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.\"",
