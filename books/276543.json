  "description": "Invading the north with a flotilla of twelve war canoes and numerous auxiliaries, Tattooed Serpent did so confidently, with great vigor and expectation. However, it had been Ahal who encountered the mysterious northern barbarians first. Surprised by the raiding party that did not expect to run into forces stationed at the mouth of the Northern River, Ahal conducted a fierce if brief battle, which helped to enhance his worth in the eyes of his royal leader, as well as to heighten the jealousy of his equal in command, the shifty Taotal. However, the leader of the invaders managed to escape the battle unscathed and the consequences of this first clash appeared to be more far-reaching than Ahal or even Tattooed Serpent himself could have foreseen or foretold.",
