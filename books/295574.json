  "description": "Maureen and Wendy are sisters, and just like all sisters, they have their moments when they get along and other moments when they are like oil and water, which is a lot of fun to witness. Little sister Maureen has a new mission in to find a real life four leaf clover. Maureen has also taken up a new habit of fibbing. When she tells everyone about her fake cousin from Canada who lives in a castle and her other fake cousin who works with pop sensation Joy’D, her fictional family reunion becomes more than the young girl can manage, much to her older sister Wendy’s enjoyment. While Maureen struggles to try her luck with her lie, Wendy has some major drama in her relationship with Max. These sisters are going to need all the luck they can get!",
