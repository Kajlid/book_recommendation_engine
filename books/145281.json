Forensic evidence from Arthur's home is found all over the scene of the crime, and it looks like the fate of Lincoln's relative is sealed.At the behest of Arthur's wife, Judy, Lincoln grudgingly agrees to investigate the case. Soon Lincoln and Amelia uncover a string of similar murders and rapes with perpetrators claiming innocence and ignorance - despite ironclad evidence at the scenes of the crimes. Rhyme's team realizes this \"perfect\" evidence may actually be the result of masterful identity theft and manipulation.An information service company - the huge data miner Strategic Systems Datacorp - seems to have all the answers but is reluctant to help the police. Still, Rhyme and Sachs, along with their assembled team begin uncovering a chilling pattern of vicious crimes and coverups, leading their investigation to point at one master criminal, whom they dub \"522\".When \"522\" learns the identities of the crime-fighting team, the hunters become the hunted.
