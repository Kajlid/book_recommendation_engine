  "description": "Everyone deserves a second chance, right? Cole Saxon wasn’t so sure of that. He’d burned so many bridges, he wasn’t sure anything he could do would be enough to make amends. Then fate brings him to Haven. To the brother he’d disowned and to the only two people to ever have a hold on his cold, black heart. Keira and Julian have been through hell. The road to recovery is rocky, filled with Julian’s paranoia and overprotectiveness, and Keira’s nightmares and panic attacks. When it’s suggested they could use help in the form of a Dom. One to help guide and shelter them, fate brings them Cole. . . Well, fate can just kiss their ass because he is the one man they will never trust again.  MMF, contains a hot, alpha Dom looking to atone and two subs in search of safety and happiness.",
