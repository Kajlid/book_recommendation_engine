  "description": "VioletIt's best to leave the past behind.Ramsey's family is local royalty. Basically the Kennedys around here. And he doesn't have a problem using his money and connections to work the system.It's the reason he and I didn't work out, years ago.Then I make a mistake--I let a night of fun and relived memories lead to inviting him and his best friend-slash-campaign manager into my bed. With their smoldering looks and magic fingers, it's a mistake I'm tempted to repeat.But I need to remember the people they are behind closed doors donâ€™t mesh with their public faces. Because in Ramsey and Hunter's world, appearance is everything, even if hearts get stomped on in the process.",
