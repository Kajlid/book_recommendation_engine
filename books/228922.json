  "description": "NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon!Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling, award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. SPEED is Harley's book--a gritty, '90s-era love triangle overflowing with dark humor, intense heat, and tangible teen angst. It is based on a true story.Ronald “Knight” McKnight was Obsessive. Possessive. Downright psychopathic. But that didn’t stop me from falling in love with him…or falling apart when he joined the Marines. When he left, Knight told me to “find someone better,” but I didn’t. I found Harley instead. Harley James was a fun, flirty, tattooed mechanic whose face was as angelic as his secrets were sinful. He taught me how to live again. How to laugh again. But would he teach me how to love again? Over Knight’s dead body.\n*SPEED is Book 2 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone.",
