She’d rather spend weekends kicking a soccer ball or antagonizing Noah, the cute son of a famous pastry chef–not doing the Electric Slide.Then Abby’s barely legal sister, Carol, does the unthinkable–she announces she’s getting married and wants Abby to be her maid of honor. Clearly, Carol has lost her mind! Will Abby soon lose hers?So what if Carol turns into Bridezilla? So what if the dresses are hideous? So what if the invitations get messed up? So what if Noah looks extra hot with frosting in his hair? Abby can handle it. After all, it’s just one day. Right?",
