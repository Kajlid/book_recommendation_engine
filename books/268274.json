  "description": "Of Bitter Herbs and Sweet Confections is a fictionalized memoir, which tells the moving story of Tanya, a Jewish teenager forced to flee her Polish hometown in order to escape the Nazis. Tanya's sweeping odyssey of changing fortunes, taking her across thousands of kilometers far away from the death camps of Europe, is both heartrending and heartwarming. This inspiring story of survival, resilience and optimism in the face of adversity, based on true events, is a Holocaust novel with a difference, which opens a unique window onto a lesser-known facet of this horrific chapter in history.",
