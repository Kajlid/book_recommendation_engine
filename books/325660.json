  "description": "Let's take a trip. Close your eyes, now imagine every feeling you've ever had on paper. This book is the culmination of those feelings for one person, a mosiac of ups and downs, life and love, loss and redemption. The beautiful thing about poetry is that the author's interpretation can mean something entirely different to a reader. Maybe that's why you need this book. Let it heal you, inspire you, or relate feelings you didn't know you had. That is the purpose, after all.",
