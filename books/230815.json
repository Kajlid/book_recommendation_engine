  "description": "Let the People Hymn Tunes in Perspective by Paul Westermeyer Paul Westermeyer's new book, Let the People Hymn Tunes in Perspective, is a comprehensive study of the hymn tune, its history, and its effect on Christian congregations everywhere. The hymn tune, though seemingly simple and unimportant in the scheme of things, symbolizes far more in a Christian's life than they realize; hymn tunes touch our hearts and accompany some of our most important life moments. While Let the People Sing gives detailed information about hymn tunes and their origins, its main emphasis lies with the assembly and its ability to sing and fully experience the depth and breadth of congregational song.",
