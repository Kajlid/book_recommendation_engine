  "description": "I didn’t mean to walk in on Will, my nerdy best friend, naked and pleasuring himself. But ever since I saw what the Clark Kent lookalike was hiding under his Superman T-shirts and Star Wars pyjamas, I’ve been unable to stop thinking about his…lightsaber. Yes, touching him would be great, finding out what he tastes like, amazing, but our friendship means too much to risk. After suffering a devastating loss, I lost myself. Will found me, held me, made me believe I could carry on. Volunteering at a sexual health clinic gave me purpose and a new focus to make a porn film that would take out the smut and replace it with love, realism and the message of safe, consensual sex. But to do that, I need Will again…as a photographer who can adapt his skills to filming porn…And definitely NOT for sexy sexcapades…So, I’ll stick to the banter with an edge of snark we do so well, project my sexual tension into the scene I’m directing, ignore his magnificent ass as he films the pop shot, and keep pretending that my best friend doesn’t make me want to risk it all.I didn’t mean to walk in on Will, naked and pleasuring himself. The same way I didn’t mean to fall in love on a porn set.",
