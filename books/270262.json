  "description": "Love is blind? This starlet doesn't believe it. Then again...she's never been starstruck.\n\nAs a child star turned teenage diva, Avery has played a lot of roles in her lifetime. Not one of them was as difficult as pretending to be an ordinary girl at a normal high school. Well, relatively normal. Trudale is a boarding school for the arts, catering to the elite. But even in a school overflowing with celebrities and children of celebrities, Avery is an anomaly. She's a superstar, a bona fide supernova in their midst. So untouchable she's never even had a date. Her lonely nights are spent listening to her favorite voice actor bring her beloved books to life. But when it turns out that the audiobook narrator she's been crushing on attends the same school, it's clear this is kismet...or a cruel joke. As Trudale's token scholarship kid, Seth's as jaded as they come. Being paired up with the new girl who represents everything he hates about this world is basically torture. Except that the more he gets to know Avery, the more he realizes that there's more to her than meets the eye. And maybe, just maybe, he can let her in on his secret. He's the guy behind the voice she's been crushing on, not his roommate. But trusting Avery means putting his faith in something he doesn't quite understand. One thing's clear, either this is true love or Cupid's got a sick sense of humor.",
