All Anthony can hope for now is that Daniel is kind and they can someday be happy together, his life no longer being his own.That is until a pink-haired, golden-eyed Dom named Noah breaks into Daniel’s home while he is away, only to find Anthony there. Noah doesn’t seem that bad of a guy, all things considered, and he is a Dom to boot. On a whim and in an attempt to take control of his life, Anthony demands one thing from Noah:“Steal me.”",
