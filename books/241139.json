  "description": "Soon after arriving in Paris in 1963, Nfudu launches a heart-rending secret affair with her best friend’s wealthy and attractive father—Javier. When she meets Ikechi—a striking financier, in London, Nfudu’s bond with Javier is tested. Ikechi seems like the perfect match, but a grim revelation about his ‘caste’ forces Nfudu to defend her honor. Torn between her insatiable love for Javier and her burning desire for Ikechi, Nfudu takes matters into her own hands. Her actions send her down a slippery slope that threatens not only her own existence but also that of those closest to her.Suspenseful and riveting, Nfudu is the story of a young woman during one of the most perilous times in history. It intricately weaves plots of love, war, crime, hatred, ancient taboos, and a clash of civilizations, then merges these into one powerful story.",
