  "description": "Ink and sawdust meets brisket and moxie.I’m a tattooed casualty.A charmer, a fraud, a skeptic, and a carpenter.My name is Tse.I’m cocky enough to believe my own lies, but too oblivious to see the truth is already out there.I’m a cautious perfectionist.A sister, a scrapper, a dreamer, and a workhorse.My name is Sophia.I’m capable enough to plan ahead, yet too powerless to avoid getting blindsided.We’re complete opposites—one who plays it safe, the other a thrill-seeker—but when old sins resurface bringing violence to the present, our path forward becomes clear.",
