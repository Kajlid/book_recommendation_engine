  "description": "THIS BOOK HAS RECENTLY BEEN REVISED AND REWRITTEN AS 'UNGRACEFUL' WHICH IS THE FIRST BOOK IN THE SERIES. Stella has a secret. A gi-normic bombshell that she herself has only just discovered. A few short months ago, this would have been the thing she dreamed about, a revelation that changed everything she knew to be true. Taken her out of her normal, mundane life and popped her into a cool supernatural comic book fantasy. Things should have been golden right? Uh nope. Not even close.Between graduation, an upcoming move to New York and getting intermittently wooed by beautiful Asher Grey (when he wasn’t having a neurotic episode), Stella felt she was finally snapping her life into place. Getting her crap together. Moving onwards and upwards.Until she wasn’t. Until she found out what her Mother really was. Until her body started to change into someone she barely recognized. Until she started losing her mind and ruining every relationship she’s ever had. I suppose it isn’t everyday you’re told ‘By the by, you’re a freaky demon - a supernatural wonder with powers that will ruin your life. Good on you!’ Yup it was one of THOSE secrets",
