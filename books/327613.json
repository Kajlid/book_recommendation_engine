  "description": "From Here to Maternity, Sin√©ad Moriarty's third novel, is the story tells the story of Emma Hamilton who embarks on the path to adopting a baby when she and her husband can't conceive. It manages to be both hilarious and incredibly moving and is comparable to the writing of Marian Keyes in its ability to balance light and shade in a heart-warming, thoughtful and satisfying story. Just as Emma Hamilton and her husband James become parents of an eight-month-old Russian baby, Yuri, they find out that Emma is pregnant. Which is a bit of a shock since they had come to terms with not being able to have children. Emma discovers that having her dreams come true brings a whole new set of problems as she is faced with well-meaning friends and family - and not-so-well-meaning maternity Nazis - telling her how to be a mother. Only her wonderful calm long-suffering husband, a mad family that makes her look like the down-to-earth sensible one, and fantastic friends whose lives are even crazier than her own, keep Emma from losing it, and in the end she comes through with her usual mix of humour, good-natured hysteria and real heart.",
