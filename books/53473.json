  "description": "Inspired by the authors’ real lives, this picture book shares what sound means for one young deaf boy as he experiences the world with cochlear implants.Most people either can or cannot hear sound . . . but some people can do both! Meet a deaf boy with cochlear implants as he moves about his day. Sometimes he prefers not to hear, but when he wants to connect with the hearing world, he puts on his cochlear implants. How could he explain to his hearing parents what the absence of sound is like? Suddenly he has an idea—the best way he knows how to share this part of him with those he loves. With whimsical, bright illustrations and lyrical words, Sound Switch Wonder is a sweet and gentle story about sharing and embracing differences.",
