  "description": "Have you ever wanted something so badly it consumes you? There is a fine line between needs and wants. Deke Gavelson has wanted his Ravage cut for as long as he can remember. He’s earned it. He was born to be in this club. He’s not afraid to fight for his place, either. Then she barreled into his world, and Deke suddenly desires something more than his rag and winning the next round. Rylie Hollister has lived through hell and back. Each event makes her the strong, independent woman she is today. Until a bitter underground fighter threatens to turn her plans upside down. These two are bound by their desires, but oh, how that changes when his intensity meets her passion. ** Bound by Desire (Ravage MC Bound Series #2) is a standalone full-length novel. You do not have to read the Bound by Family or the Ravage MC series to follow this book, but if you’d like to see the whole picture, you really should. **",
