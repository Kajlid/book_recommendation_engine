  "description": "Welcome to the Discrworld, where the gods are not so much worshipped as blamed!Terry Pratchett is the world's bestselling writer of comic fantasy. This is the first ever fully-illustrated version of the original Discworld novel.Rincewind the \"Wizzard\" lives in the city of fair Ankh-Morpork, a metropolis placed atop the Discworld, a flat earth being carried through space on the backs of four giant elephants, who in turn rest on the back of an even more gigantic celestial turtle, the Great A'Tuin.

As one of the few people able to communicate with Twoflower in a language the tourist understands, the extremely reluctant Rincewind finds himself forced to become Twoflower's guide by Ankh-Morpork's ruler, the Patrician, who fears the Agatean Emperor's wrath should something untoward befall a citizen of that empire within the bounds of crime-ridden Ankh-Morpork. Unfortunately for the city, Twoflower works in \"inn sewers ants\", and once he explains the concept of people agreeing to pay out if you make a bet with them that your business won't burn down, he inspires the first attempt at insurance fraud on the Disc.As a result, the unlikely companions are forced to flee the burning city, and venture into the wilds beyond. Out of the frying pan, and into the fire...",
