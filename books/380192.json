  "title": "In Deep Water: The Anatomy of a Disaster, the Fate of the Gulf, and How to End Our Oil Addiction",
  "description": "When Deepwater Horizon 's well blew out on April 20, 2010, the resulting explosion claimed eleven lives. Over the next two months, an estimated 200 million gallons of crude oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico, a haven of biodiversity and one of the world 's prime fishing grounds. The resultant oil slick covered 2,500 square miles, killing wildlife and menacing the coastline and many thousands of jobs from Texas to the Florida Keys, and beyond.How and why did this happen? Who was responsible? And what can be done to make sure such a devastating accident never happens again? \"In Deep Water\" answers these questions and more. Drawing on the work of the 400 scientists, activists, and researchers at the Natural Resources Defense Council, \"In Deep Water\" documents the environmental and human toll of this tragedy and underscores that our often wasteful over-reliance on oil comes at an ever-greater cost to us and to the planet we inhabit.",
