But, instead of mating and starting a family, Sky Wolfe drags her into the troubles that have kept him away these past eight years. Wolf’s Princess is the perfect ending to Maddy Barone’s amazing paranormal romance series, After the Crash.

When she refused his claim, Sky Wolfe left the den and moved to Omaha, intending to return when she turned eighteen to renew his courtship. Now, eight years later, in the final installment of the After the Crash series, Rose is an old maid with a pack of wolf shifters guarding her from other men. She wants a husband and children, and since Sky has ignored her all these years she decides to find a man to love on her own.  Sky has been busy in Omaha, where women are commodities, working to change the laws that oppress them. Victory is at his fingertips when he receives word his mate is husband shopping. Can he free Omaha’s women and woo his mate? Or will he have to choose between them? Read the breathtaking conclusion to this series, in which a group of plane crash survivors learn to live in a future that is nothing like their past.
