  "description": "Savior. Monster. A Time Wizard who will be the damnation of many... The world already suffers a bitter taste of hell on earth, in a World War II where Nazi warlock vampires battle with Gray Tower wizards in the streets of Europe and in the shadows. The Gray Tower, in its quest to stabilize a world that hangs on a delicate balance, has issued an order: Kill the Drifter. Isabella George, an alchemist trained by the Tower, knows the identity of the Drifter and refuses to go through with it, because it hits too close to home. Instead of executing the Drifter, she protects the Time Wizard at all costs and ensures that the power to control Time never falls into the wrong hands. She sets out to lift the severe decree of the Gray Tower, and prove to the Master Wizards that the Drifter is the only way to win the war. As Isabella unmasks traitors and embraces unlikely allies, her greatest danger may lie in her own heart--from the brutal desire for revenge, to the crushing guilt she carries...and the dangerous passion she tries to deny when sheâ€™s with one man in particular. As she attempts to sort things out both in her heart and head--and not mix up the two, a figure from her past comes along and makes an enticing offer to solve all her problems. The only payment required is her soul.",
