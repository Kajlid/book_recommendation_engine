  "description": "Having a positive outlook is a well-intentioned goal. Having a positive outlook is an obviously healthier alternative to having a negative perspective on life. We must understand, however, that “positivity” in and of itself cannot overcome or overturn some of the negativity that is generated outside of ourselves by individuals or by social constructs/values. We must learn how to navigate through a world in which our positivity may have little bearing on the negative attitudes and outlooks of individuals or the harshness and injustices of our society without allowing that reality to dampen our spirits. We must understand that, despite our desire to project a positive outlook and to interact and share that energy with others, many will not be accepting of or responsive to it. We must be careful not to feel thwarted by the unreceptiveness of others and to understand that we may only be able to counteract some of society’s ills in small, practical ways and to accept/understand that there will always be plenty of “ills” to contend with. We must not let these realities diminish our spirit and drive.The purpose of this book is to help the reader accept these realities and to maintain a positive focus despite them and to not overlook the benefit to others and to society that we can provide without “changing the world.”WRITING SPACE: Each quote has its own separate page so that you'll have room for reflection and space to write down your thoughts.",
