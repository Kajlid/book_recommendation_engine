  "description": "Simply stated, we need YOU! We need you to be who you are without the chains and lies that prevent you from becoming and living the gift you are to yourself and to the world. Be Well was designed to help you meet yourself, live your journey, and live with the best health and wellness you possibly can. Throughout this book, you and I will discuss basic information about the dimensions of well-being. We will consider Scripture and science in our search for some of the best practices in health and wellness, but our conversation will be easy to understand, easy to follow, and have ideas for practical use. Start your journey Today, building your E.M.P.I.R.E. of Health and Wellness so that all of you, not just pieces and parts, experiences the fullness of well-being.",
