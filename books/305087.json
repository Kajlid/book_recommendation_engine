I won’t let this failure break me.We have 72 hours to turn this around.72 hours to make a new plan out of the dregs of the old.72 hours until all hope is lost.This task is impossible, but I still like my chances. I have an ace in my pocket and his name is Mason Cain. He might not want to help me, but I don’t plan on giving him a choice in the matter.My name is Rosalie Oscura. And I refuse to let anything beat me.This series is set in the world of Solaria five years after Zodiac Academy and ten years after Dark Fae and book one was previously published as Darkmore Penitentiary. There is some character crossover but all series can be read independent of each other without spoilers. The female lead will end up with more than one love interest.",
