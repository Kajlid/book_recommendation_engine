  "title": "Think For Yourself: The Importance of Maintaining Individuality and Freedom of Thought",
  "description": "We live in a unique time in this world, a time when the information age has brought the world much closer together. With this sharing of information and resources comes great opportunity, but there are some drawbacks as well. Global standardization has, in many ways, contributed to the homogenization of numerous aspects of life. Individuality has been lost in many cases, and its continued decline comes at a heavy price for some. People's willingness to follow the crowd and fall in line behind \"the next greatest thing\" or \"popular thought trend\" has fostered this decline in individuality and free thinking. Mankind needs to embrace our individuality and our individual differences, as well as the similarities that come to light during the sharing of information in these modern \"global times.\" This book attempts to shed some light on the subject and encourages you to Think For Yourself in your daily navigation in today's global society.",
