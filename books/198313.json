  "description": "When the Langston sisters return home for their mother's funeral, it's not in grief, but in relief.  Though Mahalia Langston was known as a gospel music pioneer among the church community, her daughters knew her as someone else altogether.  The three women hope that, along with their mother, they can finally bury the secrets that plagued their childhood.  But that's no longer an option when tragedy strikes and the sisters are forced to deal with the past theyâ€™ve spent their whole lives trying to forget.  With the help of a praying woman, the sisters begin to think emotional healing is a real possibility. Until, that is, they learn their mother had one final secret.  A secret so earth shattering, only the grace of God will help them get through it.",
