  "title": "No Man's Land",
  "description": "Arriving in the Harz Mountains, within striking distance of the Iron Curtain, 'civilian' Brown appears to be enjoying a small vacation. Yet one night, he crosses into the Russian zone, claiming to be drawn to a site of Catholic pilgrimage. His cover is not quite convincing enough, however, and he finds himself arrested and interrogated. Refusing to confess the real reason behind his visit, he gains an unexpected ally, and the two of them embark upon a hazardous plan to complete his mission and return to the West. The result is a remarkable, psychologically charged exploration of fear and crossed frontiers.No Man's Land is a profoundly chilling tale of espionage, superstition and betrayal, which bears all the hallmarks of Greene's most famous works. Included in this volume is another rediscovered spy story, The Stranger's Hand, which in 1953 was turned into a film starring Trevor Howard and Alida Valli.'Hesperus has performed a valuable service in making widely available for the first time a reliable edition of these two little-known texts, written between The Heart of the Matter and The End of the Affair, when Greene was at the height of his powers as a novelist'.
