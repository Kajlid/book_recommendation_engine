  "description": "Ann Bridges weaves her vast Silicon Valley business experience into dynamic works of fiction, beginning with the Fall 2015 release of \nPrivate Offerings\n and its sequel, \nRare Mettle\n, in 2016. Her intimate knowledge of finance and operations at dynamic technology companies serves to build an authentic current running through this intelligent and sexy drama. Struggling public relations consultant Lynn Baker lands a much-needed contract with a dynamic technology firm in Silicon Valley, just in time to help launch its highly anticipated initial public offering. She soon finds herself drawn into a web of intrigue as competing interests from China begin a ruthless game of chess, each vying for the top-secret technology developed by the enigmatic company founder, Eric Coleman. The already-frenetic IPO schedule is disrupted by a vicious vortex of turmoil, including deep-rooted power plays from company insiders, each holding surprising secrets deliciously doled out by Ms. Bridges. \nPrivate Offerings\n is fast-paced, worldly and crisply written, stimulating the mind with its intelligent drama and raising the heat with the sultry chemistry that builds between the two main characters as they are drawn ever-closer to each other, and to the chance of a lifetime. Silicon Valley insiders are already hooked: \"Private Offerings flows at a breathless pace...\" offering \"nuanced characters with depth...captures the intensity of the Silicon Valley business world...a compelling read; hard to put down and a pleasure to get back into.\" The San Jose Mercury News calls it, \"a timely fictional page-turner...she can tell a story...\"",
