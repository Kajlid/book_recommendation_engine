  "title": "The Cheating of America: How Tax Avoidance and Evasion by the Super Rich Are Costing the Country Billions--and What You Can Do About It",
  "description": "Charles Lewis, Bill Allison, and a team of researchers from the Center for Public Integrity -- an organization that the National Journal called \"a watchdog in the corridors of power\" -- investigated how millions of high-income adults and some major corporations cheat the government of billions through tax avoidance (legal), tax evasion (illegal), or tax \"avoision\" (catch me if you can). Now Lewis and his team provide explosive revelations about who cheats and how they do it, from offshore banks to foreign \"tax havens.\" Case studies of the most brazen dodgers will have taxpayers seeing red in this eye-opening report that puts the IRS on notice. Sure to enlighten and outrage, The Cheating of America is a must -- read for every citizen.",
