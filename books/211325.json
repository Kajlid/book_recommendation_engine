  "description": "February, 1941 : German submarines are squeezing the vital maritime lifelines that allow Great Britain to stay in the war. In France, Otto Kretschmer, the top German submarine ace, is on leave but is suddenly recalled on duty by Admiral DÃ¶nitz, Commander of the German submarine arm, and given command of the prototype of a new class of diesel submarine, the U-800. Adding his tactical genius as a submarine commander to the fantastic capabilities of the U-800, Otto Kretschmer soon returns to sea, leaving a trail of sunken Allied ships behind him. He will also sow mayhem on American soil, thanks to a team of elite German Army soldiers embarked on his U-800. The ultimate goal of Otto Kretschmer: to force a quick end to the war and thus cut the loss of life on both sides.",
