  "description": "“It felt wonderful and exciting… I’ve never felt anything so beautiful in my life— and then it was terrible, like I would die!” Creatures stir among us, warm blooded, powerfully seductive, and capable of stealing the very essence of life with a single kiss. Daniela radiates energy they’ve never encountered: strong, powerful and highly prized by a Thief of Life. Once her unique energy comes to light, she’s pulled into an explosive fight for more than just her life. Two enemies feud for her heart, but must also work together to protect her against others of their kind or risk losing her forever. An emotional tale of wonder and jealousy, of yearning and the tearing of one's soul. In the end she could find the truest love or the ultimate betrayal.",
