Rich, connected, and powerful, my family had the means to survive the apocalypse, yet I seem to be the only Alcaraz left standing to protect my family's legacy and raise my niece. Every single day is a struggle, fighting zombies and internal monsters that threaten to tear me to pieces. When the only place we could possibly call home falls under attack, my men and I are thrown together with an attractive stranger and his quirky family. Despite everything my men were trained to do, itâ€™s one short, a-dork-able nerd named Benny who might be our salvation. He might be mine, as well.Benito We thought we could survive there, hiding in that little house. We were wrong. Four men rush into our lives just in time for everything to fall apart. Together we can fight our way to The Gamble where they've promised is space for my family and I. With my heart, and my family on the line, I entrust this stranger with everything that I hold dear. Hopefully he doesn't rip it out and eat it like the undead monsters walking the earth. The Gamble is a part of the Final Days MM romance multiauthor series. Each apocalyptic book can be read as a standalone, but there are more thrilling zombie tales to enjoy so why not grab them all?!",
