  "description": "Kate and Sam are off on another adventure - without even leaving their yard. Why are the horrible chipmunks plotting to dig a hole right into Kate and Sam's house? And what have they done to the brave worm who tries to investigate? Kate and Sam must rescue their friend and save the house, and to do so they'll have to snorkel along secret underground streams and find their way through the burrow of the Chipmunks of Doom. Luckily they have the help of old friends and new, including Nasturtium and the Fairy Godmother, as well as a pair of magic rabbits, a story-telling toad, fairies, genies, and more. And, as ever, Sam and Kate's creativity and kindness will help ensure that everything turns out happily ever after.",
