  "description": "My name is Rune and I recommend not falling in love with your would-be executioner. Of course, I don’t necessarily practice what I preach.I have to figure out why several orphans have been possessed by elementals and stop shifter criminals who want to destroy the city’s prison before it’s even built. But my worst problem is that Sash, equal parts beautiful and deadly, is immune to my goofy charm and appears determined to carry out her bloody assignment.I fear I’m going to find out how much love hurts.Fire Summoning is the second book in The Sentinels, a thrilling new urban fantasy series. Mixing mystery, magic, humor, and heart-pounding action, it's sure to delight fans of The Dresden Files and The Iron Druid Chronicles who may just find a new favorite hero in Rune Russell.",
