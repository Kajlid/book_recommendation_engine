  "description": "*This title is currently off of the market of and being recrafted. If you read the initial beta and are interested in the release, please let us know*Jonny Ballione is not your stereotypical young New Yorker. He’s smart, attractive, and owns half of Soho. He spends his days contemplating the world we live in from a park bench in the Theater District. Overall, life seems to be handing Jonny everything he ever wanted, until that fateful Monday when he first saw Emily Carroway. Jonny finds himself entranced by Emily’s piercing green eyes and she begins to haunt his every thought. She is everywhere he looks, everywhere he goes, and he continually finds himself drawn back to that park bench off of 47th street in hopes of finding her again. A chance meeting after a rough morning at work leads the two on a journey that neither will soon forget. While it sounds like a dream come true, all fairytales have their cracks. Jonny Ballione isn’t actually Jonny Ballione. Truthfully, he has no idea who he once was and after searching the world for over 470 years, he doesn’t want to be anyone else again. He just wants to be Jonny, enjoy his ritzy life with his “brother” Vinny, and stay madly in love with the girl who drives him crazy, Emily Carroway.There is only one major obstacle in Jonny’s way. Jonny is a grim reaper and touching Emily would mean her death. Can he win her over and not lose everything in the process?",
