  "description": "She bends all the right ways.  I'm a hunter, I shoot to kill. That's what the military taught me, and now I protect my brothers in the Bad Disciples MC. But when I meet Kylie, a physical therapist at the VA, I don't need protection. Ever. Her beautiful body curves in every direction, she knows how to stretch herself to meet my needs. Kylie has her own demons though, an ex with a tendency for hitting women. And there is no way in hell I'm gonna let that mother fucker put his hands on her again. Or her son Carter. I'll protect them both with my life. Because they're my family now.",
