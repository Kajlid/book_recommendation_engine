Reeva is as strong-willed as she is beautiful and she's not about to take orders-especially not from the stubborn warrior she nicknames \"Vandarsaurus Rex\" because of his refusal to adapt to new ideas. The heat of conflict erupts into blazing desire as they push the boundaries of their attraction. Will she succeed in taming him or will she find herself succumbing to his natural dominance?",
