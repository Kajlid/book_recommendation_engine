  "description": "Buildings, bridges, and books don't exist without the laborers who are often invisible in the final product, as this picture book reveals.All across this great big world, jobs are getting doneby many hands in many lands. It takes much more than ONE.This is an exploration of the many types of work that go into building our world--from the making of a bridge to a wind farm, an amusement park, and even the very picture book that you are reading. An architect may dream up the plans for a house, but someone has to actually work the saws and pound the nails. This book is a thank-you to the skilled women and men who work tirelessly to see our dreams brought to life.",
