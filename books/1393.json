  "description": "When a friend tells Jack about his favorite bar, Jack decides to go there alone to check it out. Jack has told no one his secret, but he goes to bars for one thing only. Jack has a thing for bears. The hairier the bear, the more Jack wants him. So far, Jack has been disappointed in the action at the local bars, with no bears in sight. When Jack enters this new bar that he knows nothing about, it appears to be one of the worst, a dark and dangerous bar, but he orders a beer and decides to stay, for awhile anyway. was finished with his second beer and starting on a third when he decided to call it a night. After canceling out his tab, he started to head for the door when the sight of a big hairy muscled bear entering the bar stopped him in his tracks. Jack stumbled backward, landing on a bar stool, and from there he sat and watched the man. What he was really watching was whether this bear had a mate with him tonight, not that it really mattered. He would be Jack’s soon enough if Jack had his way. ******“Bud, you think this little man deserves the full treatment?” So Bud was the bear’s name. Bud looked at Jack. “I think he does. You want two bears?” Jack just stood there and nodded. His cock was doing the talking for him. “Name’s Bull,” the man said, as he walked over to Jack and pulled him toward one of the stalls. “We’re doing it here?” Jack asked, surprised. “You expecting a five star hotel?” “No.” Jack’s fear was beginning to show and he desperately tried to hide it.",
