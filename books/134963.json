  "description": "A cheeky magical cat, a clued-up eight-year-old girl and a tail-swishing ride through the sights, sounds and flavours of France: the first release in a new childrenâ€™s travel ebook series, My Big, Fat Magical Cat Goes to France, brings much light-heartedness to the genre of travel book.  Follow the adventures of Jasmine and Lola as they visit Paris, Marseille, Toulouse, Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux and Nice, and learn about French cuisine, music, literature, art and architecture along the way.  Written in a light-hearted style that sees travel through the eyes of a child, the book is a first release from Sydney author, Jim Shanahan. Current travel photos and original illustrations, by Sydney-based graphic artist Jeffrey Oley, bring the story to life for younger readers.  The series is an initiative by independent publisher Perry Brown Publishing, and is aimed at children aged 6 to 12.",
