  "description": "Consider This Home is a mesmerizingly elegant, emotionally explosive novel that takes its readers deep into the dark center of the American home and family. Home proves elusive for Kathleen Miller and her young son, Daron. For six years they have lived in self-imposed exile in Las Vegas, when Kath is unexpectedly called back to Sterling to help repair her parents' broken marriage. In this small southern Utah town, she and Daron fall into a web of family frictions, strict and all-encompassing Mormon custom, and Kath's own tangled, secret history. Here, Kath first experienced love, sex, and desire with Tom, who ultimately came to accept his homosexuality - although it meant abandoning Daron, his unborn son. And here Kath married Merrill, a religious zealot whom she deserted, to her community's dismay. Now, while Daron forges new bonds of family and friendship, Kath must reinterpret her relationship with the man she once loved and confront the consequences of the marriage she had fled from. Her mission to Utah becomes more explosive than she imagined when her estranged husband's private talks with an Angel erupt into a violent crisis that irrevocably alters all these braided lives. Novelist Greg Bills makes his debut with a stunningly accomplished and sophisticated narrative that is a textured and multilayered exploration of family connections, duty and independence, faith and zeal, love and sacrifice, Heaven and Earth. This is not simply a portrayal of contemporary dysfunction, but rather the timeless story of the reinvention of love, life, family, and home - an effort required of each passing generation.",
