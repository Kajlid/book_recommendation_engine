  "description": "When Vic comes out of the psychiatric hospital his mother has moved the whole family away from his home town, where the end of his last relationship almost ended in tragedy. Vic, glad at being able to start anew, takes the chance to create a more low profile image that would make his last two years of high school a lot easier. His plan is go get through those two years and quickly move onto university. But that plan is sabotaged when his new best friend, Jack, kisses him on New Year's Eve, something Vic has been longing for and dreading in equal measure. Because Vic knows being gay in high school can be hell, and he's scared sweet and innocent Jack won't be able to handle him, or his past. It scares him more than anything now that his past has come back to haunt him, metaphorically and literally. Vic tries to hide the horror of his past as long as possible, knowing that when Jack finds out what happened he will leave him. As Vic takes a turn for the worse everybody but him realises how strong Jack, and his love for Vic, actually are. But is that enough for Vic to get better?",
