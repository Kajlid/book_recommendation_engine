Parker Elliot is going to Penmore State University miles away from home. She's leaving her small town because Penmore has a fantastic science department, because she needs to begin exploring the life she wants to lead and because Grayson Waters is the starting quarterback for the Penmore Herons. Grayson Waters at first glance lives life to the fullest, but he is dealing with more than meets the eye. A con artist father in trouble with local mobsters, an illegitimate brother living close by, the pressure of leading his team to the championship game and a desire to pursue a career outside the football field. Decisions need to be made. For Gray, slipping into the shadows with a pretty and observant brunette might be just what he needs to finally make the right ones.",
