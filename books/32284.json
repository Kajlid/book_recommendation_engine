  "description": "Dwight Johnson is a new medic with the 173d Airborne Brigade, and green as hell. Despite this, he becomes an instant hero during a sapper attack on his first night at the base camp. Oddly, when he awakens the next morning, he remembers neither the attack nor what he did to achieve such status. He soon discovers that whatever happened, it triggered a clairvoyant ability to not only feel the enemy's hostility but to use this ability to pinpoint their location and intentions.",
