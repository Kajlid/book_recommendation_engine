  "description": "When Caswel Esmar violates his sacred oath as an Alfaran Knight of Whiteleaf by exploiting powerless humans, the Council of Elders imposes a harsh punishment. Now he must live as one of these hapless mortals until he learns humility, self-control... and how to wear a bra.Caswel is transformed into a human high school girl for 50 moons. In this form, he must pass classes, overcome snotty seniors, and convince the Elders he's suffered enough by playing the martyr at every opportunity. Little does he realize that an old flame is stalking him, and hell hath no fury like an Alfaran sorceress scorned. When her jealous attacks result in another student being injured, Cass must reclaim the role of knight, this time in a pleated skirt instead of shining armor.",
