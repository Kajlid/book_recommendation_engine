  "description": "It is the Local Pastor who is given the Authority to Release God's Power! There are a number of keys to seeing the miraculous power of God manifest on a consistent basis. One of the least understood is the fact that healing is under the authority of the believer, God has already provided His healing power and placed it on the inside of every born-again believer. It is up to us to release it. Come Let us exalt his name together\" (Psalm 34:3). A man of great faith, Oscar Smith reads and studies the Word of God. He has served as a volunteer Chaplain in nursing homes, schools and prisons. He is trained as a Critical Incidence Stress Management Chaplain, and is a Licensed and Ordained Pastor; his mission focuses on Life Safety in the home.
