  "title": "The Real Deal",
  "description": "The most important thing in Amanda's life is negotiating a successful merger between her company and Brant Computers, a family-held competitor. Company president Eric Brant is on board with the idea, but when Amada arrives in Eric's office, it is his cousin Simon Brant who greets her—and Simon is anything but agreeable. Squaring off against the sexy, brilliant, sexy, obstinate, sexy, eccentric, not to mention sexy Simon is completely frustrating—and a total turn-on. Simon has never met a woman as driven as Amanda, or as devastatingly attractive. He can't decide if he wants to put her on the next plane home—in the cargo hold—or kidnap her and spend a long weekend showing her the kind of negotiating he likes best. But when intimacy leads to explosive passion, it might be time to think of a different, more permanent kind of merger...one that's less about business and all about pleasure.",
