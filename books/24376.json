  "title": "Prepare for the Worst and Pray for the Best: A Layman's guide to Surviving a Nation gone bad",
  "description": "When was the last time you have taken a few moments and paid close attention to what is going on in America? Have you noticed how fast this once great nation is fallen? When will the decline stop? We are going through the worst economic decline since \"The Great Depression\", the unemployment rate is the highest it has been in over twenty years, and the national deficit is at 14 trillion dollars and climbing every second. If none of this has affected you or someone in your family, how long will it be before it does? We are all only a crisis away from being included in the 3 million foreclosures (as of 2010), or the 15 million unemployed (as of 2010). Why is the federal government playing such a major role in our daily lives, when they can't seem to keep their own house in order? With the collapse of the economy and so many out of work, home invasions/robberies have skyrocketed. Are you prepared? I'm hoping that the information in this book can help you get prepared. If nothing else, open the eyes and minds of the millions that are totally oblivious to any of what I just mentioned.",
