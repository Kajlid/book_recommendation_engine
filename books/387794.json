  "description": "There are days when Lire Devon would kill to be conventional...Espresso at Peabody's. Lunch with friends. Quiet evenings at home with someone special... Sometimes she'd give anything to be that girl. But nothing is ever that simple when you're the most talented clairvoyant in Seattle.Now there's a murder, as baffling as it is horrifying, and the police want Lire to help them flush out the killer. Well at least some of them do. Detective Sgt. Vanelli seems a lot more interested in picking a fight than enlisting her aid.This first book in a delicious new contemporary fantasy series from Katherine Bayless is a fresh mix of mystery and romance with a heady dash of the supernatural.\"If you like urban fantasy, or paranormal fantasy, this is right up your alley. I may even have to go buy the paper version for my shelves at home, I enjoyed it that much. She is right up there with Laurell K. Hamilton...\" \"A hidden urban fantasy gem - amongst the best in 2010!\"\"This was a thick juicy steak: Woo Hoo!\"",
