  "title": "The Game",
  "description": "It started out like any other Tuesday.I spent twelve hours writing algorithms for one of the largest companies in the world and then came home to work on a pet project of mine—feeding facts about the men I knew into a formula to find my perfect match before my twenties came barreling to a close.But then a man knocked on my door and handed me some papers that turned my life upside down.Apparently, a father I never knew existed had left me something in his will. That something turned out to be part ownership in a professional football team.Next thing I knew, I was learning a sport I knew nothing about by spending time with the team’s quarterback who was out with an injury, a man who my formula would definitely determine was all wrong for me.Christian Knox was too handsome and confident for his own good and could have any woman he wanted. Only lately the only woman he seemed to want was me.But there was no way I was getting involved when I was now his boss, even if he was insanely gorgeous and had the dirtiest mouth I’d ever come across.It would be wrong, wouldn’t it?Probably. But you know what they say about things that are wrong...sometimes they feel so right.",
