  "description": "Epic in scope, Between the Shadow and the Flame is the allegorical retelling of the history of philosophy, as seen through the journey of its three main characters.When a pandemic and ensuing nuclear war all but destroy civilization, and conspiracy theorists whisper of a plot to wipe out humanity, armchair philosopher Sophia Xiao is caught up in a quest to find the truth. Shadowed by a mysterious figure, she travels across the devastated land with Newman, a former theology student, and Hyle, a snarky young science writer, as they evade paramilitary death squads, encounter pockets of survivors, and match wits with the charismatic cult leader who has prophesied her role in the coming battle at the end of days.This unique novel skillfully integrates a suspenseful mystery plot with a serious philosophical inquiry into the structure of reality and knowledge. Hunted, Sophia, Hyle and Newman search for clues about their pursuers and the cause of the war. As they travel, they tackle even larger issues. Drawing on their diverse backgrounds, they invoke the ideas of great philosophers, theologians and scientists as they debate age-old questions: Does God exist, or is the material world all there is? Can religion coexist with science? Do we have free will? Is certain knowledge possible? What is the structure of reality?A compelling examination of philosophyâ€™s role in the world, Between the Shadow and the Flame will challenge your beliefs and keep you turning pages until the full relevance of these questions is revealed in the provocative conclusion.",
