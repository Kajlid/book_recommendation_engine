  "description": "From the creators of Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear, Winner of the 2023 Carnegie Medal for Illustration, comes another beautifully illustrated graphic novel adventure based on a true story, in which young conservationist Chang rescues and rehabilitates an injured elephant.While volunteering at a wildlife rescue center near Yok Đôn National Park in Vietnam, Chang helps rescue an injured and abused Asian elephant named H’Non. For decades, H’Non was held in captivity, forced to haul heavy timber logs and concrete poles at construction sites, and then to carry riders at tourist attractions all day long with no respite. While nursing H’Non back to health, Chang is tasked with finding a kind mahout—an elephant trainer—who will teach H’Non how to fend for herself in the wild. Though Chang initially has her doubts about the young mahout she finds, a boy named Wat, H’Non takes to him instantly. As her friendships with both H’Non and Wat grow, Chang learns what it means to give people a chance, show up for your friends, and to love openly and forgive compassionately. Written by scientist and environmental activist Trang Nguyễn, with breathtaking, award-winning artwork from Jeet Zdũng, Chang’s daring, inspiring story is for young readers, animal lovers, and intrepid explorers who are ready for adventure!",
