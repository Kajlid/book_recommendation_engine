  "description": "Can one man have too many fembots? Can he ever have enough? As Jake's inventory of robotic women grows, so too do his worries, what with fears of discovery (from within and without), concerns about programming conflicts and breakdowns, not to mention the very real possibility of getting a broken back from too much sex. It's enough to drive an evil genius crazy.A NOTE TO POTENTIAL second edition ebook is DRM-free, and has been tested using Amazon's emulation software for the Kindle Fire, Kindle, the DX, and the iPad. They all look fine, but if there are problems please let me know and I will fix them. Thanks.",
