His continuing to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations in his pursuit of the ultimate cup of coffee. From across the Universe, Ziltor comes to Earth, after hearing a heavy metal album on Space YouTube about the sacred bean. After a thorough sampling he finds the coffee is not nearly good enough and decides to give up. Yet, to his horror he forgot where he had parked. Desperate to escape the planet he joins the Earth’s space program and eventually finds himself employed on the S.S. 7D Condemned as the science officer. Here he serves beneath a narcissistic drunken slob of a captain and alongside a diverse crew composed of a psychopathic doctor, a closet brony, an engineer that scored zero on all his exams, a horde of blood thirsty Vikings and a redshirt that just doesn’t seem to be capable of dying like he is supposed to. Together, they search the stars, looking to find meaning in their empty and pathetic lives. But Ziltor wants his coffee and he is willing to sacrifice anything in order to find it.",
