  "description": "Love is the hardest limit.\n\"I'm an Aries. We don't submit.\" \"I'm a Leo. Wanna bet?\"Destiny Blake senses that her boredom with blond pretty boys is about to come to a flesh-tingling end. Since her first love left her for a more experienced Domme, she's honed her topping skills to a fine edge. Yet the idea of bottoming for the hard-bodied owner of her favorite BDSM club is an erotic challenge she can't resist.Destiny isn't Johnny Delcorral's type. Tangling with her, even for one night, is a dangerous proposition for a man with good reason for needing his women submissive. But he suspects she's hiding a submissive streak under her dreadlocks and leather, and he hungers to make her obey-and curb her reckless spirit.The battle is on, both in the bedroom and out. Under Johnny's knowing hands, she is dismayed to discover she's enjoying submission more than she cares to admit. And Johnny finds himself relishing her defiance instead of curbing it-and fighting a growing unease with his inability to find her boundaries.Until one night he pushes one step too far-and comes hard up against the one boundary he never expected to find.Warning: This book contains naked power struggles, sexually charged spankings, kink from chains to canes, an Upstairs sex club, a hot m/f/m menage, and absolutely everything the title promises.",
