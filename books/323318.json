They destroy my life with one decree: Kora Sinclair doesn’t exist.Sterling Falls was my chance to start over, but one night derails everything.My scholarship, my job – gone.I could run home, but giving up my dreams isn’t an option.Desperate times call for desperate measures.When I can’t repay my debt to an unforgiving man, he gives me a choice. I can steal Hades’ mask, or he can take what I owe from my flesh.But if I do this, there’s no turning back. More than the fear of his threats, revenge drives my decision. I need to steal the mask.After all, who better to become a thief than the girl they tried to erase?THIEF is a full-length, mature college/new adult romance with dark themes. This is a reverse harem, #whychoose novel, meaning the main character has more than one love interest. This is book one of four in the series.",
