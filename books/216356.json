  "description": "My name is Eden, and I am the villain of my story. I love to play games, and I always win. I’d been preparing for the most important game of my life for a very long time. Nothing was going to stop me… until I brought Ryan Banks into it. He was that boy you’re not supposed to trust, but you do, anyway. That boy you’re not supposed to follow, but you do, anyway. That boy you are definitely not supposed to dance with, but you do, anyway. I knew he was trouble, but he was the means to the end I’d dreamed of, all my life. He took my heart, and I ruined him, just like I always knew I would. But nothing could have prepared me for the real ending of my story, because villains don’t get saved, do they? Turns out they do, when they have four completely crazy, amazing best friends to fight for them.",
