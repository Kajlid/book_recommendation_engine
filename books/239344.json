  "description": "Goodreads Choice Award winning poet Trista Mateer \"expertly exposes the intensity of first love\" in this emotional collection of sapphic poetry.\"I still remember you /  as a little girl /  who overwaters plants /  because she doesn't know /  when to stop giving.\"Mateer's  Honeybee  is part poetic memoir and part manual for letting go. Each poem, bittersweet on its own, weaves together to tell a heart-wrenching tale about heartbreak and identity. Following an imperfect love story between best friends all the way to its messy end, this collection is a reminder that you are not defined by the people you walk away from or the people who walk away from you.\"It would be a shame /  to look back on this /  and (out of bitterness) /  not call it love.\"",
