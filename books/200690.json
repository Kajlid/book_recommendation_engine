  "description": "From the acclaimed author of Bad Girls comes a “dark, break-neck paced journey through wartime England, full of twists and turns you’ll never see coming” (Christopher Golden, author of Soulless ) as a teenage girl discovers that evil comes in many forms when she and a group of friends run away from boarding school in this stunning novel of suspense and survival.Maggie Leigh just wants to be a normal teenager, but when German bombs tear apart London during World War II, her ultra-religious mother sees the destruction as divine punishment. She sends Maggie to a remote boarding school in coastal Wales, supposedly to keep her safe, but also to keep her in line. The school is creepy, the headmistress is a lunatic, and the students range from spoiled rich girls to speechless trauma victims. But when a tragic accident happens on the beach, Maggie and three friends are forced to flee the school, plunging into the nightmarish world of Europe during wartime. Now every decision Maggie makes is fraught with danger, and living to see another day depends on how quickly she can think and act...and how far she's willing to go.",
