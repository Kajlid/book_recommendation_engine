  "description": "When Kate finds the name of a princess abandoned by a river, she promptly throws her own name away and assumes a new identity as the carefree Chiti Lita. But far from being treated as a princess, Chiti Lita is kidnapped by a miserable bear and taken to the Garden of Black and White, a mysterious place where the grass is grey and the flowers are painted by a band of talking goats.For as long as anyone in the Garden can remember, a deadly war has been waging between the wonderful Darlin De Vurthoope and the elusive Man in the Moon. A tower reaching to the moon is under construction and Darlin vows that as soon as the war is won they will all live as kings and queens.Captivated by Darlin’s promises, Chiti Lita renounces her old life in favour of a new one in the Garden. She is initiated into the brotherhood of goats and quickly becomes friends with the merry Lucky, simple Lonan and melancholy Noble who is pretty sure he hasn’t always been a goat.Life in the Garden is simple until Chiti Lita discovers something awful in Darlin’s throne room, and further trouble comes when the real princess arrives looking for her name.",
