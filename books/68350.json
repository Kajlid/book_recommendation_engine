  "title": "Power and the Idealists: Or, the Passion of Joschka Fischer and Its Aftermath",
  "description": "The student uprisings of 1968 erupted not only in America but also across Europe, expressing a distinct generational attitude about politics, the corrupt nature of democratic capitalism, and the evil of military interventions. Yet, thirty-five years later, many in that radical generation had come into conventional positions of power: among them Bill Clinton (who reportedly stayed up all night reading this book) and Joschka Fischer, foreign minister of Germany. During a 1970s street protest, Fischer was photographed beating a cop to the ground; during the 1990s, he was supporting Clinton in a NATO-led military intervention in the Balkans.Here Paul Berman, \"one of America's best exponents of recent intellectual history\" (The Economist), masterfully traces the intellectual and moral evolution of an impassioned generationâ€”and gives an acute analysis of what it means to go to war in the name of democracy and human rights.",
