  "description": "Synthia will do anything for her daughter - even murder. 1871, high-society Savannah, Georgia. Penniless and jaded governess, Synthia James, is trapped with her employer, a man she once loved but now despises. His obsession with money and stature has corrupted them both. When he bids their young housemaid to kill a man who threatens his business, Synthia’s maternal instincts take over, and she commits the heinous deed herself. Now there’s another business enemy... and her former beau wants him dead. But the new cotton farmer has revived Synthia’s long-forgotten passions. With blood on her hands already, Synthia is prepared to kill again. But who? The new business partner for her daughter’s sake, or her greedy lover for morality and freedom?",
