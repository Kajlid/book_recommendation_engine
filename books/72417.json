  "description": "This book, by Fikile Magubane, a mother of four and a Nursing Educator, who has an honours degree in Social Science, tells the story of how she was called out one night to help the mother of a youth who, in a fit of rage, had smashed her car and was threatening to kill her and himself.In her own words, \"I dashed out like a fire-fighter to put out fires in another's house, not knowing that my own home was on fire.\" On returning in the early hours of the morning from the police station and hospital she discovered her own teenage son--hanging.This book is a product of her intense grief and self doubt that led her on a journey of research to try and answer the questions. \"Why?\" and \"What are the life-saving signs that I missed?\" The journey has brought her to a place where, through sharing what she has experienced and what she now knows, she feels she can perhaps make her son's death \"a sacrifice to save others from the monster.\"Research indicates that the prevalence of suicide is on the rise, especially amongst teenagers. Fikile not only shares her experience with the reader in a starkly courageous and honest light, but also generously gives of the knowledge that she has gained from her bitter experience.",
