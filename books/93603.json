  "description": "When Dan put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger, he thought it would all be over, but he soon learns that in death, just like in life, you don't always get what you want. As he watches the consequences of his suicide he meets Tar, a benevolent spirit who tries to help him let go of his life on Earth and move on to 'real Heaven'. A dark, tormented spirit is drawn to Dan's fiancée, Anne, as she struggles with her grief and guilt, becoming her constant companion. Dan hopes that with Tar's help, he can find a way to save Anne and her three-year-old daughter from the shadowy spirit. However, things aren't always what they seem with spirits, and Dan begins to wonder who it truly haunts.All proceeds donated to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:1-800-273-8255 www.suicidepreventionlifeline.orgLetting Go is like ‘The Five People You Meet in Heaven’ told from both sides of Heaven, ‘The Lovely Bones’ meets ‘A Grief Observed’. It’s a character-driven narrative exploration of grief, mental illness, suicide, regret, and letting go of things that cannot be changed. An emotion fueled drama which will make you cry, and sometimes laugh (or at least chuckle on the inside).This story will touch the heart of all those who have struggled with forgiveness and letting go of things that cannot be changed. It will also provide comfort to the victims of suicide, who often suffer silently with their guilt and shame, and to anyone who has experienced profound grief, or depression. It is the author’s hope that this book will save lives by giving pause to someone who is contemplating suicide, if only long enough for them to reach out for the help they need.",
