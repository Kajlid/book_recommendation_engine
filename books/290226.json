  "description": "Welcome to Eden, a quaint town lost within crop fields in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Here, everything and nothing is what it seems. Behind the peaceful elegance of small town charm lies a field of hidden skeletons, but Eden's skeletons kneel before two lords of sexual depravity and deliverance. But when the skeletons shake free from their closets, there shall be penance to pay on a biblical scale. Please enjoy your stay.",
