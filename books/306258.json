  "description": "What if you had to live in fear? What if one encounter with the wrong stranger could result in your body being made into a nice, fuzzy pair of transforming moccasins? And what if you had an incurable medical condition, that caused you unbearable pain every time you tried to change forms? My name is Chase, I'm a 16-year-old shapeshifter, and that would be my life. Well minus the inconsistent homes, abusive adults, and friends that share (some) of my same circumstances. This is the story of how we ran away, how I ended up where I am, and everyone who's to blame.",
