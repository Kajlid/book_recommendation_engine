  "title": "How to Talk to a Widower",
  "description": "Doug Parker is a widower at age twenty-nine, and in his quiet town, that makes him the object of sympathy, curiosity, and in some cases unbridled desire. But Doug has more urgent things on his mind, such as his sixteen year-old stepson, Russ, a once-sweet kid who now is getting into increasingly serious trouble. As Doug starts dipping his toes into the shark-infested waters of the second-time around dating scene, it isn't long before his new life is spinning hopelessly out of control, cutting a harrowing and often hilarious swath of sexual missteps and escalating chaos across the suburban landscape.",
