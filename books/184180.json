At the brink of disgrace and expulsion from his order, the young monk is championed by a powerful cardinal who has plans for him. Blacktooth sets out on a journey across a landscape still scarred by the long-ago Flame Deluge, a land divided by nature, politics, and war. He will find horrors and wonders, sins of the flesh ... and love. As he encounters and reencounters a beautiful but forbidden mutant named Ã†drea, he begins to wonder: is a she-devil, the Holy Mother, or the Wild Horse Woman herself?",
