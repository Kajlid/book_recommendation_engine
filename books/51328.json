  "title": "Evolution and the Doctrine of the Trinity",
  "description": "First published in 1918, this book constitutes a restatement of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity from an evolutionary standpoint. Implicit in this aim is the requirement that the truth of a doctrine is not essentially attached to the terminology in which it is expressed, so that the key idea survives as the original terminology becomes archaic. The bulk of the text is devoted to various aspects of the human personality, taking into account modern discoveries but always assuming the prior existence of a spiritual environment in which God is regarded as 'the Ground of Reality'. The final chapter draws together these aspects in a unified analysis of the relationship between humanity and transcendence. This book will be of value to anyone with an interest in evolution and the development of theology.",
