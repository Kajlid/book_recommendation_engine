  "description": "A magician in need of redemption. A loyal hero on a quest. And only one bed at the inn. Once the world’s most legendary sorcerer, Lorre fled the Middle Lands after his own curiosity -- and a misguided transformation spell -- turned him into a dragon and nearly killed a king. He isn’t a dragon anymore, but he is hiding alone on a tropical island, avoiding people, politics, and his own reputation. But now a hero has found him. And not just any hero. Prince Gareth’s full of patience, intelligence, a kind heart ... and unfairly attractive muscles. And he needs Lorre’s help: his tiny mountain kingdom is under attack from ice magic, and Gareth hopes the world’s last great magician will save his people. Lorre is done with quests and princes and trying to change the world. But Gareth might tempt him to believe again ... in heroes, in himself, and in magic.",
