Her friend Karen calls Allie a liar and doesn't want to hear \"stuff like that.\" But her old pal, Dub, listens eagerly as Allie tells him about the voice that guides her down a steep cliff side, the girl she imagines who begs, \"Help me,\" and a terrible nightmare in which that girl falls to her death.
