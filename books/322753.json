  "description": "When Ethan Barlow was eighteen his world imploded. The father he loved became a stranger who kept secrets and the mother he thought he could rely on was suddenly too caught up in her own interests to be of any help. Instead of sticking around for the rest of the fall out, Ethan left without a backward glance.Monroe Laurier knew she was a cliche: the small town girl who dreamed of marrying her high school sweetheart and living happily ever after. She didn’t care. Ethan was her future…until he wasn’t. She didn’t know what hurt more, the fact that he left without an explanation or that he took her best friend Zoey with him.Eight years later when tragedy strikes, Ethan is forced to return to the small town he left behind. He knew it wouldn’t be easy, facing the past never is, but he didn’t expect the hurt to still be so fresh…or for old feelings to resurface. Starting with Monroe. For years he told himself she was just a high school flame that would have eventually burned out. He was wrong, the way he felt about her hadn’t diminished time, if anything it was more intense.Can he pick up the broken pieces of the past and build a future? Or has his shot at a second chance come and gone?",
