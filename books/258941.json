  "description": "LOVE FALLS 'Love Falls\" captures the delicious uncertainty and electrifying beginnings of first love' It is July, three months after Lora's seventeenth birthday and a week before Charles and Diana's Royal Wedding. When Lara's father, a man she barely knows, invites her to accompany him on holiday, she finds herself in the sun-scorched hillsides of Tuscany, far away from the fumes of London's Holloway Road. There she meets the Willoughby family, rife with illicit alliances and vendettas. The more embroiled she becomes with them, and with the carelessly beautiful kip, the more Lara is consumed with doubt, curiosity and dread. And so begins her intoxicating journey into self discovery and across the very fine line between childhood and what lies beyond.",
