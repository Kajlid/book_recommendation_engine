His parents don't know and probably never should, the whole school knows Michael's gay and are less then accepting of it, so when the school opens a Gay,Straight, Lesbian, Bisexual alliance and Michael's is in it, it's only a matter of time before his overprotective and religious parents find out. Follow Michael as he comes to terms with himself and his feelings, his parents and his friends. No one said High School was easy.",
