As a natural-born telepath who’s also telekinetic—two things that can be disturbingly lucrative in the wrong person’s hands—she’s learned to hide who she is. To be always moving and never at ease. To run from that inevitable moment of discovery. She’s a nomad in a waitress’s uniform. This is how she survives.Until him.Jesse Linwood is a vampire with a problem. An automaton with sharp teeth, he was sent to evaluate and ultimately abduct her. What he doesn’t expect is the way her blue eyes turn him inside out. Stalking her wasn’t supposed to make him feel anything. She was supposed to be like all the others. He begins to unravel and, in the end, makes the choice to pick a fight he knows he cannot win in order to save her life.This is the first book in a planned series and DOES end in a cliffhanger. It also includes erotic scenes and graphic violence.",
