  "description": "Tyler Bennett and I hate each other.The annoying jerk my parents forced me to play with as a kid grew up to be a sexy, grumpy baker who still can’t stand me. Sure, maybe I enjoy our bitter banter, his cocky smirk, his chocolate chip cookies. But there’s a reason I can’t play nice. You’re wondering why—if I hate the guy so much—did I agree to be his fake date to his cousin’s wedding? Look. Just because I love being a pain in the man’s well-formed butt doesn’t mean I want someone else torturing him. Especially not the ex-fiancée who left him for his best friend.One night of faking it takes an unexpected turn. Heated glances, lingering touches, that arrogant mouth against mine. One night of getting swept away in an attraction that maybe isn’t so one-sided after all.Aside from this new, tentative friendship laced with sexual tension, something else has grown out of that night. And Tyler and I will have to figure it all out…in about nine months.Author’s note: Just One Favor is an enemies-to-lovers standalone romance with a hot side of longing, sexually-charged banter, a broken hotel bed, and chocolate cream pie.",
