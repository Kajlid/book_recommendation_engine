  "description": "G.G. Snowboards (The G.G. Series, Book #1) is a fresh new chapter book series for readers ages 5-9. In each book, the sassy, spunky G.G.—an eight-year-old Hispanic girl who lives in a big city apartment--gets to try a new extreme or action sport. In G.G. Snowboards, the vibrant G.G. boldly tells her family, “It’s the halfpipe or nothing!” But snowboarding is a lot harder than she expected. Can G.G. brave the lift? Slide the rails at the terrain park with her cousin Carlos? Or even ride the ginormous, scary half pipe? With photo illustrations by a former member of the U.S. Snowboard Team.",
