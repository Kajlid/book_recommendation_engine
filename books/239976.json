Ian, an ant with an unconventional mind, and Tasila, a butterfly with a heart for creatures \"oddly-graced\", were drawn to each other from the first time they met in the meadow—but it seems their friendship defied an untold law, and their worlds would never be the same again. When spring can only last so long before the heat turns up, will the two weather the challenges that lie ahead, nor will the odds and omens against them prevail?Till winter comes is the first book in a series. It offers something for everyone, with a love story, thrilling action (well, not explosions), profound quotes, and poetry. The story also has some powerful themes,, including friendship, forgiveness, multicultural relationships, and effects of pollution on the environment. What makes this story even more interesting is that these little creatures in a little world have such complex personalities. They have motives, aspirations and fears, and will have to make some tough decisions at times. Find out just how much can happen in their little world from springtime till winter comes.Pentopublish2017",
