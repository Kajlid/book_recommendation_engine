  "description": "Catching two demon burglars is routine for Gabriel 1089, who's one cog in an army of cybernetically modified humans protecting the sky city of Heaven. Until two turns into a twenty-demon ambush. When he wakes up, he's missing his network-enabled halo-and one of his metal wings. The down-level junk dealer tending Gabe's wounds has hands that spark nerve endings he never knew he possessed. But for an angel cut off from Heaven, an attic in Old Trent feels more like a trap than a sanctuary. Demons on his doorstep are nothing new for Jeff Werth. Ever since they saved his daughter's legs, they've been calling in their marker. In exchange for his services-nursing Gabe back to health so they can use him as a pawn in their war with Heaven-they'll consider the debt paid in full. Except having a powerless angel at his mercy feeds a rising desire that has him rethinking the deal. Then the de-haloed Gabe begins having dreams that become visions...then memories. Until he's not sure whose side he's on. Heaven, or the simple family man who healed his broken wings...and made his heart whole. The sexual awakening of an angel, some wing porn, abuse of heavenly cliches and a dog who steals the show.",
