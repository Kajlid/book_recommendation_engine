  "title": "FREE WOOD III-THE CRATE BOOK: Upcycling pallet wood into sturdy wood crates with precision and repeatability",
  "description": "This guide shows how to upcycle crate and pallet wood into useful, stackable wooden crates by making and using simple jigs. The repeatable precision ensures you can build as many crates as you need. Wooden crates are a useful storage and organization solution as well as a design element. Several crates the same size can be stacked together to make room dividers, book shelves, end tables or used individually to store things. They make excellent extra seating or a futon if we add a pillow top. They are great closet organizers and catch-alls and have many other uses in the home and shop. Unlike buying used crates at the flea market which is expensive, these crates cost next to nothing. Flea Market crates vary so much in size they are not as useful for stacking together. If we can upcycle our own pallet wood into crates of a consistent size we can then arrange them into shelf units, book cases or even cabinets. Combined with other pallet wood structures, such as shelves, wine racks or by adding doors or drawers they can become even more versatile. The finished crates can be stained or painted to suit your taste.Read this book and soon you will be building your own consistent crates. LOW TECH TECHNIQUES included for those without fancy power tools.FREE Bonus section inside.",
