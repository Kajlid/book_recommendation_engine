  "description": "Destiny will have to wait. He’s got a fight to win.He woke up not knowing his name, though it probably isn’t the worst thing that’s ever happened to him. Maybe. But now, Oblivion must fight for his life in the Pit of Lac’uus, where those with vices come to play.Sure he’s more or less a slave, but there’s no denying the intoxicating adrenaline of the fights, and the victor’s spoils are alluring. He might have even been content with his new lot in life if he didn’t have a feeling there was something important he should know.When a human from Earth joins the concubine ranks and acts as if she knows him, responding with soft gasps to his touch, he realizes there’s more to the things he doesn’t remember. But he knows if they do share an intimate history, it’s one he has certainly betrayed with his sins.However, Oblivion does what he must to survive, right up until the day his memories come smashing back, and the sinner must face his past.",
