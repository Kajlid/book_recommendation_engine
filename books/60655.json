  "description": "Everyone knows that Angel Lieverman is big-time trouble. That's why Lizzie stays as far away from her as possible! But when Angel and - gasp! - Lizzie have to serve detention together, Lizzie realizes that Angel's life is exciting! Soon Lizzie has a new image and a new attitude. Who knew that being bad could be so much fun? Now, if only Lizzie's family and friends could see it the same way! Plus, Lizzie thinks her friend Gordo's obsession with the lingo and music of the Rat Pack is totally lame - until the whole school gets into it. Soon Lizzie is helping organize a lounge-lizard-themed dance, and Gordo is furious with her for being a phony. Can Lizzie convince Gordo that she's gonna do it - her way?",
