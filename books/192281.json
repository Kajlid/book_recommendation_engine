  "description": "Who knew being a sexually active woman would cause a societal uproar? Here's the issue with modern American society. We expect women to behave themselves, to have grace, to be a lady. Yet we idolize women in the media who exude constant sexuality. Porn is everywhere. From sexy cheeseburger commercials to risqu√© magazine covers, the image of the 'ideal woman' is rarely well-clothed. And yet, typical women (women like you and I) are patronized if we behave in a way that emulates these sexual Hollywood starlets. So- where's the line? How can we be the inner, beautiful, SEXy beings that we are while also giving off an essence of well-respected dignity that society expects us to? Well, it's a tough line ladies. But it's one we can walk if we want to. And this book is about walking that line. Balancing on the beam between naughty little girls and high class ladies. We can be a bit of both, can't we? And we should be a bit of both. We have every right to attune to our inner Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. We deserve to be every aspect of our feminine selves.",
