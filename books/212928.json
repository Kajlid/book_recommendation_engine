  "title": "Amos Barton",
  "description": "Published as part of George Eliot’s fictional debut, Amos Barton is an honest and expressive work, displaying the same warm irony and keen observations that distinguish so many of her later novels. Parson Amos Barton is responsible not only for the spiritual welfare of his flock, but also for his extensive family. Burying himself in the works of the Evangelical greats, he may find food for thought for his parishioners, but the family’s poverty only worsens. For all his learning, it seems not even the Parson can contain their inevitable tragedy. Victorian novelist George Eliot is the author of a number of remarkable works, including Middlemarch, her masterpiece.",
