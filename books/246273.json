  "description": "When you hit rock bottom, the only way left is up.The Sanguinata are taking liberties and using humans like personal blood bags, but the tip is in the fine print, and the humans signing on the dotted line may as well be serving themselves up like cartons of juice. But when a woman under Sanguinata protection implores Serenity Harker for help, even the delicate balance of Midnight won’t stop Harker from making a bargain that will put her life on the line. Before she knows it, Harker has volunteered to compete in the House Games—a test of survival where lupin go up against sanguinata. The terms are simple: if she wins the humans go free.On top of preparing for the games, Harker must work her first active case. But the excitement of leading the investigation is soon tarnished by a heart breaking loss. Bereft and broken and left to pick up the pieces, Harker must resist the temptation to fall apart if she is to liberate the humans from Sanguinata clutches.As the house games approach, will Harker live up to her pledge as champion of humanity and give them back their free will, or will this fight prove to be her last?A kick-ass, urban fantasy read, with a slow burn reverse harem romance. Angels, Fallen, nephilim and Arthurian legend are given a fresh twist in this sexy, thrilling urban Fantasy series. Fans of Lost girl, True blood and Laurell K Hamilton’s Anita Blake series will surely enjoy it.",
