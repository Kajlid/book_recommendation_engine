  "description": "Jonathan Davis is the perfect narrator for the main character of this audiobook, a man dead set on fame and glory. Davis narrates the protagonist's dark thoughts with harsh cadences that jut out of a usually cold and deadpan voice. The Walk up Nameless Ridge is science fiction, set on the remote planet Eno, where a mountain twice the height of Everest remains to be climbed. Listeners will be on the edge of their seats as our protagonist's insatiable appetite for stardom lets him stop at nothing - not even murder - to conquer this mountain. The audiobook is both a gripping adventure and an acute look at what kind of evil men are capable of.",
