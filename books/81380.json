It is best to read this after Big Girls Do It books 1-5 to avoid major spoilers.***Falling in love with your best friend's ex sucks. It isn't fair to want the one thing you can't have. But the kind of soul-deep need Chase and Jamie felt for each other wasn't concerned with whether it was a good idea to be together or not. Should they fight for a relationship that came with a tangled web of broken hearts and complications, or should they just let it go, despite knowing that forgetting each other would prove painful and impossible?",
