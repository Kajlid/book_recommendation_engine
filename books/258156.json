  "description": "Having powers doesn't always make you the heroÂ \n\n\n\nI am a Xenocrate. This makes me what some might consider \"special\" - and everyone wants to be special, right? \n\n\n\n\n\nIt means I was born with powers, but these powers come with a price. The price is one that my mother, among many, has had to pay. For this reason, I went from a modern day Robin Hood, to a lawless villain. \n\n\n\n\nI am Delaney Benson. I am the Shadow, and this is my story.",
