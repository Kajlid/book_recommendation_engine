Watching the former-Southern Belle tackle life and love in Vermont was only the tip of the iceberg when it came to antics, charades, mischief, and romance. Now, back in Memphis and beginning a relationship with the namesake of Yankee Doodle Dixie, you'd think Leelee might just sit back and enjoy her newly-crafted life. But that just wouldn't be as much fun . . .Opening up her restaurant with her boyfriend, Peter, proves to be harder than she originally anticipatedâ€”especially when her unpredictable best friends are involved! Toss in a lisping neighbor, a male dog named Roberta, and the return of her evil ex-husband who started the whole mess in the first place . . . Well, this is a recipe for just the kind of novel readers expect from Lisa Patton.As life and love challenge Leelee's resolve and sense of humor, Southern as a Second Language is an endearing and chuckle-inducing conclusion to a very beloved character who keeps us guessing up to the very last page as to whether or not it all works out in the end. Whether in maple tree Vermont or magnolia-filled Memphis, Leelee's heart and laughter will delight readers of any climate!",
