Who wants to date an eighteen-year-old boy?Not me. I much prefer an older man with rough hands that knows what he’s doing.Enter Mr. Evans.A single father billionaire with more time on his plate than he knows what to do with.And the man is brilliant and wickedly delicious.Much to my surprise, he’s quickly becoming my star pupil, which means he gets more of my time than necessary.But I can’t help myself. He’s exactly what I need in my life, in my bed, kissing me at the stroke of midnight…And the best is even though he’s older than me, he’s more than willing to let me teach him a few new tricks.Let's just hope we don't get caught.This is book 1 in a 3 part series. You will have to read books 2 and 3 to complete the story.",
