  "title": "Gabba Gabba Hey!: The Graphic Story of the Ramones",
  "description": "The Ramones were the archetypal American punk band and this is their story, from their beginnings in Queens in 1974, through the burgeoning punk scene at CBGB's, the excitement of their first album, their brush with the unhinged genius of Phil Spector and the endless touring which saw them perform 2,263 concerts over a 22 year period.Set against a backdrop of New York facing bankruptcy and terrorized by Son of Sam, The Ramones tale takes in endless inter-band fighting and finally the tragic deaths of three of the founding Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee.The band's influence has proven immense, with their early British tours having a profound impact on bands like The Sex Pistols and The Clash, and the band finally receiving due recognition when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and later won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",
