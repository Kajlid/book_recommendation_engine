Ignore the weight of the water hanging overhead, and the little dead girl wandering the streets. Off with you, while you still can.In Haverny Wood the birds drink blood, the dogs trade their coughings for corpses, the lost children carve up their bodies to run with the crows, and the townsfolk stitch silence into their spleens. You mustn't talk so wild.The desert-locked outpost of Boundary boasts the famed manufacturers of flawless timepieces; those who would learn the trade must offer up their eyes as starting materials. Look to your it will eat you alive.Sooner or later, in every community, fate demands its dues — and the currency is blood.",
