  "description": "Anxiety has become the only thing Abigail Hartley can count on. She's jobless, dreamless, loveless and stuck living with her parents—it's not exactly the 22 she had in mind. But when tragic news rattles the Hartley household and years of secrecy begin to surface, Abigail can no longer hide behind her fears. She joins forces with her sarcastic, pre-teen sister and heads to the only place that might have the answers she's looking for. One month in Georgia is all it takes to change everything Abigail knows about, well…everything.",
