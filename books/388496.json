  "description": "In Dragons from the Sea, book two of the Strongbow Saga, Halfdan Hroriksson has escaped—for now—the enemies who murdered his brother and seek to kill him, too. Determined to avenge his brother's death, Halfdan knows he must first gain experience as a warrior. He joins a Danish army, led by legendary Viking leader Ragnar Logbrod, gathering for an invasion of Western Frankia, for among its fierce chieftains and seasoned warriors he may find the allies he needs. But first he must prove his own worth in battle, and more importantly, he must survive, for he will face dangers not only from the Frankish enemy, but also from hidden foes within the ranks of the Danes. The Strongbow Saga is an epic tale of one man’s unstoppable quest for justice and vengeance that carries him across the 9th century world of the Vikings. This second edition of book two contains new maps, showing Halfdan’s travels in this installment of the story and the route of the Viking fleet that invaded Frankia in 845 A.D.",
