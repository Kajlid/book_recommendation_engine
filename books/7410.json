Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan, following on the heels of their wildly successful H.M.S. Pinafore . Pirates invade the rocky coast of Cornwall in this topsy-turvy tale of love and duty, highlighted by the famous strains of \"Poor Wandering One,\" \"I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General,\" \"Oh, Is There Not One Maiden Breast\" and \"With Cat-Like Tread, Upon Our Prey We Steal.\" This vocal score includes the complete music and all dialogue, a plot synopsis, articles on the famous partnership and the history of The Pirates of Penzance , a filmography and a discography.",
