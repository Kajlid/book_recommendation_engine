  "description": "For eight hundred years, Valéry Castellane has known only one kind of light - the light in those human beings he's had to kill so he might live. The last of these has been the most brilliant light of all, the light of the one sent to tell him that heaven was never really lost to him. But did he destroy all hope for it in attempting to make this angel a human love he could hold forever on earth, or is the mystery of this vampire's salvation yet to be fully revealed? Sometimes the key which unlocks the secret of what's to come is hidden in the past. Take another journey with a vampire, through eight centuries of dark human history which have, all along, been leading him to the light. Volume Out of the Depths After an earth-shattering revelation by his maker that he doesn't truly understand, Valéry seeks a new world, free of the Old World's pain. Trapped in the darkness he can't escape, yet still touched by the light in the human lives he cherishes despite every dark deed, his attempt to determine who really is the monster further leads to him becoming one whose greatest deception is the lie he tells himself. Until two revolutions and two world wars later, the illusion is shattered to behold an enigmatic mortal girl.",
