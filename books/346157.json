  "title": "The Attitude of Faith: Saying Yes to God's Power in Your Life",
  "description": "God Says YesThe yes attitude is the biblical attitude for living life. Godâ€™s Word is faithful, and His message is absolute, certain, and guaranteed. God does not vacillate in His message or His plans; neither did the apostles, and neither should we.If you choose a negative, wrong attitude, then you will create negative and wrong results. If you choose a positive and biblical yes attitude, you choose the attitude of faith. You will see positive results and answers to your prayers.More than just positive thinking or mind over matter, this is an attitude established upon the Word of God. More than fantasizing or imagining whatever we want, it is saying yes to the God who can and will do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or think.",
