  "title": "The Tutankhamun Deception: The True Story of the Mummy's Curse",
  "description": "The discovery and excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb is one of the most famous archeological finds in history. But compelling evidence suggests the story we know is a shamâ€”Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon actually discovered Tutankhamun's tomb several years before they told the world they did, looted it. re-sealed it, then led the world's media back to the site to claim their place in history. This book tells the story of the skullduggery that went on in the Valley of the Kings and how the famous Mummy's Curse, far from being something mystical, could well have been a systematic way of getting rid of those who were about to blow the cover on the secret of the find, and the secrets of the tomb.",
