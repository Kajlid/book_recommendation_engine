Liam Wright is Hollywood’s golden boy and at the top of the A-list. But what he doesn’t know about life… Well, it could fill his very large Hollywood mansion.

Pampered, pretty, and often puzzled, Liam and his antics keep her on her toes, and there is never a dull moment living with him. Until one day, Liam sees her as more…and he wants her to see him for the man he can be. The man he wants to be. For her. Is Liam up for the part?",
