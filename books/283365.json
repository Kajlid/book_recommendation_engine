  "description": "Fifteen years ago, the Mayor of the Education City was presented with an unwelcome surprise by his twin six-month-old boys. As the Mayor reluctantly accepted the two babies, he had no way of knowing that they would change the city foreverâ€¦. Raised in the comfort of the Mayoral mansion, Umasi and Zen are as different as two brothers can be. Umasi is a good student; Zen an indifferent one. They love their adoptive father, but in a city where education is absolute, even he cannot keep them sheltered from the harsh realities of the school system. But when they discover that their father is responsible for their suffering, affection turns to bitterness. Umasi and Zen are thrust onto two diverging paths. One will try to destroy the City. The other will try to stop him.",
