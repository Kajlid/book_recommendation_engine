  "title": "Mango: A Global History",
  "description": "From smoothies to folklore, a global history of the many incarnations of the mango. This beautifully illustrated book takes us on a tour through the rich world of mangoes, which inspire fervent devotion across the world. In South Asia, mangoes boast a history steeped in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, even earning a mention in the Kama Sutra. Beyond myth, the authors show us that mangoes hold literary significance as a potent metaphor. While mango-flavored smoothies grace Western grocery shelves, the true essence of sweet, juicy mangoes or tangy, unripe varieties is a rarity: supermarket offerings often prioritize shelf-life over taste. This book offers an accessible introduction to the world of true mango aficionados and the thousand varieties they cherish.",
