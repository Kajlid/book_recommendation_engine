  "title": "Master Limitations: Clarity, Release and Connection",
  "description": "In this manual you will be exposed to definitions first, then the explanations as to why things show up as limitation, and later, how to master them. My work is uniting the spiritual and logical into one in order for your journey to become easy and empowering as well.The word definition means a statement of the exact meaning of a word. When you are clear on the meaning you have power over your situation. Thoughts are words and words have meanings, but if you have obtained your meaning through someone elseâ€™s interpretation, you bind yourself to the experience of these thoughts and words.As you read this book I have clarified these definitions and in doing so, you are able to make a conscious choice about what thoughts mean and how what has been given negative meanings are really just misinterpretations.Once again, this is a manual for you to learn from and use to obtain fast results. I have added practices but they are not difficult. These actually are natural to do in any moment, in any area of your life.",
