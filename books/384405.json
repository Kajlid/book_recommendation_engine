  "description": "Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer introduces readers to the village of Chelm in this Newbery Honor Book. Chelm is a village of fools. The most famous fools—the oldest and the greatest—are the seven Elders. But there are lesser fools too: a silly irresponsible bridegroom; four sisters who mix up their feed in bed one night; a young man who imagines himself dead. Here are seven magical folktales spun by a master storyteller, that speak of fools, devils, schlemiels, and even heroes—like Zlateh the goat. The New York Times called Zlateh the Goat and Other Stories , \"beautiful stories for children, written by a master.\" The New York Book Review said, \"This book is a triumph. If you have no older children on your list, buy it for yourself.\" Singer's extraordinary book of folklore is illustrated by Maurice Sendak, who won a Caldecott Medal for Where the Wild Things Are . Supports the Common Core State Standards",
