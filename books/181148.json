  "title": "The Case for a Larger Israel",
  "description": "In this eye-opening book attorney David Naggar makes the case that the international consensus solution, two Statesâ€”one Israeli, one Palestinianâ€”within the confines of Israel, Gaza and the West Bankâ€”is based on fatally flawed assumptions. With the aid of 30 maps, Naggar persuasively argues that even if two such States could be delineated by fiat, doing so would not produce a lasting peace. It would endanger the lives of some, and ruin the lives of manyâ€”Palestinians and Israelis alike.Naggar begins the book by showing the reader how the overarching Arab/Muslim-Israeli conflict has been simplified to the point where only Palestinian statelessness and Israelâ€s security needs are discussed. He establishes that Palestinian Arab needs are not being met, and that Israelâ€s need to be viable has not been considered by the international community since 1920, when multiple Arab States took root, and the much larger original borders of what was to become British Mandate Palestineâ€”a homeland for the Jewsâ€”were agreed upon.Naggarâ€s well-written, well-sourced, and easy to read book, puts forth the case that a larger, viable Israel will not only serve the interests of peace, but will also greatly benefit humanity otherwise. At the same time, the vision presented in Naggarâ€s book offers Palestinians an opportunity for a better life.",
