  "title": "Jonathan Franzen at the End of Postmodernism",
  "description": "Jonathan Franzen is one of the most influential, critically-significant and popular contemporary American novelists.  This book is the first full-length study of his work and attempts to articulate where American fiction is headed after postmodernism.  Stephen Burn provides a comprehensive analysis of each of Franzen's novels - from his early work to the major success of The Corrections - identifying key sources, delineating important narrative strategies, and revealing how Franzen's themes are reinforced by each novel's structure. Supplementing this analysis with comparisons to key contemporaries, David Foster Wallace and Richard Powers, Burn suggests how Franzen's work is indicative of the direction of experimental American fiction in the wake of the so-called end of postmodernism.",
