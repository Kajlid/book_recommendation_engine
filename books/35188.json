  "description": "When Jason Stone first looked in the safe deposit box, he had no idea what the three items meant. He had no idea why he was chosen, and he had no idea what was in store for him next. He couldn’t rely on his parents, they’ve been dead for over five years. Would his foster parents be there for him, or would he be on his own again? His boring life as a freshman in high school was about to change. The question he had was would it be for the better or for the worse? Once his summer was over he would know who stood with him and who stood against him. Being fifteen is hard enough, throw in uncertainty, insecurity, and confusion and there is no telling who is going to come out the winner.",
