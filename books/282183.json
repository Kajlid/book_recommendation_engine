  "description": "From eighth-century Germany comes the stirring tale of Princess Adelina, a virtuous young woman determined to fulfill God s call on her life. The daughter of an Iona missionary to the German people, Adelina s world is turned upside-down when a young pagan ruler, Hedan of Thuringia, falls in love with her and commands that she become his bride. As a wedding gift, Hedan promises Adelina that he will allow Christians within Thuringia to worship and evangelize freely, spreading the Gospel among his people. But Hedan s mother, Geila, hates both Adelina and Christianity, stopping at nothing to subvert her daughter-in-law and stamp out the fledgling German Culdee church. Based on a true story, this Esther-like tale recounts the deeds of courageous Adelina as she endures persecution, slander, exile, and the impending destruction of her people. Through it all, will Adelina remain faithful to her Heavenly King? Or will she fall away and leave the Culdee church to its fate? Find out in this ancient Christian tale of beauty, bravery and romance -- The Princess Adelina",
