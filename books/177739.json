  "description": "Alyson Lane thinks that she can leave, but she will not walk away from this. From Me. Alyson hasn’t realized it yet, but she’s made a big mistake. It’s one thing to agree to go our separate ways, it’s another to shoot Blake Hanson down. No, Alyson chose wrong and I am going to make sure she knows it. I am not a man to be turned away from. I will not be denied. She is my sub and I… I will dominate her completely.",
