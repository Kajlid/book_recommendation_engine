  "description": "Becky's hard-working mama and four older brothers and sisters try to surprise her on her eighth birthday. â€˜An exceedingly warm and satisfying story of a [African-American] city family that is true to childhood.' 'NYT.\"Mama --\" Becky said and waited. \"My birthday's coming pretty soon. Will we have chicken-spaghetti and striped ice cream?\"Mama sighed and said, \"I don't know, Becky. Things were a little better last year.\"Not having something special to look forward to for a birthday was bad enough, but then the whole family seemed to turn against Becky. Life was lonely for the youngest in the family when everyone else started working on a project without her. Brother Abe even tried to keep her out of her own home during the day -- and playing baseball with Abe did not appeal to Becky.This is a story about a very real family -- the ups and downs, the quarrels and making-ups, and it is a story of Becky's happy birthday.",
