  "title": "The Valley of Fire",
  "description": "When a rogue angel known as “Insanity” escapes and starts a polygamist cult in Utah, all Hell breaks loose. Friends murder friends, husbands abandon wives, heads leave their bodies, and a frenzied fat man beats his revered prophet with a broom – and this is just the beginning. Insanity's friends can stop him, if they can find him. They’ll follow the trail of broken bones and mangled lives he littered along Utah’s Route 666. Unfortunately, in their rush to recapture him and clean up his mess, they might accidentally start Armageddon. It's hard to say though. The Horsemen of the Apocalypse didn't explain their plans when they arrived in Nevada's Valley of Fire. They just flipped everyone the bird. One thing is the road to rendition is paved with bad intentions.",
