  "description": "What happens when your boyfriend loves you but his split personality hates you?  For a while, it seemed like Winter, Bones and Reginald might be able to strike a balance with their strange relationship. But having sex with Reginald while Bones pretended not to be there is harder than they imagined--especially for Bones who is inadvertently developing chemistry every time his other personality makes love to her.  But when that chemistry gets out of hand, Reginald--who Bones considers his brother-- suddenly disappears, leaving Bones devastated and hating Winter for causing it.  Enter the X Factor-- With Reginald missing, the imbalance in Bones' mind takes yet another turn, allowing X out to play--the part of him who knows things about Bones that even Bones doesn't.  Stuck in Bones subconscious, X is only able to live when Bones sleeps. But X has too much revenge to \"Execute\" and not enough time in his 4 hour window to work. But with Reginald gone, X finds he has more power, and strikes a deal with Pretty Winter.  Wanting only to fix what she broke and put Reggie and Bones back together, Winter agrees, even if she has to play the whore to do it. But that'll damn well change when Bones figures out two things--that he's falling for Winter-- and that X exists.  ****NOTE**** The mental disorders in this story are fictionally constructed to drive the story.
