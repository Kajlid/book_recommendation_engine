  "description": "Farrow Latimer, Prince of the Arcades:   I am the prince of darkness, the executioner and fallen angel royalty who is forbidden, love. No matter how many men or women I take to my bed none capture my heart.   As the Arcades teem with lust, debauchery, and destruction, I neither relish nor abhor my role as the most brutal of all and then I catch her....the small fairy halfling who seizes my world.     Rayelynn Astraides, first daughter of the Commander of Landharn's West Shore:   The fallen angels litter the skies coming to claim us as I run from the monstrous man my father is to make me marry for failing battle school. Fallen angels are all about us and in my fear I tuck myself away.   There, beside the tree where I hide, he stands, tall, majestic, handsome... and deadly. He lets me run. I return to the battlefield to heal our wounded as I am a gifted healer. The dark angel comes again but this time to take me as his prisoner.  My world changes and I see such horror and sadness, but none greater than that which lies within the fallen prince who is disallowed love yet risks all for it.",
