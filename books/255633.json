A frightening new 2018 United States Constitution ends our Bill of Rights as freedom of speech, religion and the press are forbidden. Irmina a seventeen year old from Durango, Colorado is an expert hacker. Mysterious letters arrive from a vacant lot. Irmina meets a controversial group of hackers who have different ideas on how to combat the loss of their print materials to the evil Book Burning Centers. One of them wants to try peaceful measures while another one wants to use deadly force. The leader of a hacker group orders Irmina to steal the nuclear codes while he threatens Irmina’s family if she refuses. Irmina faces a tough decision to save her family from harm. Getting the nuclear codes from President Pyromaniac is not going to be easy.",
