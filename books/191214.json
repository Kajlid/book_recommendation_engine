  "title": "Rockets Versus Gravity",
  "description": "A multi-faceted story that explores how small actions and changes can give rise to startling and unintended consequences.Trajectory. Declination. Impact. Escape Velocity. These are rocketry terms that could also describe aspects of the human experience.A lumberjack obsessed with space travel loses four different wedding rings, and each of the lost rings symbolizes something different to the person who finds it.There are the members of a rich family whose dramas overlap with those of the homeless people living right next door, under the bridges of the Rosedale Ravine. The wheelchair-bound teen who declares war on a man parking his luxury car in the handicapped parking spot. The would-be rock star selling insurance, whose terminal diagnosis sets his life on a new and dizzying path. And many others. Every person is connected to every other â€” genetically, coincidentally, necessarily, or randomly. Every action has a consequence, seen or unseen, from the sublime to the catastrophic.",
