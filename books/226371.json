A few years back, he investigated the corrupt—and as it turned out, homicidal—local school board, and now the town’s back in his view with more alarming news: a woman has been found dead, frozen in a block of ice.There’s a possibility that it might be connected to a high school class of twenty-five years ago.

In the process, one thing becomes increasingly clear to him. It’s true what they say - high school can be murder.",
