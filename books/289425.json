  "description": "The old farmhouse in Silk Hope was never meant to be sold but to be inherited by the daughters of the line \"no matter what occurs between them and the men in their lives.\" When their mother dies, Frannie and Natalie must decide what the house means to them as independent modern women. Sensible Natalie and her uptight banker boyfriend, Jake, propose selling the property. The sisters can't afford to keep up the farmhouse, Jake contends. Women don't need safe havens anymore, Natalie claims. But wild, impulsive Frannie refuses to sell their sanctuary and resolves to honor the legacy in her own inimitable way--with a little help from a pig and the patient one-armed foreman at the local underwear-packaging mill. \"How it all ends must be experienced by every reader.\" (Philadelphia Inquirer)Poignant, funny, and altogether compelling, Lawrence Naumoff's fourth novel is a moving parable in which two good women find, among the neglected virtues of the past, a sustenance to carry them into the future. Silk Hope, NC is \"the finest work yet by a wise and gifted author\" (Winston-Salem Journal).",
