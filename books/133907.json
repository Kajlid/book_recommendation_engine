  "description": "Praise for Richard Roberts: \"One thing Richard Roberts does so very well is create an unforgettable character. In this book, he's created a whole crew. Each is so vivid in my mind that I am able to look at the beautiful artwork of the cover and pick out each character by name.\" ~Laurie Laliberte  About Quite Contrary:  The secret of having an adventure is getting lost. Who ever visited an enchanted kingdom or fell into a fairy tale without wandering into the woods first?  Well, Mary is lost. Mary is lost in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and that is a cruel and murderous story. She's put on the red hood and met the Wolf. When she gives in to her Wolf's temptations, she will die. That's how the story goes, after all.  Unfortunately for the story and unfortunately for the Wolf, this Little Red Riding Hood is Mary Stuart, and she is the most stubborn and contrary twelve year old the world has ever known.  Forget the Wolf's temptations, forget the advice of the talking rat trying to save her - she will kick her way through every myth and fairy tale ever told until she finds a way to get out of this alive. Her own way, and no one else's.",
