  "description": "In this endearing companion to Kiss, Kiss! , Baby Hippo finds that taking a walk is sleepy work. When Baby Hippo can’t sleep he goes for a wander through the reeds, along the bog, over the rocks, and through the willowy, wavy grass. On the way he discovers that all the animal moms and dads are hushing their babies to sleep. The gentle and rhythmic sounds will entertain, entrance, and, most importantly, promote sleep in toddlers everywhere.",
