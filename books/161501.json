  "description": "Santorini. Turquoise seas, ancient ruins and beautiful sunsets. And a woman thrown from a cliff. The violent death shocks fellow passengers of the Empress Louise, a grand cruise liner packed with British tourists. For newly promoted Inspector Nikos Stephanakis, the case poses linguistic and cultural problems. His request for assistance yields unexpected results. DI Beatrice Stubbs, called in as support, flies to Greece. What with tension at home, the timing couldnâ€™t be better. She anticipates a few days in the sun and a swift resolution. But when an earlier death at sea proves suspicious and an elderly lady is killed in her cabin, terror spreads like contagion. Murder is aboard. And someone has Beatrice in his sights. From the Cyclades to the Dodecanese, Nikos and Beatrice pursue the killer and unearth a secret. Revenge is a dish best served cold.",
