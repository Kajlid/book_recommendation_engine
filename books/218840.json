Travelling through the very fabrics of existence itself, the inept duo encounter all manner of ridiculousness...and leave it a bloody wreck.A quest of absurdity for the ages, A Vulgar Tale is sure to warp your mind and liquidise your sanity. If you're a fan of bizarre adventure, the more deranged the better, then this unholy tome is your jam, man. Featuring plot points fit for a king, a string of gratuitous brutality, mullet abuse and characters so intriguing they belong wedged up Satan's colon, A Vulgar Tale is as outrageous as it comes.",
