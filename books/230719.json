  "description": "Aspiring crime boss Emma McRae knows about superheroes. Used for her beauty and enticing demeanor, Emma has been entangled in the underground crime life since she was a little girl. No one has ever left the crime syndicate except in a body bag, and Emma is trapped in her current, low-level role. A calculated attack by the city’s superhero, Grim, throws Emma’s employer and his well-oiled business into chaos. Eager to impress and finally move up to better jobs - and more respect - Emma doesn’t hesitate to accept the order to infiltrate the vigilante’s life. Her targets include Shawn Thorton and his adoptive brother, Jaxon Rettig. Legally blind from a young age, Shawn doesn’t seem like much of a threat, but harbors a secret: with the help of neurostimulating lenses, he is Grim, and has been targeting Vance’s syndicate with ruthless ambition. Unaware of each other's cold-blooded goals, Shawn and Emma begin to fall for each other. She was born into the criminal life, but through Shawn, begins to question if she’s on the wrong side of the fight. Emma wants to expose Grim’s secret identity and claim his power before her employer decides she’s a liability and fits her for a fancy pair of cement Jimmy Choos. Jaxon, who wants a better role than “tech-savvy sidekick,” longs to take the fighting into his own hands. Shawn must choose between protecting his jealous brother and falling for the appealing Emma, who might be the arch nemesis that brings the superhero to his knees.",
