  "description": "â€œThis torment of mind is one I scarcely thought possible, one which I so ignorantly assumed to be the fabrication of those who claim to have suffered through life's multitude of horrors. Had I known, I think I should sooner have chosen death.\" Set in 1871, this gothic horror novel tells the story of a young housekeeper removed to an idyllic country manor after accepting an offer of employment from the strange and reclusive Mrs Gathany. The place seems almost too good to be true, however, and it is not long before a sinister creature makes its presence known and Mrs Gathany's disturbing family history slowly begins to unravel.",
