  "description": "It has been three years since Branith has been home and a few of the Princes from the Free Lands have come with him. Things have changed and they are all quick to note the obvious ones. The young girls he remembered as cute little toddlers and scamps are developing curves, and he is suddenly feeling very protective. Where did that come from?As Elves gather for the celebration, Daroth finds his Kingdom is being invaded by what seems like every high-ranking Elven family in the Empire. There are toddlers everywhere! He would ask where they all came from, but their ages point at only one possible answer: their conceptions can be traced back to the time when Gabriel and Eden conjured their spell in the High Elven Kingdom. It reminds him of when their children were toddlers, and with that in mind, he is ready to enjoy the party.Can it be that simple?",
