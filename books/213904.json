  "title": "Sputnik's Children",
  "description": "A literary genre-bending novel full of heart. Cult comic book creator Debbie Reynolds Biondi has been riding the success of her Cold War era inspired superhero series Sputnik Chick Girl with No Past for more than 25 years. But with the comic book losing fans and Debbie struggling to come up with new plot lines for her badass mutant-killing heroine she decides to finally tell Sputnik Chick's origin story. Debbie's never had to make anything up before and she isn't starting now. Sputnik Chick is based on Debbie's own life in an alternate timeline called Atomic Mean Time. As a teenager growing up in Shipman's Corners, a Rust Belt town voted by Popular Science magazine as most likely to be nuked, she was recruited by a self-proclaimed time traveller to collapse Atomic Mean Time before an all-out nuclear war grotesquely altered humanity. In trying to save the world Debbie risked obliterating everyone she'd ever loved as well as her own past in the process. Or so she believes. Present-day Debbie is addicted to lorazepam and dirty wet martinis making her an unreliable narrator at best.",
