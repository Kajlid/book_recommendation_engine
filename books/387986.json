  "description": "All Jack Artizan wished for was to fit in. As if feeling \"different\" from other eleven-year-olds wasn't enough, dreams of a strange land, where a golden LyreBird fills the air with a song and from which its denizens draw their magic, lately add to Jack's troubles. But when the LyreBird is killed, this all-too-real nightmare leads Jack to seek the advice of a local fortune teller.Jack soon learns a great mystery. For more than two centuries, people have simply vanished from the earth without a trace. Stories of their disappearance became legend and this grew into folklore. Today, meet-up groups share rumors of a fellowship of vanishing aliens or what they call Here-Afters...but little do they know, Here-Afters are human beings from the Land of Intuit.When Jack and his friends mysteriously appear on Intuit, they find the enchanted realm terrorized by the FOG, an evil network of warlocks stealing magic from Intuit's children. To save the Land of Intuit, Jack and his friends join forces with Mr. Sandman, a Muse Queen, and a mystical LyreBird, in a quest to find the realm's ancient Book of Destiny.",
