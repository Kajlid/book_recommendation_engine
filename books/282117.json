  "description": "The Mystery began a hundred years ago. It was never solved. Now it's happening again. When ten-year-old Aaron moved from the big city to the country, he thought it was a boring sleepy town. Then he met Jake, a know-it-all farm girl who said his house was haunted. She claimed an Amish boy disappeared without a trace after hearing the wind call his name. Aaron thought she was just trying to scare him...until the night he heard his own name in the wind. \"Wow! What a terrific book - especially for young adult readers. What more could you ask for? Mystery, time travel, history - all rolled into one heck of a yarn.\" - Joseph Perrone Jr, author of As the Twig is Bent \"THE TIME CAVERN will stimulate and captivate the imagination of young readers, girls and boys alike. I urge parents and teachers to add this book to their libraries.\" - D. B. Pacini, author of The Loose End of the Rainbow \"The Time Cavern showcases masterful storytelling that will immediately be passed forward to one of my nephews. I highly recommend picking up a copy for the young explorers that you love.\" - Roy L. Pickering, author of Patches of Grey",
