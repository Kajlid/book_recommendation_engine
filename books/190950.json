  "description": "Ingredients for any Romantic comedy ever written : 1. Good English which includes a dozen words which could have been easily avoided....... (Almost) Check 2. Utterly Gorgeous and incredibly smart Chick /Girl /Woman ...... Check 3. Witty and a bit lost Dude/Boy/Man...... (Kinda) Check. 4. A cheeky premise that makes them meet in the most 'original' sounding circumstances 5. Interesting characters who have no other purpose, but to contribute to the furtherance of story. 6. Is based on the writer's own 'life' experiences, which he subtly veils through first person narration and random throw backs, through it's 200 pages or more of story 7. And of course a happy ending, where the Guy wins the Girl against all odds and ends up telling the story to anyone who is kind enough to listen to him.This book however is all this and more. It brews a weird concoction which happens to challenge the very notions from whence it has been formed. It challenges you to make hard decisions. It asks you to choose which story you'd like to believe in. And it invites you on this ride through the city, forged by time and love....",
