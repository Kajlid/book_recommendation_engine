  "description": "As little girls, Jen, Babby, Ivy and Bizz played with baby dolls under the weeping willow tree. As teenagers, they gathered under those branches to giggle and talk about boys. Known by everyone simply as the Willows, they grew into women, branched out to start their own careers and families, and assumed they would be together forever. When Jen is diagnosed with terminal cancer, the Willows must face their deepest pain about each other as well as their own individual ways of coping with grief. At the same time, long-kept secrets begin to unravel. What they believed they truly knew about each other comes into question. The Willows must face their mysteries, their shortcoming and their many moments of laughter, trusting that in the end, they would still find love and acceptance when they crawled under the willow tree.",
