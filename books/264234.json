  "description": "The people of Pantogan occupy a fractured land; their triumph over the Elementals has brought little respite. Now Queen Elaina and Rake have a new battle to fight. A tide of disillusioned youngsters and their new allegiance to the charismatic dictator, Armastad and his army of bronze warriors, threatens to erode the carefully balanced democracy and ultimately the people who matter the most - those with the Craft.",
