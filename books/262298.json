  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Layla Frost comes a twisty fantasy novel about fated mates, evil, and a spicy take on magicks…\nI was cursed.It wasn’t an exaggeration. It wasn’t even dramatics—though I was prone to those.It was a fact.And a sucky one at that.After inheriting my grandmother’s home, I thought my luck had turned around. A fresh start in the one place I’d found solace from my cruel father.But I was cursed, remember? So rather than a quiet life, I faced mysteries. Con artists. Disastrous dates. Stoned witches, magicks, and evil organizations out to do evil things.And a house that was haunted.Only my ghost wasn’t a creepy specter with rattling chains. Nor was it a murderous Victorian child. It wasn’t even a comedic ghoul trying to scare me out of the house with a possessed singalong.That would be too easy.My invisible squatter was snarky. Pop culture obsessed. Disconcertingly charming with a voice that was otherworldly hot.And not actually a ghost.He wasn’t completely human, either.But that was okay. Apparently, neither was I…Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to strong adult language, themes, and lovin’ so good, it must be magicks.",
