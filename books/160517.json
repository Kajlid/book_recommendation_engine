The beloved girl's best friend and childhood crush, Landon, is the only key to unlock the mystery of what happened to her. When Landon is found wandering in a daze far from his home after the disappearance, he is clueless as to the events that took place or the whereabouts of Emily. The only thing keeping him from knowing what happened to his best friend, and girl of his dreams, are the memories which have hidden themselves far within the folds of his brain. He must delve deep within his mind to remember the events of that fateful day so that he can hopefully be reunited with her, but at the same time he is scared to death of what role he played in her disappearance. As Special Investigator Carter VanDusen races against time to learn the truth, Landon can only pray that the greatest danger is not within himself.",
