  "description": "Translated by Miroslaw Lipinski. The greatest author of fantastic fiction in the Polish language is Stefan Grabinski (1877-1936), the master of the short story form. Grabinski's stories, which he termed psychofantasies, are explorations of the extreme in human behaviour, where the macabre and the bizarre combine to send a chill down the reader's spine. When it comes to the erotic, few authors can match Grabinski's depiction of seething sexual frenzy.",
