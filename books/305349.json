  "description": "I was held against my will for years, and she thought I was dead.AlekseiSloane had every right moving on. Valentin faked my death and made everyone believe it. He paid the right people and stole my body. I woke up in a padded room and knew everything was going to change from that point on. He told me Sloane had two babies, taunted me at every opportunity, and told me I'd never see my daughters or the woman I love with all of my being.Until one day it all changed. No one came in to give me food. Suddenly, everyone in the facility was gone and it became a ghost town. In that moment I knew I needed to get out, and by some miracle I was able to. Now I'm on my way to the woman I've never stopped loving, praying I can hold her in my arms once more.I don't know what I thought would happen when I saw her, but it turns out coming back from the dead isn't so easy.",
