A man from our world wouldn't have a chance against them ... or, would he?The Duplicators - A planet with a machine which can duplicate anything would be the wealthiest world in the galaxy, right? Wrong. And unless the hapless voyager who's trapped on the planet can find a solution to its problem, he isn't going to live to leave again. Plus three short stories, including \"A Logic Named Joe,\" an uncannily prophetic story of home computers and the internet - written in 1946.",
