So Philip leaves for Paris, where his father's hopes and his lover's ideals are realised but with unforeseen consequences for them both ...A peerlessly successful and prolific romantic novelist, Georgette Heyer shows in Powder And Patch what won her a wide, devoted readership that continues to this day.",
