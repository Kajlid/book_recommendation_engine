  "description": "It started when I was just a boy.My obsession.An inheritance the men in my family seem to be gifted, one that feels a lot like a disease.It was love at first sight.Hair the colour of fire, eyes crafted of the deepest jade.I was captivated by her instantly, enthralled, but it was not meant to be, our worlds were already vastly different. Destinies not meant to intertwine. My family worked for people like her, they didn't marry them. The Princess of the Irish Mob. The eldest son of The Firm's disposal crew.So, I grew up, I moved on, and I spent long nights in bars drowning dangerous thoughts of her.But, it seems, with time, things can change. One night, one debt, one single game of cards.And in a sick twist of fate, a treasure that should never be mine was suddenly within my grasp.",
