  "description": "Welcome to the Textro Truck Stop...where they have hot food, hot coffee, and even hotter waitresses.It's a slow Friday night at the Textro, and business isn't expected to pick up until the football game lets out in nearby Masonfield. Deke, backed up by his friend Harley, is here on a mission of romance. Rachel Sutherland has come to unwind from a bad day at the clinic. Thomas \"Grandpa Tom\" Burns and \"Leaping\" Larry Brown are just dropping in for some diesel and coffee, while across the diner Holly just wants to get her socially disastrous boyfriend, Gerald, home. Waitresses Stacey and Marisa are taking it easy, serving the few patrons while waiting for the game crowd to arrive.But things are about to get busy in an unexpected and very deadly way.There is a storm coming in and the crowd that arrives with it isn't from Masonfield...at least, not anymore. These unexpected guests are from the nearby Mazon County Cemetery, and they have their own idea of what should be on the menu. Now a dwindling collection of locals, waitresses, truckers, out-of-towners, and one astonished veterinarian find themselves in a desperate fight for survival against a foe they thought only existed in the movies. And as the night wears on they discover that if they don't escape by dawn, they will lose all hope of getting away.",
