  "title": "The Matrix: Screenplay",
  "description": "For the first time in the acclaimed Newmarket Shooting Script series format, the screenplay for one of the most successful films in history. A surprise box-office hit when it opened in theaters in the spring of 1999, The Matrix has proven to be nothing short of a phenomenon, setting records for DVD sales, winning four Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound & Best Sound Effects Editing and spawning two sequels for release in 2002 and 2003. The extraordinary vision of writers/directors Larry and Andy Wachowski is captured in its purest form with the film's shooting script. The tale of Thomas Anderson, aka Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker forced to confront his special destiny in the salvation of humankind, challenges our perceptions of reality and expands our expectations of what a movie can be. The 122 pages of the script are presented in facsimile form. Also included are scene notes about the script written by Phil Oosterhouse, assistant to the Wachowskis throughout the making of the film; 20 b/w film still photos & full credits.",
