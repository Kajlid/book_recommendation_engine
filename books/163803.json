  "description": "Smart-mouthed, insecure Alice Wunderlund likes to hide in the shadows. So being a Private Investigator is the perfect job for her. But when Allie is assigned to observe and record the daily activities of a British aristocrat, she starts to feel more like her namesake than is healthy. And when a gorgeous, lethal, hunk of an Irishman appears in her room, takes one look at her and bites her neck, she knows ‘Eat Me’ has just been taken to a whole new level. Connor O’Brien is an ex-cage fighter turned Scorpio Son, one of an elite genetically engineered band of cloned warriors fighting to save the planet from secret invaders. When his brother Cam reports being watched, Connor goes to investigate, only to find more than he bargained for: A mate who turns him from an easy-going player into a moody, one-woman-man in an instant. But Allie isn’t looking for a mate, certainly not one who turns cat when aroused. So she gives him an ultimatum he can't possibly agree to: share her in a threesome or not have her at all. For Connor, who doesn’t share, ever, this is just the first of many challenges he must overcome on his path to claiming the beautiful PI whom scientists had created just for him.",
