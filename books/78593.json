And not only that, he really wants to bite her. In the second story, Billy has been yearning for centuries for the woman he accidentally killed as a novice vampire in Constantinople. Now she's back, reborn as Esther, the explorer. Exiled in the Arctic, Billy is already battling his lust to devour her all over again. And lastly—the only way that Merle Cobalt can save her father's life is to spend 25 days living with renegade vampire Darius Cole. But vampires are known for their mind-controlling powers, and Merle knows that after spending so long with Cole her free will could become a thing of the past.",
