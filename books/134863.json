Bella is a victim of her husband’s cruelty; who can help her break free from years of abusive oppression? Tumultuous events shape the lives of these women. Old and new friendships help steer a course through a year of crisis. Is love enough for a marriage in modern times?'Journeys' received a Highly Commended award in the Bloomsbury 'How Strong is Your Book Idea?' competition, in conjunction with Mumsnet. The judges commented: 'Not so much \"Sex in the City\" as \"Tumult in Tunbridge Wells\" and as such a book that will mirror the domestic dramas of many modern women, and will appeal to them as they too try juggling friendships, relationships, careers and motherhood in their own lives.'Jane Sheridan is new to the writing profession, adding authoring to an impressive career as a chartered engineer and director of her own structural design business. She lives and works with her husband in Sandwich, Kent.",
