  "description": "Ceedon’s Valley is like most other small towns nestled deep in the Northern woods of Central Canada: It’s location seems deliberately chosen to frustrate on-lookers; its past holds secrets only reluctantly whispered amongst those of the present; nothing is ever really amiss, except for the disappearance of the odd camper every once in a while…. And, oh yes, the residue of magic, breathed into life by the alchemists who first settled the area, still pollutes the air.Michael Gregory is a lanky teenager with a solid ‘C’ average. Like most of the other residents of Ceedon’s Valley he has lived there all his life — his roots run deep in the area. Perhaps it is those deep family roots which allow him to feel the pull of an ancient magic. When he yields to its call he finds that he is suddenly the benefactor of immense knowledge. His ‘C’ average is obliterated by top marks — no matter how many grade levels he is advanced — across the board. It seems that there is no subject presented to him that he does not already know about in exhaustive detail.But being privy to such boundless knowledge is not without its consequences. It soon becomes obvious that the same magic that has imparted on Mike this “gift” is intent on extracting from him a steep price: He can feel it painfully invading both his body and his mind.Brushed off by friends and family, it is left to Michael to wrest the parasitic magic from his person, if not from Ceedon’s Valley, once and for all. However, as he tries to formulate a plan, he becomes frustrated with the realization that the only subject he does not seem to be versed in is this magic and how to stop it.",
