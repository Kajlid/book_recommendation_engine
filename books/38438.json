  "description": "Pico, Texas is full of secrets, as Chris discovers when his family unwittingly moves into the town’s haunted house. As an Asian adoptee relocating from a big city, Chris worries about fitting into a small-town high school still using a Rebel soldier for its mascot. But, to his relief, the attitudes of the town are changing, and soon he has friends, a job, and a cute new neighbor. Still, the shadow of a less tolerant time lingers. Sixty years ago, Charlotte Monroe was murdered in Pico, hanged from the oak outside of Chris’s bedroom window. Chris is sure that it’s her ghost he hears every night. As the weeks go by and Charlotte’s midnight wailing gives way to violent outbursts, Chris knows that to save his family he must put the sins of the past to rest.",
