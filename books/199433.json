  "description": "We live with minds as open and spacious as the deep blue sky. Living in Blue Sky Mind presents basic Buddhist teachings that keep us on the wholesome path of self-realization toward a happy life. Zen priest and teacher Richard Gentei Diedrichs offers simple lessons, anecdotes of personal transformation, and reflective questions to guide us along Buddha's enlightened way, such as-- \"Buddha advised that we not speak with malice if we want to create connection and happiness around us;\"-- \"We learn that to be happy, we need to end our suffering and the suffering of those around us;\" and-- \"We are fortunate to have a way to be happy with what we have and with who we are.\"",
