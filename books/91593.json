  "title": "The Lady in Medieval England 1000-1500",
  "description": "80 b/w + 10 color illustrations 6 x 9 Although a number of books portray the life of nobility in medieval England, most present the romantic ideal rather than reality. This new paperback edition of Peter Coss's insightful work focuses on the lady's role in medieval society and how she related to and participated in the prevailing male culture of gentility. Equally important, the author discusses how the lady was perceived both by herself and by her male counterparts. Peter Coss is professor of medieval history and director of the Centre for the Study of Medieval Society and Culture at the University of Wales, Cardiff. He has published several books on medieval society. He has also served on the council of the Royal Historical Society.",
