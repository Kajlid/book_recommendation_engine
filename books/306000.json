  "description": "Once upon a time, I was innocent — and then they destroyed me.Left me for dead.The boys of Havoc House don’t think I remember what they did to me.But they’re going to pay for all of it.I’ll cross each of them off my list until I’m the last one standing. And I will do anything to make it happen.Even pretend to fall in love.People like to say that revenge is a dish best served cold. But it takes planning and patience to seek true vengeance when you’ve been wronged.And the best revenge takes time. You have to smile when you want to scream. Laugh, when you want to cry.Play nice, while you dream about going for the jugular.For that, you need boiling rage.I am the cleansing fire that will burn St. Bart’s Prep to the ground.Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. But I can’t wait on heaven, so instead I’ll raise hell.Coming November 2020",
