  "description": "Thrown to the Wolves Book 1 of \"The Faith in Peril Trilogy” The Glick children are precocious and exuberant, chasing rainbows and butterflies and living happily on their farm in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. But when five-year-old Jacob Glick wanders off into the woods, his sisters, Rebekah and Anna, are obliged to retrieve him. The siblings soon stray too far, as darkness falls, and they are lost. Rebekah, the oldest of the children, is eighteen and ready to marry, although the man she has had her eye on is courting someone else. To her chagrin, only Daniel Stoltzfus has offered for her, but an incident in the past is the reason she is so determined to give him a wide berth. Never, under any circumstance, would she consider courting Daniel. While lost in the woods and struggling to survive, the Glick children are forced to find food and shelter. Rebekah and Anna are tested not only mentally and physically, but also in their faith, as they are pushed to the limits of what they can endure. A danger lurks, stalking them, and, when they are attacked by wolves, it’s quick-thinking and luck that saves them, but the ordeal is far from over.",
