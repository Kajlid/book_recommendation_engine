Ruthless gangs patrol the highways and danger lurks in the shadows. A new friend, a new settlement and things are looking up, though all is not what it seems.  In no time at all they find themselves in the worst kind of trouble. Now they have to pick a side. Whose will they choose?  Safety comes at a price. Is it one theyâ€™re willing to pay?",
