They lock gazes, and ...She recognizes him.As the sexy vampire heartthrob she watches on TV every week.Peaches and Dalton Deangelo are completely wrong for each other. He's only in town temporarily, working on an indie movie. She should stay away before she gets burned.

He says a lot of dramatic things, but it's his carbohydrate-free perfect body and sexy touch that turns Peaches to Jell-O.Will they be able to make it as a couple?
