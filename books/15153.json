  "description": "Book 2 of the Ftizwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy recounts Darcy's activities during the \"silent time\" in Jane Austen's original novel. With Bingley's affairs brought to a conclusion, Darcy leaves London for Pemberley and Christmas with his sister and their Matlock relations and to find answers to the mystery of Georgiana's recovery. Later, restless and determined to end his infatuation with Elizabeth Bennet, he accepts an invitation from an old University friend to attend a house party at the family castle with the intent of finding a suitable wife. The Social Diamonds he meets there are more than willing, but it is the unknown, lovely, and mysterious half-sister of his host who might just banish Elizabeth from his heart. With a nod to Austen's Northanger Abby, Duty and Desire takes Darcy on a \"gothic\" trip into the other side of Regency society.",
