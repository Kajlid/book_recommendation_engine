  "title": "Missing Magic",
  "description": "Thanks to his influential uncle Kelver, Ned’s gotten into an elite new school. But there’s a problem—everyone there can do magic. And Ned? Not a lick. Amidst whispers of the terrifying Necromancers (rumored to be kidnapping unsuspecting kids!), Ned struggles to adjust to his new situation, avoid making enemies, and jump-start his magic skills, all with very little luck. Then, just as he’s getting accustomed to having his hair turned into snakes and his books into bricks, the Necromancers strike! Ned and his classmates are kidnapped. But without magic, how can he possibly help them escape? Things can’t get any worse—until they do. Full of entertaining incidents and a great shocker near the end, Missing Magic is one compulsive read. Emma Laybourn has created a sparkling adventure and a charismatic underdog—readers just can’t help rooting for Ned.",
