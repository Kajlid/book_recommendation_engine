Born a Caputo, an Italian mafia family feared on the American east coast, I’m more like them than I care to admit.The only daughter of Antonio Caputo, rage and fire course through my veins the same as it does my father and my brothers. I was bred for violence. I thirst for blood. I was raised to never back down. I’m hungry for the power they all hold.I pretend to be the princess Daddy wants me to be.To the outside world I’m the angel among monsters. I’m a good liar. An even better player. I even have him fooled—the one person I never meant to hide myself from. I’m done hiding. The day I shed my cap and gown the real me came out.He still hasn’t figured out it’s all just a coverup. No matter how many times I told him I wasn't the good little girl he thought I was, he didn’t believe me. He never thought I could handle him, pretending I didn’t exist.Truth is—he’s the one that can’t handle me, and he’s about to see how bad I can be.",
