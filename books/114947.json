Happiness is just within her reach when tragedy strikes, ripping everything away, leaving Liz so hopeless and desperate that she attempts the unthinkable…. Braxton Wright cares only for three things: his bars, making money, and his mother. He doesn’t do relationships, stays far away from girls that need anything other than one night. Meeting Liz leaves him conflicted; wanting to know her, to keep her, but scared she will crack the foundation he’s sacrificed so much to build. As Liz learns to live again, Braxton’s life shatters, leaving him in a million pieces. Could love be enough to bind two broken people, or will the world succeed in tearing them apart…",
