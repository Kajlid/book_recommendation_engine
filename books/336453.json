  "title": "Tales from the Zirzameen",
  "description": "Tales from the Zirzameen reflects on Iranian culture and society as well as the American expatriate culture there in the 1970s. The short stories relate how the author became assimilated there, and he shares his experiences leading up to the revolution and in its aftermath.Despite the circumstances under which he left the country-including being taken hostage for a time-the author celebrates the hospitality and rich culture of the Iranian people. He was welcomed warmly into their society and came to appreciate the sincerity and kindness that characterized the people he met.It is hoped that placing the people of Iran in greater historical context might familiarize the American people with this ancient culture, showing the human faces that lie behind the current political propaganda. The objective is peace and recognition of our common humanity.",
