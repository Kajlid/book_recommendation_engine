  "description": "Gary Gray marries his first girlfriend, a fellow student from Central Florida Christian College who loves Disney World as much as he does. They are nineteen years old, God-fearing, and eager to start a family, but a week before their wedding Gary goes into a waffle house bathroom and lets something happen. God says no is his testimony--the story of a young Black Christian struggling with desire and belief, with his love for his wife and his appetite for other men, told in a singular, soulful voice. Driven by desperation and religious visions, the path that Gary Gray takes--from revival meetings to \"out\" life in Atlanta to a pray-away-the-gay ministry--gives a riveting picture of how a life like his can be lived, and how it can't.",
