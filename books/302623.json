  "description": "It was shocking how quick love could turn to hate.In a matter of seconds my life went from perfect to ruined.Trust became a mythical, make believe fairy tale.Eight-years of my life was destroyed because I trusted the wrong person.I wouldnâ€™t be making that mistake again.At least, that was what I told myself.Life got lonely.And I fell in love with someone I had never met.Online.She lived across the country. That was so much easier than dealing face to face.It didn't make the relationship real.Until she showed up on my doorstep.Not looking a day over eighteen.Telling her to hit the road was easy,The Cruel Infatuation was not.Then another surprise showed up.And my life was on the brink of going up in flames yet again.",
