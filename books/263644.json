  "description": "Long Live the Beautiful Hearts is the emotional, heart-wrenching conclusion to the Beautiful Hearts Duet by bestselling author, Emma Scott. Never again would I allow my heart to become the plaything of someone else. Never again would I let a man (or men) come between me and my goals. Never again would I love without feeling the fullness of that love in return. Not until I knew it was real. And if that took me a lifetime to find, so be it. Those were my vows, and after all that had happened with Connor and Weston, I was determined to keep them. To protect my heart. And then he came home, and my vows became his promises. He held my heart in his hands with reverence and care. He helped me find my soul's greatest purpose in life. He loved me with a love so pure and vibrant, I knew I'd never feel anything like it in a hundred lifetimes. It was real. Until it wasn't. Until it all came crashing down when I discovered the deep love I thought I'd found was nestled in a web of lies—so soft and silken I hadn't noticed it was there. Until it was too late. ********** Long Live the Beautiful Hearts, a contemporary romance, is NOT A STANDALONE. It should be read after first reading Bring Down the Stars.",
