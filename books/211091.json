  "description": "Anna Kelly Sweeney is a writer of popular fiction intent on worldly success. Leo is an idealist who lives in rural County Kerry and devotes himself to poetry, culture and innumerable worthy causes. When Anna falls in love with the handsome and enigmatic Vincy, and Leo with troubled publicist Kate, the consequences of their glimpsed happiness reverberate beyond their own insulated worlds. Inspired by Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, this panoramic and compulsively readable new novel is an intelligent, witty and fiercely humane insight into modern Ireland. \"\"In this modern take on Anna Karenina, Anna Kelly Sweeney is an affluent Dublin housewife whose vast literary and financial aspirations fail to match her talents. . . A bruising commentary on the new Irish culture conveyed with a grin.\"\" --Booklist",
