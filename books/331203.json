  "title": "Presence : Human Purpose and the Field of the Future",
  "description": "Radical and hopeful - Presence synthesises cutting-edge thinking, firsthand knowledge and ancient wisdom Human Purpose and the Field of the Future gives the reader an intimate look at the development of a new theory about change and learning. A book built around a series of wide-ranging conversations over a year and a half, Senge, Scharmer, Jaworski, and Flowers explore their own experiences and those of one hundred and fifty scientists and social and business entrepreneurs in an effort to explain how profound collective change occurs. Their journey of discovery articulates a new way of seeing the world, and of understanding our part in creating it - as it is and as it might be. Presence explores the living fields that connect us to one another, to life more broadly, and, potentially, to what is \"seeking to emerge.\" Seven capacities underlie our ability to see, sense, and realize new possibilities. Developing these capacities accesses a deeper level of learning that is the key to creating change that services the whole - ourselves, our organizations and the communities of which we are a part.",
