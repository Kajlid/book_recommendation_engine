  "description": "30 DAYS (Time is Now)An anthology of illustrated poems about science, cosmology and nature. The gold-foiled softcover book contains 30 illustrated poems and scientific notes. Listed as one of the Best Science Books of 2014 by Maria Popova. This is a limited edition print run of 1000.These illustrated poems were created, one per day, during April 2013, for National Poetry Writing Month, an annual international event. I was reading about cosmology at the time, and as I took my habitual walks across the marshes, I pondered on the dimensions of space and time through which I was passing, as well as existing euphorically in the moment with the first stirrings of spring. The poems followed naturally through, allowing me to weave a pattern of deep emotion through a weft of scientific fact. The illustrations came about from my collection of paper ephemera, and a lot of digital manipulation. Where I have used scientific images, I have credited these.This beautiful, gold-foiled softcover anthology contains all 30 illustrated poems and includes scientific notes.",
