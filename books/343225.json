Stigmatized in the media and fought over in the halls of Washington D.C., this is the true story of what is really happening on the U.S./Mexican border.Borderline provides an inside look through the eyes of former U.S. Border Patrol agent Vincent Vargas, who is no stranger to violence, having served in Iraq and Afghanistan with the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment.The story begins on the battlefields of the Middle East and culminates on the southwest border of the United States, where Vargas was tasked with protecting his country, his fellow agents, and the immigrants caught in the middle. He learned firsthand about the unforgiving brutality of the cartels, human traffickers and the desert.After bearing witness to the carnage, Vargas made the decision to join the Border Patrol’s elite search & rescue unit called BORSTAR.With almost unfettered access, Vargas provides an in-depth, never-before-seen look into the U.S. Border Patrol, from the agency’s origins to its present-day missions.",
