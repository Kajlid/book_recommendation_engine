  "title": "Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity",
  "description": "This classic manifesto is “a foundational text for anyone hoping to understand transgender politics and culture in the U.S. today” (NPR)*Named as one of 100 Best Non-Fiction Books of All Time by Ms. Magazine* In Whipping Girl, biologist and trans activist Julia Serano shares her experiences and insights—both pre- and post-transition—to reveal the ways in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and sexuality as a whole.Serano's well-honed arguments and pioneering advocacy stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. In this provocative manifesto, she exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive.In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about being transgender, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work to embrace and empower femininity—in all of its wondrous forms.",
