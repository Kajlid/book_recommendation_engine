  "description": "Devon Chastain has always been angry. He burns with it, is consumed by it, lashing out at friend and foe alike and securing his reputation as a difficult noble son for all to see. Now that his family has betrayed the crown, Devon is a mess of emotion he can’t control, and he finds himself discovered by none other than Sebastien d’Hiver, the mad duke who, rumor says, once killed his entire family and sold his soul to a demon.He will find, soon enough, that only the last half of the rumor is true. Sebastien d’Hiver is a man given over to the dark that is all he or his demon has ever known, and it isn’t until he drags Devon to the eerie country manor he calls home that he realizes that there’s more to life than pain. Soon, all three of them, noble, traitor, and demon alike, will find in each other the light they’ve all been missing.(Please note: This book takes place in a \"biological imperative BDSM universe\" in which everyone is born either a submissive or a dominant, and is compelled to satisfy those urges. It does not intend to represent real-life BDSM practices between consenting adults, and should be read only for entertainment purposes.)",
