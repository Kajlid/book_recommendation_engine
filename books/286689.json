  "description": "When I met Katerina Ricci, I’d just knocked out the Easter bunny.    After coming off an overnight tour, yeah, I made some bad choices.   I’m my baby sister Joey’s legal guardian, and I work long hours as a firefighter to make a better life for us.   Now she’s in trouble at school. And after my unfortunate bunny brawl, they want to ensure there’s a stable presence in my sister’s life.   Someone like Kat, whom I begged to pose as my fake girlfriend to convince the school Joey is in good hands.   But fake soon becomes all too real. And we get very naked.   A time or sixteen.   Kat is exactly who we needed in our lives. She also looks exceptional nude, a fact I surely wish my sister hadn’t accidentally seen for herself.   Whoops.   There’s only one problem. Kat’s overprotective dad is the fire chief, aka my boss. I’m up for a promotion, one I desperately need. One we need.   But giving up my stand-in girlfriend isn’t an option.   Not anymore.   Author’s note: Austin Lancaster is a single father, although he didn’t become one the old-fashioned way. STAND-IN DADDY features characters introduced in CEO DADDY and is a standalone romantic comedy with no cliffhanger and a happily-ever-after.",
