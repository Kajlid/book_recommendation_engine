  "description": "\"Oh dear,\" said Paddington, as everyone turned to look at him accusingly. \"I'm in trouble again.\" Somehow trouble comes naturally to Paddington. What other bear could upset the whole cinema by standing on his seat to boo the 'bad guy' in the cowboy film? Or drip ice-cream on the people down below? Or flood the launderette and saw Mr Curry's kitchen into little pieces? Only Paddington! But when Paddington's head is so full of ideas, some things are bound to go wrong!",
