  "title": "The Plaster Fabric",
  "description": "When The Plaster Fabric appeared in 1957, homosexuality was illegal in Great Britain and both Martyn Goff and his publisher risked prosecution for the book’s frank treatment of gay themes. The story finds Laurie Kingston, a former Royal Air Force pilot, now working in London as a bookseller and artist. He is a man with a secret, having spun a web of lies to conceal his homosexuality which, if discovered, could cost him his job, his friends, and even his freedom. After a chance encounter with Tom Beeson, a rugged soldier, Laurie finds himself falling in love. But his already dangerous gets more difficult when his best friend, Susan, also falls for Tom. Laurie runs the risk of losing it all as the fabric of his carefully constructed life begins to chip away like flakes of plaster . . .Worthy of a place alongside early gay classics like Rodney Garland’s The Heart in Exile (1953) and Mary Renault’s The Charioteer (1953), The Plaster Fabric has been reissued in this new edition, which includes an introduction by Martin Dines and the original cover art by John Minton.***REVIEWS:“It is doubtful whether since male homosexuality was admitted as a subject for treatment in English fiction it has inspired a more satisfactory novel than Martyn Goff’s The Plaster Fabric.” – Spectator“Mr. Goff’s earnest handling of his extremely delicate subject, homosexuality, commends him to serious attention . . . The sense of impending doom, of the hostility of society, of insecurity, and the constant terror of betrayal are all well conceived.” – John Betjeman, Daily Telegraph“[B]rave … plainly the work of an intelligent novelist.” – Times Literary Supplement",
