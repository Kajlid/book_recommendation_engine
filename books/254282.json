  "description": "What would you do if your beloved girlfriend suddenly became your worst enemy? That dilemma’s all too real for Syl Skye.As the last princess of the fair Fae, Syl is all things brightness and sun and white flame, but even though she’s Summer incarnate, she’s drawn to Rouen Rivoche, the dark Fae princess-assassin of the Winter Court.They should be mortal enemies, but they’re best friends. Girlfriends. In love.That is, until an old enemy puts Roue under a dark spell that makes her forget all about Syl, their lives and their love. Now Roue rules Dark Faerie as a cruel and cold Queen, and she wants nothing more than to destroy Syl and her fair Fae people.  Worse, both opposing Faerie realms stand on the brink of utter destruction, and only their queens, Syl and Rouen, can save them—and only if they can put their differences aside for two seconds and fight together as allies.But how can you fight against an enemy when your true nemesis is on your team?",
