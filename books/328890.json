  "description": "How can a fairy's blessing be such a curse?At her birth, Ella of Frell was the unfortunate recipient of a foolish fairy's gift—the “gift” of obedience. Ella must obey any order, whether it's hopping on one foot for a day and a half, or chopping off her own head! But strong-willed Ella does not tamely accept her fate. Against a bold backdrop of princes, ogres, giants, wicked stepsisters, and fairy godmothers, Ella goes on a quest to break the curse—once and for all.",
