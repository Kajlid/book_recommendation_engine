  "description": "Tabitha has her freedom but she didn't expect the loneliness.Alone. Stranded without family or friends, money or work on the edge of the wilderness. That's not what Tabitha bargained for when she left Victorian England eagerly anticipating a new life. In America she wouldn't be the young widow to be pitied dependent on her dead husband's family. God will provide. Tabitha clings to the promise. He will provide a job. A place to live. New friends.But what about the love of a husband? Dare she hope for that? Etienne Rousseau, the charming Frenchman she met on the ship, offers one solution to her loneliness, while rough-edged Lucas Hayes offers another. Perhaps one of these men is part of God's provision for her. . . .",
