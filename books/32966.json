  "description": "Miya, a proud and arrogant member of an asexual race, is overcome by her submissive and sexual reaction to a stranger. He takes her to his planet where she finds herself at his whim and mercy both physically and mentally. He eventually comes to control not only her body but her heart. This novella contains strong, thematic elements of domination/submission and BDSM as well as explicit and graphic descriptions of sexual situations. The experience is portrayed in a sensuous, romantic and erotic fashion but it is not light BDSM.",
