  "description": "For a shifter, and an omega at that, Reed has never fit into pack life. Popping out pups and keeping house for a bossy male isn't in his plans. He dreams of exploring a wider world and experiencing all the interesting things that humans have devised. Too bad his sire has other ideas, and Reed's wishful thinking turns into a desperate bid for freedom. When a foreign beta picks him up on the road, he fears his future is doomed. Daniel is the rare shifter who has transitioned out of pack life and into the hustle and bustle of human society. His carefully crafted life was already turned upside down once by rescuing an abused omega. Now he's racing to save Reed from a similar fate. Pure luck, or maybe the will of the Gods, have brought him to the boy before his sire sells him off to the highest bidder. His only problem is in convincing Reed to trust him. Time is not on Daniel's side and when Reed's pack catches up with them, there is only one option on the table. He can only hope that the omega forgives him for taking it. When duty turns unexpectedly into desire, he sets about wooing the pretty boy. Mistrustful and defiant, Reed resists until Daniel's plan of seduction proves too tempting. But there is a secret between them and revealing it could doom their growing affection.",
