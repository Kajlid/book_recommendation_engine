  "description": "Winner of theÂ Caldecott Medal! For fans of Blueberries for Sal , One Morning in Maine , and Make way for Ducklings .\"Out on the islands that poke their rocky shores above the waters of Penobscot Bay, you can watch the time of the world go by, from minute to minute, hour to hour, from day to day . . .\" So begins this classic story of one summer on a Maine island from the author of One Morning in Maine and Blueberries for Sal . The spell of rain, the gulls and a foggy morning, the excitement of sailing, the quiet of the night, the sudden terror of a hurricane, and, in the end, the peace of the island as the family packs up to leave are shown in poetic language and vibrant, evocative pictures.",
