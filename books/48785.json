  "description": "When god Dionysus manipulates the lives of two struggling performers, the consequences are as dramatic as theatre itself. God of Wine is a dark tale of alcoholism, obsession, and a decision that will mean life or death to a troubled Broadway star.HarperCollins UK Review of God of \"This is a great idea for a novel. The morally ambiguous god of theatre and debauchery interfering with the lives of two bright young things on Taylor, a star with a dark past, and Kristen, a hungry young would-be actress who will stop at nothing to get what she the love of a married man.Suspense builds as Kristen abandons one after another of her morals and the two protagonists slowly move towards one another and, we suspect, romantic tragedy.There is great stuff here. The romantic tension that builds as Kristen relentless pursues Taylor is convincing and absorbing, and Taylor is a great character - charismatic, alluring, but believably damaged. I also love the idea of a book set in the theatre world, which is continually fascinating.\"There's narrative momentum to the way events unfold. What exactly is going on between Dionysus and Taylor? How far do his powers extend and does Kristen have a hope in hell of undoing the damage he's convinced her to do?\"",
