  "title": "The Harem Exposé: Training of a Harem Slave",
  "description": "Vickie is onto a story that might make her career. She has information that harems, traditional harems, where women are held as slaves – against their will – still exist in parts of the world. But, how to get the story? After a contentious interview with the Sultan of Esham, a small country where women have no rights at all, Vickie is even more determined to unearth the barbaric practice. Not to be denied, she enters the country, disguising her true sex. Once inside she is determined to learn the truth and expose it to the light of day.  How will she deal with the truth when she comes face to face with it, and it is even more degrading, more dehumanizing than she expected? Can she protect herself from exposure? What happens to a woman who pretends to not be a woman in a land where women are little more than property?  And, what does happen inside the harem? Harem slaves are prevented from escaping by high walls, chains, and discipline. Even a well-behaved slave may find herself helplessly strapped to a punishment bench and canned for even minor transgressions. She begs for mercy – but finds none.  This book is for adult readers. It contains depictions of corporal punishment, tight restraints and bondage, humiliation, and sexual exploitation. This is not a story of consensual loving play.  Adults only. 116,000 words.",
