  "title": "Kant's Analytic",
  "description": "Mr Bennett, as was to be expected, has written a 1st-rate book on Kant's Analytic. It's vivid, entertaining & extremely instructive. It will be found of absorbing interest both by those who already know the Critique & by those-if there are any such-who have a developed interest in philosophy, yet no direct acquaintance with Kant. These last it will surely drive to the text &, as surely, will drive them to approach it in a truly philosophical spirit. Bennett's Kant isn't a giant immersed, or frozen, in time. He's a great contemporary-a little out of touch, admittedly, with recent developments in mathematics & physics-but one with whom we can all argue, against him, at his side, or obliquely to him. So Bennett does argue, continuously, fiercely & fruitfully; & summons to join in the argument, at appropriate moments, those older contemporaries, Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley & Hume, & those younger contemporaries, Wittgenstein, Ryle, Ayler, Quine, Quinton, Warnock etc. This is splendid, & a necessary corrective to that extraordinary isolation in which Kant tends to be islanded, partly indeed, by his own unique qualities, but partly by oceans of the wrong kind of respect. Bennett, continuously engaging his great antagonist, shows the right kind.",
