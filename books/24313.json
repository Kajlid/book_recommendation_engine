  "title": "Shamrock Tea",
  "description": "Shamrock tea, the magical substance that allows people to experience the world with visionary clarity, can only be found by passing through the famous van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage. The characters who bear this knowledge include a young boy named Carson, his uncle Celestine, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the nephew of a famous Belgian writer. Vividly colorful, Shamrock Tea —nominated for the 2001 Booker Prize and winner of a Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2001—invites readers to enter another world.",
