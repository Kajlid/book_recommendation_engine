  "description": "Joanna Yoder grew up on a primitive Amish farm in Ohio. It was a land of horse-drawn buggies, picturesque cornfields, and hay-filled barns--a land of submissive wives, obedient children, and bearded dominant males. It was also a land that Joanna was determined to flee, no matter what the cost. Her journey to freedom took her from a one-room Amish schoolhouse to the competitive world of university sports and a degree in marketing. After accepting a position with a new and expanding high-end sportswear company in Florida, her world took another giant leap forward. This new and very exiting world now included Bentley automobiles, luxurious hotels, and a mysterious and sexy med student named Carlos. Finally liberated from her smothering past, Joanna welcomed this dream-come-true with open arms. What she didn't know, however, was that dreams can turn into nightmares and nightmares can become reality. To her horror Joanna learns that Carlos will not be satisfied with a night of passion in a five-star Las Vegas hotel. What he wants is more -- much more!",
