It’s defined by those who make us whole—those who make us who we are.And here, at the end, Bear and Otter will be tested like they’ve never been before.There’s a knock at the door from a little girl who has nowhere else to go.There’s a phone ringing, bringing news they do not expect.There’s a brother returning home after learning how to stand on his own.As these moments converge, all of their lives will change forever.Beginning in Bear, Otter, and the Kid, and continuing in Who We Are and The Art of Breathing, TJ Klune has told a saga of family and brotherhood, of love and sacrifice. In this final chapter, the events of the past pave the long and winding road toward a future no one could have imagined.",
