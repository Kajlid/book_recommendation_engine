  "description": "From the silly to the simply smashing, the Chicks in Chainmail are back to save us once again! Whether defending a charity ball against rapscallion pirates or taking names at a medievalist tournament in the Asteroid Belt, whether bringing a snooty loremaster to his rightful comeuppance or protecting our schoolchildren from magically-summoned barbarian invaders, whether weekending in the woods to get in touch with their Inner Warrior or showing giant reptiles that Tokyo's not going to take it anymore, these female fighters will always have what it takes.",
