  "title": "After Words: Real Sex From Gay Men's Diaries",
  "description": "What if you stumbled across someone's diary and there was no one around? Would you read it? Taking this question beyond the hypothetical and neatly eliminating any moral quandaries we open the pages and invite you in. Unabashedly explicit and surging with the immediacy of the moment, these stories of one night stands, rebound romances, and infidelity are often startlingly beautiful and filled with insight. Kevin Bentley is the author of Vintage Photos of an American Icon. He is currently Editor-In-Chief at Council Oak Books in San Francisco.",
