  "description": "Fuzzy, feathered, furry or funny, the stories in Animal Attraction pop with memorable characters- animal and human. From the cuddly gerbil, the lush jaguar to the wise eyes of an Indian elephant, beasts abound in the Animal Attraction anthology from Torquere Press. The animals in these stories have a way of making men come together--in all sorts of sexy ways. Some of your favorite Torquere authors are here--Kiernan Kelly, Sean Michael, CB Potts, B.A. Tortuga, along with the new voices Shanna Germain, Aaron Michaels, and Elazarus Wills. Readers will journey from the jungles of India to the mountains of Colorado to the humid streets of South Beach. Cowboys, veterinarians, doctors, scholars, bookstore owners, and cops mix it up with dogs, cats, horses, owls, and even eagles in these sexy tales of raw animal magnetism.Stories Included:Make Me Beg by Aaron MichaelsBrahmas and Pitbulls by B.A. TortugaA Hound, A Bay Horse, and a Turtledove by Elazarus WillsWhite Mountain by Sarah BlackCold Iron by K.C.
