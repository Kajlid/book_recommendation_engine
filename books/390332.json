  "description": "For over half a century, Martin Gardner has established himself as one of the world's leading authorities on Lewis Carroll. His Annotated Alice, first published in 1960, has over half a million copies in print around the world and is highly sought after by families and scholars alike — for it was Gardner who first decoded the wordplay and the many mathematical riddles that lie embedded in Carroll's two classic stories: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.Illustrated with John Tenniel's classic and beloved art — along with many recently discovered Tenniel pencil sketches — The Annotated Alice will be Gardner's most beautiful and enduring tribute to Carroll's masterpieces yet.",
