  "description": "Tooth And Nailed Hannah Murray So what if there's a psychotic nut after her? Rowan Evans doesn't like the idea of being whisked away by her father's security chief for safekeeping. Jack Donnelly rubs her the wrong way, gets on her nerves, and the last thing she wants to do is spend two weeks under his protective custody-even if he is tall, blond and delicious. Jack has spent a lifetime-and then some-keeping people safe. So when he learned his oldest friend's daughter was in danger, he knew there wasn't anything he wouldn't do to keep her out of harm's way, including kidnapping her. And if it gives him some time to get a little closer to a woman who's always gone out of her way to keep him at arm's length, so much the better. He knows she'll be mad, but he can handle it. Can't he? When a self-sufficient, independent woman butts heads with a stubborn Irishman, there are bound to be sparks. And that's before she finds out he's a vampire.",
