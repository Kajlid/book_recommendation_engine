  "title": "Dylan's Love",
  "description": "James is middle-aged. Dylan is young. James has been unlucky in love and Dylan has never been given a reason to believe in love. James has recently gone through a break-up, and Dylan hates being alone. One day, while James is umpiring for the local under twenty-fives pro soccer team, he has a chance encounter with Dylan. There is an immediate attraction. Sparks fly. Even though James is incredibly attracted to Dylan, he has to wonder if thatâ€™s enough to take the plunge and try to get over his past experiences with love. And even if he wants to take the chance, Dylan is too young...right? How could they ever work as a couple?  A sweet, funny, sporty, and sometimes saucy May/December MM romance.",
