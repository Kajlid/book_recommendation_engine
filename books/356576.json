  "description": "'What if I were to tell you that a psychopathic arsonist might also be the person most likely to save you from a burning building?'* This book is about a special kind of ' flipnosis' . It has an incubation period of just seconds, and can instantly disarm even the most discerning mind. This is the kind of high-wire psychological espionage which, in the right hands, can dismantle any conflict- but which in the wrong hands can kill. Flipnosis is black-belt mind control . It doesn't just turn the tables, it kicks them over.*From the malign but fascinating powers of psychopaths, serial killers and con men to the political genius of Winston Churchill - via the grandmasters of martial arts, Buddhist monks, magicians, advertisers, salesmen, CEOs and frogs that mug each other - Kevin Dutton's brilliantly original and revelatory book explores what cutting-edge science can teach us about the techniques of persuasion .*Fascinating, provocative, and ultimately inspiring, Flipnosis reveals, for the first time, the psychological DNA of instant influence - and how each of us can learn to be that little bit more persuasive.",
