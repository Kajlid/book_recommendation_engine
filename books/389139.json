  "description": "Ava is welcomed home from the hospital by a doting mother, lively friends, and a crush finally beginning to show interest. There's only one Ava can't remember any of them - and can't shake the eerie feeling that she's not who they say she is.Ava struggles to break through her amnesiac haze as she goes through the motions of high-school life, but the memories that surface take place in a very different world, where Ava and familiar-faced friends are under constant scrutiny and no one can be trusted. Ava doesn't know what to make of these visions, or of the boy who is at the center of them all, until he reappears in her life and offers answers . . . but only in exchange for her trust.",
