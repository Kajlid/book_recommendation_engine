  "description": "They met under summer showers ... Vera Markovic only wanted a vacation away from New York where everyone knows her as a Russian Mafiya printsessa of the Markovic Bratva. She didn’t expect to find something worth remembering. And definitely not a man like Alfie Shelby. They fell in love when the leaves changed colors ... As New York City’s notorious fixer, Alfie Shelby always gets what he wants—and when he sets his eyes on Vera, he’ll do anything to keep her ... even if she’s not sure she wants to be kept. And they nearly lost it all when the snow started to fall ... She wants nothing to do with a gangster. A life of crime is all he knows. But neither can deny what they have, even when forces beyond their control try to keep them apart.",
