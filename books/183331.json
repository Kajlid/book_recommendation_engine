  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.Belle’s story begins in the captivating fourth installment of the New York Times bestselling series.  I made myself a promise: No men. No romance. No waiting around for a prince that’s not going to come. Because some girls don’t get happily ever afters. Some girls only get broken hearts.  Which is exactly why I should stay away from him. He’s vile. He’s arrogant. He’s controlling. And I don’t trust him.  But some men get into your blood—under your skin. Some men you just can’t get enough of.  Some men you just crave.  This a full-length novel. It's recommended you read the previous books, but not necessary to enjoy the story.",
