Something tells me that she doesn’t see herself that way at all though.This is why I’ve made it my mission to break her out of her overly cautious shell starting with a lucky penny and a $10 raffle ticket.It was all supposed to be a little fun but when a large dose of lucky graces us, everything suddenly becomes unexpected.LucyHe thinks I don’t see him, but I do.

I can only hope that it’s true what they say…After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love.",
