  "title": "The Boy For Two Witch Girls.: Cambion boy's love for Witch girl, amidst attack from vampires.",
  "description": "Daniel is a normal boy, approaching eighteen, unknowingly good looking to some, living a normal life, losing himself in novels. He dreams, in a way that all boys do, not realising he is a Cambion.For those in the dark, a Cambion is a half-Incubus and we all know how dangerous that can be. Janice, living a few doors down from Daniel, knows she isn’t normal. Okay, it seems quite normal for her to be a red-headed witch, daughter of a powerful witch, but her ambition to be head witch, the first female head witch, had been with her since she was a toddler and is not normal, not even for a witch.Her distraction to her quest however, is staring out of her bedroom window, watching Daniel working-out in his back garden with no fear of vampire attack. Their mothers plot to bring Janice and Daniel together. They know their children need each other to fulfil Janice’s real role in life, they know their children will, one day, marry and that their children will rule the planet. Most of all, the mothers know that these shy teenagers love each other, fear rejection and need a kick-start to send them on their quest.But are we getting ahead of ourselves?“I related to Janice and her quest, obviously, but in chapter fourteen I was Daniel and felt his every emotion.” “Not the usual witches versus vampire story. The emotions shared by Daniel and Janice got to me and I felt for both of them.”Obviously, the themes dealt with in this novel are of an adult nature with some sexual scenes, therefore readership is limited to those over eighteen.",
