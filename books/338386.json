But now, shortly after their eleventh birthday, Luka is gone, the mystery of his fate hidden in the fragmented images that haunt Adam’s thoughts. Inexplicably, Adam finds himself in a synthetic reality created with one aim: to unravel the events surrounding his brother’s death. An old-fashioned train carriage, lit by the soft glow of gas lanterns, is carrying a handful of passengers into the night. On a journey marked by strange events and wondrous transformations, Adam meets a passenger who understands the nature of this construct and its rules. The eccentric and charismatic Dr Verrence Hart offers to guide Adam in untangling his memories in order to uncover the murderer.There is only one catch. The killer is aboard the train. And for the guilty, absolution lies in forgetting the past.",
