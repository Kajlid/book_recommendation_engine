  "description": "Aidan is content. He's got a good job, nice house and is comfortable in the small townâ€”far away from anyone who knows his secrets. Yet, he feels the prickle of something stalking him. It doesn't help when a stranger starts insinuating his way into Aidan's life. Newcomer Seth is attractive in a way that stirs something in Aidan he had thought long buried. Can he keep his secret and continue in his solitary life or will events conspire against him to drag the truth into the light and change everything? (M/M, Novella - 20,000 words.)",
