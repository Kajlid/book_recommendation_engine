  "title": "Breaking up the Band",
  "description": "The members of a rock band often have a complex and tumultuous relationship. For Stephen, David and Kate the tension of years on stage and in cramped tour buses have brought their emotions to the boiling point. Sweat stained, beer soaked and on edge, the three are pushed together as their band is torn apart. In Breaking Up the Band the final nail is put into the coffin and all the passion and hostility comes to a head like the last verse of a hard and violent song. As the three band mates practice alone in a studio, lines are crossed and in a white-hot moment the fire that ignited their creativity burns wild and dangerous.",
