  "title": "Snowmagic, Kalevalan Fantasy",
  "description": "Snowmagic is a gripping story of ancient Finland from the dawn of the earth and the birth of the world's greatest sorcerer, the Eternal Bard. He sung a change into the world and that's when all the trouble began.Written as an homage to the Finnish epic \"The Kalevala\", Snowmagic is an historical fantasy written with mythic exaggeration, larger-than-life characters and a forthright tale-telling style found in \"The Kalevala\". These oral stories passed from generation to generation relate stories which, some say, harken back to the Paleolithic.Grab a cup of coffee, slip into furry slippers and make yourself comfortable in the firelit inglenook and enjoy this trip to ancient Finland's furthest fields.",
