  "description": "Imagine a world where everything is perfect. Everything. There is harmony between all people...between humanity and nature...between people and God. Now imagine yourself transported to this paradise. Just when Carter Friese thinks life can’t get any better—it does. Carter is transported to Gomor, where he gets a taste of what his world (our world) would have looked like if no one ever sinned. Scene after scene unfolds to Carter’s amazement. As he grows in knowledge of God’s original plan for creation (utopian human society, harmony among all creatures, and the active part that heaven takes in each human life), he is satiated with joy and beauty. But Carter’s own spiritual condition opens the door to evil—an opportunity the powers of darkness have long awaited in this pristine realm. Only a close encounter with God prepares Carter for his perilous escorting Euphonie to his world.Euphonie is a song writer who has never known anything but beauty and bliss. When she loses her ability to write lyrics, she becomes an enigma in her world. God assigns her a pilgrimage to regain her gifting.An innocent realm hangs in the balance as the powers of darkness pit one realm against the other. They scheme for nothing short of a second fall.",
