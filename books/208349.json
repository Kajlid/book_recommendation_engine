  "title": "The Biography of a Grizzly",
  "description": "Wahb fulfills the destiny of a silvertip grizzly bear in this Bison Book reprint of Ernest Thompson Seton's classic, originally published in 1900. In vivid language and in seventy-five drawings, the author of Animal Heroes captures for a new generation of readers the freedom and danger, joy and pathos, of Wahb's life. After his mother and siblings are shot by a cattle czar, Wahb grows up alone in the mountains of northwestern Wyoming. As a cub, he collects wounds and stores up hatred for omnipresent enemies—men and beasts. But in maturity he owns the territory. His arms can \"toss pine logs like broomsticks\"; his paws \"with one tap\" can \"crush the biggest bull in the range\"; and his claws can \"tear huge slabs of rock from the mountainside.\" During summers at Yellowstone National Park he is on good behavior, except for his one intimidating visit to the hotel. Now his only enemies are time and the roachback grizzly who challenges his power.",
