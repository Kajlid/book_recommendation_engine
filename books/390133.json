  "description": "A genetically modified food preservative mutates into a world-wide zombie plague, infecting humankind by the billions. As civilization collapses in a spectacular orgy of brain-eating destruction, overweight comic shop owner Mort Lesser must make his way out of his hometown of DuChamp before the local nuclear power plant goes critical. It's no fun being fat when the streets are overrun by hordes of flesh-eating deadheads, but with the help of some new friends-- foul-mouthed redneck Pete Bolin and sexy stunt car driver Zhao Dao-ming-- Mort just might make it out of the city in one piece.Meanwhile, strange creatures stalk the inheritors of this blighted world. Are they mankind's saviors, as their angelic appearances suggest, or something far more sinister?Both a post-apocalyptic buddy comedy and an extremely violent survival horror novel, Mort is one of the most unique and original zombie novels you'll ever read! For mature readers only!",
