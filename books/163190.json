  "description": "Sal and Josh are well on their way to having a little one of their own, but now they have to contend with Lucas and his son Reginald. Lucas has a bone to pick with Josh and this time he doesn’t mind getting his own hands dirty. Josh will have to face a man that he called friend at one time, but then things change drastically when he took on the proposition of saving his friends life. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned and his decline in health is rapidly getting closer to his own demise. This is Lucas’ way of evening the score, but just how far is he willing to go? Does Josh have it in him to kill his best friend or will he have to sacrifice his one true love and the baby?",
