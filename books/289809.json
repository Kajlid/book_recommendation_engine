  "description": "We cut ourselves. Not by accident, we do it purposely—and regularly—because physical pain is comforting, and because now it has become a habit.Nancy doesn't have a best friend, until she meets Katie in the bathroom at school. She and Katie have something in common: they both cut themselves. At first, it's just fun—like the drugs and alcohol and shoplifting—and Nancy and Katie don't talk about why they do it. But soon Nancy realizes that she and Katie need cutting to get through the day. Nancy can cover the scars on her arms and legs. It's the others, the ones inside, that are becoming hard to hide.",
