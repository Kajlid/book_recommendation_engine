  "description": "I finished the story, read the excerpt for the next one, and now I’m counting down until I can revisit Misty-on-the-Sound again. Pepper Sullivan is in trouble. She just moved back to her beachside hometown of Misty-on-the-Sound from New York City to open her own law office. Her real passion is singing, but practicing law is her bread and butter. Now the only other attorney in Misty (and the guy everybody knows she hates) has fallen off a balcony and died—or was he pushed?  Pepper digs deep to solve the mystery with the help of her legal beagle Mr. Woogles, her former high school boyfriend who’s now the town sheriff, and her interfering mom. Along the way, she deals with the challenge of an old house, wacky clients, and the hot Italian doctor who buys the place next door.  With a song in her heart and dogged determination, will Pepper be able to solve the case and absolve the innocent?
