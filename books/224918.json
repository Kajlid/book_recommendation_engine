  "description": "The bet was All I had to do was make a guy fall in love with me in one week. Normally I'd never take such a crazy dare, but I could REALLY use the cash... so how could I say no? Then I met my mystery date. Simon \"Peacock\" Cavanaugh. Or better yet, just call him Simon the C*#k. He's rude, perverse, and his good looks make me hate him even more. Falling in love with a guy like him... it might be impossible. But that's a relief, because really, why would I WANT to be head over heels for a man that's more dick than heart? A guy who thinks a good first date is hooking up in an alley? This simple bet is going haywire. Simon is a player who says he doesn't do romance. I know I'll never let a bad boy like him close to my heart. What if we're both wrong? Peacock is a down and DIRTY romance novel that will make you wonder about online match-making... because are all guys as hot and FILTHY as Simon? ;) Hmmm.",
