  "description": "Fighter.I've always been a fighter, Even before I knew it was in my blood. I fought the demons of my past. I fought for my life. I fought for the future I wanted.Growing up in a foster home, after my father killed my mother, I fought for who I was, Who I could become.And now, it's what I do, what I am. My career is in the ring, taking down every opponent I face, Every enemy who threatens me. I fight.But now, I've got the biggest fight of my life, Fighting for her, the one I want, The one I can't have.Salem Harris is taken, but I swear to God, She'll be mine, even if I go down for the count, I'll fight like Hell for her, Or die trying.",
