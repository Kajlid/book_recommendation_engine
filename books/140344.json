He's also soldier for the United Pakistan Army Commando-a terrorist. In his quest to fulfill UPAC's orders to destroy the Northeastern public school, he finds himself struggling with his loyalties and desires. But not for long. Scott Belgrade is a fiery basketball coach and health teacher. He is also a soldier for his students-a hard-nosed leader who follows his gut. Along with him stand his buddies, coaches, and longtime friends, who are happily sidetracked by talk of hot women and sports. Until they stumble upon the truth of impending obliteration at their school. Can Belgrade and his boys save the school? Can \"the Cat\" save one of his nine lives?",
