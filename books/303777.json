  "description": "Dear Ida,The arrogant man at the dry cleaners made my bad day worse.So, the last thing I expected was for him to offer me a job.I shouldn’t have accepted—not if I wanted to maintain my sanity.But the allure of a big paycheck overpowered my reservations.Now, I know he’s just as infuriating as a boss as he was the first day we met; yet, the sparks that fly between us are far more than on a professional level.The more time I spend with him, helping him secure investors for his new restaurant chain, the harder it is to ignore the attraction between us.Playing with fire, you’re bound to get burned.And this man has seared himself into my soul.Tell me, Ida, is there hope for our future, or is it impossible to really please this Tough Customer?",
