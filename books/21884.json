  "title": "Women in Lust",
  "description": "Lust is urgent, overpowering, and potent. While in real life readers may not always act every time desire calls, in fiction, they can abandon the safety of propriety to seek out lust and sex wherever they find them. The characters in Women in Lust may vary in the objects of their lust, and how they go about acting on it, but what connects them is that pure impulse for a lover. Sometimes he is someone she knows well, a boyfriend or a husband; in other stories, he is a stranger, and is desirable precisely because he represents the unknown. Whether watching a lover playing guitar, going out for a smoke or simply engaging in a chance encounter, these women seize the opportunities presented to them, and savor the lovers who teach them about themselves, helping open them up to new sensual possibilities.Table of   Ladies Who LustNaughty Thoughts  Portia Da CostaGuess  Charlotte SteinHer, Him and Them  Aimee PearlBayou  Clancy NachtSmoke  Elizabeth ColdwellBite Me  Lucy HughesRide a Cowboy  Del CarmenQueen of Sheba  Jen CrossHot for Teacher  Rachel Kramer BusselUnbidden  Brandy FoxSomething to Ruin  Amelia ThorntonGuitar Hero  Kin FallonOdeto a Masturbator  Aimee HermanOrchid  JacquelineApplebeeCherry Blossom  Kayar SilkenvoiceRain  Olivia ArcherThe Hard Way  JustineElyotStrapped  K.D. GraceBeneath My Skin  Shanna GermainComfort Food  Donna George StoreyWinner of IPPY (Independent Publisher) Bronze Award for Erotica",
