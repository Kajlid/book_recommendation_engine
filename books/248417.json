  "description": "Brazil: beaches, babes, samba. Will Bryant is not living in that Brazil. São Paulo is a seething megalopolis of twenty million, built on fast money and old lies. Will is a Canadian in exile, a disgraced ex-cop teaching English to feed his family when he lands a different sort of job, to find out why wealthy men with filthy habits are being blackmailed. The answer will take Will Bryant further than he ever wanted to go. This may be Brazil. But it’s no Carnaval.",
