  "description": "Lauren was haunted by nightmares of monsters as a child, but learned the hard way that the worst monsters look like everybody else.  While visiting her mother and stepfather during the holidays, she’s sent to search for her two younger brothers, who have a tendency to wander onto the land of their nearest neighbor—land that has been abandoned for a reason. When she stumbles across something unexpected, it changes her life forever, drawing her into a world beyond the boundaries of the civilization that has always sheltered her.  There, her courage will be tested, as the monsters she’s always feared when she was a child turn out to be real. When the Minotaur of myth helps her take down a manticore, she wonders if she isn’t still trapped in those childhood dreams. Except there’s nothing childish in her feelings for her bullheaded rescuer.  Asterius has just one chance to prove himself a worthy mate and win the love of the new female that has fallen into the Dead Fall, so she can break the curse upon him.   He knows it will be difficult to win her love, because she’s as beautiful and fierce as any goddess, and he fears she will never be able to see the man beneath the monster.  He will risk everything to protect her from the dangers of the Dead Fall, which seems determined to destroy all life within it.  Author’s Note: 18+ Explicit Content including steamy scenes and graphic violence. The first book in this series is included with The Scorpion’s Mate in a 2-book bundle, available on Amazon through Kindle Unlimited.",
