  "description": "10 Hours and 37 Minutes#1 New York Times bestselling author and master of horror Stephen King teams up with Bev Vincent to present a terrifying collection of short stories that tap into one of King’s greatest fears—air travel— featuring brand-new stories by King as well as Joe Hill, in addition to fourteen classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, and Dan Simmons.INCLUDES A CONVERSATION WITH STEPHEN KING AND BEV VINCENT!Stephen King hates to fly.Now he and coeditor Bev Vincent would like to share this fear of flying with you.Welcome to Flight or Fright, an anthology about all the things that can go horribly wrong when you're suspended six miles in the air, hurtling through space at more than 500 mph and sealed up in a metal tube (like—gulp!—a coffin) with hundreds of strangers. All the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we'll bet you've never thought of before… but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger.Featuring brand new stories by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as fourteen classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, and Dan Simmons, Flight or Fright is, as King says, “ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents... Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight.” This terrifying new anthology will have you thinking twice about how you want to reach your final destination.Table of Contents:—Introduction by Stephen King—“Cargo” by E.
