Tyler goes to see his friend Manny, expecting him to ask for help. Instead, Manny urges Tyler to protect Carine, to take her back to Cold Ridge, away from the temptation to meddle in a murder investigation.What Manny knows is that Carine's at the center of a deadly game. And the only person she can trust is the person she vowed never to trust again: Tyler North. But they're running out of time—because a killer has followed them to Cold Ridge...a killer who has put a murderous plan in motion, with stakes higher than anyone can imagine.",
