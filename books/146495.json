  "title": "The Invisible War: What Every Believer Needs to Know about Satan, Demons, and Spiritual Warfare",
  "description": "Some Christians believe strongly in the existence of demons and spiritual warfare. Others downplay or even ignore the idea. With such divergent views, how are Christians supposed to know the truth about demonic forces at work in this world? Satanic attacks are very real, and this book will examine what every believer needs to know about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare. Available in both a cloth edition and on an audio CD, this provocative book will help Christians understand what the Bible says about these threats and will show them how they can safeguard themselves and their families through prayer. The Invisible War, by popular author Chip Ingram, offers a balanced look at what is going on in the spiritual realm and what believers can do to defend themselves.",
