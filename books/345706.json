  "description": "Sergeant Tabitha Bryce just wants to make a name for herself. But as the youngest junior officer in her crew, she doesn’t get much of a chance to shine. Taking a gamble, she stages a daring one-woman sting. But her plan backfires and she finds herself being stripped naked and sold as a sex slave. To her mortification, it is her stoic, unobtainable captain who buys her freedom.Her new master, Captain Keer, has been the commanding officer aboard Pride of Justice for years and has never lost his cool—until a junior officer with dreams of glory is placed aboard his ship. Now he must get Tabitha out of the mess she’s gotten herself into. But he doesn’t count on the bonus that comes with his new “slave”—a thin silvery cord wrapped around Tabitha’s most intimate areas that won’t come off without some special attention from her new master. Now he must try to free her from permanent sexual bondage to the love knots without losing his heart.",
