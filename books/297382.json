Her new guardian, Celeste, claims to have been a lifelong friend of her nan, and is one eccentric figure among many others who live in the small town, all of whom seem to know something that Andie doesn’t…One evening, when the woods behind Celeste’s house spirit her away, Andie discovers a secret so incredible she can scarcely believe it: she’s half-Fae, half-Witch, and it’s her destiny to find the four Keys that will save the Tuatha De Danann from annihilation.Worlds collide when two of her new friends from school, the sweet, helpful Teagan and the rude bad boy Hunter, join her on her journey to reach the mysterious place known only as Finias. There, they’ll find the first Key: the Sword of Light.As they flee the wicked Fomorians and do battle with the Witch Freya, Andie and the boys forge new alliances and make some more adversaries.
