  "description": "DALE  I'm a mature and very pragmatic person, whom others like to call boring. At least I was...until Harley came back into town...  What do you do when a girl comes back for some petty revenge against you and seduction is part of her game? You pretend to be a millionaire dom, of course. Yeah...it sounded better in theory. My execution keeps ending up in awkward messes, and this game between us gets even messier when I learn more about Harley. She's easy to fall for, even though she's hazardous as hell. What happens when all the games end?  HARLEY  One simple little goal turns into one giant disaster. On the surface, Dale Sterling seemed like an asshole from my past; the typical arrogant guy who boulders through life and anyone in his way. So a little revenge seemed plausible, considering what he did to me once upon a long time ago. In hindsight, it was immature. But revenge has kept me on top of the world since I stopped being on the bottom of everyone's shoes, so I make no apologies for my immaturity. But Dale is weirdly kinky... Everything is going fine...until it gets real. Now the guy I wanted to humiliate is the same guy I'm begging my heart not to stupidly fall in love with. Unfortunately, my heart tends to be stubborn.  *Can be read as a stand-alone *Sexual content *Adult language",
