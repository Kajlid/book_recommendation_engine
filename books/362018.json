Viewers of the film will be eager to read more of this inspiring story. Tyler, a nine-year-old boy, is stricken with incurable brain cancer and begins to write letters to God. He turns his suffering into spiritual lessons for his widowed mother, his embittered adolescent brother, and a troubled postman. Letters to God probes some of the most important and most-often-asked questions that trouble people of 'Why do we suffer?' 'Where is God?' 'Why do godly, faithful children have to battle cancer?' This inspiring story of hope will help readers from all walks work toward greater understanding of God's presence and care.",
