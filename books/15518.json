  "description": "Vindhya Rarissima lives in a world of taboos where love is concerned. In Andsar, on the planet Thain, soldiers are not allowed to have lovers. To love a soldier and to be found out, is to die at the hands of the elders of the village. She loves the soldier, Natoshi, anyway.Natoshi is a soldier in the Mysore Guard, and he is a man tired of war. He doesn't feel he is cut out for the suffering and pain he must inflict, but he doesn't have a choice. His only option out of the Guard would be to confess his love for Vindhya, but that would cost them both their lives.Khyber Bloodfang is Vindhya's younger brother, and he's more normal than most on Thain. He looks almost like a human from the planet called Terra. This is unusual in Andsar, but is there a darker, more ancient, side to Khyber that is unknown to everyone around him?",
