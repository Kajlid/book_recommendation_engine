What eventually unites them is an utterly surprising and terrible twist of fate that shatters their everyday, ordinary tranquility, and all that they take for granted.A prose poem of a novel with a mystery at its center that “recalls To The Lighthouse or Mrs. Dalloway ” ( The Times ), If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things was the recipient of the Somerset Maugham Award and the Betty Trask Award, and was named one of the best books of the year by the Los Angeles Times.",
