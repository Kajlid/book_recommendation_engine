  "description": "Women are the future of American business. According to a recent Nielsen report, women will control two-thirds of American consumer wealth in less than a decade.And yet almost all business and success literature is still written for men—dispensing advice that doesn’t take into account women’s unique strengths or address the demands of family life on mothers.           Think and Grow Rich for Women is a powerful new book—from the award-winning author of Think and Grow Rich: Three Feet from Gold and coauthor of the multimillion-selling Rich Dad, Poor Dad . It combines Hill’s classic Thirteen Steps to Success with case studies of noteworthy women (including Sandra Day O’Connor, Maya Angelou, Katie Couric, Caroline Kennedy, Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Thatcher, Condoleeza Rice, J. K. Rowling, Barbara De Angelis, Marianne Williamson  Angela Merkel , Mary Kay Ash , IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and many more), outlining a master plan for success for all women.",
