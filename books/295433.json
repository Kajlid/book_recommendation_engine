  "description": "Elīya thought she shared everything with her best friend—until Tamar ran away to see the true form of God. And decided that she didn’t owe Elīya an explanation.Yenatru thought he had two friends—until, with only one left, it turned out he wasn’t as close to Elīya as he thought.Elīya’s resorted to putting her all into her college ethics class, but it isn’t giving her the answers she needs.And nothing seems to tell Yenatru the right words to say, for any situation. He can’t even manage to tell Elīya that he's been delving into some deep magic on his own. No one knows that he's creating things with the power of his soul—except the woman he meets in the library. And she calls herself Lucifer.But Yenatru's new friend can't stay a secret forever. Elīya has something she wants so badly that she would do anything for it—anything at all. And it's Lucifer herself who might just be able to offer a deal.If you thought you knew what a book about God, angels, demon college roommates, and motorbiking to Eden would be like, think again.THE STARS THAT RISE AT DAWN is the first book in Ivana Skye’s Šehhinah trilogy, an Abrahamic fantasy series where everyone’s personal life is of cosmic importance—if they aren’t too distracted by essay deadlines or coffee.",
