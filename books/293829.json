  "description": "In Rockhead, 27 year old geographer, Atlas, is obsessed with the intense, athletic world of technical rock climbing—and with the question of whether he should leave his brilliant, controlling girlfriend for an exciting fellow climber. As he and his climbing partner, Dade (whose pregnant wife can't decide if she wants him at home or not), travel across America towards Yosemite, they find themselves searching for the ‘rockhead’—a state of intense mental and physical focus that will help them climb better.During their travels they also struggle with a set of questions that initially overshadow—and ultimately encompass—the rockhead: How do you do a single thing well—like repair your ailing van? How do you love in the right way? And, perhaps the key to it all: how do you live your best life? At the end of the novel Atlas finds his own, powerful answers. He's taken an enormous fall and huddles on a tiny ledge, 2,600 feet high up on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley—so high up that the blood dripping from his broken tooth will evaporate before it ever reaches the ground.​Dade might be dying and the rope that Atlas needs to reach him is in shreds. Atlas must make a fateful decision: to wait for rescue and risk Dade's death, or to try and reach Dade himself by climbing without a rope on the most dangerous section of the route. How Atlas gets to this moment is the story of Rockhead. And how he tackles it, living as if it's last thing he'll ever do, is something that will transform his life--whether he lives for six more decades, or the six seconds it would take for gravity to rip him to the valley floor.",
