  "description": "Autumn, 1888. The population of London is horrified by the atrocious murder spree being conducted by Jack the Ripper. While Metropolitan Police Commissioner Charles Warren throws the bulk of his investigative resources into the search for The Ripper, another, less well publicized killer is at large.  Tucked away on the inner pages of the daily press, a few short articles tell of the strange, unsolved murders taking place on board the carriages of the new-fangled and much-heralded London Metropolitan Railway. Each murder takes place the day after the Ripper killings, as the murderer appears to be taking advantage of the lack of police resources to tackle two major investigations simultaneously.  Inspector Albert Norris is charged with bringing the railway killer to justice, but clues are few and the killer's motive unclear. He is forced to carry out his investigations 'quietly and without causing a public panic' as the authorities seek to maintain confidence in the underground railway system's safety. The press is being told even less, and Norris can count on little help from above as he attempts to solve the inexplicable series of murders.",
