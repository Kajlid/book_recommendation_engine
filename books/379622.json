  "description": "Pete Hamill is a New York native who has never stopped loving his city. In this memoir of his life there, he begins with his first sight of the skyline, from Brooklyn, when he was a boy, and goes on to walk the city's streets, from Times Square south to the tip of the island. Mixing history and architecture with personal recollections, Hamill conveys a deep appreciation for New York and an awareness that the basic tolerance New Yorkers develop toward each other is what holds the place together in all its staggering diversity.",
