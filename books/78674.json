  "title": "The Navigators",
  "description": "From the infamous pink triangles worn by gay prisoners in the death camps of the Holocaust to the fires of the Stonewall Riots; from the gilded closets of Hollywood to the assassination of Harvey Milk, AIDS, and the struggle for marriage equality: seven decades of gay history come to life through the experiences of a former Luftwaffe pilot imprisoned at Bergen-Belsen for his sexuality, his orphaned American nephew, and the family they create in San Francisco. Sweeping in scope yet intimate in focus, THE NAVIGATORS tells the story of how the lives of everyday individuals become the raw materials of history. \"Peoples-Rosenblatt uses his novel to skew a greater Western history to include the gay minority. Although not a text for college classes, this novel is written for both history buffs and gay literature enthusiasts to enjoy,\" Kitty Drexel, edgenewyork.com. \"A brilliant and beautiful book that lets us see history for what it is--the backdrop that shapes both peoples' characters and their lives.\" Angel Curtis, OutSmart Magazine.",
