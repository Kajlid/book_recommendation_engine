  "description": "In the tradition of 1984 and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, 2031: THE SINGULARITY POGROM explores humanity's next great evolutionary challenge. Set in a violent near-future where human and artificial intelligence threaten to merge, 2031 is a clash of wills between software genius Ray Brown, his gifted but troubled son David, and megalomaniac Dianne Morgan, Ray's one-time lover. David Brown's unique ability to mentally communicate with Sentinel, the artificial intelligence running the Internet, marks him as a prime candidate for Dianne's experiment to integrate human and artificial intelligence. Then the tipping point arrives; in a gruesome delivery, David's beloved wife dies birthing a son who seems barely human. The antagonism between father and son grows into hatred as the boy matures. By age six, Martin Brown's powers already exceed David's, and he plots to kill his father in order to claim Sentinel as his own. Human evolution hangs in the balance as David, Ray, Dianne, and Martin clash in an epic conflict that comes to a startling and unexpected conclusion in 2031.",
