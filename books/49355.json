  "description": "Believe it or not, mermaids are real. That is if you can believe Navy Commander Frank Reeves, who has come knocking on marine biologist Gillian Keller's door determined to recruit her into a top secret operation known as Project Mer. OSI has special plans for the mermaid, Onara. But first they must keep her alive and learn how to communicate with her. Soon the military and their civilian team will learn a deadly secret; the Si Raen (pronounced sigh-rain) of Muir Tearmann are not only formidable with a blade, but also possess a power only hinted at in mythology. When Onara's sister, Queen Alari, comes to her rescue, things turn deadly, as the Mer begin a blood thirsty retaliation and Hawaii's tourist population is caught in the crossfire.",
