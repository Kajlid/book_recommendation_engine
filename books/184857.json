That is my command...\"For weeks now, Quen's people have been caught within the Mollag soldiers' deadly net. And Quen alone has been chosen for a grim and desperate task - a quest into the black unknown shadows of the great forest of Thual - to seek out the Wise Ones, to consume the Mollag and rescue his people. But first he must survive the treacherous journey through the forest's forbidden paths. Somewhere... somewhere within Thual, the Great Keepers lie hidden. And the greatest terror of all lies before him.",
