  "description": "Reservations? Yes. A couple. Like: Is Hayden really as interested in me as I am in him? And is my roommate right should I \"beware of hookups\"? Confirmation? Doubtful. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said \"commitment.\" Special Requests? Let me get through this summer without being fired and heartbroken. Let me fall in love this summer. Let me be part of the inn crowd.",
