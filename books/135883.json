  "description": "Her whole life, Lai was told that she’d only live to see eighteen years. In the seemingly utopian community she grew up in, scientists calculated residents’ life expectancies at birth, and that number defined their place within their society. When Lai was given the number eighteen in a community where numbers over one hundred are the norm, her life was considered all but meaningless. As her eighteenth birthday approached, Lai became determined not to be defined by her death date, and then everything started to unravel. After escaping the only life she’d ever known, in a community that she had been taught was all that was left of humanity, Lai is now faced with something even more terrifying: the truth. The Silent Spaces picks up where The Quiet Limit left off, following Lai as she navigates past losses, present confusion, and future uncertainties. She must find a way to survive, all while refusing to give up on those she left behind.",
