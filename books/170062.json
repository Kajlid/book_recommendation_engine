  "description": "The Terminators never sleep. They don't need food or water. The heat of the desert gives them no pause. The darkness of night does not halt their deadly gaze. Bullets won't stop them. Their humanity cannot be appealed to - because they have none. Sent from the future, their mission is clear and unrelenting, to erase the lives of any who threaten their future dominance, any who would attempt to deny the rise of the Machine. But that which man has created, man can destroy, and so . . . the war for the future begins today.ContainsHunters and KillersEndgameSuicide RunDeath ValletThe Dark Years",
