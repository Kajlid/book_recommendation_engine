  "description": "A searing and exhilarating new collection from the award-winning author of The Boys of My Youth and In Zanesville , who “honors the beautiful, the sacred, and the comic in life” (Sigrid Nunez, National Book Award   winner for The Friend ).A New York Times Notable BookA  New York Times Book Review Editors’ ChoiceA Boston Globe  and  LitHub  Best Book of the YearWhen “The Fourth State of Matter,” her now famous piece about a workplace massacre at the University of Iowa was published in The New Yorker , Jo Ann Beard immediately became one of the most influential writers in America, forging a path for a new generation of young authors willing to combine the dexterity of fiction with the rigors of memory and reportage, and in the process extending the range of possibility for the essay form. Now, with Festival Days,  Beard brings us the culmination of her groundbreaking work. In these nine pieces, she captures both the small, luminous moments of daily existence and those instants when life and death hang in the balance, ranging from the death of a beloved dog to a relentlessly readable account of a New York artist trapped inside a burning building, as well as two triumphant, celebrated pieces of short fiction. Here is an unforgettable collection destined to be embraced and debated by readers and writers, teachers and students. Anchored by the title piece––a searing journey through India that brings into focus questions of mortality and love— Festival Days presents Beard at the height of her powers, using her flawless prose to reveal all that is tender and timeless beneath the way we live now.",
