  "description": "Why do zombies scare us? Are they merely our own fear of death given form? Is it their corrupted, rotted appearance or that they retain the appearance of those we once loved? Or is it simply that they want to eat us, and there are always more, and more and more of them hungering for our still-living flesh? In this collection of flash fiction-stories that assault our senses, and then end before we know what's hit us, you'll find some answers to these questions. You may also never look at a graveyard the same way again...-Chris Allinotte",
