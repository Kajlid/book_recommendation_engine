  "title": "Systematic Racism and Capitalism: Alliance of Oppression",
  "description": "We will take a brief but in-depth look at systematic racism and capitalism what they are, how they work, and why we should care. It flows as if the author is having a personal conversation with the reader using history and facts from the slave trade up until what’s going on this very day. This is great for those of us who love to read but don’t have allot of time, or for those of us who don’t read but should. This is also a great starting point for people who are interested in how racism works but don’t want to be intimidated with thick overbearing material. Let’s get a dialogue started, and clear up the confusion on what is not being taught in schools. Since schools don’t want to teach it, parents don’t want to talk about it, and others insist it is no longer a problem. We will have a review of the facts, reasons, and results of how systematic racism and capitalism have been used as weapons to oppress, control, and manipulate people for centuries. We will discuss strategy and solutions to create a change toward universal justice for everyone.",
