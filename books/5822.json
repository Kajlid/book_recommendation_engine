  "title": "Our Appointment with Life: Sutra on Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone",
  "description": "This easily accessible translation and commentary by Thich Nhat Hanh on the Sutra on Knowing the Better Way To Live Alone, the earliest teaching of the Buddha on living fully in the present moment. “To live alone” doesn’t mean to isolate oneself from society. It means to live in mindfulness: to let go of the past and the future, and to look deeply and discover the true nature of all that is taking place in the present moment. To fully realize this is to meet our appointment with life and to experience peace, joy, and happiness this realization brings. A wonderful addition to the library of anyone interested in Buddhist studies.“Our appointment with life is in the present moment. The place of our appointment is right here, in this very place.” Thich Nhat Hanh in Our Appointment with Life",
