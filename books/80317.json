  "description": "The Bishop is growing his vampire followers by leaps and bounds, feeding on the naturally rebellious teenage population. Jael tries to keep one step ahead of the undead and their schemes while maintaining a semi-normal life. But living Amish while still being considered an outsider is beginning to wear on her. With old friends in town for the summer and a boyfriend as loyal as Captain America, Jael is never short of help. Slaying vamps and having people around that you love can be a dangerous combination. Jael has some hard decisions to make and she’s afraid not everyone will be on board. Will she fulfill her destiny or fall into the Bishop’s trap?",
