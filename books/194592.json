  "title": "Ju-On: The Grudge 2",
  "description": "The bloody and vengeful grudge of Ju-On returns in this manga sensation from Japan! The landmark horror film franchise is captured in comics form, opening on a gruesome and tantalizing series of images from an operating room - a lightning storm, gory medical instruments and a single witness to the scene and whatever lay on the table. Cut to peaceful scenes of everyday life that are taking place in and around a familiar apartment complex. But what eerie presence sits just below the surface, itching to manifest itself and take out its deep-seated rage on innocents? What could have caused such hatred, and why is the spirit terrorizing again? The chilling answer to these questions is found in the pages of Ju-On Volume 2.",
