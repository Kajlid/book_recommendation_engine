  "description": "The angel, Kellareal, stopped the genocide of a hundred and forty three human/animal hybrids, who'd been bred as a research experiment and spent their entire lives imprisoned. Against orders, he spirited them away to a dimension and gave them the job of protecting humans whose own hybrid experiment had escaped and become their nightmare.  Rosie Storm thought she was getting a few weeks of tantrum-fueled asylum. The last thing she was expecting was someone like Carnal.",
