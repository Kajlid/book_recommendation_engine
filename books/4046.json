  "description": "It's hard to believe that everyone's favorite fat cat has been around for 20 years and is still going strong. This feline festschrift celebrates \"Garfield\"'s two decades at the top in a host of ways. You can watch the evolution of the characters, take a trivia quiz, or read Jim Davis's top 20 strips. The chubby chap (Garfield, that is, not Davis) even gives a rare interview.It's always fascinating to look back at an enduring piece of pop culture, and \"Garfield\" is no exception. In spite of all the changes that have happened since 1978, it's somehow comforting to read this book and realize that those annoying little things that make life such fun haven't changed a bit. Whether he's dabbling in disco (Saturday Night Feline) or gobbling lasagna, life is always cool for this cat. --Simon Leake",
