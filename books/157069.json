  "description": "This isn’t just a two-year long one-night stand. It’s my life.\nThis is my life. Our life. It isn’t just some careless affair. \nI’ve made the worst decisions a woman could, but I’ll earn my second chance.\nShe can try keeping all the guilt for herself, but I’m just as much to blame. \nLoving Casey wasn’t my biggest mistake. Fighting it for so long was.\nI’ll show her how fearless our love makes me. I’ll protect her torn heart. \nHe still has magic in his eyes. He’s the man who makes me happy.\nHer voice still brings me to my knees. She says my name like it’s sacred. \nI live for the day when I’m his. To take care of him. To love him the way he deserves.\nI can’t wait to be all she needs. I can give her a happy life, security and so much love. \nSometimes two ships never meet in the night, but ours did.\nSometimes the water is rough. It beats you all to hell until you have no choice but get stronger. \nOur love story reads more like a tragedy, but to me it’s clean and pure.\nLet them point their fingers. Without a love like ours, they haven’t really lived. I pity them. \nI’m a cheating wife and a villain. I am his honeybee.\nI’m a snake in the grass and I sleep best when I’m lying next to his wife. \nI want to be his everything.\nI’m nothing without her anyway.\nThis isn’t even close to over.\nIt’ll never be over.",
