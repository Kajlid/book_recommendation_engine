  "description": "Assistant D.A. Alexa Hamilton has just been handed the kind of case that makes the trial of accused serial killer Luke Quentin. Sifting through mountains of forensic evidence, Alexa relentlessly builds her case and prepares for a high-stakes trial ...until threatening letters throw her private life into turmoil. The letters are addressed to Alexa's beautiful 17-year-old daughter, Savannah, who Alexa has raised alone since her painful divorce years before. Alexa is certain that Quentin is behind the letters - and that they are too dangerous to ignore. Suddenly Alexa must make the toughest choice of all - and send her daughter back to the very place that Alexa swore she would never to her ex-husband's world of southern tradition, long memories, and the antebellum charm of Charleston. While Alexa's trial builds to a climax in New York, her daughter is settling into southern life, discovering a part of her family history she's never known. As a family's wounds are exposed and the healing begins, Alexa and Savannah, after a season in different worlds, will come together again - strengthened by the trials they have faced, changed by the mysteries they have unraveled, armed with miracles that are uniquely their own.",
