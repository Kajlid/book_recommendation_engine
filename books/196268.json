  "description": "A human machine that follows her every order…   Jessa is an officer on Lyra, tasked with guarding the space station. She’s professional with her Bio-mech partner, following procedure and keeping her lustful thoughts to herself. It’s easy enough to do, knowing that the Bio-mech units, or cyborgs, aren’t endowed with human reproductive organs.  MCK-397, or “Mack,” as Jessa calls him, notices Jessa’s arousal after they encounter a couple having a sexual liaison in the E Deck. When he goes to question his Bio-mech technician, Godfrey, he comes away from the meeting with certain upgrades and enhancements. Now his feelings for Jessa are anything but professional.  Soon it becomes clear that their feelings for each other will interfere with their working relationship.  But can a human and a cyborg actually fall in love?",
