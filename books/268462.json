  "description": "Anne's begun to make a life for herself in Anuanna, and she is working hard on her studies as a witch. But Anne’s struggles intensify in her new life as she juggles with problems in her school and love life alongside trying to break an ancient spell that has been placed on her by her deceased ancestors. Reviewers Comments: \"I found the story engaging, endearing and quirky at the same time (I loved your fantasy animal constructs! and what they did!). I hope you will continue the story of Anne, The Academy and all the other characters you introduced.”“I really enjoyed your book. I really liked all of the different gifts, it kept it interesting. I enjoyed all of the characters and thank you for the read, it was most enjoyable. I hope I can do the same for any books you write later on!”\"It is exciting, is well structured and has an easy read plot that is perfect for cold winter nights, hot chocolate in hand and a blazing fire in the background. It's comforting, personal and magical. The only other book I have read with such Vigour is Harry Potter. However, because you have differentiated the plot quite significantly, you have given yourself the opportunity to stand in your own spotlight and appreciated for your own storytelling. Your book is something to celebrate.\"NOTICE: This book contains mature content. Age is advised from 17+This book contains adult content such as violence, nudity, sex, and strong language",
