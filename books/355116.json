  "description": "Well, it is for a good cause, Micah Collins tells herself. Queen and Country and all that, even if her suggestion is a bit over the top... Micah offers big money for the local military fundraiser if she can purchase the services of two of England's finest soldiers. And who could be better than devilishly handsome captain Trent Williams and sexy-as-sin captain Clayton Blackwell to help her get rid of the pesky problem of her virginity? Since it's just for the weekend, Clayton and Trent, mates since university, agree to the unknown woman's odd request, not realising they'll all get a lot more than they bargained for...
