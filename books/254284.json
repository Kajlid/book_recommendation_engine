Everything needed to be resolved before his trial; first and foremost, the depth of deceit we’d failed to unravel. The stakes were higher.

CalebMy father was a liar, a manipulator, a killer. He was—me. Only, the longer I’d been away from him, the more those broken pieces of myself had been gravitating back together. Because the mind was a powerful thing. And love—was a weakness. A strength. A four-letter word for loyalty. Where was mine? Not in the hands of the man who’d made me this way. So I didn’t have to wonder what would be the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Instead I wondered, could I stop it?Book THREE in the Things That Matter series.*Can't be read as a standalone.",
