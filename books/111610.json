  "description": "Kim Stanton received an offer of a worry free life for the next four years; all she has to do is agree to have sex with her boss. Derrick Colton offers Kim an internship as his personal assistant. She will be his right hand in his deals and learn much more about business than she will in school. Initially she feels insulted by the prospect of being a kept woman. When her aunt gives her some bad news, and financial problems occupy her thoughts, Derrickâ€™s offer becomes more practical. All those problems and the added benefits of spa treatments and personal shoppers are not enough to sway Kim. There is one temptation that Kim cannot deny no matter how hard she tries. Kim is deeply attracted to Derrick.",
