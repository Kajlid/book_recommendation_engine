  "title": "Destiny: A Romeo and Juliet Retelling",
  "description": "When Destiny Clark is cast alongside her long-time crush Isaac Robinson in their school’s production of Les Misérables, Destiny is horrified to find that she has to be publicly humiliated by acting out her true feelings of rejection onstage. As their rehearsals begin, Destiny realizes the unimaginable: Isaac has developed deep feelings for her despite their vastly different backgrounds and belief systems. But can they find the true message of love in a world full of judgement and fear? Weaving around Destiny and Isaac’s alternating viewpoints, this modern-day retelling of Romeo and Juliet is the first book in a series inspired by the characters of Les Misérables and explores heartbreak, self-discovery, intolerance, and love.",
