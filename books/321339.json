  "description": "“I dreamt of Her again. She leads me through the darkness. At first, the ground beneath us is firm. Then, it starts to turn hazy as if we’re gliding rather than walking. We make our way forward, my hand and Hers knitted tightly together. Something is running through my shoes. I look down but I can’t see anything. Then, it reaches my ankles. It’s water. As we walk further towards the darkness, the water rises up my body. Finally, I am submerged. Her hand gently guides us into the depths of the water, pulling us to the bottom.”Film director, social media influencer, professional provocateur – these are the self-proclaimed titles bestowed upon Victor Weiss, a foul-mouthed and controversial film director working in the burning heart of California, USA. After discovering that a long-lost relative has died and left behind the unpublished manuscript for a novel called Little Mice of the Ruins, Victor attempts to adapt the novel into a film in the hopes that it will thrust him into the annals of the Hollywood elite. A madcap adventure starring deranged serial killers, sadistic talk-show hosts and a severely overweight author clearly in need of attention, Little Mice of the A Memoir is a dark and audacious satire of our modern political where politicians live and die on social media, where internet personalities make their living demagoguing to millions of people, and where leaders of the free world can threaten total nuclear annihilation over Twitter.",
