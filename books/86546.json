  "description": "An incendiary tale of lust, passion, love, betrayal, and loss. Intimate sexual relationships may never be the same.When Dr. Josh Flagon, a professor of literature at a moderate sized liberal arts Nevada university, is drawn to an irresistible co-ed, Rebecca Reaper, little does he know it will take him on a lustful, passionate, life-changing ride. It will also jeopardize all that he values—his career—and all that he seeks—freedom.While teaching classes and writing, Flagon uncovers a secret that boils beneath his cool, scholarly veneer. Rebecca, a brilliant student and sensual siren, reveals that mystery and much more to the professor through their passionate tryst. But at what price? Is it worth killing for?While the couple vacation on a secluded Hawaiian Island, a mysterious incident occurs that further challenges their relationship. From that point, Flagon’s life spirals out of control until be-friended by the unlikely, yet ever-wise Puerto Rican gangster, Jorge Luis Juarez.In a haunting tale that weaves the literary with street smarts, passion with desolation, imprisonment with emancipation, and the desires of mankind with its origins, there thrives something to savor for every adult who has entered the intimate relationship arena and sought deeper answers to life’s questions. This is one story that will make some gasp, many others smile, and take you into realms beyond.",
