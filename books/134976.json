  "description": "This novel was written and is set in about 1991. At the time the author made serious efforts to get this work published and, although he got favourable responses from publishers, none were willing to go as far as taking the novel for publication. The usual reason given was that it was unclear what genera the story belonged in. There was discussion as to whether it belonged in romance, or as a thriller and it isn't really literary fiction. A representative of a Christian publishing house was very taken with the narrative but he also declined to publish on the grounds that it wasn't Christian enough in all respects for the expectations of their readers. However a number of people did read the manuscript, in a couple of cases more than once. Their feedback was extremely encouraging so the author never quite forgot that he had written a readable work of fiction and with the advent of Kindle publishing decided to make the story available at last. The Chapel is the story of Paul, a soldier retired on grounds of disability. He has given all in the service of queen and country and seems to have little left to live for. However, life is not done with him and an unexpected responsibility, new friends, a developing talent for art and a cat all conspire to make life meaningful again. But in the process of regaining happiness Paul must also lay to rest the ghosts of his past. The author served nine years in the Territorial Army, has been a lifelong Methodist and a Lay Preacher for many years and has a particular affinity with felines.",
