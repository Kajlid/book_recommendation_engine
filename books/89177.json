  "description": "I've always been the brother with a plan.It's not that I stood out that much. Raised by a Marine father and a kick ass Marine wife, our life has always had a sense of order to it. I like that. Plans don't fail. You fail to plan.Only, I didn't plan for MJ. She's a hard-headed physical therapist who's taking care of one of my buddies, and she rubs me the wrong way. And by rubs me the wrong way, I mean, I can't get her out of my mind. I always knew about the Santini Curse, I just didn't know it would drive me to chase a woman.She tells me she doesn't have time for romance, and definitely not with a man who wears a uniform. She agrees to a simple affair, but nothing beyond that. But she's never dealt with a Santini man in love, and remember I'm the one who plans everything.And the only plan on my schedule is proving to MJ that loving a Santini might not be easy, but we are definitely worth the fight.",
