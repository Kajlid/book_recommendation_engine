  "description": "From the softer side of Tori Scott, a story of two single parents, a teenager with an attitude, and a little girl who steals everyone's hearts. Sandy Morrow is determined to make it on her own following the death of her husband. She and her daughter are doing just fine until Hunter Thurman and his surly teenage son move in next door. She doesn't need any help, though she doesn't seem to be able to convince Hunter of that. Hunter recently returned home after years of military service that took him away from his son and his mentally-unstable wife. His son is resentful of his father's absence and takes every opportunity to let his father know he's not welcome back home. Hunter had no idea what his son had been going through because his wife had somehow managed to hide her problems when he was home on leave. Now Hunter feels he needs to fix things, not only for his son, but also for the pretty widow next door. This book is dedicated to the men and women who leave homes and families to defend their country and champion freedom across the globe. You have our everlasting gratitude and we pray for your safety. She’d never forget the sounds. The squeal of tires, the thud of impact, the harsh clang of her daughter’s tricycle as it landed in the street. Melanie's scream of terror, the haunting silence that followed. Her next-door neighbor's booted feet flying down the driveway, curses blistering the air. Her own scream, and the quieter footfalls of her bare feet on the grass. The teenaged driver alternately crying, praying, and swearing. Those snippets of time would be imbedded in Sandy’s memory forever.",
