  "description": "I thought I had all I needed: my gun, my chopper, and my brothers. Most women don't crave a life like mine, but after the things I've done and seen, I never thought I longed for more.  The Ghost Riders Motorcycle Club is my family and I'll bleed for them. I'll do anything to keep them safe, even if it's from me.  One look from him and everything I fought to hide was ripped wide open. Being an FBI agent gave him the power to flip my world upside down, and he did it in a way I never saw coming.  What happens when an FBI agent becomes more obsessed with you than with his case? Do you let down your guard? Or pull the trigger?  Warning: This book contains a heroine who doesn't submit, a hero who fights for what he's claimed, and insta-love so hard it will dent your kindle. *Not responsible for dented kindles*  Pulling Her Trigger is a complete novella. No cliffhangers. No alpha-hole. No cheating. HEA. STANDALONE.",
