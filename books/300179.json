One day, my mafioso prince will be the king.And I will be his queen…Then my brother runs into trouble, and I’m taken as collateral.But the enemy doesn’t realize that my brother isn’t the one they should worry about.Because, without me, Ryan is heartless.And soon, they will all see what vengeance a Heartless Savage will wreak.",
