  "description": "A Jade's Trick, the first installment in Lilly Black's Jaded Series, tells the story of Evan Lucien (F), a former runaway left frigid by years of sexual abuse, and Cain Ballantyne, a strikingly handsome billionaire who is accustomed to getting everything he wants all the time...until he meets his match in Evan. Streetwise and hardwired to expect the worst in people, she sees right through him, instantly recognizing him for what he is - a rich playboy just out for a good time, but this playboy comes with much darker desires than she could have imagined. Determined to prove her assessment wrong, Cain spares no resource in seducing her, reminding her at every turn that he is the one who will succeed where all others have failed, and when Evan surrenders to his charms, she finds everything she ever wanted. In her, Cain finds everything he never knew he needed, becoming the man he pretended to be to make her his. On the arm of San Diego's most eligible bachelor, the poor girl from New Orleans finds herself thrusts into the spotlight among the Southern Californian elite, where she learns that the people in Cain's world all seem painted and fake like the tricks of a jade. Everyone has secrets and hidden motives beneath their perfect facades, even Cain himself, and over the course of the four book series, as their tumultuous yet unstoppable love grows, he gradually begins to share his secrets with her amid grand gestures of love and phenomenal, mind-bending sex, all while a killer hunts among his ex-submissives. Enjoy the guilty pleasures of sensual bondage, switching, and Femdom as Evan finds her sexual muse and reshapes Cain's sexual norms...and maybe yours as well.",
