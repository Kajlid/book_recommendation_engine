  "description": "A sweeping, second chance standalone romance!I was pretty good at living without regrets until a way too close call during a skydive. Instead of my life flashing before my eyes, I saw one face, one regret that’s been gnawing at me ever since—Presley. The woman I loved madly ten years ago. The woman I had to walk away from.At first, all I want is to sort out why I can’t get her out of my head. But as soon as I see Presley again, I know I have to win her back at any cost. Brilliant, captivating and utterly beautiful, she’s the one I want.Fate steps in when we’re asked to pair up to find a treasure in art and antiques. It’s an opportunity I can’t pass up—to uncover a path back to the woman I let get away while we chase down a love story a hundred years in the making.Trouble is, Presley is tougher now, more wary, and she’s been hurt. By me. So it's going to take a whole lot more than one hot kiss and a wild adventure together to convince her to give me a second chance.",
