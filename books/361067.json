  "title": "The Forest of Thieves and the Magic Garden: An Anthology of Medieval Jain Stories",
  "description": "Lively tales of asceticism, wickedness, and virtue from one of India's great religious traditions Beautifully translated from the Sanskrit, the stories in this volume reflect the vital tradition of Jain storytelling between the seventh and fifteenth centuries. Some of their characters find bliss by renouncing the world, others by living within it in peace and moderation. There are stories depicting the painful consequences of a loved one's becoming a monk and the triumph of Jain women who win their husbands over to their religion. The climactic story follows an unsuspecting traveler's journey through a forest of destructive passions. Ranging from simple folk tales to sophisticated narratives of rebirth, The Forest of Thieves and the Magic Garden opens a window onto a rich religious tradition.",
