  "description": "Jani's eyes swept the paddock. No Freedom in sight! She ran toward the open gate with Keeta trotting behind her. Maybe the filly was in the barn. But even as she ran toward the new building, Jani knew Freedom wouldn't be there... How had Freedom gotten out? Had she learned to undo the latch? Or was someone targeting Jani and Penny's horses? But they had no enemies, or none she could think of. That girl, Kara, was a little strange, but she didn't seem malicious or anything like that. A sudden, horrible thought leapt into Jani's head, making her heart thud even faster. No! That was just a crazy idea! The horses couldn't have been stolen, could they?",
