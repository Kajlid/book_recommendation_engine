  "description": "Lucian Morelli always takes what he wants. And now he’s taken me. The man who’s haunted my steps from the moment we met at the ball now controls my every move in his hideaway. His dark eyes miss nothing, and he seeks out all my weak spots. He uses his fingers, his wicked tongue, his sharp mind. Searching, testing, looking for the side of me I’ve hidden away for so long.He’s relentless in his pursuit of my secrets, but I manage to discover some of his own. I’m not the only one hiding, not the only one marred by my past. And when he sees me, truly sees me, for the first time in as long as I can remember—I’m not afraid. I’m not afraid of this monster, my monster. I want him to hurt me, to break me, to put me back together, and above all, I want him to love me.A love as fiery as it is destructive, one that will scorch our families and maybe, just maybe, set us both free.",
