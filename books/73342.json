  "description": "Can the love of an honorable man be enough to forgive a woman’s one felonious act? Should that woman risk everything to find out? When Tom Carver, Whistle Creek’s blacksmith, tackles a youth prowling in his barn, he certainly doesn’t expect that youth to be the recently-hired school teacher, Beth Patterson.Her feeble excuses invite his suspicion, so for the next few weeks, he devises “chance” encounters with her so he can watch her every move. Hiding from the law, Beth had hopes of starting afresh in the town of Whistle Creek. But with one brother obsessed with stealing a horse, and the other, younger one befriending the town’s intrusive blacksmith, she fears her ugly past will be uncovered. Tom’s deliberate encounters with Beth reveal she is a deeply devoted sister, and a beautiful, loving woman. Soon desire expels his distrust and he purposely courts her. Denying her own yearnings, Beth knows she must reject his advances for the sake of her small family. Surely Tom, a decent and respected man, would condemn her for her one tragic deed. Wouldn’t he?",
