  "description": "Cindy Crabb has been writing her influential, autobiographical, feminist zine, Doris , since the early '90s. This new collection offers stories, essays, and interviews from 2001-2011, and it collects issues 19-28 as well as some never before published writings. If you've read Doris before then you know what's in store. If you haven't, then I'll say that Cindy has a great writing 'voice' that makes you want to keep turning the page. Over 300 pages!",
