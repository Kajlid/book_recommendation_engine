  "title": "Poirot: The Complete Ariadne Oliver, Vol. 2",
  "description": "The final POIROT omnibus, featuring the last four appearances of the detective's side-kick, the sleuthing crime novelist Ariadne Oliver: Third Girl, Hallowe'en Party, Elephants Can Remember and The Pale Horse. Poirot and Mrs Oliver continue their sleuthing in the 1960s in four uncharacteristically 'modern' novels with an added twist of danger! Third Girl - Poirot finally admits he is growing old as a perplexed girl thinks she may have killed someone. Here Christie dragged Poirot into the swinging 60s and effectively squared him up against a world featuring sex, drugs and hippies. Hallowe'en Party - A teenage murder witness is drowned in a tub of apples. This was only the second time Christie wrote about the death of a child, and is all the more engrossing for it. Elephants Can Remember - An old husband and wife double murder has never been solved - until now. This was the very last Poirot story that Agatha Christie wrote, and garnered good reviews. The Pale Horse - A priest's death leads to sinister goings-on in an old country inn. This bonus novel featured Mrs Oliver for once without Poirot and was one of Christie's darkest stories, blending witchcraft and murder.",
