When I lost my fighting career and my family, I stayed on my feet, wielding apathy like a shield. I didn’t allow anything—or anyone—that might bring me to my knees to get too close.  Now, I’m CEO of the UFL. I can’t afford to show any weakness if I want to get back to the octagon.  And Eve?  I’m quickly learning she might be my biggest weakness yet… Eve I’m angry and bitter. My romantic history made sure of that.  I’ve been able to repel the advances of even of the most persistent men for a long, long time.

Because in my experience, when life has you on the ropes, it never lets up.  Not until you go down and stay down… Fighting the Fall, book 4 in the Fighting series, is an emotional, angsty, older man/younger woman, contemporary, steamy, sports/MMA romance with a guaranteed happily ever after.
