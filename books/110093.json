  "title": "The Illuminated Language of Flowers",
  "description": "\"Presents one of the most enchanting customs of the early 19th century - communicating through flowers instead of words. Hundreds of plants and flowers were given meaning ranging from the warm, simple \"I love\" of the red chrysanthemum to the disquieting message of the currant \"thy frown will kill me.\" The book glows with Kate Greenaway's exquisite illustrations of the Victorian world from her 1884 book, Language of Flowers. An alphabetical listing of over 700 flowers and plants with their meanings - and a cross-index by meanings.\"",
