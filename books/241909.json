Trapped ruling the Psirens, she feels a rage unlike any she’s ever known, and is certain that both she and her new people are irredeemable.With Poseidon’s voice still ringing in their ears, Vex finally finds the courage to reveal what he was trying to tell her the night of the Fischer wedding, and it might be just in time.Can Vex help Azure become the ruler that Poseidon expects of her;the ruler he knows she can be, and perhaps lay his own past to rest along the way? Or will the darkness consume them as they journey to a small English town in search of Azure’s long-lost daughter?Join this dark duo as they learn not only whether it is possible to fight, but feel, by embracing the very shadow that makes them who they are.",
