Two-Moons is an Onondaga warrior woman with the ability to Dream truly. When she was born, the extraordinary events that gave her name were considered predictive of an extraordinary life. That prediction comes true when a power-hungry Medieval wizard from another dimension kidnaps Two Moons, drawing her from her own time and place into Medieval England. With her extraordinary gifts, he hopes to use her to entrap her people to serve as his slaves. But through her dream gifts, Two-Moons is able to contact her own gods--setting the stage for an awesome duel that pits European sorcery against Obongda magic.",
