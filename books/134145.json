Minna, a beautiful Roman serving girl, finds herself thrust into the wilds of barbarian Scotland with acrobat Cian, a tribeless youth loyal only to himself. Here, they are trapped between Roman scouts fighting to subdue the dark, tattooed Picts, and the Scottish warring tribes themselves.Caught between these forces is Cahir, King of the Dalriadans of western Scotland, who has watched his power dwindle and his people fall under the Roman yoke.At Dunadd, Cahirâ€™s fort, Minna hears songs that tell of his ancestors, Rhiann and Eremon, and it stirs dreams and visions within her: visions of Scotland, battles and bloodshed. And despite her loyalties to her Roman upbringing, as the war for Scottish freedom unfolds, Minna struggles against an irresistible call of her blood, a call that reveals a destiny she shares with the wounded king Cahir, and which binds her inevitably to Dalriada and its people.",
