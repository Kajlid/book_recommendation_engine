  "title": "A Child's Heart: The Abbreviated Tales of S.R. Tooms (Collection of Humorous Horror): Short Scary Stories",
  "description": "It is surely by fate with which the dark spirits of this world have brought you here to the threshold of CRAPLET... a book of short, entirely spooky and at times gutbustingly humorous stories. Each entry ranges in length from a single paragraph up to several pages of nonstop thrilling entertainment. S.R. Tooms himself has assured each tale is certain to titillate, shock, or disgust. A masterful collection of flash fiction running the gamut of human emotion, where but one thing is guaranteed: You will be unable to put this book down once the cover has been lifted... and you'll never forget the narratives within once it closes. To say nothing of the nightmares that will undoubtedly befall you!",
