But that’s not the only strange thing that happens. Her voice sounds funny, and soon her supposed best friend and celebutante Lulu Collins and her supposed boyfriend Brandon Stark kidnap her from the hospital and take her back to her supposed penthouse apartment.

Until, of course, she finds out that she’s stuck in supermodel Nikki Howard’s body.",
