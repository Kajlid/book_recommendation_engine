  "description": "\"A top notch information packed, roll in the floor, and share with your girlfriends book.\" -- Reader Views\"The guidance is skewed and the humor is . . . wait for it . . . divine!\" -- Armchair Interviews\"Deedee Divine's Totally Skewed Guide to Life is \"delightfully wacky and unexpectedly wise,\" says Celia Rivenbark, author of You Can't Drink All Day If You Don't Start in the Morning. It’s not always easy to find the fun in life’s frustrations. But as Deedee says, “Family that doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Among the favorite essays featured in this second book from the bestselling author of Driving on the Wrong Side of the Road are \"Riding in Cars with Kids,\" \"What's DNA Got to Do with It?\", and \"Why Women Won't Read Maps.\" Find out why Bubbas build the best burgers, men shouldn’t use the B-word (“budget”), and the term “happy camper” is an oxymoron. From raising daredevil children to her struggles with weight-loss, Estill mines laughter from her many failures. Anyone who's ever been aggravated by postal service, annoyed by excessive psycho-babble, or frustrated by the search for a fool-proof diet will find Estill's takes on such subjects refreshingly honest and entertaining.Winner of the 2010 International Book Award (humor category) and a 2008 ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Finalist.",
