  "description": "Amber LaLanie burst upon the music scene a decade ago like a ball of fun energy.  Her \"live for the day\" attitude has hid her insecurity and extreme loneliness in the sea of people around her.  Then she met a production intern, Kylee, who has a way of drawing out the real Amber that lies within.  This is set in the same world as Music of the Soul but is a standalone book.",
