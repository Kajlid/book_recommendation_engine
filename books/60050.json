  "description": "Just because Claude’s father owns Pendragon Hotel, that doesn’t mean the role of running the hotel was handed to him on a silver platter. Claude had to fight for years to convince his father that allowing his gay son to run a hotel catering to gay men wouldn’t lead to him screwing either the guests or the men who worked there. Claude’s kept every promise he made to his father. He doesn’t mix business with pleasure. He doesn’t play where he works. He’s hidden his private life so well, most of the staff don’t even know he’s gay, let alone just as kinky as any of them.  But, when Claude goes to meet a man who works for a nudist website, everything changes. The truth refuses to remain hidden, and Claude’s whole life is stripped down and laid bare for everyone to see. The only question that remains will Claude be able to cope with the naked truth?",
