  "description": "A fun way to explore at shapes! “Come down here,” Triangle says to Square. “Why don’t you come up her?” Square says to Triangle. And so it goes, on and on, as each one tries to convince the other that where he is at is the absolute best place to be. Stopping at nothing as they plead their cases of who has the better friend to which one has the best treat to eat. Up or down, which is better? Will Triangle give in and go up there where Square is or will Square come down to where Triangle is? Join them and find out who wins. Triangle or Square?",
