  "description": "No Names. No Guilt. No Boundaries.  Renee Matthews is starting over. Free of a demanding ex-husband who left her feeling worthless, she's ready for a purely physical connection, on her terms. Sex in the dark with a total stranger--a night of breathless passion without complications. An online ad leads to the first of many anonymous trysts. And when one partner takes her into a darker realm of pleasure, Renee discovers hungers she never knew she possessed.  Renee knows these encounters are risky. Nothing has ever compared to such exhilarating desire--certainly not her ex, or the \"perfect\" potential boyfriend her parents keep pushing her way. But as the excitement escalates, so does the danger. And walking away from her midnight lover may be more difficult than Renee ever expected. . .  \"The sensuality of the narrative style, the intensity of the characters' emotions, and the complexity of the plot are all satisfying.\" --Eroticarevealed.com on Every Dark Desire",
