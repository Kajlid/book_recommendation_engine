  "description": "Did you ever wonder if you would live to thrive again? If you think you know what life success is, you may be surprised to discover that it isn't about a college degree, job title, or hood ornament on you car. Experiencing loss can teach you more than all the things you acquire in your pursuit of success. Don't Die is a metaphor for living and thriving. Andrea Goeglein threads a true tale of loss and learning throughout the pages of this book; she shares valuable insight gained by awareness, and she encourages readers to think deeply about their definition of success.",
