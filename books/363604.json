  "title": "Yerma",
  "description": "Yerma (meaning 'Barren') is one of three tragic plays about peasants and rural life that make up Lorca's 'rural trilogy'. It is possibly Lorca's harshest play, following a woman's Herculean struggle against the curse of infertility. The woman's barrenness becomes a metaphor for her marriage in a traditional society that denies women sexual or social equality. Her desperate desire for a child drives her to commit a terrible crime at the end of the play.This Student Edition comes complete with a full introduction; plot synopsis; commentary on characters, context and themes; bibliography; chronology; and questions for study.",
