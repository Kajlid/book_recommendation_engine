  "description": "The second time Emma goes home with Wren, they’re both far too drunk. Emma’s night started with shots, alone, at a bar she’d never been to before because she couldn’t bear to run into Cam or Steve. It was just her luck that Wren showed up and sidled over to her with two shots in hand. They both knew why Emma was there. She was trying to forget the name Camille altogether. Wren Mathis is an easy distraction but that’s when things get complicated.",
