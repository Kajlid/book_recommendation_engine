  "description": "This is a love story about love stories. And, as important, a story about why fate will sometimes feel like luck.  \"They swirl around each other, like they're being pulled into orbit.\"  Robyn always thought that she and her destiny were inseparable facts. That true love was waiting around the corner, if only she kept looking.  \"She saw signs everywhere and thought of the whole cosmos like an ocean. It was looking to wash beautiful things up on shore, like seashells. All she had to do was pick them up.\"  But when celebrated author Gatory Penn comes to town with a novel contradicting everything in her world, Robyn discovers that believing in love will mean confronting an old man's broken heart.  Written to be read in one sitting, this heartfelt novella will stick with you long after you finish reading.",
