  "description": "UninhibitedI can’t be trusted with anyone’s heart, especially hers. WhitMy first memory is of breaking my mom’s heart. Yea, people know me as the good-time guy, the guy with the jokes, the deejay who's always up for a party. But underneath all of that, I’m the guy who lets people down wherever I go. The one person who sees past all my bullshit is Lucy. She always has, since we were thirteen and she hated my guts. But I’ve never hated her. Lucy is my ideal in every way-- gorgeous and funny and smart and takes no shit with an ass that’s the stuff of my dreams. Too bad she’s also my stepsister. But don’t worry, ma. Nothing to see here. Afterall, Lucy can’t stand me, so when we go roadtripping together, nothing will happen, right?Except it does. And neither one of us is ready for the fallout.Uninhibited is a full-length novel with a fun-loving hero, a straightlaced, goal-oriented heroine, a Stepsister trope, and an HEA. It is the third inter-connected standalone in the Bainbridge University Series and it follows Uncovered and Unknown. They are all standalones, but for the best reader experience, they should be reader in order.",
