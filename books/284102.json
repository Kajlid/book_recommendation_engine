  "title": "The Vow",
  "description": "After tragedy struck, I vowed never to fall in love again. For the last ten years, I kept that promise, never staying with a woman longer than it took to screw them.  Then she walked in… Ten years ago she was nothing but a little girl, but now she’s all grown up, with curves, and a smile that reminds me of everything I'm trying to forget. My attraction to her is wrong, on so many levels and I’ll do anything I can, even make her hate me if I have too, to stop it.  She’s here to study, and I’m the newly appointed Dean.  I shouldn’t be tempted by a student, especially one who's ten years younger than me.  And I definitely shouldn't be having feelings for her.  But I am…  Because as badly as I don’t want to admit it Lily might just be the one person to make me fall in love again.  That is, if I can let go of the hold her dead sisters memory has, on my heart.  **This is book four in the North Woods University Series. It can be read as a complete standalone and contains NO cliffhanger, NO cheating, and a HEA. Please be advised this series contains material not suitable for all readers. This is NOT a YA series.**",
