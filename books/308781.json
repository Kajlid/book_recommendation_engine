  "description": "Corrupting angels should be fun. But damn it. It’s more soul-crushing and infuriating work than I expected. Especially when Lucifer, AKA Lucian, is a lying sack of demon guts and would much prefer to rule Hell alone.Yeah...no. That doesn’t work for me. If he gets his way and I fail, I’ll lose my soul. I’ll lose my chance at helping the Seven Sinners of Hell’s Kingdom to rise with me taking the throne of Purgatory.And unfortunately, Lucian’s not my only problem. One of the angels that was supposed to jump and create a new level of Hell as its ruler has already fallen from grace. He’s mortal and bound to a bottom feeder demon. How the hell am I supposed to complete my mission for my soul when the universe is out to get me? I guess I’ll find out.Four more thrones that must be claimed and my current collection of devils need me to fill them to secure our eternities. I can’t let them down.Plus, I’m not a big fan of being Lucifer’s little toy forever. He’s not my type of psycho. He should be the one to bow to me.",
