  "description": "Breck-My name is Brecklyn Brannon, and I'm not who I claim to be. A year ago, I packed up my promising life in the city for a man I saw only once. Accepting a temporary job with Cade and four blazing hot veterans should have been my way in. Except, Cade acts like he would rather be tortured than speak to me. He can resist all he wants, but I made a promise that I intend to keep. Even if it costs me everything. Cade: I've watched her for over a year. There's something about her that seems familiar... but now that she's living here for two weeks, I could care less what it is. I just want her gone. Breck is temptation personified, and some lines can't be crossed. I'm Major Cade Jameson, and I made a promise, too. One that I can't break. No matter how hard IT gets.",
