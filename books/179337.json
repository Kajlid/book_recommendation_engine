  "description": "From its origins as a Native American trail to its iconic status in global culture today, Broadway tells the story of New York as it grew from a Dutch colony into a world-class city. Broadway has been the site of many firsts and many the first subway line in the city, the tallest buildings, and one of the longest streets in the world. Beginning along the winding streets of the original settlements amid the skyscrapers of the Financial District, Broadway heads north through the neighborhoods of SoHo and Greenwich Village. It then traverses some of the city's most famous plazas, including Flatiron, Herald Square, Times Square, and Columbus Circle, before entering Upper Manhattan and passing institutions like Lincoln Center, Columbia University, and City College. Today, Broadway continues to be at the forefront of New York City's urban developments.",
