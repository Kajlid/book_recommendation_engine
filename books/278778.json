  "description": "In prison, Damastes is shocked to learn that Tenedos lives. His friend, corrupted by power, faked his own death and is now building an army not only to retake Numantia, but to take over the world. Damastes is torn because he knows he's the only person who can stop Tenedos, but he would have to break his oath of allegiance to his friend to do it. Damastes escapes and as he assembles his own army, he discovers that there are more people loyal to him than he'd thought. He realizes that he must fight Tenedos because his responsibility to protect the people of Numantia is far more important than his oath to Tenedos. Seeking out even more supporters, Damastes prepares for the worst war Numantia has ever seen.",
