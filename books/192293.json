  "description": "Power Broker Jonah Gray is home. But does that mean Amsterdam, or New York City? Will he be Ivan Janse or Jonah Gray? One thing is certain―Jonah, as always, is steeled to get where he needs to go. This time around, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Someone from Jonah’s past is back in a big way. Jonah has been strong-armed into using his knowledge of the business of skyscrapers to assist in a nefarious, global scheme―and failure, as has been made clear, is simply not an option. There are monstrous deals and piles of cash to be made. There are reputations―even lives―to be lost. Facing the horrors of the past, Jonah’s own demons start to encroach as Perry, the woman he loves, seems to sink deeper and deeper into drugs―or insanity.  Jonah could be cracking under stress just as he needs maximum focus. He has always been able to call up his resolute strength of character and it’s never been needed more than now.  Jonah is in for the fight of his life. Not just for himself―not just for Perry―for an entire industry.",
