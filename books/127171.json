Some of our old friends have returned home safely, to be with the ones they love and trust. Even as their warm greetings of welcome are offered, another threat builds on the horizon. It enters their home in the form of a little girl. What the child visitor carries within her is an adversary as single-minded and deadly as the zombie hordes themselves. It is known to have existed over 350 years, and it takes life without consideration of age or innocence. At the same time, another female child, unable to quell her siren call, beckons the Mothers. They, in turn, gather the Hungerers to follow. Join our family of survivors once again, and prepare to brace yourself against the coming onslaught.",
