  "title": "Boy with Beer",
  "description": "Boy with Beer is a touching story of love between two men. Karl is the older man, tired of one-night stands and searching for his 'African prince.' What he finds is Donovan, an inarticulate, confused and emotionally immature homeboy, trying to prove his masculinity by fathering a child. What ensues is the story of a relationship taking its first steps on the rocky road to love. On the way, issues such as AIDS, male sexuality, and the problems of being both black and gay are raised. Boakye unflinchingly puts gay men under the spotlight and shows you how it is. Although at times, described as a tad optimistic, it is also unrelentingly candid. It is not every day that you get to see or read such a startlingly honest portrayal of gay love. With every twist in the tale of Boy with Beer, you'll be hoping and praying that love really can conquer all.",
