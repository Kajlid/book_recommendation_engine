  "description": "There’s a killer in the mountains, a beautiful woman in his bed, and an orphan at the mission. Won as a prize in a poker game, Italian beauty Sophia is forced to run with Comanche Crow and his Hellfire gang. Crow is as dark and disturbed as the devil, and when his gang begin to kill just outside of Tucson, they fall into the jurisdiction of Sheriff Cooper Blackwater. Blackwater takes his job seriously, and he’s sacrificed plenty to wear his badge. He’ll face his biggest challenge with Comanche Crow, especially if he falls for Crow’s mistress, Sophia, who is claiming not only her innocence, but his heart.",
