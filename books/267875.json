  "description": "What's a girl to do after being ditched at the altar by text message? That's right. Text. Message.How does she pick up the pieces and move on? I'm no Dear Abby but here's a little free advice...Advice #1 - First, purge your apartment of all things him--by tossing his belongings off the balcony.Advice #2 - Do not, I repeat do not, throw anything out into the hallway because you'll injure your hot new neighbor.Advice #3 - When said neighbor brings over Chinese Food do not let him stay and keep you company. It's awkward when you realize he's your boss.Advice #4 - Accept his offer to help you with your side business but think twice before using a date to his sister's wedding as collateral.Advice #5 - Investigate who your mystery neighbor really is. Don't trust his word even if he's the world's best kisser.If you listen to nothing else, pay attention to that last one. It's the most important and will save you a lot of heartache.Xo,LOVESICK IN LAKE STARLIGHT",
