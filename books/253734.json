What separates the much-needed rainfall from the devastating hurricane is our ability to navigate these storms with grace and clarity. This book provides the necessary insights and practical tools for embracing the storms we all face such that we are left more conscious and more empowered. In this book Dr. Gubacs describes the major expected and unexpected life transitions and their key components. Through a variety of life stories and experiences, the reader will see how the external and internal components of a transition can impact their life.

By understanding their own transitions, the readers are better able to appreciate how those transitions are causing or influencing the smaller, day-to-day challenges they experience in their lives. The readers will also be presented with and taught to apply practical tools for successfully weathering their life storms. Thus, the content and the delivery in Life’s Perfect Storms provides a straightforward, easy-to-follow guidebook that people of all transitions can pick up and yet focus on the chapter that seems the most relevant to them.",
