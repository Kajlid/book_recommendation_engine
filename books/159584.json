  "description": "Destiny’s Warriors -- Special Science Fiction Edition (1st in the Series) Human Sacrifice... was mortal man no more than mere cattle for the ancient gods? Did the Sun Goddess and the God of the Moon, the Great Samhain merely harvest humans to satisfy an addition to quickening? Destiny's Warriors answers these questions. Ferrin Collins, archaeologist and professor living in modern day Belfast, goes out to explore for a possible dig-site and dozes off in the woods, dreaming as always of another time and place. When he awakes, he is in the past in ancient Ireland, with no idea how he will get by! Somehow, he stumbles onto his Destiny in the town of Erui. Ferrin meets a Druid called Wolf, who seems oddly familiar. During their time together, Wolf tells him the tale of Destiny's Warriors which is a tale of betrayal, murderous plots and revenge. What ensues is an exhilarating journey into the horrors of human sacrifice. Destiny's Warriors inspires its readers to empathize with the characters while they try to survive in an ancient, harsh world of magic, mystical creatures, horrific monsters and the brutality of war. Also available on Destiny’s Warriors The Beginning Book 1 and Destiny’s Warriors The Last Sacrifice Book 2 in the series.",
