  "description": "In 2004 my wife and children and I had an encounter one night, in the cornfields of Wisconsin, with a being of light. Since that encounter I have been trying to figure out where this all began for me. I have had, throughout my life, what I considered many isolated incidences, many strange happenings, but I never thought they were in any way connected. Now I think they are. While trying to figure all of this out, my wife and I had to go back, back twenty-five plus years, to Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee, the place where it all began for the two of us, back to 1989 and back to the little house on Dale Street.Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B078K563RR here.",
