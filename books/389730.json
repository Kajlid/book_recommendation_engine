  "description": "In six darkly comic tales, Saul Bellow presents the human experience in all its preposterousness, poignancy, and pathos. The stories, which include \"Leaving the Yellow House,\" \"The Old System,\" \"Looking for Mr. Green,\" \"The Gonzaga Manuscripts,\" and \"A Father-to-Be,\" reflect Bellow s ability to depict men and women confronting, in highly idiosyncratic ways, the enigmas and oddities of existence.",
