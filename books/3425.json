  "description": "Gordon's a retired Drill Sergeant who's enjoying his life. He has his garden, his friends and access to the subs at the Hammer Club whenever he wants to indulge his Toppy side. When Billy and Marcus insist on introducing him to Frank, he has to admit, he's intrigued.Frank is a cop turned private investigator who often helps out the men of the Hammer Club. He thinks they're all just a little bit off, but they're good guys for the most part, and he's happy to take their business. When he's introduced to Gordon at a party at the Hammer to welcome Oliver home after the events in Owned, his world is turned on its head.Very much a loner, and self-contained, Frank must deal with having a partner who cares about him as more than just a good fuck. Frank also doesn't believe he's like all those little subs at the club, so he's not sure that a man like Gordon, a 'Top', is going to want him for more than the occasional make-out session. Can Gordon convince him he's wrong?Push is the latest in the popular Hammer Club series that includes Found, Snared, Owned, Baked, and Bent.",
