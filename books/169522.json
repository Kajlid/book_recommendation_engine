  "title": "The Dogs of Ron Burns - A Tribute to the Dogs of 9/11",
  "description": "This book brings together, through a collection of paintings, the story of what happens with people and dogs around times of crisis.          Here you'll see furry friends, such as bomb detection dogs, who work to keep us safe, canines who work to rescue us in times of greatest need, and of course those, such as therapy dogs, who work so lovingly to make us whole again.          The traits we like to think of as human ideals - patience, tenacity, unconditional love, hard work, kindness and heroism - are found consistently in dogs, perhaps more consistently than in people (I'm biased).          And it's my hope that by seeing these gorgeous creatures through the lens of art, that we can all appreciate them and celebrate them in a new and profound way.-Ron Burns",
