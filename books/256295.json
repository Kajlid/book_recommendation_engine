  "description": "For the first time in the US, ComicsLit brings over the latest enfant terrible of European comics, a mad genius, and for the first time, the Louvre museum is involved in a co-edition of a series of graphic novels. There will be four and each will be a vision of this great museum by a different artist. De Crécy, at the sight of the incredible richness of the museum’s collection was overwhelmed and felt small and ignorant. The result is a story set thousands of years hence in a glacial period where all human history has been forgotten and a small group of archeologists fall upon the Louvre, buried in age-old snow. They cannot begin to explain all the artifacts they see. What could they have meant? Their interpretations are nonsense, absurd, farcical.",
