  "description": "'What we all need,' said Larry, 'is sunshine...a country where we can grow.''Yes, dear, that would be nice,' agreed Mother, not really listening.'I had a letter from George this morning - he says Corfu's wonderful. Why don't we pack up and go to Greece?''Very well, dear, if you like,' said Mother unguardedly.Escaping the ills of the British climate, the Durrell family - acne-ridden Margo, gun-toting Leslie, bookworm Lawrence and budding naturalist Gerry, along with their long suffering mother and Roger the dog - take off for the island of Corfu.But the Durrells find that, reluctantly, they must share their various villas with a menagerie of local fauna - among them scorpions, geckos, toads, bats and butterflies.",
