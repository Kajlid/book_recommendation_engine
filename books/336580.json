  "description": "MikaShe’s the uber-sexy, single mother living next door. Everyone tells me to keep my distance. But there’s something about her. Specifically, her eyes. They speak to me. Drawing me in like a siren. I want to know her, but she’s more guarded than Buckingham Palace. However, after one afternoon in her presence, I find myself addicted and wanting more. Willing to do whatever I have to just to make it past her defenses. ShilohMy next-door neighbor is an insanely hot, single professional hockey player. As if that isn’t bad enough, he’s a nice guy too. After spending an afternoon where he showed my son how to skate and took us out to ice cream, I want to let him in. My past cautions me to put on the brakes, but I find myself going full steam ahead, ignoring all the red flags waving at me.",
