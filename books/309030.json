  "description": "Rule No. 3: Never let anyone think they can hurt you and get away with it.I thought I’d seen and felt the worst of it, but there’s nothing worse than betrayal.Corina knows who’s behind what happened to me and she may think hiding will keep her safe, but after everything that’s happened, nothing can keep her safe from me and the Sick Boys. She’s a pawn in all of this, but I’ll get that information even if it means I have to cut it out of her - piece by fucking piece.This little charade is about to end. They thought they could drag me down into the dirt and grind my soul into the dust. What they failed to realize is that there’s nothing left of my soul and I don’t mind getting a little dirty if it means getting my revenge. I may have let her fool me once, but there’s no way in hell I’ll let her fool me twice.After I’m done with her, I’m going after the big boys.",
