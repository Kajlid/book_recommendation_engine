  "title": "Jake Westerby: Deep Undercover",
  "description": "A mutilated corpse, a powerful family intent on stonewalling the police instead of mourning the loss of their son, a sex-for-hire scheme that began as a lark and then turns deadly--all combine to plunge Detective Jake Westerby into a shadowy world of lust and drugs on the leafy campus of Cascade University. Jake's sexual prowess has caused him grief in his personal life, but makes it easy for him to infiltrate an organization that provides male escorts and drugs to wealthy men willing to pay a premium for discretion. When his identity is exposed by a treacherous cop, Jake is slated to be the killer's next victim. Only fellow detective Paul Mazurek can rescue Jake--and only then if he can pull off an audacious impersonation. Can Paul save the man he loves so that their passion for one another can ignite and come into the open?",
