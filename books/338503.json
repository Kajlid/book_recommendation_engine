  "title": "Awake, Arise, and Come Unto Christ: Talks from the 2008 BYU Women's Conference",
  "description": "The cause of Jesus Christ is the most demanding and inspiring of all causes. Drawing on Moroni s exhortation to Awake, arise, and come unto Christ, the theme for the 2008 BYU Women s Conference invites us to awake to who we are and to the expansive reach of our influence as women of God, to arise by making of our lives a ministry as the Savior did, and to come unto Christ by choosing holiness and purity over worldliness. Contributors including President Thomas S. Monson, Elder and Sister Merrill Bateman, Julie B. Beck, John Bytheway, Sheri Dew, Mary Ellen Edmunds, Marie Hafen, and Carolyn Rasmus remind us that Jesus Christ can heal us, strengthen us, sanctify us, lift us, and redeem us, and that nothing is more important than being a follower of Jesus Christ.Young Women General Presidency For the Strength of Youth: A Resource for Parents and LeadersBarbara Thompson Lay Hold upon Every Good GiftSilvia H.
