  "description": "Alternate cover edition for AISN B00JL4A1AK For previous cover edition see hereIt's common enough for a book of dragons to center on a young wizard harnessing his power, or a knightly lad (usually a farmhand) learning to vanquish evil. The Merlins and Arthurs, if you will. Too rarely do we get to glimpse the other side of the coin. The Madam Mims and Morgan le Fays certainly had their own humble beginnings, but those stories are seldom told. Those climbs to power are somehow neglected. But within the pages of The Tatterwing Chronicles you'll find such a story. A story of a young girl taking her first steps to becoming a notorious witch known as Tatterwing. A story of her rise to power, her flirtation with the darkness, and her tendency to ride the line between hero and villain as the odds stack against her. Book one finds young Medo as a child of thirteen living deep in the bowels of the swamp, before she's seen the outside world. Before anyone has heard her name.",
