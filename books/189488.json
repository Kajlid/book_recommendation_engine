  "description": "Talon Kyres spends his days by the lake, and his nights avoiding the moonlight. Years spent on the calm Southern Island have created a peaceful, if slow life. One night, a woman with hidden power shatters this world, pulling Talon into a rekindling war, surreal powers, and the history of a family he had never known.Entering the mainland, Talon learns of Syncingâ€”an ancient technique used to command the elements. With battles rivaling the strength of natural disasters, will Talon learn to master his birthright as well, or will his choice to follow a stranger to war bring nothing but regret?",
