  "description": "Artists' Christmas Cards compiled by Steven Heller. From inside flap on \"We all have felt the urge to leave our favorite Christmas cards sitting forever atop the fireplace mantel or tacked to the door of our office, gazing at theircharm, humor or whatever attraction they hold. For as Steven Heller writes \"To look at them is to smile\". In compiling this book Heller looked through 4,000 cards and selected the funniest, the most sensitive, the most imaginative ones he could find. They range from Walt Kelly's cartoon drawing of the beloved Pogo, to Tomi Ungerer's group of tiny Santas popping out of a cash register drawer.\"",
