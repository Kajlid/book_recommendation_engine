  "title": "Rush Hudson Limbaugh and His Times: Reflections on a Life Well Lived",
  "description": "This series of interviews with Rush H. Limbaugh Sr. explores his life as a man who, from his humble beginnings, rose with talent and hard work to great achievement and prominence in his chosen profession of law. Limbaughâ€™s legal career was launched in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in 1916 at the age of twenty-five, and he practiced there until shortly before his death in 1996 at the age of 104. His professional years were marked by his competence and distinction as a lawyer, his membership to the Missouri House of Representatives, and his numerous office-holdings, such as president of the Missouri Bar. These interviews reveal a good man with a strength of character that commanded respect and endeared him to all who knew him, a man who at age ninety-six when the interviews occurred was living an extraordinary life of achievement and service, illustrated by his dedication to his family, church, community, and profession.",
