  "description": "Bipolar disorder simultaneously gives you both an amazing and a terrible outlook on life. This is a book of Melissa Burke’s personal journal entries as well as some poems, written over the past few years. The goal is to shed light on mental illness for people who don’t understand it while at the same time reminding those who do suffer from it that they aren't alone. This is also to show that even if you don’t have any mental illness, life can be a roller coaster.But things do get better. Perfect? No, never. But life doesn't have to be perfect to become a beautiful journey.",
