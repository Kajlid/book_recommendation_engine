  "title": "Appalachian Odyssey: A 28-year hike on the Appalachian Trail",
  "description": "When two friends went for a one-day hike in Maine in 1985, they had no idea they were actually starting a 2,100 mile, 28-year adventure. Inspired by the author's trail journals, Appalachian Odyssey is not a \"how to\" guide, but an enduring story told through a refreshing blend of history, photography and wit. This book is an uplifting reminder that the most meaningful accomplishments in life rarely happen overnight, but are achieved by making steady progress toward our goals.This book was originally published as an eBook covering the first seven years of the journey. It was then picked up by Down East Books to be issued as a single volume, paperback edition. The book is currently available for pre-order on Amazon.com with a publish date of July, 2016.http://www.amazon.com/Appalachian-Ody...",
