  "description": "Peter and me, we’ve been through a lot over the past few days. Pete bit me, and then was kidnapped by Whitcomb-I-Used-To-Have-Clown-Hair. In my attempt to rescue Peter I was forced to break the promise I made, which went something along the lines of not setting anything on fire or blowing anything up.Everything is okay now because Pete and I are safe inside the Gray Zone. Now all we have to do is to deal with Peter’s becoming Lesser-Bred. Because I can’t feed Pete, it means buying a Lesser-Bred whore who can. But Peter is still worried he’ll come after me so he’s asked me for a favor, and Peter has never asked me for anything, so it’s no surprise I can’t tell him no. Only, if I keep my word, if I do the thing Peter has asked me to do, there’s a chance it could kill him.",
