  "description": "Whoever heard of a homeless ballerina? Everyone in my life has always disappointed me, but NHL hockey star Camden James says he never will. We meet, and then in a single blink, he’s made me his roommate, promising me I don’t have to worry about anything ever again. They call him a hero, and that’s what I desperately need. I remind myself it’s all temporary. That I shouldn’t get used to it. But he has other ideas. Camden tells me he’s obsessed, that he’s going to change my life, that he’ll never let me go. But as more time passes, I wonder if it’s going to take a villain to get me my happily ever after. And Camden James just might be the right man for the role. *Note: Camden James is a morally grey antihero who is obsessed with his girl and will do anything to keep her. This is a darker hockey romance. The Pucking Wrong Man is a hockey romance standalone.",
