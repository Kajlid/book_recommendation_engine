Kept as a slave and sold from one master to another, Dante has suffered far too much cruelty, and even he would admit that the harshness of life has turned him from a civilised, obedient omega into a broken man bent on violence and revenge.Antoine Calvet has lived a blessed life. The alpha son of a wealthy farmer, he is an anomaly among his own gender, wanting to use his position to protect those he cares about, rather than flaunting either his money or his power. So when Antoine meets Dante at a slave auction, his heart goes out to the bruised and battered man, unwilling to leave him to endure even more suffering.But once Antoine gets Dante back to his estate, he has to wonder if he’s taken on more than he can handle. Dante’s trust in alphas has been completely destroyed, and he veers between cowering fear and outbursts of anger, unsettling the entire estate.But Antoine is convinced that kindness can win over the hardest of hearts and that with enough time, even Dante can be redeemed. But as his quest to show Dante that he matters delves into uncharted territory, Antoine will be forced to confront the very foundations of the society he lives in, and for the first time in his life, he’ll have to question whether an omega can truly be more than just a slave.This novel can be read as a standalone or as part of the series.Books in the Lost and Found Book 1: Redemption of a SlaveBook 2: The RunawayBook 3: Rescue for a Rebel This novel contains themes of slavery and rape scenes which may be disturbing for some readers.",
