  "description": "Knowledge changes everything... Hoodoo-influenced Southern Louisiana seems like the perfect place for Camille to escape her abusive past and dysfunctional family. She doesn't expect to fall in love with the handsome Gavin Devereaux and plummet into the world of Amaranth, a place of exile for reformed vampires. Wrestling to escape a deadly ex-boyfriend while giving Gavin a chance, Camille is confronted with decisions that threaten not only her life, but the lives of her inhuman friends she has come to love. Entangled in her friends' quest for freedom, she dives into their realm and faces the threats of Amaranth's ruler--the mother of all vampires--and her own inner demons. Now Camille must decide whether she will derail her life and make the ultimate sacrifice for the monsters that interrupted her bumpy path back to sanity--what she still wants so desperately--or escape with Gavin before it's too late for both of them.",
