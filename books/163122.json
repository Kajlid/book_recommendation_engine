Libe and her family are harbored by a farmer named Pavlo, who has nothing to gain from his display of humanity, and everything to lose - including his family. As the ghetto in Tuchin burns and the Nazis hunt them daily, Libeâ€™s family must rely on their cunning, hope, and faith to endure. As their journey swells with danger and despair, their faith begins to wane, and Libe finds that her very survival will depend upon her miraculous hero, Brisko.",
