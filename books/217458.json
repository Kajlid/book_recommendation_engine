  "description": "It's been a year since Robert Tracy (Agent Bering), saved from the executioner's needle, foiled the Cabal's plan to assassinate the President and take control of the country. Seizing the opportunity for a new life, he is happy and in love. But a rift in the very fabric of space-time, and an undefeated Cabal, conspire to strip away everything he cares about. Suddenly, no one and nothing is as it should be. Desperately trying to stop a saboteur intent on destroying the Athena Project, events spiral out of control and he is lost in the past. Stranded, with no way to return to the life he has built. Unable to trust anyone, and with assassins in hot pursuit, his only option is to seek the help of a child who can deliver a message 36 years into the future.",
