  "title": "Millennial Mindset: The Millennials' guide to hacking the corporate ladder and creating Awesome Sauce in any organization",
  "description": "You’re a millennial. You were told you could get anything you want – except a promotion. You are accustomed to instant gratification but forced to deal with delayed job satisfaction. You love to break the rules and hack everything but have no idea how to hack the corporate ladder. We know, we wrote this book for ourselves, and for you. So do yourself a favor and read this book on Sunday instead of going to another boozy brunch, which quite frankly none of us can afford. And no, taking a picture of this ridiculous text and posting it on Instagram does not mean you read the book.",
