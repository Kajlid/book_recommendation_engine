  "title": "Phantom World",
  "description": "Toby Riester is sixteen, gay, and searching for his first boyfriend. He discovers many potential candidates--Orlando, a cute sixteen year old boy of Latin ancestry who works with Toby at the Phantom World amusement park--C.T., a blond, seventeen year old who is obviously gay--and Spike, a well-built sixteen year old from the internet. Each boy has his own seductive qualities and each is more than his seems. One of them, however, is far more dangerous than Toby ever guessed. Orlando finds himself a girlfriend at Phantom World, but that's only the beginning of his story. When he meets his girlfriend's twin brother, Kerry, his world is turned upside down. Mackenzie Riester is the athletic younger brother of Toby. He has little respect for his queer big brother and joins with his new found friend, Billy, in playing an elaborate practical joke on Toby that becomes more perilous than he ever dreamed. Phantom World is the story of three very different boys--their triumphs, heartaches, and their search for love and acceptance.",
