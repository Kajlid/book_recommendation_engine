  "description": "Paul Taylor is in his last year of high school, watching along with everyone else in the world as the megacorporation known as Star Force leads the nations of Earth into space. Wanting to be a part of the adventure but not qualifying for any of their highly competitive jobs, his chance of joining looks to be nil until one day a new Star Force recruitment package opens up. The A7 program, listed only as 'Looking for the Best of the Best,’ has but a single prequalification...a sub 5:00 mile that Paul's track team skills qualify him for. Figuring he has nothing to lose, Paul takes the Star Force tests expecting to fail, but soon finds himself accepted and whisked away to their headquarters where he learns the truth about the space corporation…and the secret alien threat that it's been created to prepare Earth for. Mind blown, he and the other A7 candidates are then told that they’re not here to help, but to LEAD the hopeless war on the horizon, where victory does not lie in defeating an ancient enemy, but in simply finding a way to survive it. An ancient enemy mistakenly known as… The Dinosaurs.",
