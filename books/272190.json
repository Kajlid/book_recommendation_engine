  "description": "Seventeen and sure of nothing, Maria has left her parents' small-town grocery for university life in Dublin. An ad in the Student Union - \"2 â™€ seek flatmate. No bigots.\" - leads Maria to a home with warm Ruth and wickedly funny Jael, students who are older and more fascinating than she'd expected.A poignant, funny, and sharply insightful coming-of-age story, Stir-Fry is a lesbian novel that explores the conundrum of desire arising in the midst of friendship and probes feminist ideas of sisterhood and non-possessiveness.",
