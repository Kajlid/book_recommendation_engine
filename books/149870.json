  "title": "The Pocket Essential Philip K. Dick",
  "description": "Pocket Essentials is a dynamic series of books that are concise, lively, and easy to read. Packed with facts as well as expert opinions, each book has all the key information you need to know about such popular topics as film, television, cult fiction, history, and more. At a time when most science fiction was about cowboys in outer space, Philip K. Dick explored the landscapes of the mind, conjured with fake realities, and was able to make you believe six impossible things before breakfast. He embodied the counter-culture a decade before the 1960s. Perhaps best known for Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?—the novel which inspired Blade Runner—Dick's world is one where reality is only provisional, where the President might be an android, where psychiatrists come in suitcases, and where God speaks through cat food commercials and comes in a handy aerosol can. As well as having an introductory essay, in this book each of Philip K. Dick's novels is reviewed and analyzed. And for those who want more, there is a listing of the many other books and articles which have grappled with this genius.",
