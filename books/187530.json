  "description": "Midlan has awoken. Soldiers pour from between the gates and monsters descend upon the Kingdom. When Midlan turns its eye to Copperdock, Kael quickly discovers that no realm is safe from the wrath of the King. But while he fights to keep Crevan’s soldiers away from his friends, other powers rise up behind him — including an army so terrible that it threatens to devour everything. All paths lead to Midlan, every fate hinges upon a final battle, and the bloodshed will bring about a reckoning a thousand years in the making — a plan woven by Fate, herself. There’s only one soul she can’t cast a boy from the mountains who might undo everything, if he isn’t stopped. When Kael’s journey carries him to the battle’s end, he doesn’t know that the fate of the Kingdom rests upon his shoulders. The choice he makes will forever change his world … and bring him to the story’s end.",
