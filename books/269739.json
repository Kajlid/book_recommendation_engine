  "description": "I don't think I believe in those daddy and little girl kinks anymore. The idea I use to dwell on for hours of having someone who would make me his forever seems like an old childish dream to me now. All I want to do now is to sit in here and wait for my death to come and take me with it, but you know what? It's simple to say but hard to follow. A human's primal nature would never let him sit and wait for his end, no matter how tired he's. At last, you'll find yourself struggling to live, just like I did. Eager to survive and get out of this hellhole they are keeping me in I try every way possible to keep myself away from the danger, but I failed. Badly. In a hurry of slipping out from one devil's grasp I fell onto another devil's lap, the one which seems more dangerous than the first one.  The big guy who says I am his now. Forever.  Author's Note: The book contains strong sexual material- including but not limited to spanking, various sexual and punishment scenes, and is meant to be read by adults only.",
