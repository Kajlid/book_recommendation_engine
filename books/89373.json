  "description": "As the sun sets over the City of Angels, the nightmare begins for Jake Foster, whose gambling addiction has finally pushed him to the edge. After losing big on what should have been a sure bet, Jake suddenly finds himself on the run from his enraged loan shark, the notorious Jimmy Coletto. Jimmy has just unleashed two of his most ferocious Russian killers on an overnight mission to collect. Meanwhile, Jake manages to solicit the help of the only friend he can count on, Eduardo, a semi-successful gigolo from Marina Del Rey and a former Jimmy Coletto client. The chase is on as Jake struggles desperately to stay alive. But things get even more complicated when Jake’s world gets tangled in the city’s web of porn stars, stoned surfers, and weekend cokeheads. It’s an all-night orgy of creeps, degenerates, and idiots, and everyone’s invited to the party! When the sun rises in Los Angeles, it may just be the clerk at the minimart with the backed-up toilet who saves the day.",
