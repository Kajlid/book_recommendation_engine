  "description": "As a man floats down the Kongo river in the 18th century, his confused thoughts unfold to tell a story of greed, deception, and murder. A skull, some bones, and his recollections reveal the truth about one of Africa's greatest heroines and how she shook the foundations of Catholicism in Africa. Since so many slaves came to America from this region, her story is crucial to understanding early African American Christianity.",
