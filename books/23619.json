  "description": "The announcement that the plague has left some survivors with paranormal side-effects, has left the world reeling. You'd think solving murders would be easy for Claire, a telepath, and Colin, who can turn into a spirit wolf, but you'd be dead wrong. Not everyone is willing to talk to Survivors so it is a good thing you can't tell who's normal and who isn't. Updated edition 12/9/2011",
