  "description": "When Amy finally decides to go out with a bike, he drags her to a moving party that the Black's Raiders MC throws every week. She learns that she has a wild side, and that she loves it. But will her impulses leave her at the mercy of a whole biker gang?If it does, will she even care?EXCERPT: I turned to him, not even sure if I was outraged or turned on.“Where did you bring me?” I demanded.His eyes met mine.“Exactly where you want to be,” he said. “It travels around from bar to bar. You have to know what night to come. But tonight, you want to be here.”Then, slowly, too slowly for me to even claim it came by surprise, he slid his arms to my shoulders and turned me to face the room once more.",
