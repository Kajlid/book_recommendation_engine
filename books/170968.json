  "description": "A story about family, set in the 1990s, and told through the sardonic voice of Valerie Kjos. She's a young Midwestern Gen X'er whose life is just barely coming together with her boyfriend when his Iranian mother, Goli, comes for a visit that seems to never end.Valerie will have to decide what's more important--doing everything her own way, or her beloved Naveed and his live-in mother, who might not approve if she knew everything about her. But as she's about to learn, Goli has secrets of her own.Roseheart has been compared t Bridget Jonesâ€™s Diary, by Helen Fielding; Funny in Farsi, by Firoozeh Dumas; or Welcome to My Planet: Where English is Sometimes Spoken, by Shannon Olson. The culinary imagery in Roseheart has also drawn connections to The Language of Baklava by Diana Abu-Jaber.",
