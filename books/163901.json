  "description": "\"I awoke to find myself in a strange bedchamber; sun was streaming through the window. I was lying naked under some furs on a bed; in the distance I could hear the sounds of horses and men. I sat up and looked around the room, there was a fire crackling in the hearth with a fur rug on the stone floor in front of it. A chair was by the window and my green velvet dress was tossed across the back of it. A large wooden chest sat in one corner and in the other corner was a small table with a jug sat upon it.\" And so begins the tale of The Dragon Keep. The first story in this collection of erotica.",
