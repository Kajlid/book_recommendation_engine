  "title": "Standing as Awareness: The Direct Path",
  "description": "Inspired by Sri Atmananda (Krishna Menon), the Direct Path is a pathless path. It simply articulates the being of you and the world as loving, open, clear awareness. If this truth is realized as your experience, then nothing need be done. The path disappears, and life is lived in sweetness and celebration! But if there are still questions or doubts, the Direct Path contains unique and powerful resources that stabilize this truth as your everyday reality. This is a revised edition of the book, expanded to add chapters on the Direct Path in addition to its selection of dialogs from a decade of Nondual Dinner gatherings. The first three chapters unfold the basics of the Direct Path, such as standing as awareness, being in love with awareness, and exploring awareness. Included are several experiments that help establish your everyday experience as awareness, always and already. The dialogs cover questions such as the desire for enlightenment experiences, the relationship between the brain and awareness, the question of nondually correct language, the belief in physical and mental objects, the idea of having a sage's experience, and more.",
