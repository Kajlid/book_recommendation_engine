  "description": "*One of 2008's Best Books for Kids & Teens (Canadian Children's Book Centre)The stories in All in Together Girls relate the relentless search for identity and the late night drive-through culture of bored teens whose sleepover alibis have left them with no place else to go. Hallmarked by entrances into, and thought-provoking points of exit from, moments of addiction, betrayal, misjudgement, and first kisses, they are defining portraits of girls and women during the storm and stress of self-discovery.",
