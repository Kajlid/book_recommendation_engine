  "description": "They say it takes 28 Questions to fall in love. Then what? 'Funny, clever, sad without self-pity, and with an uplift that is the writing itself' Jeanette Winterson 'If it's an addictive read you're after, consider this your next stop.' \nStylist\n 'An intensely beautiful cleverly layered story of young queer love. An intense but entertaining read. Highly recommend.’ Juno RocheA queer When Harry Met Sally for the Sally Rooney Generation‘Reader, imagine yielding to someone with a power so strong she has the ability to slice time. Before. Her. After.’   When first-year music student Amalia stumbles into her Oxford college bar, she has no idea that everything is about to change. Seated across from her is Alex, a velvety-voiced fellow Australian with eyes the colour of her native sky. They strike up a friendship that is immediate - its intensity both thrilling and terrifying.   As the days and weeks go by, they spend more and more time philosophising, hypothesising, questioning everything. There is nothing they cannot talk about, except the one thing that matters most. Dare they risk a romantic entanglement if it threatens this most perfect of friendships? Set across four years and five cities, and suffused with music, literature, art, dance, sex, and the exquisite pain and pleasure of first love, 28 Questions is a passionate and unforgettable first novel about love in all its guises, growing up, and figuring out who you are along the way.",
