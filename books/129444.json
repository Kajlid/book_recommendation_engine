  "description": "The Mendelson-Devonshire disappearance was a legend; it was also political dynamite. In 1980, the disappearance of Jessie Devonshire and Randy Mendelson had been Portland's biggest news story of the year. It couldn't even be properly called an unsolved crime because it had never been proven that a crime had been committed. All that was known was that fifteen-year-old Jessie Devonshire had vanished without a trace and that Randy Mendelson, a twenty-year-old landscaper, had disappeared at the same time. Had Mendelson abducted Jessie? Had they struck up a romance and run off together? And why had there never been any evidence uncovered? When a couple enjoying a weekend retreat at the local lake find an odd disturbance in the waters, the Clackamas County sheriff department uncovers something no one expected; an old El Camino truck, covered in mud, silt, and most importantly, evidence. Could this truck be linked to the decades-old Mendelson-Devonshire disappearance? Is this truck part of an unrelated murder? Or do the mysteries go even deeper than detective March Corrigan could fathom?",
