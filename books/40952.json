  "description": "International pop star Remey Dufresne just wants a break from it all.

He doesn’t expect special treatment from the people who live there, he just wants a haven of his own. But what he doesn’t expect is to fall in love—with the town, with its people, and with the local high school music teacher and his precocious little girl. Single father Aleksander Kelly is by no means impressed by Remey’s presence. In fact, he’s downright irritated. With the media frenzy invading his hometown and inconveniencing everyone, Aleks would rather Remey go back to La-La Land and leave them all alone. It’s a shame the guy’s so good-looking. And kind. And not at all the celebrity diva Aleks expected. But the Hollywood machine never stops, and fame isn’t something from which you can easily escape. There’s more than just their hearts on the line when Remey’s obligations and Aleks’s reservations collide...",
