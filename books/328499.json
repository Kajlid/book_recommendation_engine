  "description": "September 1989 - Freshers week at the Dorset Institute of Higher Education is in full swing. A new student, Fudge, has just moved into a house in Boscombe, Bournemouth, with three fellow housemates - all eager to enjoy themselves after leaving home for the first time. However, on his way back from a night out, Fudge witnesses something sinister in the woods. Being the only lead in the resulting investigation he finds it increasingly difficult to balance partying and helping the police with their inquiries. A booze-fuelled romp, loosely based on true events.",
