  "description": "Zee was literally company property until the daring mission that brought her freedom and the legal status as a human being. But the company wasn't willing to relinquish a multi-million dollar asset without a fight, and had an ace up its sleeve. Now Zee finds herself in another fight for her life. But the argument the company makes is so compelling that it even has Zee questioning her identity. Now she wonders if she is even human. Is she just a construct of the company, or is she really the person who's name she was given?",
