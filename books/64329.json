Anna is determined to find some fun soon - not to mention some decent sex.Then a sensational new book comes out, suggesting that women are just as capable as men of having affairs purely for sexual pleasure. Could sex be like going for a facial, except you get an orgasm instead of your blackheads squeezed? There's only one way to find out.Anna - a 37-year-old mother of two in desperate need of a tummy tuck, breast lift and open pore surgery - is about to spend the next few weeks committing adultery for the pure joy of it - and with hilarious results.But there's a catch. Anna still loves her husband. And by setting out on her lone quest, she's putting her marriage at risk...Fast, funny, shocking and unputdownable, Neurotica is a novel for every woman who has ever wondered how high you can fly with an airline captain and just what male strippers keep in their posing pouches. But be warned: this book will have you shouting with laughter!",
