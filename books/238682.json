  "description": "Have you ever shared a story with family, or friends about your life and have them rolling on the floor with tears of laughter? I have, many times. Most of my stories contain large amounts of humour, small traces of tragedy, and a pinch of grossness.It is not often that a person will admit to having used a takeaway coffee cup as a makeshift toilet, in the car, while in gear, because their excretory system was too impatient to wait for the real deal. I don't know many people who have been mauled by a kitten and survived to tell their story. It is not everyday that you catch your mom walking down a busy intersection with five cats, in a continental pillow case, on her back, on her way to the vet. I am almost sure that I am the only human to have beaten herself with a hosepipe in a desperate attempt to stop a dog fight.If the above paragraph does not pique your interest as to what my entire memoir could possibly be about, then I suggest you put this book down now.What makes this memoir extra special is the fact that it is written by a person who suffers with bipolar disorder, not to mention all the other exotic mental illnesses that I have. As a \"Bipolarian\", I do believe that my memoirs will allow other people to feel better about their lives, even if only for a moment.This memoir is honest and real. In a world where such values are hard to find, this book is not ashamed to share my most awesome memories with you. I hope you enjoy it.WARNING!!!This book contains explicit language sarcasm. Read at own risk.",
