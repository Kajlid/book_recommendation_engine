  "description": "Former Marine Howard “Nash” Nashton takes his new job as a bouncer at Big D’s strip club seriously, but when it’s suggested he strut his stuff on stage, he laughs it off. Handling drunken women is much easier than facing stage fright or his crush on Peter, a hot stripper who used to do ballet. When Peter’s biggest fan turns into a stalker, Nash comes to the rescue and sticks close to the dancer. Opposites attract, but underneath they aren’t so different. Passion ignites between the men, but this wasn’t the world Nash planned on entering. Still, Peter won’t give up on his dream of a happy ending with a hot military man.",
