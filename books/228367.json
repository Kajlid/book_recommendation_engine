  "description": "SISTERS. REVENGE. MURDER. Angeline Porter, a criminal lawyer, finds her sister Sophie dead from suicide and wearing a blue dress from Gerard Duverney, her French lover, and father of Sophie's unborn child. Guilty that she didn't protect her sister, Angeline seeks revenge. If anyone deserved better it was Sophie. Disguised as a journalist, she travels to Paris to murder Duverney. Under the pretext of writing a travel piece on how to spend a Christmas holiday season in Paris, she entices him into accompanying her around the city, but finds that some things Sophie told her don't add up. Plus, she has another problem--her growing attraction to the Frenchman. What is the truth? Can she murder him? Why did her sister kill herself? She'll know the answers soon enough.",
