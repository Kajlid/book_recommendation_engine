  "description": "\"When HRH Prince John, the fourth son of the Queen of England, goes AWOL in Seattle, he meets Catori Moriarty, an unusual girl from New Mexico. John hails from a thousand years of British royalty. Tori doesn’t know who her biological parents were. He was raised in a glass box call Buckingham Palace and taught to repress his emotions. She was taught how to heal her wounds and live in joy. He suffers from debilitating migraines that threaten his career as a pilot in the Royal Navy. She can use her extraordinary higher sense perception to heal. Both are older than their years and love physics. Obviously they were made for each other, and their accidental meeting was divinely orchestrated. Too bad John’s married and off-limits, and Tori prefers the simple life. Did the universe get it wrong? Unwilling for the magic to end, they set out on a road trip to Tori’s home in Albuquerque. It’s a slice-of-life journey that ultimately spans three continents and includes two-headed snake stops and many perfect moments. Along the way they discover that they’ve been in each other’s consciousness since Tori was born and that they can communicate empathically. John’s career is saved, but each return to his ship proves wrenching. Tori learns that leaving her comfort zone is good for her soul—and his. It’s a love affair that rocks the British monarchy, but the ripples it sends out glisten.\"",
