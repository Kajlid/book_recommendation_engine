  "title": "Derriford: Confirmed Bachelors Book 5",
  "description": "Viscount Derriford likes to keep a low profile. He avoids ton parties and the ladies who frequent them whenever possible, preferring to spend time with his fellow bachelors. A predictable, undemanding existence suits him perfectly. Marriage has never been part of his plans; he is convinced he could never make any woman happy. However, when his aunt dies, leaving him a property in Somerset, this safe, untrammelled existence is threatened by a condition attached to his inheritance. He must accept all invitations proffered by the local gentry.Miss Mary Coker is a spinster fast approaching her thirtieth birthday. Having rejected the only offer of marriage ever offered her when she was nineteen, she has long ago given up on the prospect of a home of her own. She is resigned to a life supporting her Mama and siblings. When Lord Derriford arrives in the neighbourhood, she soon notices his awkwardness in dealing with the fairer sex and determines to try and make him more comfortable. She discovers there is rather more to him than meets the eye.",
