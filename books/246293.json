  "description": "After an arranged marriage, Lady Emma arrives at the estate of her new husband still uncertain as to why he chose her to be his bride. Edmund is rich and darkly handsome. He could have picked from a hundred girls with better prospects, most of whom would be eagerly anticipating her wedding night with a racing pulse. But, alas, the only thing making Emma's heart skip a beat is Edmund's stern but stunning housekeeper. Still, Emma knows her duties as a wife. Regardless of her own desires, she intends to fulfill her marital obligations. But Edmund has no interest in a wife that lies back and thinks of England. Emma is to be trained. With the help of his housekeeper's considerable skills and the intimate application of a ginger root, her new husband intends to transform her from a hesitant bride into a mare in heat. Emma and her delicate posterior are in for a wedding night that's far hotter than she anticipates... in more ways than one!",
