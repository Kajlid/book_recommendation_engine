  "description": "\"The end was nothing like any one of us could have imagined it would be. Humans, with their obsession with the ultimate and inevitable conclusion of their world, had thought through every destructive doomsday scenario to be imagined. Every scenario but the right one. The end was not quick. The earth was not destroyed by some rogue asteroid, or a collision with a vigilante planet. It was not blasted away by the antimatter of a distant galaxy, and it definitely was not the work of a virus or plague. The end of the world was a slow and gradual death for most of the living creatures on the face of the earth. The aftermath of manâ€™s recklessness left the wounded planet defenseless as its shadows consumed the skies and devoured its atmosphere. It took many lifetimes to watch mother Earth breathe her last, and with her vanished our only source of replenishment. We were forced to starve for eternity. We the immortal, we the undying.\" Volume 1. THE UNDYING is the tale of Wilhelmina Shepherd's life, from a young, innocent, wild girl growing up in Fremont, LA, to the world's most ruthless murderess. A tragic romance that spans through waging demonic wars to the extinction of mankind and beyond, The Undying is the tale of one demon's life until the end of the world.",
