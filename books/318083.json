  "description": "After spending summer alone in our family vacation home in Florida, it was time to face reality. My mother had run off and married another rich jerk two months ago, and they have been celebrating their honeymoon in the south of France. I’d avoided going back to Connecticut because our home would soon be taken over by the dreaded step-siblings. I had no intention of getting to know my new family. This was my mother’s fourth marriage, and I wasn’t going to waste another moment getting close to someone who wouldn’t be around in a few years anyway. But after I found my boyfriend Chase in bed with another woman, I needed to get out of this place. So I booked a first-class ticket back to Hell and would be home before the sun sets tomorrow. CONTAINS: STEPBROTHER ROMANCE & VIRGIN Filthy Rich is a novella in the Quick and Dirty Series. If you like a short and sweet story with instalove and a happily ever after, this book is for you. Every book in the series is completely standalone. Be warned – the sex in this is raw and taboo. It is not for the faint of heart. Now dive in, you dirty little kitten.",
