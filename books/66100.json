Mindy is travelling with six strange men in a hard-riding stagecoach. When the coach breaks down, they’re forced to walk the thirty-five miles remaining to her destination. That would be enough to try anyone’s patience, but then the company is set upon by thieves and murderers in the form of the evil Byler brothers, and the stakes are raised.Fortunately, Mindy makes the close acquaintance of two “gentlemen,” Luke Wilhite and Gary Boone, who try to help her through these dangers.Luke is tall and fair, while Boone is taller and dark. Mindy feels an immediate attraction to Boone, but he’s married! Or is he? Who will finally win Mindy’s affection?",
