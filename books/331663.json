  "title": "Writing in the Sand: Jesus and the Soul of the Gospels",
  "description": "In his latest work, Thomas Moore examines the Gospels. He uses a new approach based on a fresh reading of the original Greek texts, newly discovered gospels and employs psychology and archetypal studies. In this book, Moore shows that Jesus’ teachings are challenging in a way that is far different from the moralism often associated with him. Writing in the Sand sets forth how we can today live the way of life that Jesus represents, showing that Jesus is a vibrant figure whose teachings can be meaningfully integrated into our twenty-first century intellectual and spiritual lives. Moore also unravels the mystery of Jesus in the past and present, from the hidden and coded texts of the Gospels, and the result will enlighten and delight readers.",
