  "description": "Adventures in Immediate Irreality, the masterwork of the Romanian writer Max Blecher, vividly paints the crises of \"irreality\" that plagued him in his youth: eerie and unsettling mirages wherein he would glimpse future events. In gliding chapters that move with a peculiar dream logic of their own, this memoiristic novel sketches the tremulous, frightening, and exhilarating awakenings of a young man.",
