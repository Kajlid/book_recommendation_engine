  "title": "Reflections, a Collection of Poems & Writings",
  "description": "There are a great many books discussing the poetry of others but few of those books are written by the poet himself. The goal of Reflections is to share Christopher Oberts poems with the world and discuss his thought process as he worked on writing the poetry. This self critiquing will give the reader (or student) a distinctive view into the writing of poetry. The variety of poems in the book range from his early work to his current writing, permitting the reader to see how his writing style has changed over the years. The poems subject matter is wide and varied. Because Chris describes the different forms of poetry and special meanings behind the poems, he allows the book to be both stimulating and a unique teaching tool for the reader. He discusses what motivates him and gives a few challenges for the reader to try their hand at poetry. Overall, it would be a fine addition to any private collection, library or school curriculum.",
