  "title": "More Christian Than African-American: ...and Other Ways Jesus Turned My World Upside Down",
  "description": "For almost thirty years, Kimberly Cash Tate lived, moved and had her being in blackness. That was who she was. Her decisions, judgments, attitudes and opinions--the way she saw the world--were all filtered through her black lens. Even gender issues paled in relative importance. She was black first. A woman second. But then she acquired another defining adjective--Christian--and her world was turned completely upside down. In More Christian than African-American, Kimberly shares her life before and after Christ. In transparent prose, she leads the reader through the seasons of growing up in Prince Georges County, Maryland, reveling in college and finding the love of her life during law school--only to risk losing him when he accepted a position in Madison, Wisconsin. What black woman in her right mind would volunteer to move there? It was too white. Ultimately, it was the Lord who moved Kimberly to Madison, where He saved her and utterly transformed her view of marriage, motherhood and the career shed worked so long and hard to achieve. As she ventured beyond the familiarity of race, God changed her identity.",
