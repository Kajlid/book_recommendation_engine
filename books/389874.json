  "title": "The Cure For All Advanced Cancers",
  "description": "Cancer can now be cured, not only the early stages, but also advanced cancer, stages four and five, including imminent death. We are not accustomed to thinking about a cure. We think of remission as the only possiblity. But this book is not about remission. It is about a cure. this is possible because the true cause of cancer has been found. The Cause of the malignancy is explained in the earlier book, The Cure For All Cancers. But removing the malignancy left behind the tumors as they were, prior to the malignant development. So, eliminating tumors became the focus of additional research, and is the subject of this book. The 21 Day Program described in this book does both. Once you win this battle, even advanced cancer can be cured. The success rate for advanced cancer is about 95%. So you can count on this method, not merely hope it will work for you. It is a total approach that not only shrinks tumors, but also normalizes your blood chemistry, lowers your cancer markers, and returns your health. The small failure rate (5%) is due to clinical emergencies that beset the advanced cancer sufferer. However, if you combine the advice in this book with access to hospital care, even hopeless patients can gain the time necessary to become well again.",
