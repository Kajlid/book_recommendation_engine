  "description": "Love bites when a seventeen-year-old vampire and witch tangle. Marissa Lakeland faces her worst nightmare one dark and misty night when she chases a gorgeous hunk of a guy to prove he's a vampire. So why does the thought of tall, dark and vampiric appeal to Marissa, when there's no way a vampire can compel a witch to do his bidding? At least that's what she's read in vampire lore. But lore can be mistaken. Fledgling vampire Dominic Vorchowski knows Marissa's the only one who can save him. Only why does she have to be a witch? Fate has thrown him together with the bewitching Marissa and if he gains her trust, he'll have his life back again. Except for that whole eternal thirst for blood thing. And the fangs. Not to mention the aversion to intense sunlight. In any event, he's set his sights on one girl who's totally off the menu. The centuries-old vamp Lynetta wants Dominic to replace the lover she lost, and no teenaged witch is going to take her guy away. Dominic and Marissa must stop the vampiress from winning the battle of the night.but time is running out.",
