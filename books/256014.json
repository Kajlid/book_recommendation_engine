  "title": "Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World",
  "description": "Beyond the world we can quantify, classify and analyse there is another, more mysterious world. In this book Arthur C Clarke investigates this supra-scientific world. Under his direction, Simon Welfare and John Fairley travelled five continents interviewing witnesses of strange and unexplained phenomena. They talked to men and women who had seen monsters from the depths of oceans and lakes, had been showered by frogs and fishes and had watched 'unidentified flying objects' crossing the night sky in brilliant light; they talked to explorers and mountain people who had seen the yeti, the abominable snowman and his cousin 'Bigfoot'. More threatening events are also evaluated in the hope that we can glean evidence which may prevent future catastrophe.Arthur C Clarke would not wish, even if it were possible, to provide answers to all the questions posed in this book. As he writes: 'The universe is such a strange and wonderful place that reality will always out-reach the wildest imnagination.'",
