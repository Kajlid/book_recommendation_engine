  "description": "The Naked Truth...\nAfter eight Seasons in London, Lady Jane Parker-Roth is ready to quit the dull search for a husband in favor of more exciting pursuits. So when she encounters an intruder in her host's townhouse, she's not about to let the scoundrel escape. Until she discovers she's wrestling a viscount-Edmund Smyth, the one noble she wouldn't mind meeting in the dark. And when their struggle shatters a randy statue of the god Pan, even more mischief ensues...Edmund was indeed searching for evidence of a scandal, but the shocking clues inside the nude statue are far from what he expected. The same can be said of Jane, who shows a talent for interfering in his affairs. And as his quest becomes more than a little improper, he finds the impetuous Lady has a talent for that as well...\nPraise for the Novels of Sally MacKenzie\n\"The romance equivalent of chocolate cake...every page is an irresistible delight!\"-Lisa Kleypas\"Plenty of sexy sizzle and charming wit.\"-Booklist \"Plenty of heat and hilarity.\"-Publishers Weekly\"Naked, noble and irresistible.\"-Eloisa James",
