  "description": "Two girls that know how to have a good time.  When it comes to having a good time, Shayla Carson and Sydney Dane know the recipe. Two best friends for life, plenty of drugs to sell for the Devil Knights and no boundaries. When they add in a new delivery man from the MC, things come to a boiling point quick.   Some days at work are better than others.  With iron eyes and an imposing presence, Neil Jackson doesn't worry about much. He doesn't like the business direction the Devil Knights have taken, but Anton Sellick is the President, not him. When his new task is delivering supply to two of Anton's top sellers, he comes face to face to face with the women who will turn his life around.   Sometimes the best decision is no decision at all.  The Devil Knights are the major drug source in Santa Domingo. Neil knows he needs to get out before things take a turn for the worse, but Shayla and Sydney have put those thoughts on hold. Having feelings for both women feels wrong, but they make it feel so right.",
