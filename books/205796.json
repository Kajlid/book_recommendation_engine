  "description": "World War Z meets Grapes of Wrath! The old world is dying, but a new world is born!  The first volume of Taz Gallaher's long-awaited zombie epic follows three characters as they struggle to survive the zombie apocalypse: Chewy, a hard-bitten ex-con, battling to stay on the straight side of the street in Fresno, California; Mona, an upwardly mobile lawyer, marooned in her Bronx apartment building; and, Brady, a Midwestern computer hacker who undertakes a cross-country trip to safety. As the old world crumbles around them, each must defend family and friends, find safety, discover who they really are, and start to fashion a new world from within the ruins of the old.  Chronicling the zombie apocalypse from coast-to-coast, Republic of the Living: Exodus braids its character-driven narratives with vivid snapshots of the apocalypse and its aftermath: a bastion in the middle of the Mississippi River encircled by zombie hordes; the last blog post on the failing internet; a forsaken soldier trekking from defeat at the hands of the undead; San Francisco in the aftermath of ZA; post-apocalyptic combat in the desolate streets of a windswept Montana town; and more. In the style of Steinbeck's great American epic, these postcards from the present and the future supply the widescreen experience of the novel's action.  Welcome to the big book of zombie lit - - volume one!",
