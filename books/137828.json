  "title": "Ignorant, Pathless, Characterless, Spontaneous, Inactive: How These Qualities Will Make You Happy",
  "description": "Have you become a learned by seeking all of the knowledge of the world, yet continue to feel restless? Have you accomplished what you have sought to achieve, yet remain unhappy? When will you find the rest that you seek? If you feel restless, you have removed yourself far away from reality.  Knowledge, philosophy, doctrines, and dogmas are the enemies of truth. They give you a distorted and disconnected sense of reality. They make you ungrounded, whereas reality is naked, here and now.  Are you obsessed with activity? If so, you will learn to be more passive and receptive. Only then, when you become passive and receptive, will reality show you its real face.  Are you a conformist who has not yet found individual freedom? In that case, you need to embody the qualities of ignorance, pathlessness, characterlessness, spontaneity, and inactivity, as explained in this book. By naturally embodying these qualities you will achieve more than ever before. These are the qualities that are necessary for you to reconnect with real life and reality. These qualities will put you in tune with the wholeness that will act through you. When you are ignorant, pathless, characterless, spontaneous, and inactive, you become centered, grounded, and purposeful inside. You dance with the universe, and you find happiness. In order to attain freedom and happiness, however, you must unlearn what you have already learned.",
