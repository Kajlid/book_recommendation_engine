  "title": "Superstoe",
  "description": "Several carefully masterminded national crises, crop failures, livestock epidemics and a limited human plague have caused a U.S. governmental crisis. In the name of patriotism, former university professors Paxton Superstoe, Benjamin Adams and Lazarus Furth launch a madcap scheme to take over the government and put Superstoe in the White House. The country, indeed the world, will never be the same again. \"Superstoe\" is a delightfully whimsical tale of the complete revamping of the American political and social scene.",
