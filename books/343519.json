  "title": "The Sunny Side: Short Stories and Poems for Proper Grown-Ups",
  "description": "From the beloved creator of Winnie-the-Pooh comes an irresistible collection of short stories guaranteed to delight readers of all ages. Drawing from a collection of stories originally published in 1921 and chosen exclusively by the author himself, The Sunny Side gathers the best short works by the inimitable A. A. Milne. Written for the satire magazine Punch , these brief stories and essays perfectly capture Milne's sly humor, beguiling social insight, and scathing wit. From \"Odd Verses\" to \"War Sketches,\" \"Summer Days\" to \"Men of Letters,\" Milne takes his readers from the stiff British drawing room to the irreverent joy of a boy's day at the beach. Ideal for curling up with in the hammock or stretching out by the fire, these tales shine brightly any day of the year. Complete with a series of whimsical illustrations, The Sunny Side offers the perfect chance to rediscover this forgotten classic by one of our most cherished authors.",
