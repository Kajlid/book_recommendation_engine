  "description": "This guts-and-glory biography covers the trials and tribulations of legendary 80s rock band Personality Crisis. Largely unknown outside of hardcore punk circles, Personality Crisis were hugely influential and remain popular even though they played their last show in 1984. This big 6X9 book is packed with posters and photos, making it well worth the price.",
