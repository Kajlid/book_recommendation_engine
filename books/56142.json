  "title": "First Course In Turbulence",
  "description": "Finalist for ForeWord Magazine 1999 Poetry Book of the YearWith rapid shifts between subject and tone, sometimes within single poems, Dean Youngâ€™s latest book explores the kaleidoscopic welter of art and life. Here parody does not exclude the cri de coeur any more than seriousness excludes the joke. With surrealist volatility, these poems are the result of experiments that continue for the reader during each reading. Young moves from reworkings of creation myths, the index of the Norton Anthology of Poetry , pseudo reports and memos, collaged biographies, talking clouds, and worms, to memory, mourning, sexual playfulness, and deep sadness in the course of this turbulent book.",
