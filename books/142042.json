  "title": "Skin Tight",
  "description": "Who would have thought that she’d ever have to thank her brother (and the drunken ogre who didn’t know when to sit down and shut up, of course) for literally dropping her into the arms of the man of her dreams?Not Leah, that’s for sure. But now she’s had to thank Calland a thousand times over for taking her and Chloe with him to the UFC fight that landed her in the arms (and bed) of the tall, tattooed, sexy-as-sin, Ian. Ever since, Leah and Ian have been inseparable; they’re happy and in love. But there’s someone who’s determined to see that happiness end. Victoria has been a pain in Ian’s ass all his life, though a harmless one. Family “friends” since childhood, he’s laughed off her random visits and claims of undying love. Now with Leah in the picture, Victoria has upped the ante and it’s no longer a laughing matter.Victoria may claim to be crazy in love (or just plain crazy), but Ian and Leah, with all the usual suspects at their backs to offer love and support…and lots of laughs along the way… make it known that they’re in it for the long haul and Victoria can’t change that. But Victoria is used to getting what she wants…and what she wants is Ian. And she’s made it clear that she’ll do whatever it takes to have him… *Recommended for readers 18+ due to HOT sexual encounters, adult situations, and language. **This is book four of the Skin Deep Series; recommended to read after Skin Deep, book one of the series, Under My Skin, book two of the series, and Skin to Skin, book three of the series.",
