While their allies wage war on a thousand different fronts, the XVIth Legion descend upon the Knight World of Molech &#8211; home to House Devine and their feudal levies, and a principal seat of Imperial military power. Just what could have drawn Horus to attack such a strongly defended planet, and what might he be willing to sacrifice to fulfill his own dark destiny?",
