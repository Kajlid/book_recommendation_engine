This book is a stand-alone and can be read out of order, but the series is best read in order to gain the full experience. This is not your mother’s contemporary romance. Daring readers will encounter violence, gun play, garden variety BDSM, and a HEA. It is not for the faint of heart. It’s a full length novel of 60,000 words with no cliffhanger. Recommended 18+ due to mature content and possible triggers.",
