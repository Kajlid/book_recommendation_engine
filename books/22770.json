  "description": "Vampire slayer Tazrein Noir willingly served humanity… until the pull of the night destroyed the one good thing she had left. Now she struggles between the power of light and darkness within her. And the dark may be winning. Mr. Elson is a Minoan General—one of the immortal dynasty of Crete, now also head of security for Pseira Industries. Haunted by the sins of his father, he spends his entire life as a light for honor, justice and sacrifice. Yet without his fated mate, he’ll become all the things he fears… Lordel Pseira is the ruler of the Minoans, as well as the very modern CEO of Pseira Industries. On the verge of succumbing to the darkness, without his light, he shall be lost… Lordel’s light is Mr. Elson’s fated Tazrein. Deception, passion, and death hound Tazrein’s every move. The Minoans want her blood to unlock the key to save their dying race. The Knights of Mortis want her dead so she cannot fulfill destiny. And the vile Nox want her for themselves so they can rule over all. Sacrifice and blood. Sex and love. Destiny and fate. The balance hangs in Tazrein’s hands…and in the eyes of the two men she fears she cannot live without, despite her continued existence hanging in the sweetly seductive balance between them both.",
