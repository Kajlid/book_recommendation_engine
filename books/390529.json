  "title": "All He Ever Wanted",
  "description": "A man escaping from a hotel fire sees a woman standing beneath a tree. He approaches her and sets in motion a series of events that will change his life forever. Years later, traveling from New England to Florida by train, he reflects back on his obsession with this unknown and ultimately unknowable woman--his courtship of her, his marriage to her, and the unforgivable act that ripped their family apart. Spanning three decades from 1899 to 1933, ALL HE EVER WANTED gives us a tale of marriage, betrayal, and the search for redemption. It has the unmatched attention to details of character, place, and emotion that have made Anita Shreve one of America's best-loved and bestselling novelists.- Shreve's last two novels, Sea Glass and The Last Time They Met, have sold 258,000 and 212,000 in hardcover, respectively. And paperback sales for The Last Time They Met have topped 600,000.- Over 4.8 million copies of Shreve's Little, Brown books have been sold to date.- The Weight of Water is now a feature film, to be released on November 1, 2002, and is sure to bring Shreve to an even broader audience.",
