  "title": "It's a Purl Thing",
  "description": "A fun, frothy novel about friendship and knitting. Scottie feels like her whole world is turning upside down. Then she discovers knitting, and it’s as if she s been thrown a cashmerino lifeline. Soon Scottie and her best friend Amanda, along with new friends Bella and Tay, find themselves hanging at their local yarn store, a magical place called KnitWit, bound together by a yen for yarn and a hunger for friendship. Their stitches and their relationships become so intertwined that it’s hard to remember which came first: the girls or the purls. Chicks With Sticks is not just for crafty types (through it does include several knitting patterns and projects). It’s for anyone who’s ever found friends in the most unlikely place or wanted to. Sometimes you just need some string and sticks with some full-fat hot chocolate on the side to get you there.",
