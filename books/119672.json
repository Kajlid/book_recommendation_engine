  "description": "Eagan lives in a world where wizards, shadows and dragons once roamed the lands and may yet come again! After centuries of peace, heroic battles and creatures of the night have long since faded into myth and fireside tales. Only Eagan, The Guardian of the West, knows the truth. The night-shadows will return and the people must be ready to defend themselves. The only hope of the land are the mighty dragons who slumber – awaiting the call to service – and one lone wizard. Book one in a trilogy that will delight and entertain you as it carries you off to a new world.",
