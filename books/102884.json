  "title": "Saint Nicholas: The Real Story of the Christmas Legend",
  "description": "Many parents and teachers struggle with how to approach the Saint Nicholas/Santa Claus dilemma. Many deal with this by telling children that the legends surrounding Santa Claus are based on a real, historical figure named Nicholas, a Christian bishop known for his generosity. This picture book presents a shortened, somewhat fictionalized version of the life of Saint Nicholas, explaining that Nicholas was a servant of God and that, through him, God's love was reflected to others. The story touches on the ministry of Nicholas and his generous gift of a dowry to three young girls as a response to God's love in Jesus. And it brings application to our own lives as we, too, respond with grateful hearts to God's great gift of love to us. Combining museum-quality artwork and family-friendly language, this book clearly articulates how God showered His love upon us through Christ and helps children see that our own gift-giving is a grateful response to the sacrificial gift of God's Son.",
