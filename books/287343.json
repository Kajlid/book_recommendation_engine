  "description": "It is the mettle to proceed that matters ...\n\nThe Labyrinth behind him, Terry and company arrive on the Eastern Steppes in the midst of a carnival, and a fateful decision puts him under a dire curse. Stripped of his bond powers and exiled to the dreamlike Wildervast, he must find and free the ultimate witch, then kill an invincible man. Meanwhile, those left behind must face the machinations of the tauren herd leaders, whose law allows them to take a template for common use, and the remnants of Theseus' bonds in search of revenge. Beyond all, there remain the inscrutable machinations of Vlad the Dreamer, and the immortal might of the Twilight Zone's gorgon, Stheno.  \n\nWarning: This book does not pan to waving curtains and fade to black. Those uninterested or under the age of eighteen are strongly warned of explicit content.",
