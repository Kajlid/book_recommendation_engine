  "description": "It was Vietnam, 1965, but the rockets' red glare wasn't hot enough for brazen, challenge-hungry pilot Pete Mallory. He fanned the heat by wagering he could seduce his C.O.'s sister and fly away unscathed. But no-nonsense Tess Ramsey zeroed in on his soul-deep vulnerability - and the cocky chopper jockey took a nosedive. Worse, once he'd found her, no-strings Pete had something to lose. And he'd have to battle every devil of war's hell to snatch Tess from the widening jaws of mortal peril.",
