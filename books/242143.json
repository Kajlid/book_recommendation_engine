  "title": "The Wall of Water",
  "description": "Winner of the LA Women-in-Theatre New Play AwardOriginal Yale Repertory TheatreThe perfect rent controlled NY apartment has one fatal flaw--the roommate from hell. The play takes place on the day the newest roommate can't take it anymore. Classic humor of mistaken identity mixed with new-age twists. The Wall of Water is farce with all the sharp edges showing--it is an intractably woven tale that tackles subjects as serious as death and as important as scientific inquiry, and everything inbetween. A farce about the nature of madness, the way it is infectious, how we treat it and how we decided who is and who isn't. A play with 4 leading roles for young women about strong women and the men who love and sometimes sedate them.",
