  "description": "Ilya The rest of us woke after a few days, when it became apparent we'd survived the drug. Even Corinne woke faster the first time. This time, three weeks had passed. I was grateful for the scans and other tests Dr. Farrell ran, indicating she was alive. Still, I was terrified for her. And for me. I spoke to her often and lately, I begged her to open her eyes. After surviving the drug a second time, Corinne's abilities are put to the test as the enemy steps up his attacks. Will she survive the attempts on her life, as well as betrayal from within? As she struggles to keep the others alive, a new threat arrivesâ€”one even the enemy doesn't see coming.",
