  "description": "One girl. One guy. One imaginary friend. Three is definitely a crowd!Former foster kid, Clemence Connelly, survived her childhood thanks to her imaginary sidekick, Little.When she finally lands her dream job as a French-to-English interpreter, she comes face-to-crotch with her professional rival, Parisian posh boy, Raphaël Debussy.While he shows her Paris-by-night and deploys his best ‘player’ tricks to get into Clemence’s culotte, Little uses her own powers of persuasion (a.k.a. tantrums!) to nip any romance in the bud.Clemence is stuck in the middle until a mysterious stalker slithers out of the shadows, leaving her with no choice but to take charge, secure her job and wage her one-woman war against shitty luck.This witty, sexy, enemies-to-lovers romcom with a big heart will make you chuckle, swoon and shed a tear or two.
