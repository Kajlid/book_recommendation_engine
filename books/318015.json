  "description": "He could've chosen anyone, but he chose me.DeviI've been part of the Iron Vex MC for years now and being a full patch member is so close. So close in fact I can almost taste it. I'll do whatever I need to prove myself to Boss, to show her I deserve to be here. Nothing will stand in my way. Or at least, it's what I thought.Someone walks right into my path and turns my entire world upside down. He mistakes me for a clubwh***, but I don't mind it. The way he wraps his hand around my throat and stares into my eyes with burning desire is unlike anything I've experienced before.There's only one problem. The man who intrigues me is none other than Joker, Boss' brother, and the Prez of our Toronto charter. I know I shouldn't let him get any closer, but I can't keep pushing him back. Every time I do, he only comes closer.",
