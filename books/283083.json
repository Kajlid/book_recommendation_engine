  "description": "The Stark boys threw me away like ten day old trash.   Once upon a time, I was their everything. Once upon a time, I belonged to them. I should have known better than to think they'd keep me around. If there's one thing the rich are good at, it's throwing away something long before it's broken. If there's one thing they're even better at, it's breaking the things they promised to protect. But here's the thing they don't quite get - I might be shattered, but I'm not broken. They're prepared to fight, but I'm not prepared to go down without a fight.  The Stark Boys Some secrets are better left shot and buried. Some loves are better left lost. If Jenna thinks she's strong enough, she surely hasn't got a clue just what kind of power we have over her. We'll break her once. Twice. Three times if that's what it takes. And no, we're not dumb enough to think we can throw money at karma and ask for a pass. We're more than prepared to break a little too. After all, her and us were never a story that could end in happiness.  Vengeance High is a high school bully romance novel with guys who might or might not mind sharing.",
