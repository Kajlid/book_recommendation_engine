  "description": "At first glance, the sleepy suburb of Jonesville, Massachusetts doesn't seem to have much going on. The teens at Jonesville High are itching for more, ready to escape the confines of suburbia and the cliché of classroom cliques⁠... but there's more to the story behind closed doors. Town darling and star athlete Tarkin Shaw reveals himself to be a predator who has used his privilege to prey upon girls for years⁠, with no consequences. After a shocking assault, a group of shaken but stubborn friends are ready for revenge - but things don't quite go as planned⁠. Instead, they're forced to step up and confront the injustice of a world that paints girls as victims who get what they deserve.",
