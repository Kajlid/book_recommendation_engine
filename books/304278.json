  "description": "On 23rd June 2010, in every country across the globe, the dead inexplicably awaken with murderous resolve. For the first days, Erin Locke – Lockey to her friends – survives alone as society collapses in England with shocking speed.With her trademark snarky sense of humour, goofy insights, and can-do attitude, she chronicles her early adventures in a journal to keep her spirits high and sanity intact, until she befriends retired Royal Marine veteran Nate Carter, and the unlikely duo find themselves a place they can call home.Her newfound security is threatened by an encounter with other survivors that ends in blood, and a vengeful hunt by the dead man’s brother begins. After skirmishes with the self-styled feudal lord of their new lawless existence, the pair learn they are the only chance of salvation for innocents enslaved by the aspiring warlord and are forced to act for more than their own survival.There are no heroes left, so the captives’ only hope are one fast-talking, foul-mouthed woman, and one deadly, middle-aged ex-marine.Set in the world of Chris Philbrook’s best-selling zombie apocalypse, Adrian’s Undead Diary, No More Heroes opens the world up, illuminating the nightmare of the United Kingdom, and bringing its heroes into the light.",
