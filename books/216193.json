  "description": "Miscellaneous thoughts I have with myself when I observe the world. Ride with me the waves of my thoughts. Sometimes I reach the highest heights of hope, at other times I reach the deepest of despair. Sometimes I am happy, at other times I am sad. At some point I am a believer, and at some other time an unbeliever. Sometimes I love, some other times I hate. Thatâ€™s what it means to be human. I am not supernatural, just a common man, trying to make sense of my existence. Ride on.",
