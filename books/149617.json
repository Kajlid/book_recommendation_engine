  "description": "Three women turn one man’s life into a deadly game.Easy-going Kris Kartofski just wants to be a good father to his little boy, Jake. His marriage to Caitlin broke down last year and he lost some of his trust in women, but he’s prepared to give love another chance. He decides to take a risk on a new girl he met online by the name of Janis. She seems sweet enough and he’s eager to hook up. So one afternoon he drives out to her family’s isolated ranch and Janis’ brawny aunt, Dawn, greets him at the porch. Wide-eyed Dawn is bright and bubbly and quick to show off her late grandfather’s prized collection of firearms. Kris receives a warm welcome and plenty to eat, but he soon gets a gut feeling he hadn’t bargained for – a quiet voice inside his head is telling him to get out.Kris quickly convinces himself he’s got Janis’ family wrong and that he should try harder to get along. He redoubles his efforts, but as time edges on, he accepts that the dynamic between these three women is deeply flawed. Janis is acting like a child in their presence and chatty Dawn appears to have complete control over the silent member of the household, Janis’ morose stepmother, Reina. When Kris can’t find the keys to his truck and Janis goes missing, he’s forced to confront his worst fears: he’s alone in the middle of the Texan wilderness and someone has played the first move in a very dark game.Warning. Contains violence. Do not approach this story if you are of a weak disposition.",
