  "description": "Immortal Descendants are disappearing one by one, and seventeen-year-old Clocker Saira Elian is next on the list…Saira and Archer’s London summer is carefree and romantic, until a brazen attempt to capture Saira looks suspiciously like the handiwork of the Descendants of War. When the kidnappings of other Descendants come to light and Mr. Shaw is taken for questioning under threat to his family, Saira realizes that for herself and young Shifter Connor, Time is the only refuge.But one danger is merely exchanged for another. Believing that their time-warping nemesis Bishop Wilder may have fled Elizabethan England for medieval France, Saira and her friends emerge onto the gloomy streets of Paris in 1429 to find it besieged by marauding wolves. When they encounter an illiterate peasant girl, whose deeds as Joan of Arc are extolled in an obscure sixteenth century book, but are unknown in their modern history, they realize the wolves may be the least of their problems. As Saira, Archer, and Ringo reunite to track down Wilder, they are faced with increasing evidence that time has been split and history altered. Crossing the time stream to repair it drops them in the heart of a battle, where friends are enemies, and foes are lethal. And in a fight for their lives, they encounter an old friend to whom Time as not been kind. To help him heal and end the deadly game of cat and mouse with Wilder once and for all, Saira must confront her greatest challenge yet: the truth about her changing Nature.",
