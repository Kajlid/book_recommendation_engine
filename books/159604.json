  "title": "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!",
  "description": "Here is a digest-size novelization of the hip, live-action hit movie of the Dr. Seuss classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas! , starring the one and only Jim Carrey as the Grinch.The movie script goes beyond the events of the stolen Christmas, all the way back to the beginning in Who-ville--where the Grinch grew up--and explains how and why he came to hate Christmas so much that, finally, one year, he had to stop it from coming. Told in the first-person voice of the Grinch himself, this is rib-ticklingly funny, irreverent, and ultimately touching. This is the movie--and the movie tie-in--of the holiday season.An eight-page full-color photo insert is included.",
