But when her world is thrown into a shredder by a past she rather leave… in the past, she finds comfort in the last person she expected to give a damn about her, because why would the sun even think about planets when he’s the center.Leon RomanoHe came to live with his best friend knowing little to nothing about the Sinclairs not because he didn’t care, but because he has his own problems to deal with. When the younger sister keeps popping up on his radar for multiple reasons, he’s given a rude wake-up call. Not every planet revolves around the sun. Especially one hell-bent on leaving the solar system.",
