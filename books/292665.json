  "description": "The mission is simple. Escort an emissary to an intergalactic peace summit. Try not to get in the way.  Lt. Magnus and his 79th Recon Team have certainly handled worse, after all.  But when an explosion rocks the tower and sends everyone into a panic, Magnus and his asset find themselves cut off from the rest of the team.  Worse still, a dying alien chieftain gives them a priceless drive of intel, marking them for death.  The mission has officially changed.  With enemies on all sides, Magnus must do everything in his power to protect the emissary and escape the tower. There is no back up. There is no chance for failure.  The fate of the entire galaxy now lies in the hands of a Republic Marine and a diplomat.  All they have to do is survive.  Experience the beginning of this sprawling galactic tale in this first entry to the Ruins of the Galaxy series. If you’re a fan of Star Wars, Galaxy’s Edge, or Battlestar Galactica, you’ll love this military scifi epic.",
