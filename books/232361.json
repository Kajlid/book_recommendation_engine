  "description": "Release Date: May 17thFate brought us together, but the sins of my past threaten to rip us apart. In a city ruled by corruption and powerful men, only the ruthless survive. And that’s just what I am. Like father, like son. The life I lead is riddled with black tie affairs and dark secrets. A simple mistake destroyed a woman I knew nothing about. She was only a name and a beautiful face in a photograph. Her picture-perfect life was shattered, but I didn’t give a damn. Or at least I thought I didn’t care, until she stumbled into me. One look and I was tempted. One taste and I was hooked. It wasn’t supposed to turn into this. She’s a good girl from the upper east side, innocent and naive. She’s ashamed to be moving on so quickly. Especially with a man like me. Someone who could tarnish her good girl reputation and make the crack in her picture perfect frame splinter even deeper. We both know this was supposed to be a one time thing. But I want more. Now she has me wrapped around her little finger, using me to get through her pain. I’m addicted to the soft moans and the way her nails scratch down my back. I’m starting to need her, as much as she needs me. I’ll protect her from the truth as long as I can. But even if she finds out, I’m not letting her leave me. She’s mine now.",
