  "description": "C.B. Murphy's compelling debut novel speaks cautiously with irony and humor to adults and adolescents about embracing black-and-white ideologies that can quickly spiral out of control. Cute Eats Cute (North Star Press, 237 pgs) follows the fragmenting family and the three Eco-Warrior high school friends of the book's 15-year-old narrator, Sam, who is forced to confront the ways and memes of the adult world in all of its many splintered shapes. Set in the BT Before Texting dawn of the 21st century, the novel's major conflict arises when a herd of deer is slated to be culled in a large city park, shifting various factions into hyper-drive as the entire community literally goes up in arms! Cute Eats Cute the title taken from a speech Sam's dad makes at his high school defending the urban deer hunt encapsulates how animals eat one another for survival and defense. And the food chain never sleeps. The satirical jabs at the men's movement, the deafening but impressionable rhetoric of the gun-toting Christian right group, The Hunters of Men, and the fragile friendship of Sam s school chums (who are each facing down their own personal issues against their blind ecology crusade) all conspire to make Murphy's novel a page-turning delight. But it's not without its carefully constructed messages",
