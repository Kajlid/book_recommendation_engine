  "description": "The Hero Training Program has always had high standards for admittance. Every registered metahuman in the country is measured, and only the most powerful can pass beyond the first step. They are researched, candidates profiled for the right psychological makeup. Of the thousands of people with abilities who reach the minimum age every year, only a hundred are accepted into the program. The strongest of the strong.Until this year.For seven decades, the villains known as The Five have wreaked havoc across the world. Men and women able to crush mountains and endure nuclear blasts have been unable to stop them. When a superhuman agent of the US government uncovers a trove of vital information about The Five and their weaknesses, a decision is made.As the director chooses his hundred students, seven exemptions are given. Seven people whose powers are nowhere near the usual level. They will have to work harder, be smarter, and protect each other to survive what comes. Weaker than their peers, their only option is to work together. To win against impossible odds, they have to become a team.",
