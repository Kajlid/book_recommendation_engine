  "description": "While she was still trembling with the complete unexpectedness of what Aeneas had just said and done, he leaned forward a little and kissed her on the mouth. Just one swift, soft touch of his lips on hers and then he turned and walked away. Love can be deadly. Especially when two girls fall for the same man - one a queen, the other her serving girl. Elissa knows she is playing with fire, but she can't resist. Queen Dido suspects nothing, until one fateful night ...Secrets are revealed, hearts are broken and as dawn breaks, a terrible tragedy unfolds. This is a passionate tale of love, betrayal and revenge.",
