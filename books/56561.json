  "description": "Miss Sarah Blount, better known as Sally, has come to Wolfe to plead for his help with her father's case. Matthew Blount is charged with poisoning a man to death at the Gambit Club, and all evidence points to his guilt. Sally knows that her father is innocent, but doesn't trust his lawyer, who seems too interested in her mother. Despite the lack of cooperation by Matthew Blount or the lawyer, Wolfe takes the case, trumping the police with a list of four suspects. But when one of those suspects turns up dead, Wolfe is forced to retrench, so unnerved that he forgoes a fabulous lunch and ignores his treasured orchids. Sally's increasing interest in Wolfe is only one of many trials he faces in this witty, cleverly plotted tale. Rex Stout's literary creation, Nero Wolfe, is one of the greatest fictional detectives of all time. And, as always, Archie's assistance as the perennial wise guy and legman complements Wolfe's devotion to orchids, gourmet meals, and his specially constructed brown leather chair. Together, Archie and Wolfe make an entertaining odd couple.",
