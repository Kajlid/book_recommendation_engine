  "description": "A single shot marks the beginning of an unforgettable summer.When twenty-one year old Blair Kennedy is shot in the leg by a rival gang, he lands in the care of Mount Sinai hospital and a med student who is arguably the least hospitable man he's ever met. Blair is all too happy when they part ways, but life seems determined for their paths to keep crossing.Wren is cold and sarcastic with a past wreathed in secrecy, the polarizing opposite to Blair's passionate loyalty and quick temper. They're incompatible in every sense of the word and yet Blair finds himself burning to know what hides behind the beautiful but frigid exterior of Wren Masters.All the while, Blair's arms-dealing gang Incindious, led by convicted arsonist Felix Bane, is at vicious war with the clandestine group known as Phantom.The one rule for survival?Trust no one.\nGunpowder is a medium heat, slow burn romance between gang member Blair Kennedy and aloof med student Wren Masters. Themes and tropes include grumpy/sunshine, opposites attract, telling each other to shut up as a love language, loss of virginity, emotional healing, and mild angst. This is the first book in a duology but has a HEA and can be read standalone.Detailed content warnings can be found inside but include explicit sexual content and graphic depictions of violence.",
