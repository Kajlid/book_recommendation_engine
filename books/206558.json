  "description": "Fresh out of the Army, alpha and all around stud Chad Brand is enjoying life as a private contractor for Tank Security. That is, until he decides to go out on the town and ends up getting hit on by his boss. Peter Tank is the ultimate alpha—bigger, stronger and more ruthless than anyone Chad has ever met—and Chad runs away with his tail between his legs before giving his intimidatingly dominant boss so much as a chance. He just doesn’t understand. Peter is an alpha. Why would he be hitting on Chad? And why does thinking back on the encounter make Chad’s stomach feel tight and hot and fluttery? Chad can’t really be interested in another alpha—can he?  Peter Tank is in trouble. The handsome young alpha he literally sent running for the hills is a fresh recruit, and Peter just received his performance review. It’s not good. Chad is not at all the ruthless, morally challenged kind of alpha Tank Security needs to get things done. He’s a genuinely good guy, and Peter has little use for those. But if Peter fires Chad now, it’s going to look an awful lot like retaliation for rejecting Peter’s advances. Peter has no choice but to keep Chad on, and he’s going to have to keep his paws to himself. If only the sexy young stud didn’t make it so hard...  (This 60,000 word novel contains the story of how Peter and Chad from the Evan’s Alphas series got together. It is not necessary to have read any of the Evan’s Alphas books to understand what is going on. The story has a HEA and no cliffhanger.)
