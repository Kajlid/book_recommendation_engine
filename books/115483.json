  "title": "The Law: And Other Essays on Manifestation",
  "description": "Can man decree a thing and have it come to pass? Most decidedly he can! Man has always decreed that which has appeared in his world and is today decreeing that which is appearing in his world and shall continue to do so as long as man is conscious of being man. Not one thing has ever appeared in man's world but what man decreed that it should. This you may deny, but try as you will you cannot disprove it, for this decreeing is based upon a changeless principle. You do not command things to appear by your words or loud affirmations. Such vain repetition is more often than not confirmation of the opposite. Decreeing is ever done in consciousness. That is? every man is conscious of being that which he has decreed himself to be. Collected her are six essays on the Law of Attraction: The Law, Be What You Wish; Be What You Believe, By Imagination We Become, The Law of Assumption, Truth, and At Your Command.",
