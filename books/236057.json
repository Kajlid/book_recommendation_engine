  "description": "Iceria, Ice, is a hawk-human shapeshiifter. It's Ice's job to protect the Northern Corridor from the hereditary enemy of the sirenhawks, the deadly she'ravens. Iceria's sisters consider her a little odd. She is a literal thinker, she loves shiny baubles and jewelry and her favorite book is an old English dictionary. In human form, Ice and all her kind are sirens of myth and legend. As the battle against the deadly she'ravens escalates, Ice discovers two things about herself. The first, she has a warrior's heart and the second, she's capable of falling in love in a very human way.",
