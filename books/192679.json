  "description": "The Gatekeeper and The Guardian, the first episode of the Star Gazer double trilogy, begins with the hero, Jack Barleycorn, being washed ashore on an imaginary island in the South Pacific. Set in the contemporary world of today, he discovers a branch of human kind long thought to be exstinct.  The islanders have a Stone Age culture, but use an extremely advanced technology, one that was left behind by an alien race called The Ancestors. Later, Jack discovers other branches of the human line also survive, although we know of these from myth and legend as Elves, Dwarves, and Ogres. A series of discoveries irrevocably alter his life, as this science fantasy, science fiction trilogy leads us to question both Darwinism and Catastrophe Theory, and offers an alternative explanation to our human evolution. As the extraordinary tale unwinds, we are led to question our most basic assumptions about humanity: who we are, where we came from, and perhaps more importantly, where we are headed.",
