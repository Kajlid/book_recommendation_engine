  "description": "Wanted. Dead or Alive. Cleaner-housekeeper-miracle worker for two housework-challenged super-busy guys. Three days a week. 9 to 5. Excellent pay for Mother Teresa. Even better for Keira Knightley. And in case we’re called sexist—better yet for Daniel Craig. When lovers Christian and Joel advertise for a cleaner, they aren’t expecting—or wanting—Mrs. Doubtfire, although one of the applicants could double as Mrs. D’s sister. But when little Susie Hood walks into their lives, scraped knees from a tumble with her bike and with the looks and heart of a broken angel, the attraction is instant and irrevocable and it’s all they can do not to lock her up and throw away the key. They want her in their bed, their lives, now…forever… She is everything they wanted, needed—but she has to want both of them. Together, separately, in any and every combination they can think of. As the sexual heat between them escalates, all three are forced to make decisions having far-reaching ramifications. Sometimes choosing love is the hardest decision of all.",
