Ounce I started reading did not want to put it down. You can tell the author is a romantic...being the author's first book I was really impressed, looking forward to the next installment.\"\"From the first you feel like you are getting to know Kamlyn Paige. The story-line is interesting and not the convoluted mess some authors seem to mistake for depth of plot. I definitely look forward to reading the whole book (as well as future books in the series).\"\"I'm not what you call an avid reader, I don't seem to take the time to spend leisurely reading but I felt compelled to sit and spend time reading this one...After the first chapter I was hooked as you get watching your favorite soap opera. And I would steal moments at work, waiting for a doctor, any place I could I was awakened I love reading! And hated to see when it was over I need to read the second book although I don't know if that's possible. I hope I find another book I like as much as this one!\"",
