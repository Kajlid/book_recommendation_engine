  "description": "When you've lived the reckless rock and roll lifestyle Rick Fars has it's no surprise to learn he's been there, done that, and in Rick's case he's most likely left his t-shirt behind on some woman's bedroom floor. As a wealthy playboy bachelor Rick's never been taken by any woman, but he's taken plenty and often. Outwardly Rick is living the dream, however, appearances can be deceptive and behind closed doors Rick's life is far more complex than most would realize. When the past and the present collide will Rick's future finally help him to know his own mind?  standalone: LGBT mmf mfm bi",
