  "description": "Welcome to a collection of dark and moody short fiction - twenty-five stories, from 200 words to nearly 2000, to entertain you in winter.There's no comedy. There's no romance. There's spooky goings-on, there's some nasty goings-on, and there's some very peculiar characters. And, I'm afraid, there's some death. Quite a lot of death, actually.I hope you enjoy them.",
