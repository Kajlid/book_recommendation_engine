  "description": "What I am about to tell you is absolutely true. Whether you believe me or not, is completely up to you. I have had a remarkable experience and only wish to share it with you just in case a similar experience happens to you someday, which is very well possible. So sit back, relax, and get ready for a tale unlike any other you have heard. And most important, listen to your mind, it will explain this tale better than I ever could. For the mind holds the key to the story. Without your mindâ€™s ears, this story will never make sense. I invite you to the Life of Death, because Death truly does have life and walks with and lives through us every day.",
