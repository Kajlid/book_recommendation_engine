  "description": "Tank was a bit of a wild card after losing his infant son. Finding family in the Wild Kings, he’s content to live and breathe the club. Until Maddie. Maddie has never known love in her life. Going from an abusive childhood home to the arms of a selfish, narcissistic man, she tries to get through the best way she can, taking care of her little girl, Zoey. After a nasty run-in with her boyfriend, she makes her way to the Wild Kings clubhouse, where she’s taken in and where Tank sees her for the first time. When her ex kidnaps her, three clubs come together in an effort to get her back. Tank funnels his rage in underground fights, going to the ring with his brothers and working out. She’s his sweetness. She’s his peace. He failed her. He’s her future. He is her calm in the storm. She’s afraid to trust. This is Tank and Maddie’s story. Warning: This story is intended for 18 and over due to graphic situations in the book.",
