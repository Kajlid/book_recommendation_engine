  "description": "Coventry, Texas bills itself as the \"tiny town with the big heart.\" Amid its picturesque storefronts and open-minded locals, one woman in search of a temporary hideaway might find much more than she hoped for...Jandy Taylor's grandfather always teased her about not being able to finish anything. So perhaps it's not a shock that a few days before her wedding to soap star Hudson Blake, Jandy postpones the ceremony and hitches a ride to Coventry, Texas, with a stranger named Sam, a dog named Sue, and an overwhelming desire to escapeif only for a few days...Coventry is in the middle of its famed annual Godiva Festival, making it the perfect place for Jandy to be carefree and invisible. That is until the press dubs her a \"runaway bride.\" Now, with an eager groom, her PR-hungry mother, and a swarm of paparazzi on her trail, Jandy has to figure out if it's possible that a town, a life, and a man she hardly knows could suddenly feel an awful lot like home...Praise for Becky Cochrane and A Coventry Christmas\"This novel is written with warmth and lots of cute, fun dialogue.\"Romantic Times",
