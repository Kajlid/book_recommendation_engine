  "description": "“I wanted to go to Nowhere, wherever it didn’t exist. I wanted to cease to have to exist and let the rest of the world deal with what I’d unleashed upon it.”It was simply meant to be a joke. Tom only wanted the world to believe that vampires were real for a day or two, and then come clean. But when real vampires surface and begin to annihilate the human race, Tom can never reveal the truth. Thrust into a new world where danger is under every rock and death looks unbelievably human, Tom, armed with only his father and the smallest group of distant friends, must learn the tools of survival—whether it’s fight or flight—and come to terms with the realization that, sometimes, it’s all your fault.",
