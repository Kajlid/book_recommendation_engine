  "title": "Don't Bang the Barista!",
  "description": "Drawing on the classics of lesbian pulp fiction, Don't Bang the Barista! is set in the hipster-dyke triangle of East Vancouver, where friends Kate and Cass discuss the politics of hooking up with a hot barista crush. Is Cass warning Kate off over concern for her favourite coffee shop hangout, or does she have ulterior motives for keeping Hanna and Kate apart? What if Hanna actually has her sights set on someone else... someone already in a seemingly monogamous and hetero relationship? Navigating life in the queer East Van community certainly isn't simple for Kate and her trusty canine, Jupiter, especially when Kate's ex gets back into town looking more fabulous than ever. Can Kate finally figure out who she wants to be with before it's too late?**Contains scenes of a (consensual) sexual nature.**",
