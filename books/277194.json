  "description": "What’s a person to do when they discover everything they’ve believed is nothing but lies?  I grew up wealthy, a spoiled rich kid some would say, blessed with a natural athletic physique and erotic good looks that could get me into the panties of just about any girl I set my mind to.  I wanted … what I wanted.  And that meant one thing: the beautiful brunette from study hall—but she left me high and dry. Today, I have a heart made of stone. I’m angry, a professed lifelong bachelor and a sexual sadist.  My soul is a cold river.  Eight years later, she’s back in my life and holding secrets that are ruthless, unforgiveable.  I want to punish her, make her cry, make her suffer. I want to hate her for what she’s done.  But I want my hands on her.  Mine. All mine.  I simply want … Ava Montgomery.",
