  "title": "The Medieval Christmas",
  "description": "Medieval Christmas - roaring fires, Yule logs, boar's head on a platter and carols. So many of our best-loved Christmas traditions have their origins in the medieval period that it would be impossible to imagine the Christmas season without holly and ivy in some form, carol singers calling from door to door and a general sense of celebration in the face of winter's harshest moments. Sophie Jackson investigates the roots of the Christmas feast in this beautifully illustrated book, which also offers guidance on how to recreate elements of the medieval Christmas in your own home, with tips on decorations, instructions for playing medieval games and recipes for seasonal dishes. She unearths some fascinating information on some of our most cherished customs as well as some which have fallen by the wayside. (Modern children will be relieved that the medieval custom of administering a ritual beating to children on 28 December, the feast of the Holy Innocents, has now given way to more child-friendly practices.) The book recreates the medieval Christmas, showing how all classes of society celebrated the feast in their own way and in doing so evolved a tradition that still delights us.",
