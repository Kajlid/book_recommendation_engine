  "description": "Trudance Darling is a Sparkler. She didn’t choose to be almost electrocuted, inherit otherworldly powers, and fall for the hottest millionaire bachelor in St. Louis--but that’s exactly what happened. Her new abilities to see true love spark in the eyes of strangers, to watch it flicker with excitement, fuse with its perfect match or witness it burn out from despair, is a wonderful curse that drains her emotionally and physically.  Tru struggles with her new abilities, but she can’t afford to be weak while she’s hunting down soul mates, saving others faith in love and contemplating if her new mysterious boyfriend is her guardian angel or angel of death. Tru must choose between a “normal” life without love or her birthright that comes with great passion, danger and responsibility.  Who knew being a 21st century cupid could be so deadly?",
