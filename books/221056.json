  "description": "For twenty-two-year-old Gina lying is just the price of keeping the peace. Sure, secrets are hard to keep from a close-knit family and her therapist is certain they’re materializing in the form of her irrational fear of coffins and night terrors. Lying doesn’t come easy for her, but it’s better to have a quiet life than to be thrown into the rumor mill of her small hometown. Everything changes when she meets the glossy-lipped Gizmo at her uncle’s funeral. From the moment Gizmo first asks her for a light Gina’s life is turned upside down. She’s drawn to the mysterious girl who seemingly bends time and space to suit her needs, but won’t disclose her real name. Gizmo breathes a sense of reckless freedom into Gina, but at what cost? It’s not long before Gina discovers Gizmo has secrets of her own and if she’s not careful they may just be the death of her. 18+ for sexual content and mature language.",
