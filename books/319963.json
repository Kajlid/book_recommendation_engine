And our houses have a rivalry that’s written into legend.BaileyAt Rho Kappa Tau, I’m a legacy.

Our houses have always had a rivalry, but some of the guys seem to hate Chad specifically, and I don’t know why.He’s surprisingly sweet and kind. At least to me.I need to stay away. A relationship with Chad would be betraying the very legacy that brought me here.But I can’t help myself. And it seems, neither can he.",
