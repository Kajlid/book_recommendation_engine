If I don’t marry him, I’ll be forced to give up my children.I’ll do whatever it takes for the twins, only I’m not the innocent girl I once was, and there’s no way I’m giving him a second chance.But when someone dangerous from my past comes looking for me, I start to see a new side to Aaron that makes me question what’s beneath his need for control.Now the man I vowed never to trust may be the only person who can protect me . . .Aaron’s Patience is book 1 in the Townsends of Williamsport series but is a standalone.
