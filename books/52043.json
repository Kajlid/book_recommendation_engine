  "description": "Dead Until Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse can read minds, which makes people...uncomfortable. Then along comes Bill-and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. That's because Bill is a vampire who runs with other undead. So when one of her coworkers is killed, Sookie fears she's next.... Living Dead in First, Sookie finds a body in her car. Then a beastly creature gives her a poisonous lashing. Luckily, the vampires save her life. That means she can't refuse when one of them asks her to travel to Dallas and use her telepathic abilities to find a missing bloodsucker. Club Sookie's undead boyfriend, Bill, is on a secret assignment and only his sinister and sexy boss Eric knows where to find him. Resigned, Sookie heads for Jackson, Mississippi, to mingle with the Ã¼ber-underworld at Club Dead. When she finally finds Bill-in an act of serious betrayal-she's not sure whether to save him...or sharpen some stakes.",
