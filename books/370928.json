Rja-Yoga also includes Swami Vivekananda's translation and commentary of the \"Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali.\" Raja-Yoga, along with Swami Vivekananda's Karma-Yoga, Bhakti-Yoga, and Jnna-Yoga, are considered classics and outstanding treatises on Hindu philosophy. The Swami's deep spiritual insight, fervid eloquence, and broad human sympathy shine forth in these works and offer inspiration to all spiritual seekers.",
