  "description": "Witches are dropping dead and their familiars are going missing. Rory Wiltz's familiar asks her to look into the matter but it's not long before the Witches' Council sends a letter of their own. Lucretia Crane, head of the Witches' Council, wants Rory and her familiar to come to her estate somewhere in New England. And she's not asking, she's demanding it.   While Rory and Hunter and their familiars travel to New England to deal with the Witches' Council, Scott, Jess, and Luke decide to go on a mission of their own to solve the murders themselves. Witch politics are in full swing at the estate, and it doesn't help that the killer might just be one of their own. Will Rory and Hunter get out of the estate unscathed, or will they lose something irreplaceable? And will their friends come to the rescue in time?",
