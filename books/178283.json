  "description": "Thomas Horton is a good cop.Focused and unyielding, he has one of the highest solved-case rates in Los Angeles, a city with the highest unsolved murder rate in the whole of the United States.Despite his record, his resolve is questioned by the appearance of a young man named Xander Drew: a man equally as focused and determined, but who refuses to operate within the confines of the rigid California legal system. When the egos and obsessions of both men collide, Horton enters a violent and dangerous world he didnâ€™t know existed beneath the veneer of order and structure that he has based his entire deductive method around, forcing both men to question everything they knew...... until they are both threatened to be dragged down to a place where everything burns, until all that are left, are Cinders.",
