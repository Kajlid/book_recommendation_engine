  "description": "Agent Jasmine Len was more than just the assistant to the deputy director, she was his right hand woman. No one knew more about the new division of the FBI she and the director were creating.  That knowledge made her more than just an assistant--it made her the next targetâ€¦and only one man can protect her now.  Agent Dakon Royal was fiercely loyal to the deputy director, and he'd do anything to keep the director--and the director's beautiful, intriguing, and maddening personal assistant--safe from the traitor in the division's midst.",
