  "description": "When a rising starlet from Spanish Harlem dies from a gunshot wound in the fashionable downtown penthouse of an eccentric and famous Broadway producer, New York District Attorney Roger \"Butch\" Karp and his hard-charging, crime-fighting wife, Marlene Ciampi, smell drama. Karp is outraged at claims by the producer and his high-powered attorney that the \"troubled\" actress committed suicide. With the help of a fearful witness who Marlene convinces to speak out, Karp wages a relentless battle for justice against a notorious defendant, a legion of experts, and a barrage of hostile threats. Meanwhile, a shadowy international power group called the Sons of Man kidnaps Karp's daughter, Lucy, as she attempts to thwart the latest terrorist threat against New York City. Karp races to decode a baffling series of riddles left behind by the group's mastermind, his longtime enemy, to uncover the terrorists' true target and save Lucy from certain death. The key may lie within the fevered mind of David Grale, a half-mad religious vigilante who has mysteriously retreated beneath the city. Hunted by a beautiful but deadly Russian assassin, Karp and his eclectic band of accomplices must infiltrate the Sons of Man before the group's scheme for world dominion succeeds. But, little does Karp the clock is ticking down on New York City as an invisible force prepares to unleash Armageddon. With more than twelve million copies of his books in print, Robert K. Tanenbaum is a true \"master of the legal thriller\" (Vincent Bugliosi) whose yanked-from-the-headlines adventures keep readers rapt until each breathtaking conclusion.",
