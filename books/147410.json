  "description": "From Book 1: Everyone has secrets. No one has secrets like Watts.  Catherine Kolb has found the perfect diversion from her life of nearly complete seclusion: a virtually anonymous correspondence with a man she knows only as “Watts.”  Intelligent, mysterious, and with an insatiable appetite for sex, he begins to draw Catherine out of her closely guarded world, tempting her with his words—some explicit, some simply enticing…  “You should indulge your curiosities, especially the forbidden ones.”  Watts insists on privacy. He has no choice. In the wrong hands, his secrets could get people killed. Including Catherine.  Common sense says they should never meet, but curiosity and lust prove stronger than reason and caution. A planned one-time encounter sets into motion a series of events that bring Catherine and Watts to the edge of ecstasy and the brink of peril.  Two very private people. One risky night. A shot at love and redemption.   Due to mature themes, this book is recommended for readers 18+.",
