  "description": "Hunter had always wanted his life to be something more than mundane ever since he was a child, but after meeting Ace, a guy who could shift from man into dragon, things changed far more than he bargained for.When he said more than mundane, he meant finding a guy to love and maybe buying a house; he hadn't signed up for magic and demons and time travel.Now that his eyes were opened to a new world, he wasn't sure who he was anymore. Was he just an ordinary person who happened to attract horribly bad luck, or was there something more sinister behind everything that had happened in his life?Either way, he never expected to learn how to swing a sword and he certainly never thought he would be worthy enough to fall in love.Obviously, destiny had other plans for him.",
