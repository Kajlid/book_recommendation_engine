  "title": "Ed Reardon's Week",
  "description": "This hilarious fictional diary tracks the world of Ed Reardon and his flawed attempts to escape poverty and gain the literary success that is surely his due. A writer and liver of life at the cutting edge, Ed resides in a one-bedroom flat over a hairdresser's in Berkhamsted, where he has lived on his own since his family left him. His first, and only, published novel was bought by Hollywood and turned into a movieÂ in the mid-70's. Though stuck in a career rut with a growing pile of rejection slips, Ed remains stubbornly optimistic. He may only own one pair of pants and a seven-figure Amazon sales ranking, but no writer knows more about stealing his agent's stationery than Ed.",
