  "description": "Lucy Reid has always prided herself on her self-control, and her ability to keep her emotions and desires in check. The arrival of her new boss, Jason Young, has her co-workers competing to see who can bed him first. Lucy refuses to admit her own attraction to him, and his rude behavior towards her only strengthens her resolve to ignore her growing attraction. When a power outage traps her in the elevator with her sexy new boss, she soon realizes his coldness hides his own dark desire for her. Jason Young is determined to show her just how good it can feel to lose control, and Lucy is aching to give in to the sweet temptation.Author's Note: Although Tempted was originally a stand-alone story, reader's enthusiasm inspired me to write a second part to Jason and Lucy's story. Twice Tempted gives readers a look into what happens with Jason and Lucy after that crazy first week.",
