  "title": "Murder in Pueblo del Mar",
  "description": "An Arizona wife and mother is murdered while on holiday in Mexico. Bailey Crane is an auxiliary cop with the Phoenix PD and is obliquely involved in the case until he visits close friends in Pueblo del Mar. The local police chief seeks Bailey's help in this most unusual caper about a philandering husband and a transvestite lover. There is of course the ever-loving musings of our southern Sherlock, an encounter with a mysterious mystic seer of 'Time and Place, ' and just about all the emotions in the human heart and soul. Bailey gets banged around and challenged at the highest level of his endurance. When family and friends are caught in the ugly web of corruption, drugs, and sex, our hero's Cherokee blood hits the boiling point. The brutally devastating climax comes in a 'Whale Shack' on the scrub brush and sand near the Sea of Cortez. This tale was inspired by an actual murder some years ago, and it's one you won't want to miss",
