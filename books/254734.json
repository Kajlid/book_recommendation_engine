  "description": "No good deed goes unpunished.  I learned that lesson the hard way when I agreed to helping my friend Justin with a favor.  My platonic friend Justin.  A favor that helped him with his reputation but turned mine into the trending topic at my school. In a matter of days I go from quiet, nobody to school slut.  The problem with that? I’m still a virgin.  The whispers, the stares and the constant gossip could bring me down but I’m tired of hiding in the dark, covering up my anxiety and being alone. I decide to take on the bullies and find a few surprising allies along the way; the Allendale Four.  Oliver, Anderson, Jackson and Hayden make up this tight-knit circle of friends and they make it their mission to protect my reputation, my heart and my soul.  For the first time I’m not alone and I’m not afraid, but will the closed-minded town of Allendale accept our relationship?  A Piece of Heaven is a contemporary young adult reverse harem novel.",
