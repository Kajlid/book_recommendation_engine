MadHatter: That’s dangerous.  Violet After sacrificing years of my life on a cheating husband, I’d had enough. I set out to quench a thirst I had ignored for years. I gave myself one year to explore my sexuality—to delve into my deepest, darkest desires. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, I would have my sexual revolution. I would have my…awakening. Diving into the world of both pleasure and pain, I was sure with Rhys I had found what I’d been missing…until he took it away. _________  Rhys I was on my way out of the life when she came barging in with her new appetite and unrealistic expectations of what a Dom should be. All I had left to do to break free was sell the club and walk away. Now I found I had something to walk toward. And for the first time in my life, I hoped I’d be enough for a woman. Caring for a woman was easy for me. I had always cared for different women for different reasons. Loving a woman had always been quite a bit harder.  Doms don’t have to say I love you.   ****FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY.
