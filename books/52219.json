  "title": "A Dictionary of Fairies: Hobgoblins, Brownies, Bogies And Other Supernatural Creatures",
  "description": "A magnificently researched, illustrated directory of the fairies of the British Isles. There are entries on assipattles and mumpokers, on fairy dress, on fairy crafts and food, and, most useful this, on spells to obtain power over these fiendish Little People. It is so entertaining that I would rather recommend it as a bedside companion than as a serious technical reference book - Selina Hastings in the Daily TelegraphKatherine Briggs is the magic mirror on the wall. Ask her what you will; but have a care of this wonderful book. Dip in for two minutes and you'll be gone for half an hour. - Richard AdamsI am certain Oberon would have revelled in this convocation of his subjects - Peter OpieA reader faced with this reference book of mythology and folklore can only stand spellbound by the lightly laid learning of its author - The Times Educational SupplementCover Illustration: Tony Meeuwissen",
