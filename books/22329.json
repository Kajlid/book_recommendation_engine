  "description": "Jake Marlowe is the unhappiest 200-year-old werewolf you are ever likely to meet. In fact, Jake is reported to be the world's last surviving werewolf and while he is musing about suicide, others are hunting him down. A rabid anti-occult group has vowed to annihilate him for sport and a group of vampires want to keep him alive for equally selfish reasons: Apparently, a werewolf bite can serve as a sort of sun-block to guard the undead from deadly exposure. As Jake fights to be the captain of his own fate, he gets welcome news: He might not be the only living werewolf after all. An unconventional slant on an archetypal story.",
