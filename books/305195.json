  "description": "Imagine stumbling upon a parallel universe in which every person on Earth has a second self – another part of themselves preventing them from truly being whole – everyone, that is, except you. For 22-year-old Mara Martin, discovering there is a world where her deceased father is still alive and the love of her life wants nothing to do with her is a lot to take in. Her own life was finally falling into place, and now she must wrap her head around the alternate lives of everyone she knows. Throw in the fact that she is part of an elite group of people who are designated to save the Earth from eventual destruction, and she just might start losing her mind – but not without learning a thing or two about love along the way.",
