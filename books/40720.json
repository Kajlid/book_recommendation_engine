  "description": "Deeper Than the Dead introduced Tami Hoag's millions of fans to Oak Knoll, a small California town that, in the mid-eighties, seemed idyllic until the See-No-Evil killer shattered that notion. It took FBI agent Vince Leone and a new technique called \"profiling\" to put an end to the trauma. Secrets to the Grave brought Leone's teacher-turned-child- advocate wife, Anne, into a central role. Together with Vince and local sheriff 's deputy Tony Mendez, she solved the Oak Knoll murder with a particularly challenging mystery. Now, through Leone's pioneering science-based investigative skills, Hoag explores the early days of forensic police work. And through the chilling case at the heart of Down the Darkest Road, she hooks ever more readers into the meticulously crafted, all-too-terrifying world of Oak Knoll, where the scariest secrets lurk in the most unexpected places.",
