  "description": "When Andy, the Pride Enforcer, sends out a call for new Lieutenants, he doesn't expect so many young lions to respond. Especially not Damian and Chad who've spent their whole lives competing against one other. They both yearn to be the best at everything, and while they have different reasons for wanting to be a Lieutenant, they will stop at nothing to get this dream status. Damian and Chad are shocked when the Enforcer puts them on the same team. They have to live together, train together, and the more time they spend together the less they can ignore what they've both been fighting for over the past few their lions are attracted to each other. They keep pushing them together, sexual tension running higher than ever. What do you do when you feel yourself falling in love for your mortal enemy? Do you run? Do you lie down and accept the inevitable? Or do you fight it as best you can? If you're Damian and Chad...you do all three.",
