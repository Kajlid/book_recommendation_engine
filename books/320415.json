They have no business falling in love.When a homeless disguise expert with an unwholesome knack for picking locks appears on Maxwell Holt’s doorstep, he worries she might steal a painting, not his heart. Her unusual skill set could help him eradicate a powerful enemy and prevent war, but the secrets she keeps could be deadly.Desperate for information, Pixie takes a job with a man almost as dangerous as the one hunting her. Knowing when to walk away has kept her alive for years, but if she stays, she might end a string of assassinations and bring peace to two countries. Her reluctance to leave could have nothing to do with her stern and distrustful employer or his fascinating smile.Disguised is a sweet romance with fantasy elements for fans of Jane Eyre and happily ever afters.",
