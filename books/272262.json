  "title": "The Island Dead",
  "description": "With over 99% of the world’s population dead and walking, the scattered remnants attempt to rebuild civilization. Survivors in Southern Louisiana discover that they’re surrounded by castles. The Gothic churches up and down the bayous become shelters against the walking dead. A father and what remains of his family fortify their small town. Nearly surrounded by rivers, the town is a natural stronghold until the Mississippi River starts belching up swarms of the dead. Will the ragtag group survive zombie swarms, doomsday cults, and what emerges from the swamps and the river depths? Is it possible that the Cajuns will not only survive, but thrive in the world of THE ISLAND DEAD?",
