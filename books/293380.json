  "title": "Unbroken",
  "description": "Unbroken is a reflection of moments-moments of strength and moments of need that are universal of the human condition. Largely autobiographical, this poetry collection shines a light in the dark places. Featuring themes of love and loss, family and self, nature and struggle, there is something for all readers within these pages.Through her verses, Tanya has set out to show that we, as people, are not alone in our struggles. Tanya has chosen to embrace hardship in this collection, so that she might help others to replace the cycle of fear with one of pride rooted in survival. Unbroken is a demonstration of a life well-lived and all that that encompasses-joy, heartache, and unanswered questions.",
