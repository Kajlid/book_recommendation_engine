  "description": "Jada and her family have joined her father on a business trip to Italy. When an ancient scepter is stolen from a museum right in front of her eyes, Jada becomes more than a witness. Aided by clues in verse, a puzzle, Snapchat photos and WhatsApp messages from an anonymous amica, Jada and her new friend, Carlo, search for the scepter in and around Rome. Along the way, they must fend off attacks of a Roma girl, a Bulgarian henchman and others intent on doing whatever it takes to stop them from finding it. Can Jada recover the scepter and uncover the thief before it's time to leave Rome? Join Jada on an adventure that takes her to underground catacombs, jet skiing on the Mediterranean Sea, scuba diving in a volcanic lake and to Rome's famous monuments as she solves a mystery and saves her father's business deal in the process.",
