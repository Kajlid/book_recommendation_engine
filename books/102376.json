  "description": "\"Please Lord don't let him find me, Please Lord don't let him find me\" I cried out this prayer in desperation for some kind of help, someone to rescue me from my childhood of fear and abuse but nobody came. I sought safety when and where I could find it - in the cornfield, under the bed, behind the couch or in the forest, rocking back and forth, tears blurring my vision. I was petrified, terrified, alone and helpless to stop the physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse my father inflicted day in and day out.If you’ve suffered in silence at the hands of a guardian, parent, family member, “friend” or colleague, this book is for you. If you’ve experienced physical, emotional or mental abuse, rape and/or sexual molestation, this is your story, as much as it is mine. Walk with me. Together, we will find our way.My greatest of all hope is that these stories and my life help other survivors find hope, healing and comfort in knowing they are not alone! This book is for all those who have and continue to suffer in silence.“Out of Suffering have emerged the Strongest Souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.” –Kahlil Gibran",
