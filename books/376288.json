She knows it's for sale - there's an estate agent's board in the front garden.Soon Connie is clicking on the 'Virtual Tour' button, keen to see the inside of the house and put her mind at rest once and for all. She finds herself looking at a scene from a nightmare: in the living room, in the middle of the carpet, lies a woman face down in a pool of blood. In shock, Connie wakes her husband Kit. But when Kit sits down at the computer, he sees no dead body, only a pristine beige carpet in a perfectly ordinary room...(In the USA, the title of this book is \"The Other Woman's House\")",
