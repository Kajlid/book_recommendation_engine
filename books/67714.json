  "description": "The people around me are terrified of opening their eyes, they keep them to the ground and whisper prayers beneath their breath. Hawthorne Manor was meant to be my salvation, a way to heal and reintroduce me to society. The countryside was my minds playground, until a darkness began to reveal itself within the walls of the mansion. Forbidden to ask questions, I watch as my charge, a seven year old boy hides from a fear he won't voice. The servants ignore the disappearances happening at Hawthorne. The child I have promised to protect won't talk to me, which leaves me. I'm desperate to find the answers to the haunting of Hawthorne Manor before I disappear too. I learn that a story from the past may be the key to the truth of the horrors around me. How will I stop an evil that is focused on consuming the one child, I have come to love?Worry, panic, chaos... The walls have control and their sole purpose is to trap me; to enslave me in delusions of nightmares that don't exist; couldn't exist. I can't focus, weighted down by a broken mind that has singled out each terror and worry, to build walls that are inescapable. It's not real. I'm crazy. Insomnia and depression have created hallucinations that make holding on to the living impossible. Each day, I grow closer to the abomination, the paranoia, the past that refuses to release me. I came here to find peace, to learn to live again, and now I am faced with a fate far worse than I imagined. My nightmares are no longer roaming my mind; they are directly in front of me.",
