  "description": "LGBT Multicultural ParanormalGregorio \"Ori\" Reyes thought there was nothing left for him in Hawaii. A former Army Ranger and promising MMA fighter, his dishonorable discharge turned him into the family disgrace, and his childhood best friend Kalani never could love him back--not the way Ori needed to be loved--even before Kalani's doctors declared him to be in an unrecoverable coma. Ori's return to Hawaii seems fated to be a depressing reminder of every chance he never took... until Kalani himself impossibly welcomes him home.Kalani's body is bedridden, but his spirit is free to roam, and it turns out it's not just Ori who had unspoken yearnings. Kalani is eager to prove that he can still savor all the pleasures of this world. Together, they remember all those years of surfing, wrestling, touching and aching but too afraid to act; now, they cross that final barrier and struggle against each other in an entirely different way.Passionately but tenuously reunited, the pair must solve the mystery of Kalani's unlucky life, sorting through dark family history and even journeying to the Hawaiian ghostworld. And the greatest terror of their journey is that Ori might have to put Kalani to rest.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language and male/male sex. Includes a flashback of m/m/f menage.",
