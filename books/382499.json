  "title": "Wayward Girls and Wicked Women",
  "description": "This marvelous collection of stories about bad girls, wicked women and unsatisfactory wives is designed to promote the female virtues of discontent, sexual disruptiveness and bad manners, and to give a positive role to women who will not put up with the status quo, and to hell with the consequences. Widely ranging in time and place, these subversive tales -- by Grace Paley, Bessie Head, Katherine Mansfield, Elizabeth Jolley, Djuna Barnes, Colette, Angela Carter, Jamaica Kincaid, Ama Ata Aidoo, Jane Bowles and many more -- all have one thing in common: to restore adventuresses and revolutionaries to the rightful position as models for all women, everywhere. Leonora Carrington's debutante swaps places with a hyena who exchanges the cage for the ball -- and goes dressed to kill. Christina Stead's seedy seducer is eventually wrecked by the utterly conventional bride. Some of these stories celebrate toughness and resilience, some of them low cunning: all of them are about not being nice.",
