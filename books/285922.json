  "title": "\"The Little Tree That Changed Everything\"",
  "description": "This is a heartwarming story for people of all ages to read about never giving up, always trying your hardest no matter what, and most importantly ALWAYS believing in yourself!  Henry is a little boy born with a crooked leg. His parents cannot afford to have his leg fixed, but Henry never lets that discourage him. He always tries his hardest. One Christmas, he finds a misshapen little Christmas tree that has been \"in the shadows\" of all the other \"regular\" trees. It has never gotten the sunshine, fertilizer, or love that Henry knows it needs. He convinces his father that this little tree has a \"fierce heart\" and wants to be all that it can be (just like Henry does). Henry believes in the little tree's destiny. The tree farm owner gives them the little tree because it is so scraggly and they take it home so Henry can make that little tree's desiny a reality. Henry nurtures the tree and even gets his beloved Ruthie and his best friend Bruce involved. Henry's devotion and love for the little tree, and the tree's response to Henry's love and care impacts the life of everyone, even including the President of the United States.. This is a story of love, faith, strength and loyalty that weaves its way through the lives of Henry, his beloved wife Ruthie, their children Amanda and Adam, and their grandchildren. It's a story that reminds us that faith and love always triumph over obstacles and tragedies if we will just believe!",
