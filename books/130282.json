  "title": "Escaping Barcelona",
  "description": "Having left behind his childhood town full of dead-end jobs and bleak prospects for a future, Rudy, a nineteen-year old runaway, arrives in Barcelona.Two days later, he finds himself outside a subway station half-naked and robbed of all his possessions.Trapped in a city whose language he doesn't speak, without a passport or anyone to turn to, Rudy is plunged into a world of hunger and homelessness. Yet, fighting off the ravages of slow starvation proves far easier than the struggle to maintain his own decency and humanity when he is forced to befriend a hostile thug who holds the only key to Rudy's escape.Unconditionally realistic, Mad Days of Me: Escaping Barcelona explores the conflicted ideology of youth and society's indifference to suffering in a harrowing tale of survival. This is a story of perseverance. A story of anguish, dignity, madness, and redemption.",
