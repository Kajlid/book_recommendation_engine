  "description": "CoyoteWild and free, that’s me. The only ones I give a damn about are part of the club. Nothing else matters. It hasn’t in years. They call me Coyote because just like the animal, I prefer the dark to the light. My Prez sent me out on a fool's errand and I walked in her path. She's the kinda woman who causes a man to drop to his knees, to break all his bad habits and tame the animal within him. I wasn't prepared to have anything with her, but I was willing to allow myself one night of sadistic pleasure. I never thought I'd see her again. I figured I was out scot free. It's too bad I wasn't. My sinful woman has a bucket full of danger alongside her, and she comes to me for help. The question is, will I claim this decadent woman as mine, or do I push her away to deal with the mess she created?",
