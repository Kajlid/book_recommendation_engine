Mike Mason is a rapacious land developer in the coastal town of Woodrose, California. Hostility begins when Mason buys out a home belonging to former boxer, Ty Brennan, forcing the eviction of his family. The animosity between the two of them grows further when Ty's son and Mike's daughter fall in love, complicating matters. A gambling ship off shore, a dangerous and covert operation that carries a heavy consequence, and a devastating cyclone all come together one fateful summer and nothing would ever be the same.",
