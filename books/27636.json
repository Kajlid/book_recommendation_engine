  "description": "A terrorist hit is coming. CIA, FBI, and Department of Defense systems have spiked, but traditional intel is going nowhere. It falls to the Taskforce--a top secret team that exists outside the bounds of U.S. law and is charged with finding and destroying asymmetric threats--to stop the unknown conspirators... A shadowy trail leads the Taskforce to Egypt--where an attack leaves one Taskforce member dead and another barely alive. Veteran warrior Pike Logan and his young partner, Jennifer Cahill, are forced to helm the increasingly convoluted and dangerous mission: a mission that tests both Jennifer's ability to justify her actions, and Pike's tenuous ability to stay in control. Sifting their way through the opposing plots of two terrorist organizations will turn out to be the least of their problems when a weapon of unthinkable power touches American soil--the only country in which Taskforce members are forbidden to operate, and the only country that Pike Logan may be unable to save...",
