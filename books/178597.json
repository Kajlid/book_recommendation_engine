He is left to wait, living only on the hope that Rachel will leave the man who stands between them. No matter how deeply in love Rachel is with movie star Daniel Hunter, the scared marriage vows she exchanged with Victor force her back to her husband. Torn away from the closeness of adjoining rooms and coffee by the fire, her time with Daniel is now fleeting. However, with the man she loves, Rachel begins to test the limits of her cage, while keeping a secret that could change everything.",
