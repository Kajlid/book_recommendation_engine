  "description": "“The need is real,” Geraden said. “And it’s urgent, my lady. Somewhere in the realm there are renegade Imagers, Masters of mirrors, and they’re opening their glasses more and more to every kind of horror and foulness.“I don’t have any power to compel you. If I did, it would be wrong to use it. And you aren’t the Champion the Congery expects. But I might be right. You understand mirrors. You might be the help we need.“Please. Will you come with me?”Terisa Morgan had no idea what to make of all of this. She had been preparing to spend another evening alone in her apartment when, without warning, he appeared in the mirror. Not as a reflection—he was in the mirror. At once, the glass shattered soundlessly, and then a young man calling himself Geraden lay on the floor of her living room. To her astonishment, he began babbling a story about “Mordant’s need”—a strange kingdom in dire trouble. He wanted her to return with him to save his world from destruction.She didn’t understand what he was talking about. She was only a mission secretary—not the sort of woman who saved worlds. Yet his eyes were so full of light and laughter, appeals and promises, that she accepted his invitation…and thereby changed her life forever.The Mirror of Her Dreams is the story of Terisa and Geraden in the strange land called Mordant. It is a rich and finely textured novel of love and lust, power and court politics, in a place where nothing is ever what it seems…and reality intertwines with powerfully seductive illusion.",
