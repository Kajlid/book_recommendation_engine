Is her grief making her see things that aren't there, or is her intuition right, and there's something more sinister to her friend's death than the ME thinks? Harbouring an innate distrust of the police, Cassie sets out to investigate and deliver justice to the woman who saved her life.For fans of Elly Griffiths' Ruth Galloway series and Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan, Cassie Raven is the edgy new forensic sleuth on the block.",
