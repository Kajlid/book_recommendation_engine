  "description": "Always ride faster than your angel can fly.-Gabriel Wolfe\nAs president of the Hounds of Hell motorcycle club, my life has been infused with darkness and trauma since the day I was born. Chaos is my birthright. I crave it to feel stable. Secure. Whole.The only people I care about are the ones who don my cut. Women are just a tool. Never to covet, only to use, each face blending into the next.The formula I live by is simple.Death is always at my door. I am a soldier of bedlam.Until a little hummingbird flies into my crosshairs, and I’m forced to feel something I haven’t felt for as long as I can remember…alive.Let the hunt begin.",
