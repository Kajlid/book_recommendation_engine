  "description": "\"This book presents the powerful basics of the original Teachings of Abraham. Within these pages, you'll learn how all things, wanted and unwanted, are brought to you by this most powerful law of the universe, the Law of Attraction. (that which is like unto itself is drawn). You've most likely heard the saying \"Like attracts like,\" \"Birds of a feather flock together,\" or \"It is done unto you as you believe\" (a belief is only a thought you keep thinking); and although the Law of Attraction has been alluded to by some of the greatest teachers in history, it has never before been explained in as clear and practical terms as in this latest book by New York Times best-selling authors, Esther and Jerry Hicks. Learn here about the omnipresent Laws that govern this Universe and how to make them work to your advantage. The understanding that you'll achieve by reading this book will take all the guesswork out of daily living. You'll finally understand just about everything that's happening in your own life as well as in the lives of those you're interacting with. This book will help you to joyously be, do, or have anything that you desire!\"",
