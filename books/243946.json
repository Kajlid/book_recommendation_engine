  "description": "Fine Art Photography by Judith Monteferrante. 'Under the Sun' is about love, and is another chapter in the continuing story of Audrey Wilde and Scott Theseus which began in 'Gelatin Silver Print.' Audrey Wilde is an American fine artist who is a leading figure in the visual art movement known as 'common art.' Her works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, advertisement, and the common-every-day present in America. Scott Theseus is an American film director and screenwriter. He has produced and directed many award winning films and is best known for his distinctive visual and narrative style. This book was created and presented by Audrey gifted to Scott as an heirloom to their love; it is a catalog of letters, photographs, and poetry, created during their years apart; collected, in Audrey's words, so that 'we who love remember love, see its flowers and the stars of its words and hear those faint in the gentle winds of our hearts; always, for it is never too late.'",
