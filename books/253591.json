  "description": "While it suffers from a somewhat \"clunky\" writing style, this book is extremely interesting. Heisenberg introduces the reader to his world. The reader learns of the thoughts that led to his discoveries, the process by which these discoveries were made, and, almost as a side-note, the reader is acquainted with Heisenberg as a person. A great deal of controversy has surrounded Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. For a long time many people did not accept it as true. Now that it has been largely accepted, there is still a great deal of difficulty in understanding it. This book will aid the non-scientist in getting a better idea of what it is all about and in understanding why it was necessary.--Jason Waskiewicz",
