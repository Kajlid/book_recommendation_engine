  "description": "Dumped by her hotshot boyfriend and boss, Layla Lewis quits her job and heads to Trecastle in North Cornwall to house-sit for a friend-of-a-friend. Trecastle isn't new to her; it's a place where she holidayed regularly with her now-estranged mother. It's also the home of Hannah McKenzie, her childhood friend. Hannah has tempted her with a place to live and a job in the local pub. Needing time to nurse her battered heart and escape her \"real life\" for a year, Layla accepts. Hannah is a talented artist as well as a barmaid. She lives in the village center with her boyfriend Jim, a singer in a local band. They are happy together, or as happy as they can be, considering. Hannah loves Jim, but there is someone she loves more and it's pushing them to breaking point. Meanwhile, back in Brighton, Layla's fiery yet loyal friend Penny seeks revenge on her behalf, sending a forged email that could damage her ex's business prospects. Penny wonders if she has gone too far but is soon preoccupied with her own problems: the sizzle has fizzled in her marriage, and she feels neglected. After getting frisky with Dylan one night, she confesses all to her husband-and he's been like ice ever since. Over the course of a year, there is laughter and heartache as all three endeavor to reign in their tumultuous love lives-discovering you can run all you like, but if it's love you're up against, true love, good things can only happen when you stand your ground.",
