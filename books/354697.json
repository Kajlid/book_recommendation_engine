  "description": "The last few years have not been kind to Rose. She has lost her husband and is currently residing with an abusive boyfriend. Furthermore, an enigmatic but very handsome man is stalking her. Ultimately, she finds that he is a supernatural being from heaven; or perhaps he has emerged from the depths of hell. Regardless, from his pointed teeth to his blood-kissed lips, Stefan is indeed a vampire, a creature Rose once thought only existed in folklore. He has emerged from the sinister darkness and come to claim her as his own. Stefan Hansen has seen the very worst of mankind. Before his transitioning, he had endured the horrors of World War II and the violent loss of his Jewish love. Thinking that the past was dead, he could not have been more wrong. And an apparition from his past was scheming to prove it with destructive intentions.",
