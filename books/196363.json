  "description": "You’re not supposed to find love in the middle of a war, and definitely not with someone in your same company.Corporal Henry Iverson is 2nd Platoon’s Doc. He loves his job, even if the guys don’t quite love him back. Uneasy with the “company queer”, Henry is on the outs of everything, except when they need his help. He’s used to being lonely, though, and he’s got the tough skin to prove it.Private Will Rollins joined the Army to get away from everything and everyone, but most especially from himself. Five thousand miles away, about to leap out of a plane over Utah Beach on D-Day, Will knows he’s missing something in his life, but he told himself he wouldn’t think about that. Not ever again.When the jump doesn’t go as planned, Henry finds Will – a man he barely knows from another platoon – injured behind enemy lines, and it’s up to him to get Will to safety, despite the raging war and Will’s sudden amnesia… and Will’s out-of-seeming-nowhere searing attraction to Henry.The war doesn’t stop for two men, though, not for a moment. Stuck between endless battles and a world that shuns their form of love, Will and Henry must fight to survive the war and fight for each other, though everything stands in their way.",
