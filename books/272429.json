  "description": "R.L. Stine has Fear Street, Stephen King has Castle Rock, E. Reyes has Devil’s Hill.\nFrom the mind of author E. Reyes comes his debut horror anthology full of 18 terrifying Halloween stories that will keep you thinking long after the tales have been read.Welcome to Devil’s Hill, Arizona; it is a place that runs rampant with the occult, the paranormal, the supernatural, the macabre, killers, and everything that makes you think there’s something behind you or in the closet. Devil’s Hill is definitely not like every other city; other cities should be thankful. And now, during Halloween, things are worse than before.It's the darker half of the year. Cold weather begins and dead leaves are around us. Short days and long nights provide the perfect setting for ghost stories. And on every Halloween, the veil between the dead and the living is at its thinnest. But this year, the veil is completely gone, allowing spirits, deities, the unexplained, and true evil to roam the town of Devil's Hill, Arizona freely.After a group of teenage witches summon an ancient deity into a scarecrow, all hell breaks loose and the veil between the dead and the living is broken. Each of the 18 stories in Devil's Hill is different and unique, but they all connect to the underlying cause of what the witches have summoned. Halloween in Devil's Hill is about to be the scariest one ever.",
