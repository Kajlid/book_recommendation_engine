Albert is a member of the Edelweiss Pirates, a secret group of young people who defy the Hitler Youth. They play the forbidden music and work against the Nazis any way they can. Albert's younger brother, Kurt, loves jazz and longs to be a Pirate, too. Although he's too young to be an Edelweiss Pirate, Kurt can still find a way to take a stand. \"[A]n inspiring story, enhanced by illustrations that suit it well.\"― Chicago Jewish StarA powerful homage to young activists.\"― Kirkus Reviews",
