Then there are the two bounty hunters from Mobile, who have the right name but are wrong in every other way. And finally there is the kid's girlfriend, a blond drifter who never leaves a fingerprint.\nAs if that all weren't enough to ruin Frank's night job, a body turns up holding a Midnight Taxi Service roadmap. And once again Frank Cole has to find the answers without even knowing the questions.   \nIn this entertaining sequel to his first novel, Vincent H. O'Neil takes his readers on a dark Florida taxi ride with his likable sleuth.",
