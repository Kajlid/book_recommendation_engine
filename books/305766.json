  "description": "Two closeted men in one rumor-hungry small town have no chance of keeping their love a secret. Chief of Police Windsor Elkhart is a master deceiver. Not a single person in Jasper has a clue he’s gay, which explains the endless suitors all vying for his attention. Happily married to his job, he’s convinced life is good enough. Twenty years of abstinence is the price he chose to pay, all because of a secret he’s too ashamed to reveal. Until Tomi Lee returns to town after a two-decade-long absence. Shame and self-loathing have kept Tomi away from his home town, but can a simple message from a lonely police officer bring him back for good? The people of Jasper prey on gossip. Everyone is watching everyone. No one is exempt. Falling in love is easy, but do two closeted men have any chance of building a sustainable relationship when they’re always trying to hide? Concealed Hearts is a low/med angst MM romance novel with two severely closeted main characters. It is part of the Hometown Jasper Series but can be read as a standalone",
