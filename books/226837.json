She thinks she's being stalked, someone is demanding money from her - threats lurk around every corner and those closest to Holly are running out of patience.But is she alone responsible for what's happening? Are her fears just the paranoia of an illness - or intimations of very real danger?And if she can no longer rely on her own judgement, who can she trust to catch her when she falls?",
