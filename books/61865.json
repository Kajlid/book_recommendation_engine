  "description": "A gripping family drama that plays out against a turbulent and controversial political era, this book tells the tale of Susan Kinnane. She is the precocious daughter of conservative parents who spurns the attention of fellow university student Mike Riley in favor of a passionate romance with activist Terry Stoddard. When the South African Rugby team goes on the road, Terry, Susan, and Mike join the anti-apartheid demonstrations outside the Springbok’s hotel near the iconic Tower Mill. Late in the night, the riot police charge, and the terrified students are hunted into the darkened park below. What happens next changes each of their lives forever. Eight months later, Susan gives birth to a son, Tom, whose destiny is shaped by a man who is not his father, and by the events of that shocking night. As a lawyer working in London decades later, Tom must return to make peace with the past. This novel combines the youthful passion and enthusiastic activism of the 1970s with the racism of the apartheid era in a vibrant and tumultuous story that will enthrall readers to the final page.",
