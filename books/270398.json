  "title": "Surviving Vegas",
  "description": "An unthinkable act. A family in danger. Their next breath could be their last. The Culpeppers are in Vegas for a vow renewal when missiles from a coordinated terrorist attack streak across the sky, delivering a deadly new chemical weapon that disperses wider and lasts longer than previous generations. It is death in a single breath, with bone-breaking seizures and brain damage from contact with just a drop of the gas. Separated from their family amid the chaos, Jake and Hannah must find their way to each other so they can locate their missing children and Hannahâ€™s mother. No one is safe, and no one knows if they'll all survive Vegas.  This is a disaster thriller featuring chemical warfare and how such an event might unfold for the average family. There is some violence and a bit of swearing, but no sexual content.",
