A pestilence born in the smoldering graveyards of nameless, forgotten battlefields. And now there is only a shifting darkness in Cut River, a darkness populated by hideous shadows that pretend to be people. Seven strangers will arrive. If they can stay alive until dawn, they'll survive. But to do that will mean engaging in a bloody war of attrition against the things that crawl and hunt in the night. Things that wear the faces of men, women, and children. Toxic Shadows.Welcome to Cut River. Welcome to the graveyard.War is Hell.",
