  "description": "Sadie Grey, prolific crime writer, fifty-something spinster, and former wild child, is threatening to write her memoirs. Unfortunately, not everyone in the UK coastal town of St. Eves is as keen to see the result of her reminiscences as she is so, when she is found dead at the foot of her staircase, the list of likely suspects is a long one. Who was it who would stop at nothing to prevent Sadie's story from being published. And why? As Detective Chief Inspector Nathan Costello and his team have their work cut out to establish a motive and track down the killer, his wife, Charlotte, is busy juggling motherhood with working at her caf√©. Thank goodness for old friend, Ava Whittington, who has taken on chief childminding duties for little Molly, with comical results. As the investigation into Sadie's murder gathers pace, long-buried secrets are revealed, along with the shocking reason for the killer wanting to keep Sadie's story out of the public eye. After all, the reputations of some of the town's most respected residents are at stake... Please note: This book is written in British English and uses UK spelling and terminology.",
