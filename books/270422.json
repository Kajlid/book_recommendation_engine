  "title": "With Borges",
  "description": "In 1964, in Buenos Aires, a blind writer in his sixties approached a sixteen-year-old bookstore clerk and asked if he would be interested in a part-time job reading aloud.The writer was Jorge Luis Borges, one of the world's finest literary minds; the boy was Alberto Manguel, who would become a prolific, internationally acclaimed novelist, essayist and editor.Manguel's reflections are part memoir, part biography and all celebration of the living quality of literature. This is a moving portrait of an enigmatic genius, replete with deep insight into Borges and the writers he most admired.Alberto Manguel is an internationally acclaimed anthologist, translator, essayist, novelist and editor, and is the author of several award-winning books including A Dictionary of Imaginary Places and A History of Reading.He was born in Buenos Aires, became a Canadian citizen in 1982 and now lives in France, where he was named Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.",
