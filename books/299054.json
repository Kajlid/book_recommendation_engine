  "description": "A passionate crusader, a gentleman lumberjack…can they move past grief and deception to find love?  Kenzie Vega puts her whole heart into everything she does, from fundraising for a cancer cure to her love of the outdoors. She’s especially passionate about forests, and even produces a MyHeartChannel show encouraging viewers to immerse themselves in nature. But while Kenzie’s days are filled with people, her private life is the opposite, and she’s actually very much alone.  A second-generation logger, Peter Olson believes in sustainable harvests while he makes his living cutting down trees. However, he keeps his profession a secret from the fascinating woman in his hiking club. Past experience has taught him that people who love the outdoors get upset about trees coming down, and he doesn’t want to blow the relationship before it has a chance to grow. But when he realizes that Kenzie’s favorite forest is slated for clear-cutting, his fear of losing her overshadows his good judgement.  As Kenzie struggles to save a memory of her mother, will she learn to risk giving someone new a place in her heart?",
