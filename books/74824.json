  "description": "James Herriot's final work and last in his beloved series of animal stories This fifth and final of James Herriot's heartwarming story collections brings back familiar friends (including old favorites such as Tricki Woo) and introduces new ones, including Herriot's children Rosie and Jimmy and the marvelously eccentric vet Calum Buchanan. As James grows older, he finds that change comes even to his beloved Yorkshire---but not necessarily bad, as he watches his own two children come to share and participate in his deep love of the animal world. Herriot's last memoir, Every Living Thing is a truly heartwarming read, burstingly full of his deep joy in life, sense of humor, and appreciation of the world around him.",
