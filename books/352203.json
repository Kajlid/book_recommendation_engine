  "title": "Everyday Dharma: Seven Weeks to Finding the Buddha in You",
  "description": "In The Everyday Dharma , Willa Miller, an authorized lama in the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition, reworks ancient Buddhist techniques and adapts them for western readers seeking personal transformation. Becoming a Buddha, Lama Miller explains, means observing the mind and actions and then doing the physical, psychological, and spiritual work to move closer to one's wisdom nature. Dharma is spiritual practice; it's what one does every day to make one's mind and world a better place to live. Each chapter includes a passage to read, an exercise of the day that relates to each week's topic, a quote from a sage, and tips on how to make daily practice a little easier. The book shows that it's not necessary to subscribe to a particular -- or any -- belief system to benefit from this program. \"It's only necessary,\" says Lama Miller, \"to believe one deserves to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.\"",
