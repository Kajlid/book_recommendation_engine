Home from their travels at last, Sunaya and Iannis are confronted with a threat against which even their strongest magic is largely helpless. The very ground under their city is becoming increasingly unstable, and there are disturbing predictions of an impending quake the likes Solantha hasn't seen in centuries.  While their hands are full preparing for disaster, Iannis's most dangerous rival returns to Solantha, intent on finding anything he can use against Iannis. It isn't long before Fenris too is in his crosshairs, his dangerous secret perilously close to being exposed. Sunaya is fiercely determined to protect both her friend, and the man she loves, but will her efforts be enough? With old and new enemies as well as the might of nature ranged against her, one false step or indiscreet word can spell doom for all three of them...",
