  "title": "Arkansas: Three Novellas",
  "description": "Here are three novellas of escape and exile, touching and funny and at times calculatedly outrageous. In \"Saturn Street,\" a disaffected L.A. screenwriter delivers lunches to homebound AIDS patients, only to find himself falling in love with one of them. In \"The Wooden Anniversary,\" Nathan and Celia - familiar characters from Leavitt's story collections - reunite after a five-year separation. And in \"The Term-Paper Artist,\" a writer named David Leavitt, hiding out at his father's house in the aftermath of a publishing scandal, experiences literary rejuvenation when he agrees to write term papers for UCLA undergraduates in exchange for sex.",
