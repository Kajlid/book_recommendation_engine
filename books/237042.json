  "description": "XANDER Sons of book 5  Vampire biker Alexander “Xander” Dumitru has a problem on his hands, namely India Jackson. She’s alone, pregnant, and, worst of all, she belongs to a rival MC member whose recent death may or may not be a permanent condition. With rumors that India’s ex may now be turned and out to take her back, suddenly Xander’s vow to protect her becomes a matter of life or death. And it doesn’t help his mission when India’s sweet blood has him craving for far more than he has any right to claim.  When India asks for shelter with the Sons of Sangue, her primary concern is the protection of her unborn child. Yet as attracted as she is to dangerous, irascible Xander, India is unprepared for the tangle of emotions the handsome vampire awakens in her. But with her violent ex returned even deadlier than before, now India’s safety comes with a steep price—one that could pit the Sons in a war against their enemy MC, and force Xander to risk his immortal life to protect hers and that of her child.
