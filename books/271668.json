  "description": "In a West African prison cell a young woman, Tanga, is dying. Her only companion, Anna-Claude, is on the brink of madness. Anna-Claude retells Tanga's grim story of incest, betrayal, prostitution, bereavement, and crime. As Tanga shares her tale with Anna-Claude, the older woman progressively becomes Tanga, fusing the two identities. Through this physical and spiritual communion, Calixthe Beyala underlines the solidarity that unites women across racial, religious, class, and national lines.",
