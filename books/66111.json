This story originally appeared in \"Fantasy Gone Wrong,\" edited by Brittiany A. Koren and Martin H. Greenburg (DAW Books. Inc. 2006).\"Means to an End\" (approximately 4,950 words) is a cautionary tale about getting exactly what you planned and schemed and worked and wished for, but with unforeseen results. This story originally appeared in \"Blue Kingdoms: Mages and Magic,\" edited by Stephen D. Sullivan and Jean Rabe (Walkabout Publishing 2010).\"The Eye-Candy of Argon\" (approximately 2,300 words) is a critical and satirical re-telling (from a different perspective) of \"The Eye Of Agron\"--widely regarded as the worst published fantasy story of all time. This parody is best enjoyed by those who have already read Jim Theis' original tale in all of its un-copyedited glory, yet lived to read again. \"The Eye-Candy of Argon\" was originally presented at the conclusion of a group reading of \"The Eye of Argon\" at GenCon in August of 2011 and appears in print here for the very first time.\"MAKESHIFT\" (approximately 5,100 words) mixes fantasy and magic with imagination and the science of noetics in the tale of a very special young man recruited to a world of wonder and weighty responsibility. It is also available as a standalone e-Tale for just 99 cents.",
