  "description": "From the founding father of science fiction H.G. Wells, a masterpiece about a man trapped in the terror of his own creation.The Invisible Man is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells published in 1897. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it absorbs and reflects no light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse the procedure.While its predecessors, The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in The Invisible Man.As a moral tale, The Invisible Man can be seen as a modern version of the \"Ring of Gyges\" parable by Plato.The Invisible Man inspired The Map of Chaos by New York Times bestselling author FÃ©lix J. Palma. As a gift to readers, this ebook edition includes an excerpt from The Map of Chaos.",
