  "title": "Letters from Iceland",
  "description": "This highly amusing and unorthodox travel book resulted from a light-hearted summer journey by the young poets Auden and MacNiece in 1936. Their letters home, in verse and prose, are full of private jokes and irreverent comments about people, politics, literature and ideas. \"Letters from Iceland\" is one of the most entertaining books in modern literature; from Auden's 'Letter to Lord Byron' and MacNiece's 'Eclogue', to the mischief and fun of their joint 'Last Will and Testament', the book is impossible to resist- a thirties classic.",
