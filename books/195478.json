His synaesthesia lets him interpret art as fireworks and symphonies - but he's just been struck by writer's block.And then there's newly escaped from small-town Idaho, young and beautiful, she will become first Raul's lover and then James's.This electrifying debut captures the raw energy and spontaneity of the 1980s downtown scene - it is a celebration of the power of art, a love letter to New York and an intimate portrait of the strangers who embody the city's spirit.",
