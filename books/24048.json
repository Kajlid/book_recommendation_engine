  "description": "It has recently become acceptable, and even fashionable, to refer to one's church as \"missional.\" But many churches misunderstand the concept, thinking of \"going missional\" as simply being a necessary add-on to church-as-usual. This domestication of what is actually a very bold paradigm shift makes missional nothing more than one more trick to see church growth.With a light hand and a pastoral spirit, Michael Frost points out how church practitioners are not quite there yet. He reestablishes the ground rules, redefines the terms accurately, and insists that the true prophetic essence of \"being missional\" comes through undiluted. This clear corrective will take ministry leaders from \"not missional yet\" to well on their way.",
