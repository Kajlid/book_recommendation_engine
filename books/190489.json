  "description": "“Slut, you forget that your pleasure doesn’t matter. The only thing that should matter to you is whether I’m happy, whether I’m enjoying the use of your body. You’re nothing more than a toy, and you don’t ask your vibrator if it enjoys being shoved inside of you.” Blake Crowley is a shadow among the elite. He weaves his wicked webs of control through any place of power. Gang leaders, politicians, and the filthy rich all do his dirty work because he controls the one thing that all men crave: the VIP rooms of Bound Temptations, where every fantasy can be fulfilled for a price.The women of Bound Temptations are more than willing to fill even the most sadistic client’s fantasy. Ropes and chains will bind them. Crops, floggers, and paddles will be used to punish them. Every hole will be used, and though pain will flow through their bodies, they’ll cry out in masochistic ecstasy as they give their bodies over in submission.This novella is an introduction to Blake and the world of ecstatic fantasy that he’s created at Bound Temptations. Be warned that this is a dark and deviant tale filled with heavy BDSM scenes. Blake may have a happily ever after, but it will not be found within these pages.",
