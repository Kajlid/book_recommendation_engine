  "description": "Dark Fantasy RH\nWe were told to create something. So I designed my own demise. I crafted my own chaos. I planned my own death. We were told to live every day to the fullest. So I experienced my own catastrophe. I enjoyed my own vices. I embraced the ugliness of those around me. Somehow, along the way, I messed something up. I ruined it. I destroyed it. I did something terribly wrong. I had to assume that was the case. The reason I could never be loved. The reason we were unwanted. The reason we were rejected. I had to assume. Now, I had only one thing left to get right, one thing anyone supported us in. Our deaths. My death. Now I had a death wish. My issue? My problem? It's impossible for me to die. \n\n\n\nLorcan Louvre is back. Three years ago she and her twin disappeared in the middle of the night for LA. Now they are back for their senior year with an infamous reputation for partying, a penchant for violence, and a plan for avoiding the paparazzi.  So why did they leave? What are they hiding now? \n\n\nWarning: This dark RH (MMFMMM) fantasy romance contains dark themes. Our heroine has been through a lot and continues to go through many struggles. The book contains substance abuse, gore, violence, swearing, abuse, assault, sexual themes (+18), PTSD, and an array of other dark subject matters. If those concepts are not something you can read about, I would suggest not reading this book. The series will end with a HEA but the heroine has to go through a lot to realize she can trust the men around her. If this book appeals to you I promise that it will be an emotional rollercoaster.
