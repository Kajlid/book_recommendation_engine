That is, until a tragic explosion leaves him wounded in body and spirit. His military service ended, Jack returns to his parents' home to recuperate. Expecting a time of quiet contemplation, Jack is blindsided by the most inappropriate of attractions... the widow of his lost brother-in-arms. While Marith√©'s sweetness soothes Jack's agony, she's also suffering from her own grief. Will the couple be able to find a future together, or will regret, guilt and secrets destroy their troubled romance?",
