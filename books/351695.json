  "description": "She risked everything to save a life...but who would save hers? Vietnamese-American Victoria Nguyen, seventeen, flees to England with a powerful secret...and a determined senator on her trail. Madeleine Seymour, a history professor, and her husband, Jack, a retired wine broker, travel from San Francisco to London to purchase property for a children's home-and find much more than land at stake. Brother Cristoforo, a black Franciscan from the Seymours' Quattro Coronati orphanage in Rome, wrestles with demons of his past and present. Woven through the mists of Lent to new life on Easter Day, Inheritance draws the lives of these four characters together to a stunning, unforgettable conclusion. A poignant story about choices made along the way...and the miracles of the heart. Set in the breathtaking beauty of England. Don't miss Pilgrimage, Book One of the trilogy, set in Italy, or Offerings, Book Two of the trilogy, set in France.",
