  "description": "Burdened with passions, resentments and unhappiness Jennifer’s extended family is arriving at her house in France for a holiday. When they leave she will give them modest gifts that will put their already fragile relationships into meltdown. Alec’s love affair with Jennifer’s son is to become one of the casualties. In his desperation to retrieve the relationship he finds himself out of his depth as the lies mount up. But the sweet, reliable Alec is forced to discover that the arts of lying and money laundering have their uses. ‘Now, how does the lovely Jennifer disguise her money?’ says Alec confidently, ‘Let me count the ways. Dollars under the wallpaper? Diamonds hammered into the floorboards? Old masters sewn into the curtains? Cocaine in the U bend?’  No, she’s far cleverer than that.",
