  "description": "All Primrose King has ever wanted was to make her father proud. A daughter born to the pack alpha, she’s always known she would be mated to an alpha heir of her father’s choosing, but when he announces that she’s to be mated to Trent Walker, the heir to a pack rumored to hunt humans for sport, she’s devastated. When hidden truths are exposed, Primrose flees to the one place she knows they’ll never find her…enemy territory.Humans are turning up dead on Brennan land, humans that’ve been brutally murdered by wolves. Jax, Finn, and Felix are in a race against time as they hunt for the wolves responsible. The council is demanding answers, and if they can’t deliver them soon, Jax Brennan could lose everything his father and grandfather have worked for. When they discover a lone wolf living on the run in Brennan territory, they’re convinced that she’s the one who’s been leaving the trail of human bodies, except there’s one small problem....she’s their star-kissed mate.Ours to Keep is a slow-burn reverse harm novel, where the heroine doesn't have to choose just one mate. It also ends on a cliffhanger but will ultimately have a HEA.",
