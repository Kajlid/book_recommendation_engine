  "description": "Miles was my best friend until one big fight broke us. Now it’s been five years since I’ve even seen his face, but when I move back home to open my coffee shop, it seems like he’s everywhere. I thought I’d gotten over him, but I didn’t. I thought we’d never get past heated arguments, but I underestimated him. He was a stubborn teenager, but he grew into a stubborn man, a cop who doesn’t back down easily and can still make me laugh out loud when I feel awkward. He wants to be friends again, but I think I want him more now than I did before. I couldn’t tell him how I felt back then, and I still can’t tell him now. I can’t tell anyone because it would break the deal I made with the devil. But then again, that devil is in prison, so he can’t hurt me anymore. Right?Warning: Contains a meddling mother, hot cops in uniform, cupcakes, suspiciously interesting new neighbors, and some heat in the kitchen. Reader discretion is advised for graphic violence, explicit language and sexual content. Recommended for ages 18+.NOTE: One Hundred Percent can be read as a stand-alone novel, but overlaps with Lying and Confessing (Fighting book 2 and 3) and includes scenes from both books told from Trinity's perspective.",
