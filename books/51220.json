  "description": "Whatever you think about him, JESUS IS MORE. Are you open to a new view of Jesus, a view that goes far beyond what most people were taught? If so, this book presents Jesus as an immortal spiritual being who is still working with humankind today.Jesus' goal is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago, namely to raise those who are willing to the level of consciousness that he demonstrated. That is why he said that those who believe on him shall do the works that he did.Jesus came to inaugurate a new spiritual cycle in the life of this planet. It is now the end of that cycle, and Jesus wants his fair harvest. Thus, as an ascended being, Jesus has brought forth this book through direct revelation.Â It contains 17 lessons, each with a practical exercise, designed to empower you to systematically transcend the limitations of what most people see as a normal state of consciousness, but which Jesus sees as spiritual death. This is Jesus' workbook on attaining personal Christhood.",
