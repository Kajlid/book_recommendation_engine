  "description": "This collection includes all three books in the Sorority Sisters First Time Series Book 1: Jasmine will do anything it takes to get into her sorority of choice during her first semester of Community College. But she isn't prepared when her future sisters break into her dorm room, zip tie her hands behind her back, and kidnap her to somewhere across the campus. She's made to wait in an odd underground room until a familiar voice jogs her out of her nightmare--and into her initiation. All the other girls have done it--at least that's what the head of the sorority says before she leaves the room. And now Jasmine is faced with four of her college professors who are willing to give her a passing grade. All she has to do is a be a good girl and she'll get everything she's ever wanted--a family. There's only one big Jasmine's a virgin.Book 2: Piper's been accepted as a possible legacy for the coolest sorority on campus. All she has to do is pass their initiation test before becoming a full-fledged sister. Sounds easy enough--all it takes is complete submission and she's in the club for good.Book 3: Sadie is minding her own business pulling research books from the library for a paper that's due in twenty-four hours--little does she know that her paper is going to be sidelined yet again. Ambushed by a wall of sorority girls and pushed into an elevator, Sadie learns she was a write-in for a new rush girl. And now she has to either complete initiation or--well, there really isn't any other option.",
