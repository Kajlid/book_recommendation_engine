  "description": "Wilma Daugherty has the voice of a storyteller. The short memoirs contained in \"Fragments: Stories of Another Time\" chronicle nine decades of experiences as a child, a young woman, a mother, and finally, the last of her siblings. Sometimes nostalgic, sometimes tragic, these vignettes are reminders of a time before the rise of consumerism; a time when children made their own play and faced the harsh reality of epidemics without antibiotics and vaccinations. Wilma Daugherty successfully captures the tone of an oral historian becoming an authentic voice in the recollection of life in small town America.",
