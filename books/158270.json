Now it’s time for Carbon County to fight back.   In End Times, Daphne lost herself in love with Owen, only to discover the dark secret that puts Carbon County at ground zero for the end of days. . . .    All thirteen of the Children of Earth have arrived and taken root in town. Together at last, they can perform the series of rituals necessary to awaken their father, a wrathful entity known as the God of the Earth.   Daphne protects their identities from Pastor Ted and the God-fearing locals out of love and allegiance to Owen.
