  "description": "WITCHBOUND is the first book in THE NORTHWOODS PACK series, a high heat, humorous, entertaining, paranormal romance series set in Maine, featuring an irresistible cast of wolves, vampires, and witches, caught up in an ancient prophecy to unite their three worlds.Twenty-five-year-old Finn, a gay bartender from NYC who grew up on the streets in the Bronx but looks like he belongs in Venice Beach, doesn’t do overnights or even return phone calls, and he definitely doesn’t believe in “mates.”When Finn inherits a cabin in the Northwoods of Maine from his werewolf friend, neither he nor his friend's insanely sexy older brother are prepared to meet on the doorstep. But once they do, nothing will stop the Alpha werewolf, Griffin, from claiming Finn as his mate, not even a kidnapping and an ancient prophecy involving Finn and a witchborn werewolf with a claim of his own.",
