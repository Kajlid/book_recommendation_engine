  "description": "\"He asked me what my favorite position was. I said CEO.\"   Abby and I have been down this road before. Trying to put together a relationship.  But I messed everything up that time.  There's no sign that things will be any better this time, but we can't seem to stay away from each other.  If she doesn't want to be in the public eye, then so be it: we'll keep our relationship a secret.  How long will that work for? And can we still be there for one another if we're constantly hiding?  Maybe we need to redefine the terms of this. But if I lose her over this, I don't know what I'll do.  Counting the Billions series: Book 1 – Counting the Days Book 2 – Counting on You Book 3 – Counting the Kisses  Note: The author would like to let you know that this is a 3-part series that will end on an HEA.",
