  "description": "Pax Burnson and Amara Kalgren have discovered a technique to join their bodies together into a superpowered goddess named Para. In order to hone her skills, the girls have chosen to escape the Earth and all of humanity to engage in the rigorous trials of a realm known as the Pseudosphere. The willpower and bodily fortitude of the young devas will be proven as they endure a constant stream of otherworldly hardships, testing their loyalties and tearing them apart. Although the two women have physically escaped everyone they know, and have even attempted to escape their own identities through Para, they discover that the past has a way of gnawing at one from the inside. Meanwhile on Earth, a mysterious dark-skinned woman has been following Thorn and Ash. They cast her aside as one of their many female admirers, only to learn that she is actually a visitor from the future. This demigoddess has risked everything to travel back in time and warn them of a cataclysmic event that has already been set into motion. Will Pax and Amara be forced to work together with Thorn and Ash, the very men they have sworn to exact vengeance upon? Are they strong enough individually or will they need to reveal themselves as Para in order to prevent the apocalypse?",
