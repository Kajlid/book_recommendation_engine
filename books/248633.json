  "description": "For Victorian travellers a trip to Turkey was a leap into the dark of Islam. Fascinated by their accounts of the far-flung, down-at-heel Ottoman Empire, novelist and traveller Philip Glazebrook followed in their footsteps. His destination was Kars, the city within view of Mount Ararat where the Ark was stranded. Through the old Serbian and Greek provinces and islands, through the ruined cities of Asia Minor, to Kars and then back to Trebizond, Istanbul and the Balkan capitals - this book recounts his adventures.",
