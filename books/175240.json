  "description": "Adrian's had it with the humiliation of home: the belching van, the sadistic rooster, and her father’s endless exhibition of sweat pants and blazers. Taking refuge in the kitchen, Adrian crafts crumpets and cupcakes, getting a taste for what she really wants in life. Though she can’t afford the culinary school of her dreams, Adrian decides any escape will do. But leaving home isn’t a cure-all; there are new relationships that torment and change her. She finds that infatuations can turn sour and ambition can burn, leaving a painful void where he used to be. Through it all, Adrian learns that humor is often the best recipe to overcome heartache. And when all else fails, there are tarts.",
