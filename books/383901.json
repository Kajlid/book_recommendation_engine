  "description": "My Occasional Torment is for The Rest Of Us, who are typically absent from the beautiful people descriptions within the pages of Erotica. All of us imperfect, middle-aged and past-middle-aged souls. We have not left the planet nor are we indefinitely sequestered inside a convent in Antarctica. At least not within the pages of My Occasional Torment. In these pages, through the ordeals of 53-year-old Julia Connery, The Rest Of Us get to experience youthful, gorgeous, seemingly indestructible Erotica gets its sexual ass kicked by a past-middle-aged married woman who knows what the good, long-lasting stuff is really all about.From Booklist:Marriage is demanding, and after 33 years, Julia wants proof that hers will last. Everyone in Highland Park, Illinois, seems to be cheating, divorced, or widowed. She cannot forget the time her husband, Sebastian, a history professor at the local junior college, was unfaithful before they married, and wonders if she should visit the plastic surgeon to keep herself desirable. Compounding her fears is the steady stream of women students who have read Mitch Albom and Frank McCourt, and now want her husband to be their inspiration. In between her fears that she is not woman enough, or Scottish enough (sheâ€™s three quarters) for her husband, she is also worried about her elderly father-in-law, who obsesses about gangsters; her 17-year-old son Roby, who is at war with his father; and their widowed neighbor, whom they all call the vampire. With insight and humor, Robb tells a tale that shows you are never too old or too married for romance. --Patty Engelmann",
