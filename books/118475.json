  "description": "Not many people know that I, Eevie Lawson, have a problem. An addiction to romance novels. I eat them for breakfast. I hide it the best I can, but I need them to breathe. It’s how I cope.I’ve had a swag of book boyfriends, but now that I’m free from the responsibility of caring for my three younger brothers, it’s time to find one in the flesh. In real life, no girl meets their hero on page one, or even at the end of chapter one. I should know. My journey is real. It’s not perfect, and it sure as hell isn’t easy—but the fight for something worthwhile never is.",
