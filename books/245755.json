  "description": "No phone, no gun, not even a hint of a coffee shop. What’s a girl to do?  Apprehension and turmoil with those closest to me has me ready to jump back into work. Discovering the body of a colleague before I’m cleared for active duty isn’t a great start and a video of my power in action has people looking at me sideways. To avoid the stares I jump at the chance to cart around a group of visiting agents.  We were supposed to be completing a simple portal closing. Instead, interagency intrigue and sabotage erupts. I’m thrown into another dimension with a near stranger who seems intent on ordering me around. We’re trapped, hungry, and facing an unknown foe. Can we find a way home before we kill each other?",
