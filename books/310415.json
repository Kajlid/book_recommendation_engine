  "description": "Have you ever thought there was a spider crawling on you only to discover it was a piece of hair?But it’s not your hair—it’s your wife’s—a woman who just happens to be your best friend’s little sister that hates your guts as well.And she wasn’t your wife until you drunkenly married her in Vegas, which meant a few weeks later she was living in your house and her hair was freaking everywhere, sending you into a panic attack multiple times a day.Yeah, welcome to my life.I, Hayes Weston, was perfectly content managing my nightclub investments until my father told me he was ready to retire and for me to take over his billion-dollar investment firm.The catch? He didn’t want to hand it over until he was sure I had contemplated my future, including looking for a wife.Now I’m married to Waverly Morgan, the girl I teased relentlessly growing up. But Waverly is all grown up now too, living in my house, and making me contemplate my sanity and the lonely life I lead before. Suddenly, she’s not the annoying little sister of my best friend, but a woman with curves, determination, and a mind that surprises me at every turn.We go from being married for convenience to married for real—until our reasons for staying married come to fruition and we’re forced to make a decision about our future.But by then, I’m invested. I need her. But marriage is a lot harder than I thought.Can I convince her to let me in? Can I convince her that she’s really what I want?But more importantly, can I honor the vows we made that fateful night in Vegas and get her to honor them too?",
