  "description": "On 2 January 2013, just a day before Jim Davidson was due to enter the Celebrity Big Brother house, he found himself behind far more serious locked doors when he was arrested by the Yewtree detectives over alleged sex offences. Twelve months later, the public voted to crown Jim Davidson as the winner of the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother. Finally, with all charges dropped and no further action being taken - and with the public offering him their staunch support - Jim can finally look back on his year from hell.Facing a series of damaging false allegations, Jim was forced to fight, not just for his reputation and his career, but for his freedom too. Mounting legal costs and a deepening sense of injustice saw Jim sink to the lowest point of his career as the Yewtree investigation threatened to ruin him both financially and emotionally. Finally, after months of pain came the words he and his supporters had been waiting to 'No Further Action'.Now, with the public's approval, Jim reflects on this painful period with the regular dose of wit and humour that have made him so successful. Searingly honest, No Further Action pays tribute to those who stood by him and takes a wry look at what life is like under investigation in the public eye.'YOU CAN'T FAIL TO BE MOVED BY THIS STORY' -Daily Express",
