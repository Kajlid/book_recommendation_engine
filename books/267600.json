Helena Carter isn’t like other Humans. She believes in rights for the Others—creatures of other races deemed vermin by all Humans.  The problem right now is she’s been captured for harbouring a criminal, Nick Mason, escaped convict and former heir to the Tiger Pack throne.  At first, Helena resigns herself to wait it out. They can’t keep her forever, but the Humans have a more sinister plan for her and her tiger. As the stakes rise for her and Nick, Helena must be stronger than she’s ever been, braver than she can imagine, and as fierce as any tigress in the war. It is time for Helena to get her own stripes.  Broken is a fast-paced Urban Fantasy and Paranormal novel with a touch of romance and a whole lot of claws. Love Kelley Armstrong, Patricia Briggs? Then you will love this.  While this book is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone. It is a complete story and may contain spoilers for previous books in the series.",
