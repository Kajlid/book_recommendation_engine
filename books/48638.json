  "title": "The Catskills",
  "description": "Some come just to escape. Others come to escape their past. Sometimes there's no escaping it. When an outsider is killed in an auto accident during a snowstorm, it sets in motion the worst two weeks of Jack's life. Gloria receives an unnerving call from her only daughter with a trouble that neither of them could imagine. Michael is a former U.S. Marine and ex-cop who inadvertently steps from the peaceful retirement life into a maelstrom of violence the likes of which he's never seen; not in Iraq and not on the streets of New York City. Chance encounters, family secrets, destructive relationships and forces of nature all combine for an explosive ending that could only happen in The Catskills.",
