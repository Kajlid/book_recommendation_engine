  "description": "Anna Akhmatova (June 23, 1889 - March 5, 1966) is considered by many to be one of the greatest Russian poets of the Silver Age. Her works range from short lyric love poetry to longer, more complex cycles, such as Requiem, a tragic depiction of the Stalinist terror. One of the forefront leaders of the Acmeism movement, which focused on rigorous form and directness of words, she was a master of conveying raw emotion in her portrayals of everyday situations. During the time of heavy censorship and persecution, her poetry gave voice to the Russian people. Anna Akhmatova published the collection \"White Flock\" in 1917. Joseph Brodsky later described this volume as writing of personal lyricism tinged with the \"note of controlled terror.\" Today, it remains among her most celebrated publications. It is presented here in full, in a dual-language book, translated by Andrey Kneller.",
