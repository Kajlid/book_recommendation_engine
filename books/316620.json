  "description": "In a life of diamond bracelets and country clubs, I’m the perfect daughter. I get all the right grades, volunteer at all the right organizations, apply to all the right colleges. And I hate every second of it. At the rate my life is playing out, under the strict rule of my parents, politicians and housewives will be my future. Until I meet Harry.Harry’s a singer in a rock band with a voice so drop-dead sexy that I actually feel hypnotized. Doesn’t hurt that he’s hot either, and with the kind, flirty personality to match, it’s the perfect trifecta. And even better, he sees the me I want to be. The me who can break free of the life I’m trapped in, the me who can control my own future. The only problem? He knows me as Stella, my fun, carefree alter-ego—so drastically different than Destelle, the one who is trapped in the life my parents rule for me. But as we get closer, I realize Harry’s keeping a secret of his own, something related to his dark past that he’s trying to move on from, and when I find out, everything we’ve built could come crashing down.",
