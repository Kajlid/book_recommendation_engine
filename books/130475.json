He'd pay her back with interest, and she would never be able to outrun his revenge.\"Bachelor Daniel Touchwood's life is normal, even humdrum. He lives in a small town, teaches English at a local school, and spends his free time immersed in books. Occasionally lonely, but never really unhappy, he sees no reason why things should ever be different.Everything changes, however, when Daniel finds two young runaways hiding in his cellar one evening. Twins Imogen and Leo are appealing, enchanting even, and it isn't long before Daniel finds himself being drawn ever closer to Imogen. As he soon begins to suspect, however, the twins are hiding are dark secret...A story about love and skeletons in cupboards, Loving Imogen explores the nature of desire and the poisonous power of concealment.Three short stories, The Song of the Sea, Summer and Fragile Things, are included in this book.",
