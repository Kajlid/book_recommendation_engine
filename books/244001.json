  "description": "Japanese mythology meets urban fantasy in this brand new series by Jasmine Walt!\n  When an ancient spirit awakens a hidden ability within Aika, grateful is the last word that comes to her mind. Being able to summon monsters and spirits to do your bidding might sound cool in comic books, but in real life it brings nothing but trouble. And between chasing after a medical degree, caring for her ailing mother, and running the family business, she's got plenty to deal with.  Unfortunately, Aika doesn't have the luxury of ignoring her new abilities. An ancient, powerful evil has taken her mother hostage, and with cancer eating away at her life, the clock is ticking until Aika loses her forever.  Luckily, a hunky—if occasionally infuriating—shaman has taken an interest in Aika, and is willing to show her the ropes and fight by her side. But the more time Aika spends with Raiden, the more she realizes that he might not be what he seems. The truth is just out of reach, and once Aika uncovers it, she'll either find the key to saving their world... ...or destroy the best thing she's ever had.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Please make sure to read the author's note in the front of the book before diving into the book. There is important information there that will improve your reading experience.",
