  "title": "The Slave Factory",
  "description": "A young woman sat inside a restaurant bar with a man more than twice her age. Neither of them held the slightest concern over the difference between their ages. Captivated by what the older man had been telling her, she was also unaware of the purposes of the two men that sat at a table twenty-five feet away. This is how The Slave Factory begins. It is the story of a woman's journey of self-discovery as she and an eclectic group of fellow students undergo six-months of focused and brutal reshaping, guided by a Master of the arts of sex, bondage, dicipline, and submission within the walls of a place known only as The Academy. Each student spent years under the watchful eye of the secret company that traced it's origins to ancient history and beyond. Only the best were selected for their final review, only the best of those were selected to be trained and sold as slaves to the wealthy and the powerful. This story contains scenes involving explicit sexual contact and numerous depictions of BDSM activities. Recommended for Adults eighteen of over.",
