  "description": "Ten years ago, visions of death and the babble of lupine voices in his head drove lone wolf Brick Northridge to challenge his cruel and greedy pack Alpha. Beaten by the Alphaâ€™s thugs and banished from the pack, Brick lives a life of seclusion in a mountain cabin in the Black Hills.  Born into a rival clan of feline shifters, skinwalker Summer McCoy, in her guise as a raven, watches Brick from afar, giving him back a reason to live through her sweet songs and special gifts.  But when her clan attempts to tear them apart and threatens the pack that banished Brick so many years before, will their love be strong enough to withstand the forces bent on their destruction?",
