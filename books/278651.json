  "title": "Life and Campaigns of Lieutenant General Thomas J. Jackson",
  "description": "From back cover: Stonewall Jackson - his very name evokes the image of the solid, immovable Confederate general, whose sobriquet, earned at the Battle of First Manassas no longer requires quotation marks. But no one has labeled Thomas Jonathan Jackson a \"marble man,\" as impenetrable as the statues which commemorate his valor, because his pious Christian character, his service to the church and teaching vocation, his unwavering commitment to duty, his affectionate role as husband and father, as well as his magnificent service to Virginia and the Southern Confederacy were carefully recorded by his close friend and confidant Robert Lewis Dabney. Dr. Dabney understood, far better than most subsequent biographers, the animating principles of Stonewall Jackson's life - his personal faith in Jesus Christ and his absolute trust in the Providence of God. Labeled by some a religious fanatic, General Jackson was simply a consistent biblical Christian who lived out his faith every day, seriously and without compromise.",
