While Planchette can whip up a perfect pizza potion, getting these supernatural guests to leave is more than her magic can handle.

Together, they struggle to put these spirits to rest and find their own sense of belonging.Unfamiliar, a debut graphic novel based on the popular webcomic series by Haley Newsome (aka Lavender Towne), is bursting with offbeat charm, a vibrant cast of wee witches, and hilarious sidekicks.",
