  "description": "Every bride is entitled to pre-wedding jitters, and what reasonable girl wouldn't think twice about marriage when her fianc√© shaves off his eyebrows just in time for the photographs? But what if the bride-to-be is really freaked out by something else? Like, perhaps, the terrifying notion of happily-ever-after? With her ex-boyfriend back in the town, Heidi Savage is wondering whether she can really forsake all others-especially for the man waiting at the end of the aisle with no eyebrows.",
