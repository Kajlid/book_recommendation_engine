  "description": "One heart, two pledges, her last hope...  He has something that belongs to her, something he can’t give back. Will the very thing that draws her to him, tear her apart?  Straight-laced Nakita Faulkner is never one to back down from a wager with her free-spirited twin brother. Finding herself getting her first tattoo after losing a bet, Nakita knows there’s no way she’d ever have anything to do with her mysterious tattooist—she has a plan for her life and she’s sticking to it.  Lennox Conrad—Nox—a tattooist with a troubled past is trying to get his life back on track. When Nakita walks into his parlour determined to get a tattoo she obviously doesn’t want, Nox is more than a little intrigued. But there are circumstances beyond his control and time is running out.  Then one night Nakita’s world is turned upside down. Utterly devastated, with nowhere to turn, she finds two lists that become her only glimmer of hope. A twist of fate throws her back into the path of Nox as she offers him a strange proposition. Will he accept or will the very thing that draws her to him, tear her apart? Set in a sleepy Australian beach town, Black Ink Heart is a compelling, heart-warming story about choosing when to hold on and when to let go.",
