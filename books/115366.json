  "description": "Mystery, intrigue and romantic suspense from Mount Desert Island to Portland in Maine! He is a former army officer (Vietnam War) who enjoys early morning drives on the coast near Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. One cold late winter morning he stops to assist a stranded motorist. In return for his kindness, the woman motorist invites him to have lunch with her in Portland and he reluctantly agrees to make the trip and thus begins a journey for him in which thoughts and feelings he thought were long dead are rekindled as the relationship with the intriguing Adriana Barrows grows. She is a woman with a shrowded background who is at once everything she seems and considerably more. As their relationship develops, he finds himself unwillingly and unexpectedly drawn into an unexpected encounter with an international drug trafficker from her past that have reappeared. Perhaps a more prudent man would take the opportunity to stay clear of this woman, but he cannot. Their relationship deepens as they both represent things missing from each other's lives; things they want; things they need. Any age difference that exists is wiped aside by the depth of their background experiences.Many years before on the battlefields of the Vietnam War, he learned a solid truth, that often when things seem too good to be true, they usually are. Now he relearns that harsh lesson as he descends into The Mists of Adriana.",
