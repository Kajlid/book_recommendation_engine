  "title": "Utopia",
  "description": "The author of a book in the early 16th century describing a fictional, idealized island society, Sir Thomas More was destined to occupy a significant place in the literary canon with his work Utopia, yet it is also his association with the infamous English king Henry VIII and his untimely political death at the monarch’s behest that has ensured More’s posthumous fame. A martyr for his belief in the supremacy of the Pope and the Catholic church, More was canonized in 1935 as Saint Thomas More, while Utopia’s controversial contents – like an early form of socialism – continue to spark discussion.",
