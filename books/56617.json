  "description": "On Sunday the public paid half a crown to view Ornum House's three hundred rooms, its exceptional display of fine china, its authentic Holbein, its dank dungeon complete with suits of armour and a dead body. With 'Burke's Peerage' tucked under one arm and a dictionary under the other, Detective Inspector C,D, Sloan tiptoes through the halls of the aristocracy. His impeccable powers of observation might reveal who murdered the family archivist, but the family ghost walks through these same corridors. So someone else is going to die.",
