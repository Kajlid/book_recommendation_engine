  "description": "In the most explosive Wolves of Icaria book to date, the Icarian pack is under fire from all quarters. The vicious Russians are looking for revenge, and a powerful alpha is visiting the island with a mind to claiming his runaway virgin bride. Angry and hurt, bratty young whelp Kent has been nursing wounds of rejection ever since the crushing discovery of his father's identity. He's always been trouble but as he lashes out against the hierarchy, Kent's defiance pushes alpha Stavros Laksaris to the very limits. Pack order must be maintained, and if Kent can't find a way to accept his alpha's authority, he's going to have to learn some very painful lessons. Stavros' ability to tame misbehaved whelps has never been in doubt, but as pressure from the Russians increases, not everything is as it seems. Kent's latest rebellion might just have more bite than anyone anticipated. Will the power of Stavros' love be enough to rein in the whelp with the dark lineage? Or will Kent's pain ultimately be the source of his destruction?",
