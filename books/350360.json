  "description": "Sara Bickford finds herself the target of an obsessed cartel boss's son, who believes she is the daughter of a woman he raped seventeen years ago-and so his child. Stopping short of nothing to claim Sara as his daughter, Trent Barkley, with the aid of his self-serving stepchildren, Marcus and Inga, kidnap Sara from her family's summer home in Maine and smuggle her back to his mansion in the Canary Islands. But Trent's plans turn to disaster when he is hunted down by a rival cartel boss and tracked by the FBI. With little time to spare, Sara must somehow escape the impenetrable fortress under the watchful eyes of Trent and his bodyguards before she, too, becomes the target in a deadly game of power. Author Author Launa McNeilly enjoys the writings of Stephen King, Anne Rice, and Jackie Collins. Lies, in a Season of Tribulation is her first novel. She and her husband, Marc, have nine children and live with their two youngest daughters, Maggie and Ashley, in Owl's Head, Maine.",
