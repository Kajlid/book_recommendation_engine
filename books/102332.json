  "title": "The Dream Taker",
  "description": "Every bit of information whether it is artificial or not, good or bad. Silly or Smart. Is placed into a box. And it grows on its own. And it becomes the reality of what it should be in order to create harmony. Spitting out the junk and illusions, and that is the true new age. Come play with me inside my realm. Where I shall make you think of things much differently, than you do now.",
