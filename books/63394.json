  "description": "Best friends Stephen and Marco attempt a go-for-broke heist to break into the high school prom and get Marco onstage to confess his love for (and hopefully steal the heart of) Benji, the adorable exchange student and bass player of the prom band. Of course, things don't always go according to plan, and every heist comes with its fair share of hijinks. Marco Impossible by Hannah Moskowitz is a fun middle-grade book by the author of young adult novels like Not Otherwise Specified, A History of Glitter and Blood, and many others. “Moskowitz ( Gone, Gone, Gone , 2012, etc.) again explores the experiences of a gay teen, in this humorous take on a teenage rite of passage--the prom--but with a twist.” - Kirkus Reviews “The boy gets the boy and the school bully gets it square in the nose.” - School Library Journal \"But those looking for an observant take on a growing, bending relationship will soon be bopping their heads to this idiosyncratic tune.\" - Booklist",
