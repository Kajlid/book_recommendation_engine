  "title": "Unemployed Kat: Adulting is Hard",
  "description": "This compilation of personal essays and blog posts covers a decade of one woman's journey into adulthood. From the unexpectedly fruitful post-college job hunt through messy hookups to broken engagements, Unemployed Kat navigates life as an urban-dwelling young adult with a keen eye for detail and a sharp sense of wit. She'll whine like 'Sex and the City's' Carrie Bradshaw and bare her soul like Lena Dunham's character Hannah in 'Girls'. Unemployed Kat should be required reading for anyone who wants to better understand (and learn from!) today's millennial angst.",
