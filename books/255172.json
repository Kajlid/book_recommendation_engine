  "description": "On the third day of the harvest month, Clara Vedette was born. Again.  Eighteen years trapped in a village is enough to drive anyone crazy, so when a way out appears in the wall, Clara leaps at the chance to leave.  But her joy quickly diminishes, for outside the wall’s protection, the hunters seeking her life can sense her, and an ancient, sinister plot emerges – a plot that’s killed her six times, and now, only one chance remains.  To save those she loves and gain her freedom, Clara must face the darkest magic and find the courage to do what she fears most.",
