She was tone, tan, and sweet as pie. I should’ve known I’d end up breaking her heart.Still, against my better judgement I took her giving us both the best night of our lives. When I woke up the next morning she was gone, not a trace of what had happened between us, and I realized then I broke my number one rule: Always use a condom.Two months later I get a text telling me I’m going to be a father. I feel a number of emotions, elation, fear, excitement, anger, but then she drops the biggest bomb on me. She says she doesn’t need me or want me. Now I’ve got to do whatever I can to keep us from falling apart. She doesn’t think I want the baby or can be a good father, while she’s about to find out just the kind of man I am.",
