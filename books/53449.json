  "description": "“. . . it is clear that while science provides insights into the complexity of the world around us, those insights . .. present a fractured mosaic rather than a seamless whole. There are profound limits to science that must be recognized if we are to minimize the destructive consequences of using the powers provided by scientific discovery.”What effect will deforestation, particularly in the rain forests of Brazil, have on the environment? How is acid rain transforming ecosystems? Can we count on science to solve the problems of overcrowding, species extinction and global pollution? Are scientists selling us out to the military and big business? Can we tolerate more Professor Rushtons? Is science being used to promote racism? Is our education system meeting the challenge? What should we be asking of our educators?David Suzuki tackles these issues and more, in this his first collection of critical essays.Here is Suzuki at his incisive best: exploring the limits of knowledge and the connectedness of things. Those links that bind us all to nature.Suzuki writes clearly and vigorously with a keen-witted love of argument. And above all with a candour that is both disarming and challenging.",
