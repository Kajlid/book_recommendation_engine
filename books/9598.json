  "description": "For three years, Alexandria has lived among mortals pretending to be like them and trying to forget the duty she'd been trained to fulfill as a child of a mortal and a demigod. At 17, she's pretty much accepted that she's a freak by mortal standardsâ€¦ and that she'll never be prepared for that duty. But as every descendant of the gods knows, Fate has a way of rearing her ugly head. A horrifying attack forces Alex to flee Miami and try to find her way back to the very place her mother had warned her she should never return - the Covenant.",
