Alternating between St. Louis and San Francisco, past and present, we meet Caroline at the precipice of adulthood, struggling to overcome the loss of her mother to cancer. As a consuming new friendship takes hold of her heart, Kraus navigates her first job, a house full of roommates, and her own rapid unraveling. Told with wry humor and insight, the author's journey offers a portal into universal territories of heart and mind, across the fissures and fault lines of attachment, grief and self-discovery.",
