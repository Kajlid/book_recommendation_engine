  "description": "Eileen placed the crown back in its place in the cedar chest. There was another layer of red velvet cloth to uncover more treasures. The children were about to pull it back when they felt a dark shadow fall over them. Michael looked up. Their grandmother was staring at them. On her face, was a furious mask of anger, her eyes were like little slits and her breathing was raspy. She was reaching out her arm to snatch them up off the floor. They ducked from her reach and ran towards the stairs to the main room in the house. They heard their mother coming back from town and ran into her arms. Grandmother raced down the stairs, demanding that her ungrateful daughter with her spoiled children leave her home immediately and to never return. The mother looked at the children in shock, looked at her mother, raised her hands to the sky and said, â€œWhat now? We have no place to go. This and many other experiences prepare Michael and Eileen to be strong when the time came to fight Satan and his evil henchmen.",
