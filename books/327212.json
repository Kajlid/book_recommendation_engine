  "description": "Ever proposed marriage on a first date?To a guy you first met covered in whipped cream?(I haven't even mentioned the bit where he won our date at an auction)There's no ring in my pocket, but I really hope he says yes.Not because I'm in love with him—that would be ridiculous.He needs to impress my father and I need access to my trust fund. That's all our union will be about.For three months, I've just got to ignore the rock-hard muscles I felt when I ran into him, the look in his eye that tells me he tastes as good as he looks, and the chemistry that sizzles between us whenever we're together.Easy. Right?A feel-good, fake marriage, standalone in the mister series.For Beck and Stella’s story – read Mr. MayfairFor Dexter and Hollie's story - read Mr. KnightsbridgeFor Gabriel and Autumn's story - read Mr. SmithfieldFor Joshua and Hartford's story - read Mr. Park LaneFor Andrew and Sofia’s story – read Mr. BloomsburyFor Tristan and Parker’s story – read Mr. Notting Hill",
