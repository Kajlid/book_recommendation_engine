  "description": "My dreams of attending Juilliard shattered the night tragedy struck my family. That night, a part of me died inside.Now, the only peace I find is in stolen moments on a rooftop where I dance to remember as much as to forget.Until I literally stumble headfirst into Levi’s life. He’s six feet two inches of ripped, hard, gorgeous temptation wrapped in a very irritating package. I swear he was sent to test me, because his hot-and-cold attitude pushes my buttons like no guy has before.I don’t know at what point I fall, but he worms his way into my heart without me noticing. One moment we are trading insults, the next we’re shedding our clothes and surrendering to the searing-hot chemistry smoldering between us.He breathes life into me again. Before tearing me apart when I discover it’s all been a lie.He says he kept his identity a secret for my protection.Yet I’m all alone when his enemies come for me.",
