  "description": "Boy meets girl. Boy falls for girl. Boy marries girl. And they both live happily ever after. Right?Not quite.I fell for the boy. So slowly I barely noticed, then all at once. I loved my best friend with my entire heart, letting him fill up the holes my family had dug. But boys don’t fall for other boys. Just ask him. So my story turned into boy meets boy. Boy falls for boy. Boy gets rejected. Boy meets girl. Boy meets boy. Boy loses them over and over and over again. Pretty twisted, right?My life story was really just a screwed up love story. A search for the one person that understood the darkness inside me. The monster I’d become. But sometimes the holes are too deep and far too bloody, for anyone—boy or girl—to fill.",
