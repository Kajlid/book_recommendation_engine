  "description": "My name is Alexia Williams. In my world, North America is divided between north and south but not the way it's taught in the history books. After losing my family to the shifters, I joined the Combined Human States Army. Now I find myself on the front lines, defending the wall between my species and theirs. My mission is simple: keep the animals on their side by whatever means necessary and I'm good at it.I don't talk to them. I don't sympathize with them. I sure as hell don't admire them until one saves my life. Andor isn't like any shifter I've ever met. He's a three-hundred-year-old golden eagle asking for help finding missing shifters who may be in my lands. I just have to decide between helping the animals or ignoring signs that my fellow humans aren't what I thought they were. But how can I help a species I hate and fear? Even if Andor makes me feel alive again? In the land of the shifters they call me Death.",
