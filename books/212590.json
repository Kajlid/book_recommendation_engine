  "description": "BDSM erotica. Author of As She's Told, winner of the National Leather Association, 2008 Pauline Reage Novel Award.Etrin does whatever she must to be sent to the planet Henth, a society of men where women are rare, exotic pets. But the lucky men who can afford them know what they are getting: eager submissives, willing to accept animal status to achieve the relationships they crave.Once Etrin's eyes are caught by Garid as he bids on her, there is no going back. But no matter how willingly Etrin submits, she must struggle hard to accept Garid's unrelenting control, and her new and humiliating condition. She is not allowed to speak or to learn his language. She is used as a pony, caged and punished - but the hardest adjustment of all is the chastity belt, and the discovery that teasing and denial are her master's right and pleasure.As Garid moves his slave toward absolute surrender, he joins the company of other owners, all of whom have their own ideas on how to enjoy the women in their possession.Graphic sexual content.",
