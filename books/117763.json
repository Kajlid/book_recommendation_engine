  "description": "All Tom's friends really are superheroes. Tom even married a superhero, the Perfectionist. But at their wedding the Perfectionist is hypnotized by her ex, Hypno, to believe that Tom is invisible. Nothing he does can make her see him. Six months later the Perfectionist is sure that Tom has abandoned her, so she's moving to Vancouver. She's going to use her superpower to leave all the heartbreak behind. With no idea that Tom is beside her she boards the Tom has until they touch down to convince her he's there, or he loses her forever. A wonderful, heartbreakingly funny tribute to love, sweet love. 'A work of adorable genius. Buy it, borrow it, steal it but just make sure you read it.' Scott Pack 'An adorable book.' Toby Litt 'The funniest, quirkiest romance of the year.' Marie Phillips 'One of the saddest, funniest, strangest, and most romantic books ... Brilliant!' The Bookseller",
