  "description": "Tikva Wolf has witnessed love transcend and evolve beyond the rigid, traditionalist trappings of the fairy-tale romance. Love, Retold is a meditation on love and companionship for people who don't remember feudalism. Each chapter explores Wolf's experiences with loved ones—Wolf's lovers and their lovers. The stories capture key moments in these relationships, and they reflect on the murkier, tenebrous aspects of love, especially—but not exclusively—the non-monogamous kind. These stories illuminate and revere uncertainty, confronting the realities of mismatched needs and desires with compassion and self-reflection. In a world obsessed with beginnings and endings, this is a book about middles.",
