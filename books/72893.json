  "title": "Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea",
  "description": "A major historical account of the Korean War, its origins, and its evolving impact on the world.Sixty years after North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea, the Korean War has not yet ended. Sheila Miyoshi Jager presents the first comprehensive history of this long-misunderstood war, one that risks involving the world’s superpowers—again. Her sweeping narrative ranges from the middle of World War II, when Korean independence was fiercely debated between Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill, to the present day, as North Korea, with China’s aid, stockpiles nuclear weapons while starving its people. Drawing on newly accessible diplomatic archives and reports from South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Jager not only analyzes top-level military strategy but also depicts the on-the-ground atrocities committed by both sides that have never before been revealed.The most accessible, up-to-date, and balanced account yet written, rich with maps and illustrations, Brothers at War will become the definitive chronicle of the struggle’s origins, aftermath, and global impact for years to come.",
