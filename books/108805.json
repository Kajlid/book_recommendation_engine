  "description": "The Riptide was a very dangerous place to surf. Anyone who tried it was either an idiot or a fool. Josh Wentworth and his good friend Robby, could not believe it when their daredevil friend Billy, dared to take the risk, and was sadly swept out to sea. Josh blames himself for Billy’s untimely demise, and soon finds a way to ease his guilt. Coming across a book on the occult; Josh, Robby, and their friend Corrie, try to resurrect. To their astonishment, they think succeed!Mysterious deaths in the neighborhood lead them to believe Billy has returned to the living for a watery revenge … or has he? Corrie and Josh realized what they had possibly done to Billy was wrong … as once spirits are summoned, they are very hard to banish; it takes much more magical powers to return the spirit to a body. Corrie learns resurrection goes against the laws of Nature, which only brings torment to friends and family members. Can they save their town from more horrible murders? When someone dies, you must leave their spirit alone.",
