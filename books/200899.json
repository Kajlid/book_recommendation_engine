  "description": "My name is Faith Keystone, but my friends call me Keys. I’m the piano player for Hammered. Did I mention I'm the only female in my band? That means I technically have five older brothers.  Can't forget my manager and security team, too. Alone time is nonexistent. I escaped an overbearing family to join this happy circus, and most of the time it's awesome. Except now, because of one teensy little incident at a show. Now I have this hulking bodyguard shadowing me like a freaking puppy. Only this puppy is more like a Doberman with an attitude problem. And he only knows one word NO. I hate that word. And I hate Quinn Alexander. The one thing I do like is giving him the slip. Is it wrong that I kinda like when he growls at me after he finds me? Because he always finds me.   Worst of all? I want him so bad that I keep forgetting I hate him.",
