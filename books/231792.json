A stranger dupes Connie into thinking their chance meeting was all by happenstance and leads to romance and the final realization that she may be in love with a murderer. Connie’s life begins with first love, death, murder, romance and the outcome of circumstances of her dead husband’s hidden past. Rosie Redmond, a co-worker, adds a comic interlude to the story as everyone tries to ascertain the workings of her mind. This topsy-turvy love-hate encounter keeps readers engaged with every turn of the page.",
