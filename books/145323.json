  "description": "He’s a better fighter\n A fighter to the core, Hudson Reyes has collected enough battle scars now to last several lifetimes. But after his combat injuries retire him from the military life he wasn’t ready to give up, Hudson finds himself spending the carbon copy days of his new career as a Hollywood fight scene and weapons specialist just doing what he knows best: surviving. Until he meets her. The one woman who makes him want to live again. With wounds as deep as his own, she’s a scrappy little thing—an angel-faced paradox that comes as a package deal with an offbeat town of admirably protective, but downright nosy folks.And a wicked roundhouse kick that’s become intimately familiar with his head. \n...but she has all the weapons.\n An antique arms authenticator by day and a self-defense instructor by night, Liana Lin has made a living turning the unthinkable demons of her past into the passions that fuel, and fill, her life. So when the unjustly handsome man she’s been unable to stop thinking about literally takes her to the mat with martial arts styles unlike anything she’s ever seen—pinning her with a molten hot stare that melts her like a marshmallow trapped between a graham cracker and a chocolate square—Lia flips into no-holds-barred fight mode. Because if one man could find a way to disarm her carefully-built defenses, it’d be him. Now if only they could stop sparring long enough to find out...THE CACTUS CREEK SERIESBook 1: Love, Chocolate, and BeerBook 2: Love, Diamonds, and SpadesBook 3: Love, Tussles, and TakedownsBook 4: Love, Exes, and Ohs",
