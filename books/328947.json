  "description": "Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has constantly been praised for her intense, dramatic suspense, breathing real life and trouble into her action-packed thrillers. Her fourteen years in law enforcement have always given her novels great authenticity, often pulling inspiration from the very cases she has worked. Now comes The Cheater. \n\nReturning to her most beloved character, Lily Forrester, from the New York Times bestsellers Mitigating Circumstances and Buried Evidence, Rosenberg proves once again that she is a master of the suspense thriller, as Forrester finds herself in yet another mix of bizarre circumstances that lead her onto the trail of a vicious criminal mind. Along the way we meet: \n\nFBI Agent Mary Stevensâ€”She is tracking a killer who murders husbands who are cheating on their wives, their mutilated bodies disposed of in ghastly ways and strange locations. \n \nBryce Forresterâ€”Lilyâ€™s husbandâ€”calls her from a Las Vegas jail where heâ€™s been arrested for attempted rapeâ€¦even though Las Vegas was not on his itinerary. \n \nAnne Bradleyâ€”Bryceâ€™s accuser, like Lily, is a woman with an eerie pastâ€¦an enigmatic figure to whom Lily is strangely drawn. \n\nThe trail leads back to a Web service that provides alibis for cheating spouses and into a thick web of deception that puts both Lilyâ€™s and Maryâ€™s lives in jeopardy. Do you know where your husband is?",
