  "title": "Two Tyrants",
  "description": "Despite growing voter dissatisfaction, the Republican and Democratic parties maintain complete dominance over the American political realm. A majority of voters now identify as independents, yet the traditional powers continue to win every election. An exclusionary election system and a relentless propaganda campaign have resulted in an entitled and inept political class.  Nevertheless, we have the power to dethrone our two political monarchs. The goal is not destruction of either party, but reform of the system that allows them to rule without consequence. Two Tyrants is a passionate narrative on the cause and effect of two-party rule, and an invitation to take the first step toward a new political reality. It is required reading for the coming voter uprising in America.",
