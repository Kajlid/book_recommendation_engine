His resolve is tested when Allison comes on tour with Runaway Train, as both Jake and Abby’s nanny and to fulfill her fashion design internship. The more time he spends with her in the close quarters of the bus, the harder it is for him to resist.Will Rhys realize that having a relationship with Allison is worth fighting for even if it means that he has to fight his best friend for a chance?",
