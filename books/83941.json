While navigating through physical, mental, and spiritual realms, Riggs discovers a most peculiar book, which drives his quest to the farthest reaches of the universe. There, despite the efforts of power-hungry scoundrels, eccentric philosophers, insatiable spirits, and creepy old men, Riggs must deliver the book into the hands of the one person in the cosmos who wants absolutely nothing to do with it! At once classic and innovative, this whirlwind fantasy is rich in myth, magic, and humor, underpinned by profound mathematical, psychological, and philosophical truths.",
