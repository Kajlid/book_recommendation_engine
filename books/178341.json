  "title": "Blasted By Adversity: The Making of a Wounded Warrior",
  "description": "Blasted by Adversity: the Making of a Wounded Warrior documents the incredible ascendance of an Army infantryman who survived an IED blast, amputating his right leg and severing his left, and emerged as a key public advocate for wounded veterans. Luke Murphy's injury was the beginning of a remarkable journey that took him from hopelessness in a hospital room to skiing black diamonds in Aspen, catching tuna on Jimmy Buffetâ€™s boat and speaking to thousands at the Pentagon. The book gives voice to a new generation of wounded service members.",
