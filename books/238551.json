  "description": "Gods aren't meant to fall in love.  A long time ago, Manann√°n mac Lir made a promise. The god of the sea never breaks his word, but protecting Sloane Nelson from himself was never supposed to be an issue.  Sloane Nelson doesn't know her real father is a vampire, or that her soul was first born over a millennia ago and has been fought over ever since. She has no idea that Mac, her teenage crush, is anything more than the overbearing, tantalizing and exasperating man he's been since they first met.  But when Sloane makes a decision to relocate permanently to the Isle of Man, Mac's home and her favorite childhood vacation spot, neither of them can foresee what the fates have in store. Can they survive together, or will their worlds be ripped apart forever?  LIGHTNING In SEA brings to a stunning conclusion the dark and explosive storylines of BLOOD In FIRE and SMOKE In MOONLIGHT.",
