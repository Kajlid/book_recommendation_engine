  "description": "Blind dating: the act in which you date a stranger and hope it’s not the kid you once babysat. And try not to freak out when it’s your one-night stand from two weeks ago.As the last woman standing, I, Piper Carter, am officially a loner.Apparently, that means it’s time for me to get out there and find myself a man. My protestations that I have no time for it falls on deaf ears and the next thing I know, I’m on a blind date with someone my best friends assure me will be perfect for me.Maverick Donovan, the guy I, uh, know very, very well…After one conversation that makes my disdain for this setup very clear, the superstar playboy author asks me for only one thing: my help with his research for his next novel.Turns out, the heroine in his next hot romance is the owner of a bakery, but all his ill-fated efforts are baking is the batteries in his fire alarm.I agree. I’ll create some recipes for his leading lady, and he’ll credit me and my store, giving me the recognition I need to help me on my way to franchising.If only we didn’t have to spend almost every free waking moment together to make it happen.I don’t want to give my heart to the guy with a trail of broken ones behind him, but there’s a fundamental problem with that plan.I’m pretty sure I’m doing just that…",
