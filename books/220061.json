  "title": "The Band: Freshman Year",
  "description": "Five friends start a band in college. Through procrastination and off-beat romances, the band faces challenges that often have little to do with their music. From road trips gone wrong to hosting a dating game show at the mall, Alex, Danny, Jerry, Enrique and Mitch face their first year of college together as The Band. Read like a sitcom, every episode is packed with funny dialogue and moving plots, each leading to the next one.",
