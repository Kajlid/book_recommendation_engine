But when Libby was swept back to medieval England, she met the one man who could make her ignore it. Bastien of Bale, an outlaw as stunningly handsome as he was dangerous, unleashed in Libby a primeval passion that was like none she had ever known... and was yet somehow hauntingly, achingly, familiar.",
