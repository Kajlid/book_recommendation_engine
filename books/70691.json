  "description": "Her husband left her for another man. Her boyfriend may be cheating. Her mother’s got a secret. Is everyone having great sex but Rachel? Lately, stand-up comic Rachel Katz’s life has begun to resemble a not-so-funny comedy routine - the kind where nobody laughs and everybody inches toward the door. It began when her husband cheated... with another man. Now she’s raising a ten-year-old son who’s fixated on Barbra Streisand and wondering if her dentist boyfriend - who won’t stop flossing long enough to make love to her - is having an affair. Enter Matt Clapton, a wickedly sexy washing machine repairman who likes Rachel’s jokes and makes her feel like a woman for the first time in ages - maybe in her entire life. With her mother busy planning a wedding Rachel isn’t sure she wants, her son dead set on inviting Barbra to the reception, and the groom-to-be in South Africa, working on someone else’s oral hygiene, the question is: What’s she going to do about it? Especially when fame and fortune beckon in a comedy contest that could put her on the map... and change her life forever. Spin Cycle tells a wickedly funny, shamelessly erotic story of lovers and liars, exes and children, parents and other strangers. This hip and hilarious new novel by the acclaimed author of Neurotica introduces a heroine who never loses her sense of humour and who discovers, somewhere between the rinse and spin cycles, that love - and laughter - can truly conquer all.",
