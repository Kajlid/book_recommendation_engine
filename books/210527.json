  "description": "Kyle Four long excruciating months have dragged by with still no clue as to where my sister is. Four months of pure and utter hell that I’ve searched the entire city trying to bring her back to me. Help isn’t something I’m used to asking for, but maybe just this once ill have to make an exception. However an over animated computer geek is NOT what I had in mind, but his talent with any and every piece of technology might just be the one thing I need. So it’s perfectly fine to let him flirt with me, no harm no foul. It’s not like I flirt back or that I like him at all for that matter, honestly the guy irritates me beyond measure. Yeah, that’s what I’ll keep telling myself. Mac Being an openly gay man is something I pride myself in, so falling for a guy that prefers his partners with long legs, perky breasts, and a V in between their legs is not my idea of a “good time”. So why can’t I get him out of my head? Why can’t I ignore the fact that he not only gets me harder than a steel rod, but he makes my heart literally skip from just a look? I should be focusing on finding his sister but for some reason every time his gruff growl of a voice passes by my ear, my mind goes south (literally). Kyle Reed isn’t the guy for me. Or is he?  This story takes you back in time four years before your favorite gay Stripped Bare series couple ever met. Giving you another insight on not only Kyle and Mac’s story but the entire gang’s life’s as well. This book is an M/M prequel to the SB series and is not only shorter than the others but is also left with a cliff hanger.",
