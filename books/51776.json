  "description": "From the critically acclaimed, and sometime damned Author, Gordon G. G. Gebert, comes his third book, \"ROCK & ROLL WAR STORIES\" which you now hold in your precious hands. You will never listen to your favorite band again without thinking of these twisted stories. Musician turned Author, Gordon G. G. Gebert, has done it again. He will take us past the \"velvet rope\" at warp speed, pinned with a plethora of all-access passes (that would make Wayne and Garth envious), into the utter chaos and mayhem of rock and roll with an uproarious collection of TRUE stories on the road, in the studio, and everywhere else in between. No one will stop you as you will be dragged through the bowels of hell and back whether you like it or not. Gordon, along with Philadelphia’s premiere rock journalist, Lynn Ramage, takes you on an insane rock and roll trip that will keep you reading as if you’ve just seen a train wreck. Gebert’s previous smash hit books, KISS & Tell and KISS & Tell MORE!, sent the actual members of KISS and die-hard KISS fans reeling when Gebert revealed \"the man behind the curtain\" in his candid expose’ of Ace Frehley and KISS. One thing critics and fans all agree upon is that KISS & Tell and KISS & Tell MORE are ENTERTAINING MUST-READS! One way or another, by the end of this tour you’ll know what it takes to be a REAL rock and roll war veteran. It’s as close as you’ll ever get to being part of the entourage. Read it! Live it! Rock on!",
