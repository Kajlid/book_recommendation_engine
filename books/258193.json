  "description": "I don’t like to think of myself as broken, and maybe I’m not. Maybe I’m just…hollowed out. A shell of who I used to be, thanks to my abusive ex.It’s hard being a romance author when you no longer believe in love.Then one lonely night, I meet the mysterious military man whose scars go deeper than his skin. He’s gorgeous and enigmatic, and the pain in his eyes calls to my own. For a few blissful hours, we hold each other. He makes me feel that I’m worthy of something more than solitude and secret anguish.When he shows up in my life months later, I know it can’t be coincidence. The connection between us tugs at my soul, and I can’t resist his allure.I thought I no longer believed in soul mates, but this damaged man could be my happily-ever-after.",
