  "description": "Winner, T. R. Fehrenbach Book Award, Texas Historical CommissionSummerfield G. Roberts Award, Sons of the Republic of TexasHonorable Mention, Certificate of Commendation, American Association for State and Local History Hardly were the last shots fired at the Alamo before the Texas Revolution entered the realm of myth and controversy. French visitor Frederic Gaillardet called it a \"Texian Iliad\" in 1839, while American Theodore Sedgwick pronounced the war and its resulting legends \"almost burlesque.\" In this highly readable history, Stephen L. Hardin discovers more than a little truth in both of those views. Drawing on many original Texan and Mexican sources and on-site inspections of almost every battlefield, he offers the first complete military history of the Revolution. From the war's opening in the \"Come and Take It\" incident at Gonzales to the capture of General Santa Anna at San Jacinto, Hardin clearly describes the strategy and tactics of each side. His research yields new knowledge of the actions of famous Texan and Mexican leaders, as well as fascinating descriptions of battle and camp life from the ordinary soldier's point of view. This award-winning book belongs on the bookshelf of everyone interested in Texas or military history.",
