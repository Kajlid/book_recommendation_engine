  "description": "“Something good” is exactly what Tyya, Andrew and Julie want to put into their shopping cart. Tyya’s dad won’t buy anything good at the store—no ice cream, no candy, no cookies. But when Daddy gets fed up and tells Tyva to \"Stand here and Don't Move!\" Tyva knows she's in big trouble... and that's when the story becomes Munsch's own, witty and warm.",
