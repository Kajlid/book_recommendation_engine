  "description": "A brand new block of flats in the centre of the city, a luxury residence, or so the new inhabitants think. But these flats have a secret and they are not so new after all, just refurbished and modernised. What were they before? A dark past hides in the brickwork, waiting to be discovered. It seems that perhaps all the previous residents have not yet left the premises. Something else lives there too. Something much darker, awoken by a storm. The pioneer first residents, are in for the rides of their lives, or deaths. Dare you enter the darkness within?",
