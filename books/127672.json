  "description": "There is one thing in the last twenty two years that I need more than anything. Some would say it’s to be normal, others would say that it’s to be loved but they would be wrong on all counts. There is one thing above all others that I need more than anything. I need to be wanted.  What do you do though when you are given the very thing you need and it’s given to you in a package that might not be the most pure? For the last year I have been loved and accepted for who and what I truly am and despite making some bad choices I am still inherently guided by the light. Things have changed. Where I’ve ended up, the light isn’t allowed and my desire to be wanted is being given to me but not in the package I expected it to be. I just can’t turn away from it, no matter how wrong it is and to be honest I’m not even sure I would want to even if I could. Even if it means the end of the world…",
