  "description": "A beautiful collaboration based on a true story.Jennifer Uman and Valerio Vidali discovered a mutual interest in this story and overcame language obstacles with the help of translators. Jemmy Button, a native of Tierra del Fuego, was brought to England in the mid-1800s to be \"educated and civilized.\" The book illustrates Jemmyâ€™s adventures in England, his extraordinary encounters, his homesickness and experiences as an outsider in a strange land, and his return home.",
