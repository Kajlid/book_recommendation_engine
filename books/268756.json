  "description": "Pediatric surgeon Harlan Allred’s life hasn’t been the same since Stacy Montgomery was rolled into the Emergency Room after a horrific car accident on a rainy night in downtown Seattle. Now, four years later, a sudden and mysterious illness has inflicted her and more of his patients, and Harlan has no idea how he and his team can heal them before time runs out. Just a few miles away, baseball superstar Luke Masterson carries out his plot to cause pain the likes of which the people of Seattle have never seen. As he closes in on his goal he disappears, sending Harlan and the rest of the baseball world into a state of confusion. Where would he go on what should have been the night of his greatest baseball triumph? With little to go on, Harlan races to find a cure and save the children who still have so much life left to live.",
