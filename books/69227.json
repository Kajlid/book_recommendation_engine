  "description": "Phil Roland is sure his dad’s death wasn’t an accident. Thousands of adults had hated him for designing a popular, but controversial, first-person shooter. Thousands of kids had hated him because he’d walked away with the rights to the game, before a sequel could be made. Now Phil’s got a plan to prove Dad didn’t just fall down a set of stairs. But getting that proof means getting in at Motive Games, getting Dad’s eccentric detective friend to help him investigate, and getting past his own grief. In this fast-paced thriller, real-world technology collides head on with real-life dilemmas. The result is a high-tech murder mystery with heart, soul… and ultimately, hope.",
