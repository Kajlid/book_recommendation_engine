  "description": "Tess has never known a life away from the pack of werewolves she's kin to. When she's informed by the Alpha of the pack that he's arranged her marriage to his Beta, she resists the animal attraction she feels for the man and rebels. Making her own way by running to the city, she discovers that the outside world is filled with both pleasures and perils, including kind strangers, an enraged fiance and a rival pack willing to resort to force to make her their own.This novelette has over 9,000 words of romantic and erotic tension between a young woman desperate to live her own life and the werewolf who wants to claim her for his own. With elements of forced marriage, coercion, kidnapping, and sexual threatening, it is not for the faint of heart but the resolution is guaranteed to curl toes!",
