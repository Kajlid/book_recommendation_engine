  "title": "Christmas with Tucker",
  "description": "It's 1962 and as Christmas approaches, so does one of the worst snow and ice storms in Kansas history. Without utilities and emergency services, it's a dangerous time for the residents of Cherokee County, but for the McCray family, it's even worse. Big Bo McCray and his wife Cora have recently lost their only son, John, and now John's wife and two daughters have moved off the McCray family farm and back to Minnesota, leaving twelve-year-old George McCray behind with his grandparents. His father's death has hit George hard and the farm is all that seems to connect him with his father. As George retreats, Bo and Cora's focus shifts to their struggling grandson. And when Tucker, an Irish Setter, needs a temporary home, the grief-stricken family takes him in. Tucker comes to the family with his own pain but soon learns to trust George as boy and dog form a bond that helps George heal and take his first steps into manhood.",
