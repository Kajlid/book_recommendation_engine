The club is in danger of collapsing, and his woman has left with his son. With blood staining his hands, and demons haunting his nightmare he finds his hardest battle is with himself. As the daughter of the Vice President, Cora entered her relationship with Dallas with eyes open. The sacrifices made always paled in comparison to the love and happiness she received. But things change and everyone has a limit of how much they can take. Close to breaking down, and lost in the maelstrom of the broken man she’s committed her life to, she’s forced to pull away to remain sane. Together they will conquer the ghosts of the past and face the future as one, or go their separate ways.",
