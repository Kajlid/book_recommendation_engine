  "description": "Best friends, Emma and Georgie, find that small town life is anything but boring as they embark on a funny, sexy and perilous roller coaster ride of an adventure they had no idea they were boarding until it was too late. It certainly wasn’t what they had in mind when they decided to leave the big city. Emma’s soon to be ex-husband is a cheater. Georgie’s boy friend is immature and commitment phobic. Knowing it is time to make some changes, they leave their failed romances behind them, in Denver, and head north to Scottsbluff, Nebraska to regroup and get their lives together while running the metaphysical store Emma inherited from her aunt. Instead of peace and quiet, though, they find themselves embroiled in a treacherous mystery involving an ancient, mystical ring, while fighting for their lives against a homicidal maniac who is determined to get his hands on it. Meanwhile, Georgie finds herself falling for yet another bad boy. Moreover, could it be that Emma has come face to face with her soul mate? Join Emma and Georgie as they find that life may not always go the way we expect, yet the unexpected can be sometimes be just what we need.",
