  "description": "This beloved classic is a funny, clever, and original novel that opens with Aladdin - now Emperor of China - trying to decide what to name his new son, a child who won't stop talking and is already far too articulate for his own good. The Genie of the Lamp announces that Abu Ali should be the child's name and that his destiny is to rescue the magician who created the Land of Green Ginger - a sort of fabulous floating garden - and then turned himself into a Button-Nosed Tortoise by mistake. Abu Ali is told he is the only one who can find the peripatetic island, locate the Button-Nosed Tortoise, and reverse the spell. And so begins a series of adventures that invoke a memorable cast of characters, some despicable, some feckless, and some (no surprise) beautiful and feisty.The Land of Green Ginger was first published in 1937, this edition is the 1962 reading by Noel Langley himself at the studios of WBAI.http://fromthevaultradio.org/home/201...The preface to the recording states that Langley cut down the length of the text himself so that it would fit on a single record.",
