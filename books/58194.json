  "description": "In a moment of decision, they will each face the truth of their own heart in God's presence Tom must choose between the beautiful girl he loves and the call of God upon his life. In utter despair and abandonment, Francis finds that Someone is already praying in his own dark Gethsemane. Never again will he need to hide his pain and insecurity behind a jest. When James cannot escape the truth of who he is, waves of shame threaten to engulf him. He pours out his confession and grief to God and rises a newborn child of grace They belonged to another century, yet their struggles are our ownâ€”finding our niche; coping with failure; living with impossible people; and changing when we realize that we are the impossible one. These humble seekers, called to live together in brotherhood, discover in the daily rhythm of their work and worship that the whole of life is a love story about a tender and passionate God. Rich with imagery and emotion, their tales depict love in action, and love given in the most trying of circumstances. Including complete texts of the original books, The Hawk and the Dove , The Wounds of God , and The Long Fall , this trilogy reflects the timeless human drama of learning to love and to accept God's grace.",
