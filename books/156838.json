Acharites are deeply unhappy with their place in the new order and want Zared, son of Rivhak and Magariz, to reclaim their realm. Caelum strongly opposes any resurrection of the troublesome Achar throne and is preparing to fight it when a brutal murder occurs, unleashing mayhem among his family. Chief suspect is Drago SunSoar. Divested of his Icarii powers as a babe, Drago has harboured a life-long resentment of Caelum and yearns to dispossess his brother of his birthright. Caelum's troubles seem overwhelming. then they are completely eclipsed by news of abominable forces from beyond the Star Gate that threaten to wreak destruction on a divided tencendor.",
