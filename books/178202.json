  "description": "Can Gabby Wells Stop a Mass Murderer? In the small, quiet town of Safety Harbor, a disturbed mind was planning the unthinkable and Gabby Wells had to stop him. Rumors were swirling that one of her classmates was planning to commit mass murder during the Fourth of July celebration and she had only hours to find him before he turned the crowded streets into a river of blood. Whether the killer was driven by revenge or anger didnâ€™t matter to her. She had dealt with enough loss in her life already and the idea of watching her friends and family die at his hands shook her to the core. Time was running out and he could be hiding in any one of the thousands of shadows every city tries to ignore. She was willing to risk everything, even her own life, to keep the ones she loved safe. If she failed, more than just bloodshed was at stake. Gabby could very well lose her soul in the process and end up in hell... right next to her murderer.\nScroll up and grab a copy today.",
