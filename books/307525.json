  "title": "Thanksgiving Poems & Prose Pieces",
  "description": "I’d just about finished writing and publishing October Poems at the beginning of November 2020 when my friend and mentor, Nancy Bonnington, announced that during the month of November she would be putting up prompts – word prompts, rather than pictures, this time – to inspire short pieces of writing from the members of her Facebook group. In the event, the prompts all centred around the subject of Thanksgiving in the USA, which was to happen on the 26th November. I rose to the challenge, although as I was rather tired from the effort of writing the October Poems it took me a few days to rest up and get my poetic head back on: which is why the first few pieces I wrote were in prose, rather than poetry. I have included them, however, as they form an integral part of the whole (and are referred back to in at least of the poems which I subsequently wrote).",
