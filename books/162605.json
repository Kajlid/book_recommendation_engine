  "description": "Members of the Crazy Writers Group gather on Tuesday nights in a local watering hole to bemoan their fates as unpublished authors. But a new era is dawning with epublishing. The question is: Will they be selling their literary souls by taking that step? Frustrated as writers and with their jobs and lives, something has to give. But what? A story of misspent youth, literary longing and the choices - both good and bad - we all make in life. The Crazy Writers Group is a wry, painful glimpse into the foibles of human nature.",
