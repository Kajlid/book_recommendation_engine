  "description": "What would you do if your reality suddenly shifted, casting you as the villain in a story you know ends in disaster?This bizarre situation is exactly what befalls Sana, a typical Japanese girl. One moment, she's immersed in a manga she's been reading, and the next, she finds herself transported into its fantastical kingdom. However, the twist is that she is not just any character - she's Anne, the notorious maid who coerces the princess into swapping places with her, a transgression that ultimately leads to her execution.Haunted by the ominous shadow of her impending doom, Sana decides she will not accept the fate that the story has written for her. Instead, she's determined to redefine her destiny. Yet, her attempts are hindered by a magical constraint preventing her from revealing the truth about the body swap. Trust from the princess, the rightful heir to the throne, is hard to come by, unseen foes conspire against her, and to make matters even more complicated, she finds herself irresistibly attracted to the prince's enigmatic bodyguard who doesn't reciprocate her romantic feelings.Will Sana navigate these perilous obstacles and rewrite her destiny, or will she be unable to escape the tragic demise that has been predestined for her?",
