  "title": "Tigger on the Couch: The Neuroses, Psychoses, Disorders and Maladies of Our Favourite Children's Characters",
  "description": "Packed with uproarious yet decidedly accurate case studies, this is a unique look at the mental disorders plaguing our beloved childhood characters. Critical questions concerning a range of classic individuals are all answered, including: Should Tigger have received treatment for hyperactivity? If Beauty had told her therapist about her relationship with the Beast, would she have been diagnosed as co-dependant? and Did Winnie the Pooh have an addictive personality? Each study also looks into how these characters presented ideas of love, life, inner peace, and good mental health to generations of children. So lay back on the big couch and learn all about the traits, diagnoses, and theoretical treatment programs for your favorite friends.",
