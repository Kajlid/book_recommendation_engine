He is torn between his lack of interest in leadership and his desire to help... at least, until one unexpected twist of fate makes his path cross that of Valentine Smythe. His mate.Val didn't expect much of his quiet weekend away. He definitely didn't expect literally running into the most handsome man he'd ever met in his life. The chemistry between them is explosive, and the attraction goes beyond the sexual.Will that be enough to bridge the gap between the two lovers? Will their bond survive the weight of Nate's secret, or will their differences prove to be too much to handle?",
