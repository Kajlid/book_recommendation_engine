  "description": "After a sinister alien race invades a peaceful planet, planning to eat its inhabitants, Jules Rammis has another heroic mission to accomplish. Jules - telepath, astrobiologist and reluctant hero - has faced many nasty aliens in his adventures. But never a race so sinister that it invades the peaceful planet of Denebria specifically to use its people as a food supply. Jules is drawn into the fray when his former father-in-law, retired Counter-Terrorist Captain Joe Hatch, convinces Jules to accompany his undercover team to Denebria. Jules must attempt to discover the invaders' homeworld and allow the World Alliance Forces to engage the brutal race on their own turf. It should be a walk in the park, but the enemy proves to be more resourceful than anyone expected, and Jules and the team find themselves in a fight for their lives. Is Jules powerful enough vanquish the All Mother, or has he met his match? Blood of Denebria is a standalone novel and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read other books in the series.",
