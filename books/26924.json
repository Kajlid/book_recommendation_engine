Relive the girls’ first two summers apart in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and The Second Summer of the Sisterhood, two novels of strength, heartbreak, first love, mothers, and the amazing friends that make all of it bearable. The boxed set will also include an exclusive added value poster.",
