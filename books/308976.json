  "description": "When the Imperial Clan of Novalis is wiped out by a comet strike, a three-way war erupts with the surviving clans forced to choose sides or perish in a deadly, complex web of treachery and violence.Jukon Gomi, sworn to end the thousand-year-old age of emperors, must battle not only the Triad, an organised religion who support the young whore’s bastard Dorion Killstar, but also an ancient underground cult led by witch’s bastard Moshino, who seek to turn Novalis into a land of the dead.As the conflict intensifies, an interconnected array of players come to the fore. Darkon Domo, warrior-priest; Gorn of Mirrors, mercenary; and Lady Crimsonclaw, girl assassin from the House of Silver Spectres, are among those poised to alter the course of history.Above them all looms the immense figure of the merciless imperial enforcer Black Reaper, charged with protecting Killstar and unleashing the Seven Deadly Archangels, a gynoid batallion imbued with dark and mysterious powers from the heart of a holy volcano.But when the storm of screaming skulls subsides, who will emerge to build — or burn — the future?",
