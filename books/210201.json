  "description": "A Secret Baby Sports Romance I’m having that cocky jock’s baby, but he won’t have me.   Gibson Evans is the best college football quarterback in the country. He’s tall, broad, tattooed, and so incredibly handsome.  And he got me pregnant. It was supposed to be just one night, but a broken condom changed all of our plans forever.  People treat him like a hero, but I think he’s a total prick. Gibson gets whatever he wants, and now suddenly he wants me.  But I have enough to deal with. I have to stop daydreaming about his hands between my thighs and concentrate on having this baby while still managing to graduate on time.  He wants to make a deal. If I promise to spend time with him, he’ll help me with my final biology research. That means an entire semester of studying Gibson’s body.  I’m not sure I can do this. One second I can’t stand to be around him, and the next I’m touching his ripped muscles and trying to suppress my excitement.  I’m terrified he’ll ruin everything if I let this become more than just work.  Long is incredibly steamy and features some very dirty language. It’s only recommended for audiences 18+.  Long is a standalone, full-length novel. No cliffhanger. Guaranteed HEA.  **For a limited time, Long includes Smash: A Stepbrother MMA Romance**",
