In John Grogan's memoir, Marley & Me, the world learned how one bad dog became the heart of the family that loved him. Now, in this original picture book, Mommy, Daddy, Cassie, and Baby Louie welcome the puppy Marley to the Grogan family. Marley grows and grows...and grows. His eagerness and energy grow with him, getting him into trouble in a great big way. And, in the end, Marley's over-the-top energy is just what's needed to save the day. Marley is a hit with families and dog lovers everywhere. And Richard Cowdrey's warmly rendered illustrations bring the story of this rambunctious dog to a whole new audience.",
