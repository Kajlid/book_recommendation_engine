  "description": "Growing up if anyone had told me that by the age of twenty-five I’d be crazy about my best friends little sister, I’d have laughed in their face, but the reality is, I am. Of course she’s beautiful with curves in all the right places, but that’s not all there is to her, and after two years of keeping my distance I’m not willing to do that anymore—I can’t do that anymore. The only problem I can see is her big, domineering brother, Reece… I’m eighteen years old, the middle one of five girls, with an older brother who thinks he knows best. He’s about to find out that no one but me knows what’s best for me when I go after his best friend, Donovan. I’m not blind and have seen the looks he’s thrown in my direction for the past couple of years, and I’m sick and tired of waiting for him to make his move—a move he probably won’t make without a push from me. I only hope my brother doesn’t do something stupid and ruin his friendship with him because of me…",
