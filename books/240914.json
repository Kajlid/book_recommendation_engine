  "description": "When darkness aligns and light struggles,When all good things start to wander,Then it will be as foretoldThat Gaia’s war will have begun. In the beginning Gaia brought order to chaos. After creating the Mortal Realm and birthing seven gods, she faded, leaving nothing behind but her blood. Her children lived in peace for a time. But once they shaped the elves and the first prophecy emerged, tensions rose. Thousands of years later war looms over the hearts of many. As the plans of an evil god fall softly into place, Nara of the Dryad’s dreams of adventure lead her into more daring situations than she had expected to face. Kingdoms hang in the balance of her decisions while gods tempt her with a destiny they only hope she will fulfill. With dryads whispering in her ears, Nara is unaware of the events unfolding across the world as many seek out their own roles in the unavoidable war. For even the touch of a dryad and the blessing of gods cannot fully wipe chaos from the realms.",
