  "title": "The Somewhat True Tale Of Robin Hood",
  "description": "Robin Hood and his Merry Men break the fourth wall frequently in this amusing treatment of the mythical figure. This VERY tongue-in-cheek version of the legend pits spoon-wielding Merry Men against the Prince John and his evil sidekick the Sheriff of Nottingham in one silly situation after another. Prince John plans to prevent Robin's do-gooding by capturing Maid Marian and marrying her off to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Will Robin win the day? That depends on if he remembers his bowling shoes.",
