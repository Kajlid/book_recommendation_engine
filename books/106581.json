With Jack still on the loose her parents have her confined to the house leaving Ella to feel like she’s stuck in a prison. Coping with the loss of her best friend and the love of her life, Ella feels trapped in an endless cycle of torment. She feels she’s doomed to lose everyone she loves. In attempt to keep her safe and help her understand her new life her parents decide that what’s best for her is to go back to school, but not just any school. Ella’s not alone though. The school is filled with students who are just like her, including her brother Dean. Her mission is to keep herself blended in the background and out of trouble, but unfortunately Ella isn’t that lucky. With the roommate from hell, her brother constantly breathing down her neck, and being pinned right away as the outcast, Ella wants nothing more than to just crawl under a rock for the rest of her life. Even the school’s sweetheart has it in for her. Can she overcome her fear of the unknown? Will she ever learn to accept who she is? The most important thing Ella is concerned about is just surviving the semester at Hamilton Hill.",
