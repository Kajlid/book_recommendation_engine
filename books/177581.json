  "description": "Peter likes to wear frilly underwear. He can’t understand why people should care about that, but they do. He longs for a man who is willing to accept him, someone who can love him for who he is and not think that he is weak because of what he wears underneath his clothes. But where to find such a man?Alex is managing his sister’s lingerie shop when he sees a man worshipping a pair of panties, and it pisses him off. He wants the man to look at him in the same way he looks at that flimsy lingerie. But why would a proper-looking man ever see him as anything other than a failure? this story contains sex acts between consenting male adults.First published as part of the Love's Landscapes Anthology(DRiTC 2014, MMRomanceGroup)",
