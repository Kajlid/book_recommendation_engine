  "description": "Working as a gay porn star has brought twenty-two-year-old Hunter Storm fame and fortune, but it’s cost him a lot, too. He’s learned to think of his body as little more than a commodity, and he copes with his loneliness by giving himself to whoever will have him. The job has also put him in the crosshairs of a stalker, a man so deeply disturbed that Hunter and everyone around him is in danger.Fortunately, Hunter has allies, including his best friend Christopher and Nana, a feisty senior who’s decided he's family. And then there’s Brian Nolan. When Hunter first meets the angry, wheelchair-bound former Marine, it’s hate at first sight. But despite his shattered body and tattered psyche, Brian might turn out to be the best ally of all.Note: This male/male erotic romance includes explicit language and graphic sex. For \nadult readers only\n! Though this is the 4th book in the series, it may also be read as a stand-alone.",
