  "description": "She's my little sister's best friend. And exactly who I should NOT be spending a summer with...  The last time I saw Elle, she was a child. A Harry Potter-obsessed 13-year-old with a penchant for fan fiction and following me around. Six years later she’s on my doorstep. The braces are gone. The “Team Gryffindor” t-shirt’s been replaced with a bikini the size of my index finger. And I can’t get her out of my head, no matter how hard I try.  Except she’s still the girl I’m not allowed to have, the center of a secret I hope she never learns.  Resisting what I feel for Elle Grayson is the only way to protect my family. But am I willing to break both our hearts in the process? *This is a completely rewritten and re-edited version of Bloom. It is now dual point-of-view, and there are major changes to plot.",
