  "description": "Roman Striker is on the hunt. His brothers may have big plans to save his hometown, but all Roman cares about is ridding the world of one vengeful alpha of the Bone-Ripper Pack, Rhett. Getting to Rhett is easy—mess with a submissive she-wolf in his pack named Mila and the alpha makes mistakes. But Roman and Mila grew up together and their history runs deep. And the more Roman gets to know the woman she’s grown into, the more he wants to pull her away from the pack for different reasons. She’s got his protective instincts at maximum, and he sure likes the way she looks at him, but he’s got dark secrets nobody knows about. The kind that could burn a sweet beauty like her.  Mila is just trying to make it from day to day at the bottom of a notoriously monstrous pack, but when Roman Striker blows into the bar she works at offering her a shot at a better life, hope starts to bloom inside her for the first time in years. If anyone can turn this messed up town around, it’s Roman, but he doesn’t realize his potential. And as she gets to know the Wolves of Winter’s Edge, she wishes for a life she could’ve had if Roman hadn’t left all those years ago. Her alpha has destroyed everything, and now Roman is showing signs of a darkness she doesn’t understand. As a war brews between the two clashing packs, she’ll have to pick a side...even if choosing a side means living with dire consequences.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
