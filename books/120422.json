  "description": "Description:I wish to reassure those who say, ‘the end of the world is nigh,’ that a few people will survive the apocalypse. I know this to be true, because I am one of those surviviors. However, our saviour is also a madman who has facilitated our continued existence at a terrible cost to humanity. My story is a gift from the future, offered in the hope that anyone who reads it might be the one who can make a difference and save the lives of millions.Rhett Goreman",
