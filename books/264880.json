  "description": "This poem cycle pretty much has it the personal, the political, the striking and the poignant. \"The Washington Poems\" immerses you into the life and psyche of our nation's capital. Even the topical poems, dealing with Jimmy Carter's rose garden strategy, the assassination of Anwar Sadat and others, ring true today.Stylistically, the writing is impressionistic in that you will not notice the style but the effects in the mood created by it. Rhyme and meter are slaves here to enchantment, through the incantation of the verse.",
