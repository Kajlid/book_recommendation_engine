  "title": "Hammer Films-The Bray Studio Years",
  "description": "Hammer Films was one of the most successful independent production companies of the 1950s and 60s. The company's movies conquered box offices around the world, but the movies it produced during this era were all produced at the same modest facility near Windsor, in the English Home Counties. Acclaimed Hammer expert Wayne Kinsey has gained exclusive access to production files and censor reports, and conducted numerous interviews during many years of research. The result is a definitive and exhaustive history of Hammer's golden age, as seen through the eyes of the stars and technicians who actually made the films.",
