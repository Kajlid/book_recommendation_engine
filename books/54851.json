  "title": "Claiming One",
  "description": "This powerful collection brings together 17 short stories linked only by flight or denial. The distinct characters in Claiming One are both incredibly loving and tragically flawed: far from finding anything, and an even longer way from peace. Yet, E.J. Runyon masterfully intertwines a trail of hope, found in the hearts of the characters, to string these tales together. We welcome them: still standing, albeit wobbling, as adults or as children determined to act in adult-like ways. Often, we arrive to their story on the heels of a major change, whether actual or symbolic; death of beliefs, sureties or illusions. Each offers a glimpse into the characters' moment of choice. We witness perilous options, discoveries and decisions, all while considering the flawless humanity presented to us.",
