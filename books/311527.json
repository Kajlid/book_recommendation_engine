  "description": "I knew the moment my soul burned.I knew the moment the Wraith of Fire had touched me.And now…Was it really so hard for the Heavens to produce some white light?But no, not even just a warm glow at the end of some graffitied tunnel and as for Pearly Gates, well they wouldn’t be opening for me any time soon!Because I wasn’t where I was supposed to be. And I could forget all my jokes about falling into Wonderland and Oz and seeing any of those fuzzy fellas from Narnia, because no amount of wishing that my life was a fairy tale would make it so.Not when I was caught in this nightmare world. One where I was to be terrorised by its ruler for an eternity.A tyrant King that wanted a new game to play.One I had no chance of winning.Not when it was my heart, that was on the line.",
