If his idea of courtship is telling her what to do, then she is not interested, or at least she is trying not to be. But when his scolding words turn to scorching kisses, suddenly Sophie starts paying attention. . .\nPraise for Vanessa Kelly and Mastering the Marquess\n\"A rare gem.\" --Julianne MacLean, USA Today bestselling author \"Fast paced and difficult to put down.\" --Romantic Times\"A delectable treat.\" --Sharon Page, author of The Club",
