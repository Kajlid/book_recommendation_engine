  "description": "Hilda Hopkins has escaped lawful custody and is once more on the lamb and on the lookout for likely lodgers to model her unique knitted dolls. This time she gets a break in the form of a job at the bleak, isolated Traveller's Rest, a bed and breakfast establishment run by the musty yet malleable Mrs Moffett. Before you can knit a garrotte and slip it over a sleeping guest's neck, Hilda is back to her old ways and loving every minute! How many will she make machine knitted models of before the Police close the loop around Britain's most notorious serial killer and prize winning machine knitter!",
