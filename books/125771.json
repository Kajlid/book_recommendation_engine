  "description": "Growing up in a small Midwestern town in the 60s, Matt wants nothing more than to run cross-country, hang out with his friends, and act cool. When Matt's father dies unexpectedly in a tragic car accident, his world is turned upside-down. Bitter over the loss of his father, Matt wants everyone to leave him alone, including God. When Wade, a stuttering, handicapped young man, moves in next door and insists on making Matt his best friend, Matt wants nothing to do with him. Teased by some of his friends at school, Matt struggles with choosing to be accepted rather than doing what's right. Only when Matt is able to see the world through Wade's eyes will he truly understand the meaning of grace and forgiveness.",
