  "title": "Bad Blood: The Shocking True Story Behind the Menendez Killings",
  "description": "They were golden boys who killed with sudden savagery. The trial revealed a dark drama too evil to believe.  Handsome, rich, bronzed champion athletes, Erik and Lyle Menendez were the stunning symbols of the California dream. The sons of a high-powered Hollywood executive and his beautiful wife, they lived in a pampered world of Beverly Hills mansions, swimming pools, and private tennis coaches.  But the dream became a nightmare when police found the butchered bodies of the boys’ parents, Jose and Kitty, in the family room of their five-million dollar mansion. Only days after the couple was laid to rest, the brothers began an appalling spending spree, buying Rolex watches, designer clothes and a new Porsche. Seven months later, all of Hollywood was stunned when the 18- and 21-year-old brothers were arrested for the horrendous killings.  In wrenching testimony, Lyle & Erik accused their father of sexually brutalizing then since they were children—claiming his sadistic acts of perversion and cruel violence drove them to their unspeakable crime.   Bestselling author Don Davis takes you inside one of the most riveting cases in California’s history, laying to bare the shattering secrets of a tormented family.",
