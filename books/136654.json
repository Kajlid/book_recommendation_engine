Still, that sounds fine – the work isn’t too hard, the pay’s all right, and the scenery is great.But he soon has second thoughts about staying. His boss, Fraser, is clearly a bit of a rogue, while Fraser’s cute but snippy daughter, Alva, takes against him from the start. And the oddball characters in the local pub aren’t exactly welcoming.Then Jake stumbles on an extraordinary secret that changes everything that’s known about the universe. A secret he can scarcely believe. A secret that Alva and the island recluse, Ruan Strang, have sworn to protect at all costs.As the mystery deepens, the questions only mount – and none of the answers make any sense. Plus, Jake’s falling for Alva and she still hasn’t so much as smiled at him.One thing’s for certain – he’s not going anywhere until the full, fantastic truth is revealed.From the author of The Wrong Stop comes a SciFi fantasy adventure set on a dreamy Scottish isle. Stuffed with larger-than-life characters, it’s perfect for fans of island mysteries, with crackling dialogue and a will-they-won’t-they romantic edge.",
