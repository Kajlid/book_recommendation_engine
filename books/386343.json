  "title": "The Feaster from Afar",
  "description": "A project over ten years in the making! At long last, Stefan Dziemianowicz and John Pelan have assembled the definitive collection of Joseph Payne Brennan's non-Lucius Leffing tales. This remarkable set will run four volumes, each containing a mix of the classic, the familiar, and the obscure. Nearly one hundred stories collected in a beautiful, four-volume set. From his early appearances in Weird Tales through the run of Macabre magazine in the 1950s, to the renaissance of the supernatural tale in the 1970s, Joseph Payne Brennan was admired for his lyrical prose and outr√© vision. In this first collection we present a mix of some of Brennan's finest supernatural tales ranging from regional ghost stories to tales of cosmic dread that rank with the best of Lovecraft, Wandrei, & Smith.",
