  "description": "Two women of the wild west and the men who love them. Two romances, one book. Book One The Gambler's Passion Beautiful Tawdry Summers is determined to fulfill her mother's dying wish and realize her dreams - even if it means she has to dance at the rowdy Bare Backed Belle’s, cheat at high-stakes poker, or run from bullets with a man she's given her innocence to. She'd do it all, and over again, to find love and keep her promise. Jace Forrester gets a thrill living a double life - preacher's son by day, card hustler by night. Always after the big win, he can’t resist Tawdry’s ultimate challenge. He may lose more than he bargains for - his heart.  The Dust Garden  Her name is Temptation--and Temptation is her curse. She hasn’t seen a living soul for five years. Her only company are her children that are laid to rest in graves right outside her cabin-- Except for today, today there is a cowboy that fell face down in the dust next to the graves…He is begging for her help.  She’s terrified of men-the last one hurt her and stole her words.  “He is…gg…oing to dd…ie out tth…ere.”  Fallon can’t take another step even though his life depends on it. He might be suffering from a broken leg and he damn sure knows there is a lynch mob hot on his trail… but he found a beautiful woman isolated in the vast desert and he can’t leave her to save himself. However, gaining her trust will prove the hardest part of surviving ~ The Dust Garden.",
