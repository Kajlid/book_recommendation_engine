Her destined mate rejects her and chooses her sister instead. She decides to join the yearly hunting game in hopes to find her chosen—a mate who will fully accept and love her. Patience meets Titus and makes him her new mate. Would Patience be willing to fight the urge to be with her mate that fate has destined for her or would he drown herself in desperation and be with her chosen?",
