  "title": "Black Knights: On the Bloody Road to Baghdad",
  "description": "In an action-packed narrative Oliver Poole describes how he became \"embedded\" in a US tank and infantry company known as the Black Knights - the first unit in the Third Infantry Division to engage in combat. By the time the first statues of Saddam were toppled in Baghdad, the soldiers had been through a terrifying baptism of fire - and had inflicted terrible casualties on the Iraqis. How did they - many of them under the age of 20, some of whom had only recently acquired US citizenship - cope with fear and injury? How did they react to the killing? How were they changed by war? What was the impact on the people of Baghdad? Oliver Poole has written a fly-on-the-wall account of what frontline combat action meant in the first major war of the 21st century.",
