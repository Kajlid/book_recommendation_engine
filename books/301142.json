  "description": "Agent Kit Morris. Has a nice ring, doesn't it?It's a big step up from \"wanted criminal\" or \"that weird con-artist guy with weirder psychic powers\"—both of which recently applied to me. But my promotion to MagiPol agent comes with a few drawbacks.First, supremely talented and effortlessly gorgeous Agent Lienna Shen won't agree to a dinner date with me. Second, my new assignment has pitted me against a guild with very bad taste in pets. Third, those pets are demons, and those demons want to kill me.My psychic magic is great for conning people. It doesn't do jack shit against hellish orcs. If I screw this up, my dinner date will be with a demon—and I'll be the dinner. Even better, I kind of suspect this supposedly straightforward assignment is actually the tip of an unholy iceberg of power-hungry malefactors bent on destroying all law and order in the city.I should probably mention that last part to my boss.--THE GUILD CODEX: WARPEDWarping Minds & Other Misdemeanors (#1)Hellbound Guilds & Other Misdirections (#2)More series in the Guild Codex world:The Guild Codex: SpellboundThe Guild Codex: DemonizedThe Guild Codex: Unveiled",
