  "description": "Two hot young lovers who also happen to be cold-blooded killers . . . Lily deVries suffers from DID, a psychiatric condition known as dissociative identity disorder. Triggered by a devastating childhood truama, her mind has fragmented into different personalities known as 'alters'. There's the gentle, child-like Lily; the sexually insatiable Lilah; and Lilith - the violent psychopath. Now Lily has found herself in the Reed Chase mental institution, where they're hoping to find a cure. But there's another patient undergoing treatment at the Institute. Fellow DID sufferer Ulysses Maxwell faces life imprisonment following the rape, torture and murder of more than a dozen women. When Lilith and Max - Maxwell's psychopathic alter - meet one another, the reaction is dynamite. And when the unthinkable happens and they escape from the Institute, it's up to ex-FBI Agent Pender to track down a terrifying pair of killers who win hearts as easily as they slit throats.",
