  "description": "My name is Darwin De Groi, and I’m in love with Peter Forbes. But Pete has this dream of becoming a metaphysical scientist and that means all his time—his attention—is taken up by college and studying. So in order to deal with the pain of watching Peter and never having him I spend most of my time in the Gray Zone, the no-man’s-land between the city of Atlanta and the Dens. There I’m free to drown myself; with drugs, with booze…With the inhuman.Lesser-Breds. Kin hybrids. The offspring of Humans and Dragons.But then an act of revenge led to a stupid college prank, which put Peter right into my arms.A better man would make the right decision and tell Pete no.I am so not that man.",
