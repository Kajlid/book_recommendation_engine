  "description": "Sometimes a letter is like a prayer; it's more for the sender than the receiver. Singer-songwriter Alex Woodard was letting go of his best friend, a Labrador named Kona, and most of his dreams when he received a letter that would change the course of his life.  What began as a song about that letter evolved into a book and album package about real-life letters, featuring Grammy-winning artists and a live show that has sol d out every performance and inspired thousands in its first few months. Join the Hay House author and award-winning songwriter as he takes you on a moving journey of release, redemption, and realization through the letters, songs, and story of FOR THE SENDER. \nProceeds generated by the songs from each letter go to a cause of the sender's choice. \n \n\nCD INCLUDED",
