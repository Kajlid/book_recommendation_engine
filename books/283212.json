  "description": "Poetry. LGBTQIA Studies. Ruth Dickey's MURA Award winning poems include many titles of poems in this collection that are lines from poems written by homeless and formerly homeless writers who participated in writing workshops Ruth Dickey founded and led at Miriam's Kitchen in Washington, DC. MUD BLOOMS goes well beyond the ordinary glance to revealing, true, humane, common bonds that may well bring us to the same place. Personal and wrenching, Ruth Dickey's first full length book of poems makes us want to read again.",
