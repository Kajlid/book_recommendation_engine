  "description": "Britt Montero is an ace crime reporter who sleeps with a police scanner by her bedside -- and who can't keep off a hot story, even if the book has already been closed. Miami is her turf, with it's sweltering nights and seething passions that can erupt without warning into mind-numbing violence. Now a black ex-football star and beloved local hero is dead after an alleged high-speed police chase -- and Britt's city explodes around her. The facts are hidden somewhere among the deadly lies, official cover-ups, and the vigilante crimes of rogue night shift cops. And Britt's determined to pursue the truth through the smoking tropical wreckage -- even as it leads her perilously close to unexpected revelations of conspiracy and corruption that could burn her to the bone.",
