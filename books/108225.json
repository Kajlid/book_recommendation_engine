  "description": "In this erotic gay fantasy novel, Jakil LeMae arrives at Alyrrawood University, the prestigious all male school for mages, vampires, faeries, and werefolk. He makes friends, enemies, and attracts the attention of a sadistic lust faerie--and it's only his first day there!  His roommate, Maika, is the faerie poster-boy for the clinically depressed, and seems determined to be as unfriendly as possible, until a mutual need forces them together. Jak, a healing mage, is drawn to pain and suffering with a need to fix things, but is this broken faerie beyond fixing?  Akitra is a lust faerie and Maika's only friend, and he takes an instant dislike to Jak over a perceived insult. Unfortunately for Jak, insulting a faerie can have deadly consequences.  Jak's closest friends are Izeri, a weather fey who can't control the weather, and Zaiden, a goofy fire mage. The two couldn't be more different--Izeri is quiet, timid, and very hands-off, and Zaiden is loud, impulsive, and has a horny streak a mile wide--but Jak would trust either of them with his life.  Also in the mix is Charias, an anti-social wereshark that Jak manages to offend, who happens to be Izeri's roommate.  Caught up in a world of sex, drama, deception, and betrayal, who can Jak trust, who can he save, and who will he love?  ** This book contains pervasive, explicit sexual content, M/M and M/M/M relationships, and self-harm. **",
