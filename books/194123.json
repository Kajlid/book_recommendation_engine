  "title": "VooDoo Souls",
  "description": "The story of the VooDoo Souls starts with an evil curse cast in the Antebellum South, progresses through the era of rum-running, and then up to the post Jim Crow days, in 1968 Macon Georgia. On the outskirts of this tolerant city, an aging group of motorcycle riders called the VooDoo Souls finds trouble, when a cursed amulet buried by a slave is unearthed. Feuds become rekindled between old foes, when an up and coming club called the Confederate Buzzards encroach upon the secrets buried within the dilapidated plantation, and home to the VooDoo Souls.With inspiration from King and Poe, Ezekiel Cartwright respectfully presents his debut novel, VooDoo Souls.",
