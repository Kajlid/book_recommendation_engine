  "description": "Finally flushed into the open by the heroism of a joker and an uninfected lady reporter, the Card Shark conspiracy faces destruction. But a cornered animal is a dangerous animal, and the Sharks still have one final card to play: the Black Trump. The ultimate biological weapon. The Black Trump simply kills all those with the wild card virus written into their genes, joker or ace -and its success rate is one hundred percent. In New York's teeming Jokertown, in the Joker's Quarter of old Jerusalem, in the Free People's State of Vietnam where the ace Mark Meadows rules in a sixties vision of love and peace, the bombs are ticking...and time is running out.",
