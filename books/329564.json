  "title": "Many Minds, One Heart: SNCC's Dream for a New America",
  "description": "The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee broke open the caste system in the American South between 1960 and 1965. Hogan explores how the organization fostered significant social change in such a short time. She offers new insights into the internal dynamics of SNCC as well as the workings of the larger civil rights and Black Power movement of which it was a part. She shows that SNCC laid the foundation for the emergence of the New Left and created new definitions of political leadership during the civil rights and Vietnam eras. She traces the ways other social movements such as Black Power, women's liberation, and the antiwar movement adapted practices developed within SNCC to apply to their particular causes.",
