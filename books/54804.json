  "description": "Sun. Sand. Sex. Icaria has it all and Kent is taking advantage of every single bit of it. His holiday passes in a blur of bright days and hot men until he meets the man who rules them all. Stavros Laskaris owns most of Icaria and when Kent catches his attention, he becomes one more thing to posses. The hot Greek summer vacation takes a dark turn when it turns out that Stavros isn't planning on letting him leave Icaria. From sexual confidante to prisoner of a man beyond the law â€“ even the laws of nature, Kent find himself in a whole new world, a world where he is bound to a man who forces him to recognize his true nature and wolf form. Kent must learn to submit to his alpha, or pay the price for being a disobedient whelp.",
