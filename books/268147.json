  "title": "The First Cell: And the Human Costs of Pursuing Cancer to the Last",
  "description": "With the fascinating scholarship of The Emperor of All Maladies and the deeply personal experience of When Breath Becomes Air , a world-class oncologist examines the current state of cancer and its devastating impact on the individuals it affects -- including herself.In The First Cell , Azra Raza offers a searing account of how both medicine and our society (mis)treats cancer, how we can do better, and why we must. A lyrical journey from hope to despair and back again, The First Cell explores cancer from every medical, scientific, cultural, and personal. Indeed, Raza describes how she bore the terrible burden of being her own husband's oncologist as he succumbed to leukemia. Like When Breath Becomes Air , The First Cell is no ordinary book of medicine, but a book of wisdom and grace by an author who has devoted her life to making the unbearable easier to bear.",
