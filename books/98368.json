  "description": "Ever met a man who knows how to take your good intentions, screw them up into a ball and toss them aside like inconsequential fluff? Chloe Jacobs has.... Still, she’s a busy, hard-working woman, and she deserves a little mindless fun on the side once in a while. Nathan Black – with his dark good-looks and unconventional lifestyle – is only too happy to oblige with occasional stress relief when he’s in town, and boy, does he give good stress relief! That is, until one fateful night when Chloe’s good sense gets tossed out somewhere along with those good intentions. The fun is abruptly curtailed... and now​ Chloe and Nathan have some serious decisions to make. ​​",
