  "description": "The saga of Alex and Gwen that started in the bestselling Vlad All Over continues . . . they can’t be together, but they won’t stay apart. Is there a happily ever after in Alex and Gwen’s future? Only the gypsies know for sure. Alex and Gwen have set aside their animosity for the sake of their son. Joint custody requires cooperation, and they’ve mastered that—perhaps a little too well, at least according to Gwen’s new boyfriend, who’s less than pleased when Gwen agrees to spend the summer in Transylvania with Alex and the kids. Although it’s not as if Alex gives Gwen much of a choice—she only goes to Romania to avoid another bitter costly lawsuit she can’t afford. But Gwen’s visit is timely because the dispute over Dracula’s gold mine is coming to a head. And so is her and Alex’s future. Author’s Note: Vlad to the Bone is the sequel to Vlad All Over, the world’s first gothic chick lit tale. What is gothic chick lit? You can find the answer here: http://www.kindlepost.com/2012/11/got.... While it’s possible to read Vlad to the Bone without reading Vlad All Over first, I wouldn’t recommend it. You’d be missing out on a lot of intriguing backstory.",
