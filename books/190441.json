  "description": "There is a miraculous power within you. You may have felt this power before. It comes in the form of confidence, excitement, or motivation. It manifests itself in that brief moment when you suddenly realize you can accomplish anything. We reach to grab hold of it, but it slips away. We reluctantly return to mediocrity.Are we doomed to only glimpse, but never grasp this power? In Unleashing the Miracles of Your Mind, Sal Marotta shows us that we don’t need to grasp it, because it’s already a part of us. In this practical, action-driven guide, he teaches us the changes we must make to our thoughts and routines to unleash it. As he guides us through the foolproof, three-tier system to success and happiness, he helps us conquer doubts and topple barriers that we didn’t even know were holding us back. Drawing on the timeless techniques of happiness and self-mastery, he provides us with the tools to change our mindsets, fulfill our ambitions, and invigorate our lives. Filled with Marotta’s own personal experiences, real-life inspirational stories, and practical results-driven tips and tricks, Unleashing the Miracles of Your Mind is not only enlightening and entertaining, but also is an invaluable instrument to charge the miracle-making power of your mind.",
