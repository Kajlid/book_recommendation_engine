  "description": "Computer whiz Adam Thornton can program the most complex software. Give him source code or static analysis, but the moment a woman enters into the equation, he’s hopelessly lost. Especially if that woman is Christie Allaway, the alluring femme fatale who can render him mute with a single smile. The same woman who very publicly friend-zones him, much to his humiliation.But then she comes knocking on his door in the middle of the night.After sending a disastrous drunk email to her boss, Christie Allaway, fearing the worst for her career, turns to the one man who may be able to delete it in time: Adam Thornton. Successful software developer. Reserved and aloof. Downright cute with his golden eyes and black-rimmed glasses. But when Christie seeks his help, Adam makes her a surprising proposition in return for his services. One she can’t help but accept.But neither expected their hearts to get tangled up in the process. Neither expected boundaries to be crossed, or rules broken. When their agreement comes to an end, they’ll need to decide if they’re willing to walk away…or take the biggest risk of all.",
