After he fails to get Riley kicked off his survey site, he vows to avoid her. Unfortunately for him, she vows to get even.Riley expects the curse to do her dirty work by driving Clark away, but instead, they keep finding themselves in close proximity. Too close. Turns out, the only thing they do better than fight is fool around. If they’re not careful, by the end of all this, more than the castle will end up in ruins.",
