Pay Back’s a Bitch picks up at the end of book 2 in the We Knew They Were Coming Series. The Xoran minor fleet has been defeated, but there are two major fleets in transit towards Earth. The Xoran know the humans lost their fleet, they don’t know that three of their super intelligent AIs have switched sides, they’re now helping the humans. The AIs face a difficult task, they must unite the planet, merge Xoran and Earth weapons technology, build a fleet large and powerful enough to defeat the battle proven Xoran fleet, train their crews doing so in less than ten years. The Earthly ships must battle ships over fifty miles long, ships powerful enough to kill a planet. The AIs develop a plan so out of the box that there isn’t a box large enough to hold it. Their plan plays on our history and weaknesses. Their plan changes Earth forever. Earth’s fleet meets the first Xoran major fleet at the edge of Earth’s solar system, a battle unlike any other covers hundreds of thousands of miles of space. Anti-matter explosions light up the darkness of space. Lasers and particle beams flash across the emptiness of space. Some of Earth’s oldest weapons are given new lives which surprise the Xorans. If the Xorans win, they will destroy the Earth. If Earth wins, it will be the first battle of many to come as humans battle towards Xora Prime.",
