  "description": "Gideon’s week…was long, and getting longer! It had all started when battered wife Ruby Benson set up her wanted-killer husband Sid for capture by the cops, hoping he’d be spending the rest of his worthless life in jail. But Benson had other plans. The brutal madman had escaped. And now he was back on the streets with only one thought in mind…revenge! And it looked like it was up to Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard to save Ruby from her sadistic spouse’s blood vendetta…or die trying!",
