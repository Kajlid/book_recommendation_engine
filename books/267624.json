  "description": "Leyla had never known what it felt like to fall in love. Not until her best friend Sara broke Ben’s heart. \nAfter the devastating break up, Leyla reluctantly agreed to pick up Sara's things from Ben's home. Leyla thought she was being a good friend, but when she finds Ben completely shattered, her loyalties are tested. He had been her friend too. An afternoon of an innocent lunch and a walk on the beach to cheer him up turns into fireworks when Leyla can't get Ben out of her head. Pushed to her limits, fighting for a love she’s always dreamed of, and against a demon she never knew existed, Leyla must ultimately make a choice. Her decision will come down to loyalty to her best friend, the expectations of her family, or the desires of her wanting heart. Is love worth taking the risk? FORBIDDEN LOVE \n   FORBIDDEN BY FAITH (book 1) \n   FORBIDDEN BY DESTINY (book 2) \n   FORBIDDEN BY TIME (book 3)",
