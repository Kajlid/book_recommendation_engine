  "description": "From the author of the dark fantasy series, \"Holy Moon\" comes the sci-fi story of \"The Nordic\", an adventurous search for the truth of human history. It dives into the theory that all human races on Earth have come from various alien origins. The main character spearheading this search is William Davidson, an amateur rugby player and part-time broadcasting journalist living in Sunbury-on-Thames in England, who has an unusually unique perfect DNA running through him that dates all the way back to the original alien line that set his family here thousands of years ago; the Nordic line.In this first book of the series, \"Reunion\", William is joined by his celestial mentor and member of the Nordic alien race, Bertil, along with his girlfriend, Maria, his jovial best friend and teammate, Michael, and his new found ally Ufologist, Manford R. Goode.William has difficulty in understanding how special he is after being informed about the 'truth' from his now Nordic alien mentor, Bertil. After which, William gains unexpected fame resulting from a heroic act he performed unaware if his hibernating Nordic 'powers' had anything to do with it or not. His new notoriety also garners an unwelcome attention from new enemies, including the U.S. military who have now taken an interest in him, even though he is on British soil.William must overcome a myriad of obstacles, some he has created himself, if he is ever going to get to the truth and free mankind from the long living lie of the human history we believe.Bertil must get William on the path of searching for the truth before the rest of the Nordic race arrives as they have done continually every 3,600 years and together remove the Greys from power and restore order to planet Earth. Without William, all may be may be lost.",
