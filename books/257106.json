  "description": "From the author of the bestselling series, Pack Mates, comes the highly anticipated third book of the Fraser Lake Pack.    After his rescue from a prisoner of war compound in Russia, wolf shifter Lieutenant Colonel Mark Thompson doesn’t quite know what to do with the rest of his life. When an intriguing young man makes him an offer to recover more than a thousand miles away, he accepts.  Nathan “Hacker” Anderson has made a living by using his genius to carry out some not-so-legal jobs for whoever wants to hire him. Coming too close for comfort with being caught, Nathan fled to British Columbia, where he made his home in the middle of a forest. For the first time in his life, he’s happy and perfectly content with his lonely life.  Until…  …a chance meeting with the handsome Mark Thompson has him falling in love for the first time in his life. If he could only convince Mark that he was so much more than his career-ending injury, life would be perfect.  Mark has never been so taken with another shifter. Nathan brings out feelings he’s never experienced. But what could he ever offer the young eagle shifter? He doesn’t have a job, a role in his new pack, or even a working right hand.  Are their feelings strong enough or will the combination of Mark’s insecurities, Nathan’s inexperience, and pack instabilities tear them apart?",
