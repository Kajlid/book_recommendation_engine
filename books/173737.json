But eleven years after his death, the construction of the self-sustaining community called Cascata Verde could expose his sins - and someone is willing to do anything to ensure the past remains hidden. Lydia Vallone is a real estate agent who's hired to help recruit the first group of citizens to this ecological wonderland, but she quickly learns this 'Green City' isn't as pristine as it seems - and enlists the help of Malvisti's grandson Michael to help discover the truth. Together, they uncover a horrifying reality and struggle to expose a legacy of corruption, greed and misplaced patriotism. It's a deadly battle that puts faith, family and social consciousness completely at odds. And all Lydia and Michael have to rely on is each other.  Or so they think.",
