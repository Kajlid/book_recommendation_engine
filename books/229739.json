  "description": "He's the sinfully sexy, off-limits client whose naughty blog showcases his best \"asset.\" His prim and proper attorney has never been more tempted to mix business with pleasure... All About the D is a sexy romantic comedy from USA Today bestselling author Lex Martin and bestselling author Leslie McAdam! Temptation has never come in a hotter package.You know how people say you can never believe what you read on the interwebs? That a hot guy online is probably a creeper with a beer gut and a shoe fetish, not the sexy beast he pretends to be?So I had no clue that the anonymous blogger who contacted my law firm about his naughty website would be droolworthy in real life. Not that I'm interested in him in that way. Attorneys can't go around sleeping with their clients. Not even if he is the most beautiful man I've ever met and so ridiculously smart he makes my nerdy-girl heart sigh.Besides, he has too much on the line to risk taking a chance on the insane chemistry building between us. We both do.I've always followed the rules. Too bad he makes me want to break each and every one of them.* * * All About the D is a full-length standalone. Due to adult situations and sexual content, it's recommended for readers over the age of 18.",
