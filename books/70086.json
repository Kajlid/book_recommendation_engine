  "description": "I Am Not My Brother’s Keeper!Wellington never wanted much; now nothing is left for him to want. The charmed life he once lived is over; the one fanciful dream that once filled his days and nights will never come true.Teetering at the precipice of dark despair, he knows only they can bring him the everlasting peace which will end his struggle, those who came together to destroy his life.He’s as resolute as he is destitute and dejected, though he would much prefer killing the heartless bitch first. Why should he die alone?Wellington is unemployed; he’s desperate, deserted by his wife, shunned by friends and belittled by a twin brother.He has no future, no hope. He’s tired of the festering resentment he cannot dispel. They ruined his life without consequence, all of them guilty. He lost everything and no one cares. He blames his brother more than any other, the man who stole his dream, his life.Each one will soon feel the same desperation as Wellington embarks on a journey of freedom in search of everlasting peace which will ultimately redefine the brothers’ lives.Now, before his execution, or before he awakens from the same tormenting dream, he must discover the truth. Six will eagerly condemn him to eternal damnation, judging him with the coldness of unbeating hearts for what he has done; six others will sentence him to dream of them forever, forgiving him with the warmth of the love he infused in them.He’s afraid, uncertain. Is he dreaming of his death, or reliving nightmares as he crosses over to everlasting peace? Cold fluids course through his veins. His eyes close. The phone rings. It always does. It’s two AM.",
