  "description": "I do love my husband. To death. I love him so much that I've waited a whole year (minus one day) for Killing Kurtis Day to arrive. Tomorrow it will finally be here and I'm giddy with anticipation.  Don’t judge me, you don’t know the whole story. I reckon if you were in my shoes, you’d kill your husband, too.  **Readers 18+ recommended due to some adult content and situations**",
