  "title": "Follow the Money",
  "description": "From one of America's most unknown authors comes a book so humorous, so vile, so inane ... it could only be a cry for help. If you're searching for a refreshing style that's a tad demented, with characters that burrow deep into your mind and never leave, you've found the right book. Follow the Money is a collection of ten interconnected short stories that will grab you, wrestle you to the ground and squeeze you until your funny bone snaps in two. A botched kidnapping, a money scam, a not-so-average convenience store holdup ... each story flows (with the money) through a series of interesting, and sometimes bizarre, plots. Layered and interweaved with seamless complexity, recurring characters and everyday motifs bind the ten stories into a single universal plot*. Ingenious in its conception, flawless in its execution, Follow the Money is a hilarious, detailed study on the many facets of the human condition. Greed, Pride, Lust ... the seven deadly sins have never been so entertaining. Prepare yourself for a raunchy, gritty ride you'll never want to end.* (Note: Not one single vampire, zombie or sorcerer was thought about during the writing or editing of these stories)",
