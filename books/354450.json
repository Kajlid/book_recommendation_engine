  "description": "When raped and dismembered corpses start to appear throughout New York City, the investigation draws police captain Mace into a plot that plays like a horror movie. Taking the lead role in this chilling story may be the challenge of his career, testing his skills and his stamina, but even a superhero would find the series of terrifying crimes daunting. Unlike anything Mace has experienced, every blood-spattered scene is filled with body parts and partially eaten human remains and in the wake of each attack is the haunting premonition of another murdering onslaught. As Mace follows this crimson trail of madness, he must accept the inevitable conclusion: whomever or whatever is responsible for this terror does not intend to stop, and it’s up to him to put an end to the chaotic reign of a perpetrator whom, until now, he’s met only in the annals of mythology. Unfortunately, the mere mention of the word—werewolf—would send New Yorkers into a panic.",
