  "title": "Bullshit in Psychotherapy: From an Ego to a Soul Driven Encounter",
  "description": "Dr. Steinfeld was educated at New Yorkâ€™s Yeshiva University, and trained in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. However he became disillusioned when this process failed to help patients. He started on his quest for therapeutic truth and discovered it was hard to find in the contexts within which he worked. The best trained supervisors could not help, and there was always a reason for our failures, primarily blaming the patients. He changed his approach, focusing on how to relieve suffering in the most efficient ways and with the most effective approaches. He also discovered that frequently patients resist getting healthy based on their experiences that led to self-sabotaging beliefs. In addition to patient resistance, there is also the problems that therapists bring to their therapeutic encounters, often encouraging a dependent relationship into which the patient buys. There is collusion between therapist and patient to stay stuck. Though therapy has proven to be generally useful, it can also be harmful. Though Dr. Steinfeld developed an holistic approach to therapy, called TARET System, this book focuses on patient-therapist resistances, how to avoid and overcome them quickly. It also suggests that clients and therapists take responsibility for their contributions to therapy failure. Overcoming resistance as rapidly as possible helps clients solve their problems and move on with their lives, sometimes to the chagrin of their therapist.",
