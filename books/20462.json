  "description": "If you're not already familiar with the work of online humor columnist Barry Parham, here's your chance to get to know him... ...the man the Chicago Tribute has called \"the next Mark Twain\" (no, they didn't) ...the guy David Ladderman, Jay Limo & others depend on for new material (no, they don't) ...the acclaimed wit known to the staff at the Miami Harold as \"the funniest man since Mark Twain\" (actually, they never met) ...a man the New Yorker Times considers to be \"just a bit taller than Mark Twain\" (this is true, because Mark Twain died) So hop aboard for Barry's fourth collection of looks at play, work, art, TV, cultural norms (a very short chapter, that one), ads, fads, politics, the internet, anti-social networking, and why the end of the world might be late. And yes, Straw-Heads, the ferrets are back! Includes these award-winning stories! Comfortably Dumb || Snowblind || The Zodiac Buzz-Killer",
