  "description": "Meet Vanessa, an almost thirty-something New Yorker who thinks she's got it marriage-material boyfriend Ethan, her own bilingual preschool, a closet full of designer fashions, and daily diner dates with her best friend Emily. But when Ethan doesn't turn out to be all he's supposed to be, Vanessa's world instantly unravels. Suddenly single, she stumbles upon a wealthy man and moves to Palm Beach to marry him, only to find the shocking truth behind the source of his wealth. Is having everything worth sacrificing who you really are? But what about the Shoe Salon at Bergdorf's? The Louboutin collection? Vanessa finds herself at a crossroads, and the choices she makes might surprise everyone-even herself. Witty, insightful, and eminently relatable, Erica Negi's story is a modern twist on the Cinderella tale-albeit in designer shoes. Reminiscent of the works of Jennifer Weiner and Candace Bushnell, My Life in Loubies is one woman's uproarious journey to adulthood.",
