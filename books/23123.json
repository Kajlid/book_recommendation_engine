  "description": "Holly Winter's malamutes, Rowdy and Kimi, are a delightful a pair of canine companions as anyone could ask for. Less faithful is her ex-lover who left her with a bitter heart and over-priced therapy sessions. Add a bout with amnesia and trepidation over her father's second marriage, and Holly is convinced that things can't get worse. Until a walk in the park pits Rowdy against a vicious golden retriever whose owner is no less so. How odd that such a gentle breed could be so nasty. Not so odd for humans. And not at all surprising when the owner is found murdered .Holly has no choice but step into the fray--for she knows better than anyone that killers are a cunning and clever breed.",
