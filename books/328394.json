  "description": "The year is 350, the place, Witchdom. An invisible land that overlays the human world, the land of Witches. The Queen of the black covens, Arteia, is amassing her armies ready to perform an age old ritual, 'The Release'. It is the only method in which the black covens can break free of the white witches control and invade the human world. The last time this ritual was performed was in 792BC. Then there was but a few million humans for the black Queen to enslave; now there are billions. Deona Wendlass, Queen of the white witches knows that with such an army, Arteia could defeat them and rule both worlds. The only hope for the human world lies in an ancient prophecy. One among the white witches will rise up. A witch with almost unlimited powers: A witch that will try to defeat Arteia. A witch called PICKITY.",
