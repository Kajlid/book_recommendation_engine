  "description": "Simon Putney has never been in love and it suits him fine. He likes life and relationships to be simple and straightforward, no ties, no emotional complications. There's friendship and there's sex, what has love got to do with anything? A move to a new apartment brings him into contact with the eccentric, but sweet Dee-Dee Walters with whom he strikes up a friendship. Dee-Dee's unconventional upbringing has influenced his ideas about love and what constitutes the perfect relationship. What he wants is an old fashioned alpha male to rule his heart and his home. Simon thinks Dee-Dee is hankering after something that doesnâ€™t exist beyond the pages of fiction. When Dee-Dee gets tired of waiting for love and decides to launch a quest to find his perfect mate, Simon warns him he's likely to find only disappointment.",
