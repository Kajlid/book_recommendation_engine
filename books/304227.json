  "title": "Growing Young: Shifting Church Culture to Reach a New Generation",
  "description": "Times are changing-our methods must shift with the tideIt's never been so easy-and so difficult-to reach the younger generation. While they're active online, they're also less likely to be active in the church. This is a worrisome trend that means their morals, values, and needs regarding faith are being neglected. This book proposes a shift of church culture to reach a new generation. Using unique perspectives and focusing on the way of the future, this book aims to help bring a whole new generation of Millennials and Generation Z into the Apostolic church. We can't control the future, but we can adapt to it and reach a satisfying result. Loaded with fresh insights and ideas, Growing Young  shows pastors and leaders how to engage young people and open their eyes to God's kingdom.",
