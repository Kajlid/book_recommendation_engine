  "description": "Bring positive change to your life with #1 New York Times bestselling author Marianne Williamson – preorder her latest, The Mystic Jesus, picking up where A Return to Love left off In this honest and uplifting book, bestselling author Marianne Williamson delves deeply into the powerful role of change in our lives today. Far from something to fear and avoid, she says, every change—even the most difficult and painful—gives us an opportunity to receive the miraculous gift of personal transformation into what we are capable of becoming. The only real failure in life, she observes, is the failure to grow from what we go through. We will find real growth, Williamson gently teaches us, when we reorient ourselves with an eternal compass of spiritual principles, which alone can guide us on this path to wholeness.",
