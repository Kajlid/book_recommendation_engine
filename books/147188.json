  "description": "Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bump! When Pat Hutchins introduces a boy, his grandfather, a bright blue wheelbarrow, a little red hen, and a garden full of fresh fruits and vegetables you can bet the harvest on this: you are about to open a firstâ€“rate picture book with a beginning, middle, and end. It also goes without saying that it has a great sense of rhythm, repetition, affection, and surprise; and a plot and sense of fun that is perfect for preschoolers. Bumpety, bumpety, bumpety, bump!",
