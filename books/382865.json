  "description": "Now that Alex is in the know about the deadly vampires that liveand huntaround his boarding school, everything is different. Putting his talents to use, Alex is training with the Polidorium to become a vampire hunter, just like his Van Helsing ancestors. Sure, hes only fourteen, but cmon: This runs in his blood. But Alex is wondering if hell live long enough to succeed. His archnemesis Elle, a vampire whose youthful appearance and blond hair disguise a rage thats directed at him, is out to get him before a powerful leader called Ultravox arrives on the scene. Ultravox specializes in assassinations, but who is he targeting? As he dodges Elles attacks, Alex is on a mission to uncover Ultravoxs deadly plan before his friends and his school become collateral damage. Theres no time to report back; innocent lives hang in the balance, and its on Alex to act nowor else. “Wisecracks, gadgets and fast-paced action sequences abound in the second book about Alex Van Helsing….[H]umorous dialogue and harrowing escapes will keep action-oriented readers…entertained.”— KIRKUS REVIEWS",
