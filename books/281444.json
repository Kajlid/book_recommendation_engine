  "description": "How do you recover from the pain of a betrayal while facing the animosity and resentment of a family friend who thinks you deserve it?When Kelsey Carlson goes on a company trip, she is devastated when she discovers her boyfriend kissing another woman. The betrayal isn't the only drawback. She must stay and face the resentment of Brenton Daine, an old family friend who doesn't want her anywhere near him. Can she and Brenton amend the breaches of the past and overcome them to start their friendship anew?Forgotten Roses is a clean romance that shows how old resentments can thankfully fade and be replaced with much better and more amicable sentiments.A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.More books by author Ruth Fated MergerLonely at the TopDouble DeceptionWhere Lies EndDestiny InterruptedGlimpse of the HeartCatch the Morning Star (Historical)On Winds of Change (Historical)",
