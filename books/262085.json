  "description": "Christmas time has come at the saddened Boden residence as Honoria and her family and friends must say good bye to a man they all deeply love.  Christmas two years before saw Darryl and his loving wife in the wrong place at the wrong time as Darryl got attacked by robbers at the gas pump and ended up in a coma afterward.  Honoria's determination to keep her husband alive is taking its toll as friends and family plead with her to let him go. A court battle ensues and soon a date is handed down of exactly when Darryl's life support will finally be terminated. Can a stranger who happens by during a frightening winter storm hold the key to waking Darryl before it's too late, or will darkness unfold and consume his wife and loved ones for the holidays?",
