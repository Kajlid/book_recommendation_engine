  "title": "How to Break Up with an Alien",
  "description": "Face it, long distance relationships in high school are hard, especially when the other one in the relationship is an alien. Alex Bianchi may have survived an intergalactic battle, but that still doesn't excuse her from her senior year of high school, or qualify her for any sort of scholarship. To make up for college tuition costs, she takes a job at a local coffee shop. If only coffee could solve all of her problems. As Alex's senior year progresses, everything changes and she can't figure out if it is interstellar or if it is just time to break up with an alien.",
