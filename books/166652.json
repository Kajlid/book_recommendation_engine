  "title": "A Christmas Tree",
  "description": "'I have been looking on, this evening, at a merry company of children assembled round that pretty German toy, a Christmas Tree.'The tree was planted in the middle of a great round table, and towered high above their heads. It was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers, and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright objects.'Being now at home again, and alone, the only person in the house awake, my thoughts are drawn back , by a fascination which I do not care to resist, to my own childhood. I begin to consider, what do we all remember best upon the branches of the Christmas Tree of our own young Christmas days, by which we climbed to real life?'Straight, in the middle of the room, cramped in the freedom of its growth by no encircling walls or soon-reached ceiling, a shadowy tree arises; and, looking up into the dreamy brightness of its top - for I observe in this tree the singular property that it appears to grow downwards towards the earth - I look into my youngest Christmas recollections!'",
