  "description": "All Grace Copeland wants is a mate. The good news is that for the last year she’s known that Jack Taylor is her mate. The bad news is that he wants nothing to do with her. When he publicly rejects her, Grace’s world comes crashing down. Humiliated and angry with herself, Grace decides it’s time to get her life in order. Moving to the outskirts of town, she starts rebuilding her family cabin and her life. Alone in the middle of the woods, Grace becomes the target for a group of untraceable rogue wolves. With her life in danger, she has no choice but to accept help from the man who rejected her. All Jack Taylor wants is to be left alone. He definitely doesn’t need a nosy mate like Grace Copeland. Especially when there are rogue wolves attacking local Packs. Jack has better things to do than spending his time avoiding Grace. When she suddenly moves out of town he should feel relieved but he can’t stop thinking that he made a huge mistake by rejecting her. He also can’t ignore the feeling that she is in danger. The only problem now is that Grace doesn’t want him in her life anymore. With rogues closing in Jack decides she doesn’t have much of choice in the matter.",
