  "description": "Piers has a new job. He's off to be the \"Nasty Brit\" judging America's Got Talent— surely a role he was made for. And with unprecedented access to people, places, and parties on both sides of the pond, he'll get the inside scoop on the celebrity world. What could possibly go wrong? Well, it's not all smooth sailing. As well as foolishly embarking on a visit to the Playboy Mansion with his girlfriend he also becomes one of the only people to fall off the \"idiot-proof\" Segway (George Bush fell off one too). Somehow though, Piers still manages to get invited to all the best parties. From chinwags with Naomi Campbell to a cigar-smoking session with Arnold Schwarzenegger; hilarious tête à têtes with everyone from Boris Johnson to Cheryl Cole; and many bizarre encounters with the likes of Paris Hilton, Tony Blair, and Jay-Z; Piers is his usual candid, honest, loudmouth self as he lifts the lid on Tinsel Town. With the background cries of \"Please don't embarrass us Dad!\" from his sons, the Big Mouth Brit embarks on his hilarious American adventure, and suffers just a few mishaps along the way.",
