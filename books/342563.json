  "title": "Marigold Garden - Pictures and Rhymes - Illustrated by Kate Greenaway",
  "description": "Marigold Pictures and Rhymes is a delightful illustrated children's book, first published in 1885. It contains many well-known and loved nursery rhymes, presented with Greenaway's delightful imagery. Rhymes include 'Blue Shoes', 'The Daisies', 'The Tea Party', 'To Mystery Land', 'When we went out with Grandma', 'When you and I grow up', and many more. It is a text sure to enchant both young and old. Kate Greenaway (1846 - 1901), was a children's book illustrator and writer, and remains one of the most popular illustrators of all time. Edmund Evans produced her first book ('Under the Window') in 1879, which was an instant best-seller and cemented her pre-eminent position. Her charming children in quaint costumes and idyllic scenes captured the imagination of the contemporary public - and continue to delight over a century after their initial publication. Appearing alongside the text of 'Marigold Garden', her illustrations (first published in 1888) further refine and elucidate this carefully collated anthology. Pook Press celebrates the great 'Golden Age of Illustration' in children's literature - a period of unparalleled excellence in book illustration from the 1880s to the 1930s. Our collection showcases classic fairy tales, children's stories, and the work of some of the most celebrated artists, illustrators and authors.",
