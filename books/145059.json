  "title": "Passion: A Novel of the Romantic Poets",
  "description": "Theirs was a world of obsession, genius, and above all…In the turbulent years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, three poets―Byron, Shelley, and Keats―come to prominence, famous and infamous, for their vivid personalities, and their glamorous, shocking, and sometimes tragic lives. In this electrifying novel, those lives are explored through the eyes of the women who knew and loved them―intensely, scandalously.Four women from widely different backgrounds are linked by a sensational fate. Mary the gifted daughter of gifted parents, for whom passion leads to exile, loss, and a unique fame. Lady Caroline born to fabulous wealth and aristocratic position, who risks everything for the ultimate love affair. Fanny her quiet, middle-class girlhood is transformed―and immortalized―by a disturbing encounter with genius. Augusta the unassuming poor relation who finds herself flouting the greatest of all taboos.With the originality, richness, and daring of the poets themselves, Passion presents the Romantic generation in a new and unforgettable light.",
