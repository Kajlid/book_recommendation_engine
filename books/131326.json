  "description": "Book One in the time travel, fantasy romance series, Highland Secrets!  She never believed in magic… Claire McGowan, Scotophile and historical romance novel addict, finally saves up enough for her dream vacation to Scotland. She never imagines she’ll get sucked back to the seventeenth century while running on the beach—that’s what she gets for exercising when she should be relaxing.  He knows with a harsh certainty magic exists... The Fae have taken his brother—Laird of his clan. Duncan MacLeod finds a bonnie naked and confused lass. He’s convinced Claire arrived in 1672 through the Faery Stones—a magical portal he’s been scouring the lands for over the past six months. At last, he has someone who’s been through the Faery Stones and can help him find them—and get his brother back. Duncan promises to help Claire get home, even though his desire to have her wars with his vow. Torn between familiarity of the present and what she wants in the past, can Claire help Duncan find his brother and get back to the future? Will she even want to?",
