  "description": "Anyone watching the seventeen-year-old Julia Morris singing Bonnie Tyler's 'Holding Out For A Hero' on NEW FACES could tell two things ... she had guts and she had talent. Not too many years later, Julia got her big break (alongside Eric Bana) on the Logie award-winning comedy sketch show FULL FRONTAL. From that platform she went on to other television and radio and she soon became one of Australia's most-loved female comedians with roles on IN MELBOURNE TONIGHT, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, GREAT AUSSIE BLOOPERS, GLADIATORS, THE MIDDAY SHOW, WHO DARES WINS and GOOD MORNING AUSTRALIA.She was young, successful ... and single, so in 2000, like so many Aussies before her, Julia decided to try her luck overseas and jetted off to the UK. There was no instant success. She had to work hard to find her way in the much larger pond. Julia spent eight years in the UK and ended up claiming both commercial and critical success on stage, radio and television. Her refreshing honesty captured the imagination of British comedy's elite and she worked with the likes of Paul Whitehouse, Stephen Fry, Catherine Tate, Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, Graham Norton and her own personal Dalai Llama -the great Dame Edna.But there comes a time when an Aussie girl needs to come home. And what was left? Maybe it was time to bag herself a husband, the title of 'Lady' (bought on the internet by the bagged husband Dan), a baby daughter, and bring her new family back to settle in her beloved homeland.",
