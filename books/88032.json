  "description": "The southern forest of Kulhn is deep, dark, and deadly. It's a perfect refuge for witches hiding from the temples. A witch like Jessera, wise in survival. She found a lost young nobleman and took pity on him. But the man she called Pete was more than he seemed. Before she knew it, she was dragged into royal politics and witch hunters were after her. Is loving a prince really a good idea after all?",
