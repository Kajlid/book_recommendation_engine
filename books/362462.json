It features authors and illustrators predominantly working in the UK and the USA including Edward Lear, Randolph Caldecott, Beatrix Potter, Kenneth Grahame, Arthur Ransome, Jean de Brunhoff, Maurice Sendak and Raymond Briggs. This volume contains colour images of over 400 books, both rare and familiar, with surveys of classic titles such as \"Struwwelpeter\", through the pioneer works of the mid-20th century such as the \"Babar\" books, to the varied products of the post-war period, including the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Lemony Snicket\" books.
