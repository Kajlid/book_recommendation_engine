  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ASIN - B00JZZGQTKThis edition has been completely reformatted to allow it to display on all Kindle devices. The poems have also undergone significant editing since the original \"iBook\" edition of the book.>>> FUN MONSTER POEMS FOR AGES 3 - 8 YEARS This fourth book in the \"Top of the Wardrobe Gang\" series contains poems about all sorts of different monsters! The poems answer lots of important monster questions: what is it like to have seven monsters living under your bed; is it a good idea to invite the Monster Bunch home for tea; what happens when monsters run your local carwash; who exactly is that lurking on the \"naughty step\"; is it safe to follow Big Jim on a Monster Hunt; and, why are monsters scary anyway? >>> BRIGHT PICTURES ON EVERY PAGE Every page of the book is simply and brightly illustrated. (We recommend viewing the 60+ pictures in colour, if you are able to.) >>> SIMPLE, EASY-TO-READ FORMAT The simple rhyming verses are easy to follow and to read out aloud. With just one verse per page, the book is ideal both for those new to reading, or for reading out to younger children.",
