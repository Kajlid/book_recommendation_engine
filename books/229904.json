Falleaf House. Stillwater House. Spellshadow Manor. Seek these places, and do not leave them. Cower within their walls...\"Alex doesn't have all the answers yet, but he and his friends are running out of time. With Aamir's new position as a professor, they hoped he might be able to help them make a breakthrough in uncovering the Manor and its Head's secret, but it soon becomes terrifyingly clear that Aamir's situation is anything but advantageous...As rules begin tightening around Alex like a noose to his neck, he is forced to rely on his own strengths more and more -- and when events at Spellshadow take a truly shocking turn, it will take all that he has not to break...Prepare for a hair-raising ride.",
