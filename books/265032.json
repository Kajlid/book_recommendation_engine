  "description": "The Evil Underneath is a mix of a pulp-style chiller with the dark, comedic sensibilities of films like The Return of the Living Dead, Parents, Fright Night, and Re-Animator.Helen doesn't have much to do now that her husband works nights. Being left in a new home by herself, the boredom and uneasy the darkness brings seems to be ever growing.She tries to ignore it by pecking away at her computer keyboard and drinking a little too much wine.Despite the strange, two-tailed cat that lurks in her backyard, everything seems fine, but she still can't shake the feeling that something is wrong.This apprehension only amplifies when her neighbors, Sam and Kathy, come over to say hello one night.It doesn't take long after meeting them before they show her what they truly are, and what they are is an evil that has lasted for generations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Following is an official OnlineBookClub.org review. \"I highly recommend The Evil Underneath to fans of horror and thriller genres or those who enjoy a survival story or an adventure into the sinister world.\"",
