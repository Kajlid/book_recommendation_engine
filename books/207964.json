  "description": "Duality is just a fact of life when you're the hybrid offspring of a psychotic vampiress and an alpha werewolf. Remus Black is about to learn the hard way that the vampires aren't the only ones who have designs on the hybrid prince of legend. When the Family, a legion of undead hunters who have lain dormant for years, starts killing supernaturals and targeting the people Remus loves, old bonds and new alliances are tested. The Family is only one of the problems Remus must face now that he's more vampire than werewolf and less human than ever before. Suppressing his wolf side was necessary in order to do what it took to save Victor's life, but his nascent vampire nature has come at the cost of his relationship with Sebastian. Even more shocking than how easy it is to live without his humanity is the fact that he finds it restored in the arms of his destined mate's brother. Remus and his newfound pack are about to learn that surviving the harvest moon was nothing compared to the threat that looms with the hunter's moon. Remus finds himself at the center of a war between the Kingdom of Night and the Kingdom of the Sun, but the battle raging in his own mind poses the greater threat. It soon becomes clear that Victor is bound to the vampiric half of his soul while Sebastian holds claim to the very wolf nature Remus must keep at bay to protect his fragile heart. To stop the hunters and ensure the future stability of the pack, Remus will be forced to do the unthinkable and choose between Victor and Sebastian. Will his choice tear the brothers apart for good, or is his love the key to bringing them together and standing against the hunters as a united front?
