And though the evidence points firmly in one direction, an open and shut case soon becomes murky and unclear.It’s not the first time bad things have happened in these woods. Things that some have tried desperately to forget. But for the killer, it’s more a matter of unfinished business.Unless Evan and the team can outwit a vengeful and clever murderer, someone else is going to die.",
