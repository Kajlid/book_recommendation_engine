  "title": "Cold Blooded: A chilling, true tale of terror, rape, and murder in the Arkansas River bottoms",
  "description": "On a cold January morning in 1981, a knock on an apartment door began what would become one of the bloodiest crime sprees in Arkansas history. In the coming days the bodies of newlyweds Larry and Jawana Price, businessman Holly Gentry, and Police Detective Ray Tate were discovered. They had been executed in cold blood and discarded like so much trash. What kind of person murders four people in cold blood? Did the right one go to prison? “Paddock is a gifted storyteller, and Blind Rage is a riveting read.”– Sonny Brewer, author of The Poet of Tolstoy Park “The newest and strongest voice in true crime writing . . . makes you feel as if you are there, seeing what happened, and feeling the terror and sorrow of those felled by these brutal crimes.” – Marla Cantrell, author and Arkansas Art Council Fellow “Somehow [the author] is able to create tension and suspense even when the outcome is already known. She has a way of making each character as familiar as the guy next door, be they ordinary people or despicable creeps! Truman Capote, even though you can't roll over, maybe you should step aside because a new ‘true crime’ star is here!”– John McFerran",
