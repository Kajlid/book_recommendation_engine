  "description": "The next in the Burning to Ride Series - Book One currently in the Seven Sins Anthology  Owner of Wilde Hotel, Briony Wilde should have been a dude. She knows her way round a Harley like most women know their way round a shoe store. Thing is, the boys she rides with are all members of the Raising Hellfire biker gang and being a young single woman in charge of a biker hotel ain’t doing her any favors. She’s low on funds and has creditors crawling out her ass. She needs cash and a credibility transplant, and she needs it fast. When Cole Knight’s car breaks down in the heart of the area earmarked for his development, he decides he might as well make the most of a bad day and try and work out why the owner won’t let him buy her dump of a hotel. He doesn’t count on her blackmailing him with a fake sex tape and having to promise he’ll walk her down the aisle to fix it!",
