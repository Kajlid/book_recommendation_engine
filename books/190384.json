So when a stunning brunette clad only in a cocktail dress stumbled to his doorstep, the off-duty air force sergeant went into protector mode. But could he really believe \"Dee's\" claims that she'd lost her memory…or was her amnesia a ruse to hide a dangerous secret?For someone had certainly set their sights on getting rid of Dee. Yet they hadn't counted on Jacob's resolve. Dee was his responsibility. Even more…she'd become integral to his next breath. And no one messed with his lady.",
