It's a small town and memories are long, and Katie and Jenny's husband, Chief of Police Jake Robbins, have had to work at putting the tragedy behind them. But it's all brought up again in the wake of a hurricane which has just wreaked havoc on their quiet Maine town.

Someone predicted her death, as well as eleven other tragedies, which are still occurring even long after the death of Katie's husband.At last, after all these years, Katie has reason to hope that her husband might not have been guilty of Jenny's murder after all.
