  "title": "A Lil' Less Lost",
  "description": "Do fairytale's always have a happily ever after? Jay and Lil's had just found the love they once shared and foolishly lost. But, a horrific turn events threatens to end it forever. Jay must race against time to save his ol' lady Lil's and their baby before tragedy strikes. In this sequel we learn more about Jay, the deep love he has for his soulmate, and just how far he is willing to go to protect her. This novella is approx. 50,500 words and does not contain a cliffhanger ending like it's prequel. However, an epic love story like Lil's and Jay cannot possibly be wrapped up in two tidy little novella's... now can it? Warning: This novella is intended for those 18+ of age and contains strong language, sexual content, adult situations and a direct continuation of it's prequel A Lil' Less Lost'.",
