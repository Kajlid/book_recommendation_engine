  "title": "The Summer King",
  "description": "Sequel to the critically-acclaimed \"The Hunter's Moon\" This second book in a series \"shimmering with magic, myth, and romance\" (\"Booklist\"), follows sixteen-year-old Laurel as she tries to understand the cause of her twin sister's mysterious death. Honor believed in Faerie, a parallel land of mischievous immortals. Laurel doesn't. That is, until the fairies come and ask her to take up her sister's failed quest to find the Summer King, a lord who can light the midsummer fire that keeps the two worlds, human and Faerie, cleaved. Laurel must decide to help those whose cause killed her sister, and, in the process, come to believe that there is still magic and love in the world. Lush descriptions of Ireland and Celtic lore make this a satisfying read for travelers to other lands, real and mythic.",
