  "description": "Rachel’s divorce, although heartbreaking, leaves her free to focus on her work during the day and take herself on “dates” in the evenings with her newest friends: a bottle of wine and whatever sappy movie is streaming on her television. It also leaves her free to remodel the other half of the duplex she received after her divorce.When Conner moves into that halfplex with a rent deduction to do renovations, all the pounding she hears doesn’t just come from construction—he’s bringing home dates. And from what she can hear through the wall that separates their bedrooms, his dates are satisfied women.With a handyman like this living next door, who needs a boyfriend?",
