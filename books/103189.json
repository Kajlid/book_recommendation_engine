Being abandoned by his Mother when he was just a little boy and raised by his loving Father, Andrew has been living a commitment free philandering lifestyle. Love and marriage by his experience wasn’t worth the heartache that was sure to happen eventually.

Going back to New York was going to be hard and she didn’t know what her future would now be. She just knew that now she was alone except for the little sister that she had never met.The story portrays the confused thoughts of both Andrew and Katie as they both experience new circumstances.",
