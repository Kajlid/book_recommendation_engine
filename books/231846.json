  "description": "5th book in the new 5 book Trillion Theory cosmology series by Canadian theory author Ed Lukowich.This 45 page book is a brief summary (a small smattering) of Trillion Theory (TT), also known as T Theory. More in-depth T Theory is available in TT’s 5 book cosmology series, via Amazon in Paperbacks and as EBooks. (Also inquire at Chapters book stores. See Ed’s www.trillionist.comPlease note that many TT ideas may be very alien when you firstencounter them. For, ‘Most great ideas were initially viewed asridiculous.’ Read TT in full to grasp how the neo concepts addedtogether make sense.T Theory predicts, ‘TT’s new theories are simply ahead of theirtime. Astronomers/astrophysicists, are presently slowly movingtowards discovering the secrets which T Theory writes about.Slowly, because their belief in the Big Bang halts their progress.That is the reason why T Theory is now reaching out to theseexperts; to speed up their cosmic discoveries as indicated by TT.’ ‘How our cosmos shows itself to us is a direct result of how itwas contructed; not accidentally by a Big Bang, but rather fromthe deployment of black holes that worked long and hard to build all of the cosmic spheres and then organize and control the spheres into billions of solar systems inside of millions of galaxies.’ The Trillion Theory (TT) book series (5 books), by self-made cosmology writer Ed Lukowich, is the story of how our cosmos incredibly grew from small beginnings a trillion years ago to 73 quintillion stars today.

Ed’s answers to these 4 secrets shows that a specific type ofscientific design was used throughout the project of building ourcosmos; a design feature seen within atoms, planets, solar systems,and within the billions of galaxies. The notion of cosmic design doesset off a firestorm with many people. ( Detailed expandedanswers can be found in Ed’s 4 previous cosmology books.
