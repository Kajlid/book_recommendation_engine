  "description": "Pretty boy Liam Walker is unlucky in loveâ€¦LiamMy newest obsession is nothing like any of my past hookups.The tattoos? Not exactly my type. A perma-scowl and general leave-me-alone attitude? Yeah, that's the kind of thing I usually stay away from. And, sure, is it surprising that suddenly those things seem to be everything I want? Absolutely. But the most shocking part about all of this is that the person who's got me all out of whack... isn't a girl.Bash is a six-foot-four-tatted personal trainer who seems to want nothing to do with me and my confused self. Until I'm naked, that is. And it's great when I am, but as soon as I'm dressed, he's more than ready to say goodbye.But if there's one thing getting a taste of Sebastian Crawford has taught me, it's that one taste just isn't enough.SebastianI don't know how to take Liam and his obvious crush on me, but it's clear that he did not sign up for the kinds of workout sessions I'm used to giving. So, I take him home, giving us both what we so clearly want, and settle on my choice to say goodbye as soon as it's done.But that goodbye is a little harder than I anticipated, and finding out that our time together was his first time with a guy, period, has me regretting the way I so easily tossed him aside. Liam is more sensitive than I originally believed, and after being cheated on by his last girlfriend only to move on to me, I can't help but feel that he deserves better... better than me.But if there's one thing getting a taste of pretty boy Liam Walker has taught me, it's that I'm willing to change my emotionally stunted ways.",
