  "description": "Attention Lenore fans: Roman Dirge is back with an all-new storybook-format tale. This time, it's the tragic story of a cat named Cat, and his misfortunes in life due to his enormously oversized head. This digest-size tale (5.5 x 8.5?) comes with a glossy card-stock cover with color art on the inside covers as well as outside, and includes an all-new back up story by Dirge, which he says is not as good. You be the judge.",
