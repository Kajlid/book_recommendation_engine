  "title": "For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto",
  "description": "A classic that for over two decades has been hailed as the best general work on libertarianism available. Rothbard begins with a quick overview of its historical roots, and then goes on to define libertarianism as resting \"upon one single axiom: that no man or group of men shall aggress upon the person or property of anyone else.\" He writes a withering critique of the chief violator of liberty: the State. Rothbard then provides penetrating libertarian solutions for many of today's most pressing problems, including poverty, war, threats to civil liberties, the education crisis, and more.",
