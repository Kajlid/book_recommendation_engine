This is a guidebook pointing you toward a better life—a life free from the baggage of the past and filled with the promise of a new future. Author Mary Tichi has been where you are: wondering how to move toward a healthier outlook. In Got Health-Style? Mary shares her own journey as she puts her years of personal coaching experience to work guiding you along the way. Her experience gives a unique and valuable perspective and offers accountability, motivation, and inspiration for any health goals. Supported by personal trainers and medical professionals, Mary’s journal holds the promise of a new life for anyone who is serious about taking even the smallest steps that will lead to huge changes.",
