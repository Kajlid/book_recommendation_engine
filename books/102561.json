  "description": "Hi, my name is Mona, and I am a real person just like you. I used to trust people that I shouldn’t have. I used to believe liars. In the past, I used food to mask my pain. I used to think that no one would or could ever love me. I don’t anymore. This is the story of my journey from victim to victor, from naïve to knowledgeable, from tragedy to triumph. Come along with me, and I will tell you what happened, how I survived, and how you can survive and learn to thrive no matter what pain and heartache comes your way. Come along with me, and I will tell you how I learned to create my own “happily ever after.”",
