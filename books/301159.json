This book contains multiple scenes of a graphic nature, including (but not limited to) swearing, sex, murder, descrimination, bigotry, and just about anything else you could think of. Reader discretion is most definitely advised. After losing everything dear to him, Charlie loses his grasp on reality. But when the whispers of his watcher find him, his eyes are opened to an impossible world.As he struggles to separate reality and fiction, acts of chaos and terror rage around the world. Law enforcement find themselves stretched, and governments clueless, but with the help of an unimaginable ally, Charlie must save humanity from absolute destruction.PRAISE FOR \"I read Watchers because the concept of the beings called watchers is familiar to me, but this tale is entirely original and gripping. The plot got better with every page and, coupled with the author’s no-nonsense prose, kept me reading late into the night.\" - Readers Favorite, ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\"A concept that is very relatable in what seems to be a crazy world sometimes.\"\"The author knew how to keep my pulse racing, and that was what made this book an absolute find.\"\"The book is both action packed and paced well. The writing feels very personal and human, instantly allowing you to be drawn into the narrative.\"\"Great concept and very well written. It had me gripped. The book didn't slow down one bit.\"",
