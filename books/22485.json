  "description": "What readers say about Quiet The Dead... “… everything a Southern mystery should be…beautifully written…Dr. Promise McNeal is a wonderful character…great story…” Mark de Castrique, author of the Sam Blackman Mysteries, writes, “Quiet The Dead will keep you guessing until the final, surprising revelation.” Book one of the not-so-cozy Promise McNeal Mystery series introduces retired psychologist and Atlanta transplant to the Western North Carolina Mountains, Promise McNeal, who doesn’t believe in coincidences. Promise believes the universe always has a plan, and sometimes that plan may include messages from the dearly, or not so dearly, departed. Just how her dream of a hanged woman dangling over a creek fits into that plan, she isn’t sure. But when she accepts a lucrative consulting job from her fair-weather friend, Atlanta attorney Garland Wang, she has a sense she’s about to find out. Garland says the assignment is a piece of cake, though, as usual, Garland is selective in sharing information and Promise finds herself digging into something that isn’t at all like cake. But dig she does. After all, her nest egg has hatched and flown with the four winds since her move to the mountains and Garland pays well. She’s also more than curious about who killed the wealthy socialite, Stella Tournay, and why Stella haunts her dreams. But then, as Promise is within a hand’s grasp of unraveling the truth about Stella’s death and a shocking secret about the Tournay fortune, another murder pushes her into the darkness with only her intuition as armor and clues from a murdered woman as weapons.",
