And while he is told to find whoever perpetrated the deadly attack, and find them fast, he is also warned not to look for Oracle itself.Lara Holsworth never expected Oracle to be in any danger. She would like nothing more than to keep it secret and Pierce away from itâ€”and from her, but hiding is no longer an option.
