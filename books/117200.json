  "description": "Three Black Boys: Tomorrow After Supper is an urban-fiction novel by Zangba Thomson that is intense as it is pointed and dark. This vivid, savvy, and altogether street-smart debut marks a bold new voice in literary fiction. The setting is South-side Jamaica, a neighborhood in Queens, New York, and home to Babita Harris, an Indian immigrant plagued with the deadly black fever disease. With a couple of months to live, her only hope of survival is a costly liver transplant. But with no health insurance, the chance of a surgery is slim. What she needs is a quarter of a million dollars in cash. Barnes, her only son, along with his two friends, Demus and Baker, spring into dangerous action to get the money. Though their road is paved with good intentions, the brothers in arms will be in for more than a few surprises and a whole lot of heat.",
