  "description": "Young Adult Paranormal Romance. Yesterday, his life was simple. For ages his day started the same. For centuries his day ended the same. He got the list and he went to work. After hundreds of years he had lost the ability to feel. Everybody was born, lived their life, however long they were supposed to, and then they died. It was not rocket science. The first time he saw Taylor Fergusson she was cocooned in pink. Everything surrounding her was in shades of pink. He stood next to her cradle and he looked down at her beautiful, peaceful face. There was no way he could make himself reach out to touch her. She was so tiny, he could not justify it to himself why he should take her life, her soul with him, when she had not even had a chance to live. The system kept trying to correct itself, until one morning seventeen years later her name appeared on his list again. They had a deal and he had to escort her across the valley of the shadow of death, before the Angel of Death came for her personally. Lynette Ferreira has written over twenty-two stories and at the moment she has nine more stories in various stages of completion. When she is not banging away at her keyboard, she can be found curled up with a book from her to-be-read list far too long for one lifetime.",
