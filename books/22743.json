  "description": "Picking up the story shortly after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, \nNo Unhallowed Hand\n--volume 7 in the series The Work and the Glory--takes the saga of the Restoration and the fictional Steed family from the end of June 1844 to February 1846.As this volume opens, it is a time of great sadness and of uncertainty. Having lost their beloved prophet, the Saints witness a series of power plays by those who would use the opportunity to further their own interests. It is not long, however, before the Lord's purposes are made apparent and the Twelve take their rightful position as leaders of the Church, with Brigham Young at their head.",
