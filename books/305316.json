  "title": "Panzer Aces II: Battles Stories of German Tank Commanders of WWII",
  "description": "- Sequel to the well-regarded Panzer Aces - Chapters on Hermann von Oppeln-Bronikowski, Kurt Knispel, Karl Nicolussi-Leck, and other great commanders With the same drama and excitement of the first book, Franz Kurowski relates the combat careers of six more decorated German Panzer officers. Extensively researched, these gripping accounts follow the men and their tanks across three continents into some of World War II's bloodiest engagements. They campaigned with Rommel in the deserts of North Africa, participated in the monumental tank battle at Kursk, and, maneuvering only by muzzle flashes, fought frightening small-unit contests in the dark of night. Master tacticians and gutsy leaders, these men are legends.",
