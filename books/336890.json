  "description": "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE A SECRET AGENT?Author Clara Winston was snuggling in for the night when the strange men burst into her carriage house apartment. Terrified, she couldn't make sense of their heavy Russian accents, but they seemed to be demanding the whereabouts of the \"real\" Magic Dragon -- the one she had dedicated her last romance novel to. \"Under the bed,\" she managed to squeak out, wondering why in the world they wanted her old gray Persian cat, Puff...When they went to look, Clara escaped out into the darkness and right into the strong arms of a magnificent stranger -- a man as sensual and exciting as the perfect lover she described in her books, but had never found in real life. He was CIA agent Jack McClain, code-named \"Magic Dragon,\" a man running for his life and taking Clara and Puff with him into a wild spill of hair-raising adventure, deadly espionage... and unforgettable love.",
