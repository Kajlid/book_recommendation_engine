  "description": "A close study of the rivalry between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer at the French Open, THE CLAY RAN RED is the latest collection of tennis insight by the well-known author, journalist, and blogger, Peter Bodo. Federer and Nadal played their first match at Roland Garros in the semifinals of 2004, where Bodo—courtside and reporting on every meeting of the tennis titans in Paris—picks up the story. He weaves together his on-the-scene dispatches to create an illuminating narrative that covers every aspect of this great rivalry, from the underlying psychological issues, to tactics and the place of each man in tennis history, culminating with the final of 2009. Along the way, Bodo also introduces secondary characters and rivals, and gives a richer and deeper understanding of clay-court tennis taking into consideration the unique demands it makes on the players.",
