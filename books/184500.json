  "title": "No Mate of Mine",
  "description": "Bound and Bonded Book 5 (Can be read as standalone)  Everyone at the Bound and Bonded Club, and the Washington Pack believes that Roger has never wanted to have a mate because he is too busy having fun with the variety of subs the club has as members. No one knows that Roger did in fact meet his mate, ten years before. Problem was, the boy was literally that, only twelve years old, and Roger left him alone thinking his mate would be safe in his home pack until he was ready to settle down. He was wrong.  Cameron Slater didn't want to be born an Omega wolf, especially not in a homophobic pack. When he was kicked out after his first shift, he spends two years on the streets before being taken in someone calling himself Master Donoghue. Four years later and Cam was wishing for death - anything would be better than having to service his sadistic Master and his sick friends.  A rescue mission, rabid vampires with a taste for Omega blood, and an overly possessive sub are just some of the obstacles standing in the way of an HEA for these two men. Is being Fated Mates enough to withstand the storm, or will Cam be dead before he and Roger have a chance to build a life together?  Warnings - this is a gay shifter true mate story. Includes BDSM references although no actual scenes, reference to past abuse, a sweet Alpha wolf who will do anything for his mate, and a poor Omega too afraid of his own shadow half the time and who just wants acceptance.",
