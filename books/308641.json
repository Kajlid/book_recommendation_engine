  "description": "Miss Dove had taught geography in the same school for thirty-five years; some people in town thought that was too long. Miss Dove whose life at 19 had changed abruptly when her father died leaving her with a secret debt to play, was a stern disciplinarian with old-fashioned ideas and ideals. But on the April day when she was stricken in the classroom the whole town came to realize how much Miss Dove had meant to their lives.",
