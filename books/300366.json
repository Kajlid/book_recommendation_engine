  "title": "Ballad of Hysteria",
  "description": "Panic. Frenzy. Anxiety. Hysteria. All words I would use to describe not just how I feel inside, but how my life is on the outside too. I left home to follow my dreams instead of the guy. But I can’t keep away from that guy. He’s the rock-and-roll bad boy, the drug I can’t quit. We’re toxic, but my addiction to him is suffocating me. He is the stains on my skin that I can’t get away from. Marks, scars, and art. Air. I need air—fresh air—to breathe. I think I found it. But not in the one who’s supposed to help me through the fog. It’s… unexpected. He’s unexpected. But we don’t belong in each other’s worlds. I’m red lipstick and tattoos, and he’s suits and ties and everything I need. He’s the ballad to calm the hysteria inside me.",
