  "title": "Poet In The Gutter",
  "description": "“With a few deft strokes Baker paints an intriguing and believable portrait of his hero, leaving the reader wanting to know about Sam and his life in the city of York. It is tightly written in an urgent and individual style. An engrossing read which grips from the first chapter.” Robert Beaumont, Yorkshire Evening Press.“Exceedingly cunning, laid-back plot. Genial, fast and funny.” Philip Oakes, Literary Review.“Baker’s Poet in the Gutter turns into something quite unexpected. John Baker does not soften any of the real horrors of life in an abusive family, surviving alone on the streets, or fighting drink, degradation and solitude, but he has used them as the basis for an entrancing – and funny – fairy-tale in which all the dragons are slain and the good guys come out on top.” Natasha Cooper, novelist, Times Literary Supplement.",
