She’s too preoccupied attempting to determine what makes the beast so beastly. It might be the taxing visits from the aged enchantress who cursed him or his growing vexation at not being allowed to touch Benella.  In order to gain her freedom, she must find a way to break the curse, but first, she must help him become a better man while protecting her heart.  **Intended for adult readers due to sexual situations, violence, and moderate language.",
