  "title": "Long-Fangs: The Union of Tribes",
  "description": "An immortal headhunter chief leads the last savage Amazonian tribes against a city taken over by Kurupuri, the evil jungle god. It’s a story about guns versus arrows. Trees versus asphalt. Past over present. But most of all it’s a story about the dangers of the modern world blindly destroying its own mysteries.Sarah, an American journalist who arrives to the jungle to write an article on primitive tribes, finds out that her guide is a man of extraordinary extremes: a nineteen-year-old face with a five-hundred-year old mind, a headhunter but also a Harvard graduate, a fighter and a wise man all in one. Long-Fangs has one goal: to unite his people against the tree-cutting invaders, and one fierce enemy: a cold-blooded mercenary hired to kill him and wipe out his entire tribe.At first just an observer gathering information for the feature story of her life, Sarah joins Long-Fangs in his quest to unite the savage tribes, deep into a fantastic world untouched by civilization, and is soon forced to take a side: the strange, Cockney-accented mercenary, captured after a fierce battle, or Long-Fangs, a headhunter going to war against everything she regards as the civilized world.",
