In these rampant flashbacks, he narrates the story of his brash lifestyle and his uncanny desires, the women he fell in love with and how he broke their hearts. In his poetic anecdotes and karmic insights, he shares the learnt lessons from the Bad, BAD world. With his dashing good looks and acquired skills of seduction, Uday makes his way back to love, only to find himself face to face with his most dreaded fantasy. What follows, is a journey of the future, past and present, where the only constant factor that always burns, is him.",
