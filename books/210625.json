  "description": "Set in a small town near the sea, Jake is cycling near the MOD site on the outskirts of the town when he sees some noxious slime oozing under the perimeter fence. Stopping to investigate, he is seen off by an armed guard, but not before his bike is swallowed up by the toxic substance. His friends determined to investigate, but are captured just before a major slime breakout. They have to get out before the slime takes over the town and reaches the sea, where it will grow, flourish and take over the world.",
