If you're one of the tens of thousands of people who read the free short story, ‘Jailbreak,’ also by Booth and Shannon, this is your opportunity to find out what happens after that terrifying first night of the zombie apocalypse. And those of you encountering The Hungry for the first time are in for the ride of your life. Remember... Aim for the head!",
