  "description": "Forget what you know about the god of love. He isn't a round baby with a bow and arrow strapped to his back. He doesn't fly to and fro while smiling at painters, sculptors, and digital artists along the way, thrilled to pose for his admirers. He isn't angelic, happy, or bashful.Cupid is an angry teenage girl who wears jeans and sneakers more days than not. She is constantly battling to keep her hair the size of a small country rather than a continent. She is simultaneously isolated and overexposed in every room she enters.You can trust me. I should know. I am Cupid.Cupid begins with a young godâ€™s decision to abandon her universe-granted gift for inspiring love, over which she has little control, and ends with a choice that will reverberate across the lives of mortals and immortals everywhere. When everything a young god has ever known is questioned and everything an immortal has ever feared comes true, no life will remain the same.",
