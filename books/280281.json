  "description": "A lonely wife. A neglectful husband. A 6'5\" tall drink of hot chocolate with sensuality to spare.  Where will things end with Claire and Tony? After seeing something wildly erotic with her new friends, how will Claire deal with her new fantasies. Can they stick to the rules they set for themselves, or will the sexual tension cause them to cave in? This volume closes out their story... for now.  Alan Austin is a national award winning author now writing erotic fiction under a new pen name and outside of his established publication outlet in order to delve into some of his deepest desires and fantasies. Alan and his wife are both authors who enjoy the wilder side of life and leverage some of their own experiences along with a healthy dose of imagination to heat things up in their writing.  Alan is a mid-thirties family man from the Midwest United States with an amazing wife and the best kids in the world. He enjoys working out and reading when he has time between family activities and writing. Alan grew up on the west coast before moving his family inland to make a home for himself. He is an active volunteer in his community and loves serving others.  Alan and his wife enjoy sharing their wildest fantasies and he uses his short stories as vehicle to share them with others.
