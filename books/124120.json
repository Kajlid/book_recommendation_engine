  "description": "THE MacNAIR of MacNAIR, CONMAN EXTRAORDINAIRE, PULLED INTO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE BY DESPERATE REVOLUTIONARIES Finds his life endangered by madmen of every stripe The Earl sighed deeply. \"What is there to say other than that the sixth Napoleon is now upon the throne in Paris and the entire world must suffer the whims of the French tyranny.\" \"And England herself is ruled by Bonapartes?\" \"They call themselves Bonaparte-Hanover, but it comes to quite the same thing: the darkest tyranny prevails.\" \"Hard to fully comprehend,\" muttered the MacNair. \"What a remarkable man the first Napoleon must have been. Wicked, to be sure, but still: to have conquered all of Europe -- remarkable!\" \"Perhaps. To me the fact of his wickedness far exceeds his remarkableness.\" The Earl of Kensington scowled. \"But then again, what should one expect from a man whose sole contribution to Western civilization is the invention of the flush toilet?\" \"And who is that?\" asked the MacNair, bewildered by the strange turn this conversation had suddenly taken. \"Why Napoleon Bonaparte, of course. You mean you don't go to the bonny in your own world?\" Desperately jumping from universe to universe and century to century, on the run from berserk Emperors, secret policemen, vengeful wives, and maddened doppelgangers, the supremely unruffled MacNair still finds time to save an empire, marry an heiress, and invent the two hallmarks of modern civilization, the indoor flush toilet and French Champagne!",
