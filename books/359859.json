  "description": "My work is my mistress. When I became a cop I knew a relationship was out of the question. Who wants to date let alone marry a man who might not come home at the end of a shift. That’s why I’ve never put too much stock into dating. Do I wish there was someone waiting for me at the end of the day? Yes. Do I wish I had someone to call my queen? Definitely. But one call, one misfiring alarm could change that all. There is just one problem. Would she go for an older man like me? She could have any man at her feet, worshiping her. I know what I want and it’s her. Now it’s time to make her see that I’m what she needs.",
