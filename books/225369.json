  "description": "Owen Owen Olsen needs a familiar. His magic is unbound, pure, and utterly vulnerable to the many witcheaters roaming the world just looking for a tasty little morsel like Owen to swallow up whole. Only bonding with a familiar will make him safe. But no matter how many times Owen performs the ritual to summon an animal to be his servant, guardian, and protector, it just doesn't work.  Owen’s grandmother assures him it just takes time—that his familiar will find him—but time is the one thing Owen doesn’t have. Every minute of every day is another chance for a witcheater to hunt him down, tear down his shields, and eat him, and the stress and fear are killing him.  Then he meets Luke Wolfman.   Luke Luke Wolfman is a werewolf in need of a solution. He’s been exiled from his pack—banished for having the audacity to sleep with the alpha’s son—and living on his own is eating him alive. His wolf needs his pack like his body needs water, and he won’t give up on finding his way back to them.  He needs a plan. Something that will force his alpha to forgive him and accept him back into the pack. But knowing you need a plan is very different from having one, and Luke doesn’t.  Until he meets Owen.  Owen Olsen is a witch, and Luke’s ticket back into the pack. All Luke has to do is seduce him and convince him to let himself be claimed, and he’ll be set. Alpha Grayson will have no choice but to forgive him if he comes back with a witch...   (This 87k word book has a HEA and no cliffhanger.)",
