  "description": "Growing up in a small town in Missouri, there weren’t a lot of opportunities to publish your first manuscript, so I would like to acknowledge PublishAmerica for taking a chance on my first book. Always being interested in the supernatural and seeking to learn more about the phenomenon inspired me to write this story. Although it’s fiction, I can relate to my character Nikkie. When I was a small child, from time to time, I experienced certain similar occurrences. I think we all want to believe that death is not final, and that we can still connect with our loved ones that have passed. So if you want to read a good ghost story, Behind the Red Door is for you. Special thanks to my husband Jim and my kids, Amanda, Jerry, and Steve, for their love and support. I would also like to thank my niece, Christy, for encouraging me not to give up.",
