  "description": "The acclaimed translation of Borges's valedictory stories, in its first stand-alone edition  Jorge Luis Borges has been called the greatest Spanish-language writer of the twentieth century. Now Borges's remarkable last major story collection, The Book of Sand, is paired with a handful of writings from the very end of his life. Brilliantly translated, these stories combine a direct and at times almost colloquial style coupled with Borges's signature fantastic inventiveness. Containing such marvelous tales as \"The Congress,\" \"Undr,\" \"The Mirror and the Mask,\" and \"The Rose of Paracelsus,\" this edition showcases Borges's depth of vision and superb image-conjuring power.",
