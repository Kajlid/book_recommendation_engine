This book contains dark—and sometimes violent—events that may be triggers for some readers.***I’m your typical high school girl…except for the fact that I’m the only seventeen-year-old virgin in town. Worst part?Everyone knows, and that makes me the hottest gossip topic in the school halls. Sick and tired of being teased and stereotyped, I decide it’s time to do something about my…well, sexual status. My hasty decision lands me in a world of trouble, but lucky for me a stranger comes to my rescue.Stephen is much older than me, and to complicate it even more he happens to work with my father. But there’s no denying the chemistry between us, and it’s simply impossible for us to keep our distance.Unfortunately, it seems that fate might be against us as the one mistake I managed to make comes back to haunt me. No matter how hard we try to make it work, there are just too many variables keeping us apart.In the end someone is bound to get hurt. Odds are, that someone is me.",
