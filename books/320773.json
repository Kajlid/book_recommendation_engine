  "description": "LondonFrom the outside, my life looks perfect – great son, amazing job, and a smile permanently plastered to my face, but they don’t know what goes on deep inside. Am I a tortured soul? Not even close, but I’m far from perfect. I haven’t had my shit together ever, especially not when it comes to men. That’s why when the hottest bachelor in the nation walks into my hotel, I know I have to ignore the instant attraction between us for two reasons – 1. I don’t date guests. 2. He’s so far out of my league. Too bad, my body and my heart don’t agree with my mind. I know this is a disaster waiting to happen, but how can I say no to the literal man of my dreams?JamieI’m mesed up. That’s all there is to it. My life was perfect until that night when I destroyed a family’s life. Now, I don’t even recognize the face I see in the mirror. I’m just a shell of the man I once was, but then she walks into my life. Her bright smile does something to me I can’t explain. I can’t stay away no matter how hard I try, but I have to, I made a pact with myself that I can’t break. Then, I see her face again, and I don’t give a shit. I need her like I need every breath I take.",
