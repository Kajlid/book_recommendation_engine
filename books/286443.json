  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B086HVFDFT) Can you hear it?  Whispering in the dark.  Secrets only the dark knows.  Joseph Moore, choir director for the First Baptist Church of Lenora, Nebraska, has secrets of his own. Terrible, lonely secrets. One that involves natural human desire. One that calls forth powers he cannot begin to understand. Both with the potential to destroy him and those he loves.  Now the world is changing. The darkness, the shadows, the ghosts, are closing inâ€”and Joseph and his lover, Kevin, are being stalked by a merciless demon, hell-bent on possession.  Can you hear it now?  There in the dark.  It's whispering your name.",
