Dumped and homeless on Thanksgiving, Dr. Leta Gaebel's having her worst day ever. Why not work another shift at the hospital? It's the only home she has now. When two mysterious hunks interrupt her desperately needed nap, she's not exactly upset. Then they offer her a chance to help save the world. Uncle and Zed must steal mission-critical supplies from a nearby hospital. They didn't intend to meet the exhausted but gorgeous doctor. They certainly didn't expect a sexy proposition from her--and they damn sure aren't turning her down. One more doctor in their unit and a woman to call their own? Yes, please! The trio gets assigned to the Atlanta safe house. But when Reverend Silo's mercenaries attack, Leta is forced to dig deep not only to save lives, but keep herself alive in the process. Will any of them survive to see another day?** A Siren Erotic RomanceThe books in this series are best read in   \n   Monkey Business \n   Monkey's Uncle \n   Monkey Wrench \n   Grease Monkey \n   Barrel of Monkeys \n   Flying Monkeys \n   Ice Monkeys \n   Code Monkey \n   Monkey See, Monkey Do \n   Monkeying Around",
