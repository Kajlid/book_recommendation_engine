  "title": "Twelve Months: A Fairy-Tale",
  "description": "Samuel Marshak was born in 1887. His start in literary life he owed largely to Maxim Gorky, in the circle of whose family he spent part of his youth. He first appeared in print in 1907, with lyrics of his own and translations of foreign poets. Marshak has been most prolific in the field of juvenile literature. He inculcates respect for the man who knows his job, respect for creative work. Marshak also wrote several plays based on Russian fairy tales and designed for the juvenile stage, including Twelve Months. Written in a light and witty vein, Twelve Months portrays twelve wise and just rulers of nature, and two girls of opposite type, the one good, whom they help, and the other bad, whom they punish. The play was awarded a Stalin Prize in 1946.",
