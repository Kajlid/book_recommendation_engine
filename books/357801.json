  "description": "In the late 1800s, newlyweds Jasper and Beatrice Gordon leave rural South Georgia to start a life in the capital of the New SouthCAtlanta. They start businesses that provide them solid footing in the emerging black upper middle class. The Gordons reach back into their home community and bring a young, trouble-bound relative into their family as a caregiver for their children. Though enmeshed in the family, Nellie never grows beyond the language and attitude of rural Georgia. The Gordons' two children forge lives as divergent as their parents, as one crosses the color line to marry and the other a cultural one to choose a mate. This saga continues to unfold when the unwed granddaughter, Missy, becomes pregnant during the 1940s, and the family has to make decisions to remedy an embarrassing situation. The full import of these decisions culminates during a summer in the mid-1960s when two adult adoptive children bond to resolve and confront issues surrounding their births and adoptions. Secrets Begging to Be Told gives a brief look at the culture of color and class in the first half of the twentieth century as well as ways in which this family deals with the phenomenon. It further depicts the generational dynamics of this family as it relates to handling crises.",
