  "description": "A government program gone wrong. Artificial insemination used to create a new breed of soldier. The year is 2020 and war still plagues our world. After suffering extreme loss of life, the United States government creates a voluntary program called Operation Vala, which involves the artificial insemination of women between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five to produce a child the military will claim and raise to be a new breed of soldier. When Kinsey Garrick finds herself an unwilling participant in the program, she chooses to fight back. When she escapes the compound with her newborn son, she becomes the target of a nationwide man hunt lead by the head of Operation Vala. Known only as Hakon, this man will stop at nothing to capture and destroy Kinsey, and take from her the one thing she's willing to risk it all for...her only son.",
