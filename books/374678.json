  "description": "Watch that first step. It could turn your life upside down.\nUntil a fall ended his Olympic diving career, John Andrews lived for the seconds he spent in the air. Now he's adrift on a college campus, grounded by paralyzing vertigo and double vision. Worse, he sees shimmering colors over everyone's heads.The last is hardest to ignore, and impossible when it comes to Mason. While sex with the hot, moody computer major gives John a rush as heady as diving, Mason's the only person John's ever seen surrounded by two distinct colors.Mason feels like a stranger in his own life. His lover is dead, and he drowns his guilt in bourbon and sex-until John's innocence reawakens the man he used to be. After Mason gives the young virgin a proper introduction to sex, he plans to send him on his way. But John sees too much to make things that easy.For John, their connection is more than just sizzling sex, it's something worth fighting for. The more he learns about the colors, though, the more he realizes the free-spirited Mason isn't free at all. John doesn't take second place to anyone-even the dead.Warning: Anyone wishing to read this title should be an adult, free from any condition that might be aggravated by the presence of a not-too-scary haunting, sizzling sexual chemistry, and angsty young men having mildly kinky sex. Other restrictions may apply. No additional equipment needed-unless you like that sort of thing.",
