  "description": "In this delightful children’s tale we are taken on an adventure as the tiny caterpillar explores the forest around him in search of new friends. But, finding he is so very different from the other creatures in the forest, he sadly returns to his old friend, the great big tree. After a miraculous transformation, he seeks approval from the other creatures, only to discover it matters not how different they are on the outside, but rather, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. This charming and enchanting story relays a powerful message of friendship, forgiveness, and how the physical differences between us do not make us who we are as an individual.",
