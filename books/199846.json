  "description": "A flatlander from southern Indiana, Walter Glover, while in his 50s, became fascinated by elite climbers who scaled the world’s highest mountains. One day he heard a voice say, “You know, you could do that.” After months of training, an unlikely odyssey began for this senior citizen, journalist, and hospital pastoral care chaplain. He undertook to climb the Seven Summits while raising money to fight America’s epidemic pediatric health issue—youth obesity. Mount Everest and Mount Kilimanjaro is filled with descriptions of the stark beauty, weather, and elements surrounding the world’s most famous mountains—and the creative forces that produced them. Vivid accounts of altitude sickness and a brush with cerebral edema add to the suspense. As Glover chronicles his interactions with guides and fellow climbers, we meet fascinating people, including Godlisten, the extraordinary guide on Mt. Kilimanjaro featured on the book cover with the author. Glover’s treks raised more than $130,000 for programs to combat youth obesity. The Seven Mountain Story series and Walter’s quest will energize people of all ages to become more active, increase their capacity to dream, and then train to realize those dreams.",
