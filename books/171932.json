  "description": "Now that the evil Count has been killed and dragged to Hell by the demon lords of the Godhand, Guts, the Black Swordsman, recalls his horrific upbringing and his brutal \"benefactor,\" the mercenary Gambino, whose parenting skills leave much to be desired. His bleak childhood spent wandering from battlefield to battlefield, Guts' growing skills as a slayer catch the eye of many, including the legendary Griffith, warrior leader of the Band of the Hawk, who is eager to test the fighting prowess of the young swordsman. As usual, any time that Guts is involved, there'll be Hell to pay!Created by Kentarou Miura and the inspiration for the wildly popular anime series, Berserk is an unholy hurricane of blood, carnage, and horror! Brutal, crude, and darkly funny, Berserk is not exactly for the theater crowd...unless the theater features pit fights!",
