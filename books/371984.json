  "title": "Ulrich",
  "description": "Ulrich is tired of being far from home. He misses the high mountains of his homeland, the familiarity and comfort of living amongst Pack. The thin, weak wolves of the lowlands grate, and he is ready to be done with his duty to the King and return home. Sent on assignment to find the reason behind the death of a fellow wolf, he hopes that by fulfilling the mission, he will have paid his dues and be permitted to return home.The very last thing he expects to encounter in the wild woods of the lowlands is a wild mage who on the surface seems to hate wolves and everything associated with them. But as Ulrich digs deeper, and danger forces them closer, he realizes that the mage is so much more than he seemsâ€”and too much for Ulrich.*Note: Consists of 2 parts, \"Wolf Given\" and \"The Seventh Son.\"",
