  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Callum Silver is returning to Camp Wanagi for his final summer with the Oracle of Senders. Cal has gained a lot from his years of camp, including a steady relationship with Meander Rhoades. But despite all of the lessons he's learned, knowing this is the end of his time as a Sender-in-Training makes Cal uneasy. He doesn't want to face ghosts for the rest of his life. But he's not sure what his world would look like without the Oracle in it. He can't escape the dead—can he really escape becoming a full-fledged Sender? And does he even want to?As the summer flies by amidst sector travels, new camper mentoring, and plenty of ghost sightings, Cal tries to distract himself from the future by focusing on the joy of having this last summer with the rest of Shade. But when the campers choose their final ghost, and Cal and Meander find themselves pitted against an entity more dangerous than any they've faced before, Cal can't stop wondering how the two of them will handle life beyond the Oracle—if they manage to make it through the summer alive. Return to Camp Wanagi—one last time.",
