  "description": "Dr Dakota Thomas isn't prepared for the gunshot victim who rolls through his ER doors. Michael Ricco looks like a young Marine who found a lot of trouble, but his dog tags tell a different story. Why was he shot in the back in the middle of the desert? Why were thirteen people murdered to keep his secret and how in the hell could he have a birth date of 1898? In a world were genetic experimentation pushes the boundaries of what one would do to live a little longer, perhaps the real question is how many must die to keep one person alive?",
