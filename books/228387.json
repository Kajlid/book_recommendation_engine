  "description": "David Mudfoot finds gold for the legendary Dawson and Alicia Wicks. He has survived grizzly bears, Alaskan storms, and professional killers. Mudfoot is deadly in a fight.He would rather sit at a computer than go on a date. He is rich, but unable to say so. He routinely works alone in dangerous wilderness. His beloved pet is a wolf-like monster dog that rides along in Mudfoot’s ugly truck.Mudfoot is easily among the world’s foremost targets for kidnappers --- not to mention certain terrorists, who soon will try to kill him.And now God is sending this overly complicated man to Victoria Winston.-----There's some satire here and plenty else to go with it.David Mudfoot and Tori Winston fall in love, fight terrorists, and attempt a political renaissance in the fictional New England state of Montshire. Meanwhile, failed politician Horace Crump struggles to hide the chronic shortcomings of Montshire Agricultural & Military University (MAMU). Terrorists use the Montshire forest for training. Prosperity threatens the dead hand of state government. Two monster dogs find one another and learn new tricks.Add in a couple of action scenes for good measure. Also examine the challenges the very rich face in helping the very poor.So, what else could you want? We think you'll have trouble putting this book down. Written in short sections, it should be perfect for a three-plane travel day.MIKVELK Publishing, LLCDallas, Texas USA",
