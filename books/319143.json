  "description": "Dear Mr. Brodie,I hope this email finds you well. Your well-being and personal growth are of the utmost importance to me, as a therapist. As such, I have decided it is in your best interest to continue individual therapy with another practitioner. This is due to the potential for boundaries being crossed between us.Attached is a list of colleagues I would recommend for you.Sincerely,Scarlett Shepard, MS, MFTDear Scarlett,Cool.Consider our sessions terminated.Now I can tell you how beautiful you are and how attracted I am to you.Let’s start crossing boundaries over dinner tonight. You’ll say it would be unethical, and I’ll point out that we’ve only had a few sessions. You’ll cite the age difference, and I’ll tell you how hot it is that you’re six years older than me. You’ll say you’re a mom, and I’ll remind you that I think your son is awesome. We don’t have to discuss my former attachments to former co-stars ever again.This is due to the fact that clearly my only personality issue is that I’m irresistible.Yours in well-being and personal growth,Dylan Brodie, W.M.H.T.A.T.Y.E.H.
