  "description": "FEARED FABLES * RED RUN A dark re-telling of the old tale, where Red Riding Hood isn't so little, and mightn't be so good after all.   The villagers call her Red. It's the colour of her lips, her cloak, and the blood that stains her when she returns from the woods. The villagers call her Red for many reasons, but most of all, they're too afraid to call her what she really is. Witch. But when a wolf stalks the village, Red might be the only one who can save them from the beast...the beast who has his sights set on her already. Red races against the three days until the full moon to uncover the wolf's identity, find out what he wants from her, and save herself. To hell with the village, Red just wants to save herself. That's what good witches do.   Red Run is a twisted take on the old tale, with some magic sprinkled onto a young woman's journey to find herself in dark times. First in the FEARED FABLES series. Soon to come: A warped Wonderland, a favourite Horse(wo)man, and a bad beast with a fancy for human-beauties. And, hello, Snow White was a vampire if I ever read one. All to come in the Feared Fables. Keep an eye out, or follow me on Goodreads for more.  Contains adult content and possibly triggering mentions. Contact me on Goodreads if you have any concerns.",
