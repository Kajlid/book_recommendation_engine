  "description": "A riveting, no-holds-barred exploration of the dark side of some of the coping mechanisms employed by operational aid workers serving in some of the world's flashpoints in order to deal with the multiple stresses to which they are subjected on a daily basis. \"IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO AN AID WORKER\" is a compressed, hard-hitting book that delivers a powerful, distilled punch, and a worthy sequel to the author's psychedelic first work. Not for the faint-hearted: strictly over 21 only. Contains sexually explicit language.",
