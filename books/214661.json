He and his friends - all former military, all injured in the line of duty - are finding it tough to demonstrate that they are still just as capable. All they need is a chance. So Duncan comes up with a strategy - start his own Security Company, and show the world they’ve all still got what it takes. But he needs someone with a little business know-how and the capital to put his plan into action…  Mandy Lennox is looking for a new opportunity to prove herself – and Duncan’s idea of starting a Security Company with other Vets that were injured in the line of duty is just the thing. Unfortunately, Duncan is reluctant to let an ambitious socialite anywhere near his business plan. But Mandy doesn’t plan on letting that stop her.
