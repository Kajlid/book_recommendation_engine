  "description": "The oilmen of Rainwater call Jill Jones a little wildcat. She doesn't take guff, and she'll use a broomstick on any roustabout who dares to spit on the porch of her Aunt Justine's hotel. The youngest of the Jones clan of Fertile, Missouri, Jill may find that her bravado is not enough to handle what lies ahead: a fight for the hotel, a killer stalking local women, and the arrival of good-looking, take-charge Thad Taylor, who arouses both her temper and desires. Danger is about to turn Jill's world upside down, calling into question everything she believes about her aunt, her own strength of will...and the needs of her heart.",
