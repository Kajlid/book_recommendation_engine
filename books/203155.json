  "description": "Librarian's note: See alternate cover editions of ISBN 1518815235 here and here.Mysteries uncovered from tombs. Secrets dug up from the grave. The truth about vampires has been unearthed. These are the journals of an ageless woman, a hybrid half human, half \"Pet Mer,\" (Sky Gods in ancient Egypt). A blood drinker from the ancients. Their story is scarce told, but Kesi's is all too clear... She appears a delusive goddess, wanting more than anything a family. Unable to bear children, and after the death of her husband, she travels the world searching for a way to share her bloodline (\"creating\" children, later known as \"Vampyre\"). She offers aid to those who need her. But her deep desire to have kin of her own blood is not met, until she comes across a Chinese alchemist named Yin - another of her race. Hope for a life with him is banished, however, by his dark desires to destroy all the world's hybrid offspring, to find a \"cure\" for the \"blood drinking aberrations\" created by those of his and Kesi's kind. Taking what she needs and leaving behind chaos, Kesi runs, always searching. Her everlasting quest takes her through history, from one continent to the next; from her home in Egypt, to China, Rome, Scotland, and finally France. But she is never able to outrun Yin, and eventually she must face her enemy and the darkness within herself in order to have that which she truly desires. Read her story, learn the truth behind the \"myth\" of what humans call the vampire, read about Kesiâ€™s unique take on her species and those they create, and discover the mayhem and bloodshed caused by a man determined to put an end to vampires forever.",
