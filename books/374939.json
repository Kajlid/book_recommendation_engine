  "description": "\"I didn't know if I wanted to stab him to death with my stiletto or take him outside for a quickie.\" The year is 1987. U2 is the most popular band in the world and Bella Stone - career girl and self confessed flirt - has just come face to face with the long lost love of her life. Bella's been through a lot in her 24 years and managed to survive it all. Now she's in a real dilemma. And his name is Ben. Back in 1979, 15 year old Bella -uncool girl in the cool crowd - found herself thrust into the limelight when she became the girlfriend of footballer, Ben James. 'Universally ignored by boys until now', Bella had no coping mechanisms to deal with events that followed. Luckily, she possessed an inner strength and a sense of humour she never knew she had. Now, Ben is back and by some nasty trick of fate, is sharing a flat with her best friend, Justin. The chemistry between them is a strong as ever. But Bella has grown up and moved on. Is it too late?
