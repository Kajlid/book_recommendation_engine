  "title": "The Jinx of Payrock Canyon",
  "description": "\"Hey, lookit! Somebody just bailed out of that plane!\" As they observed a parachute falling to the ground, Jason Himrod and his buddy Doc could no longer hear the plane's engine; maybe it had crashed. With this, Jason & Doc saddle up their horses and ride out in the high Colorado Rockies above the ghost town of Payrock to explore the mystery before them. THE JINX OF PAYROCK CANYON, another in a series of 1950's Whitman juvenile classic literature written by Troy Nesbit (aka Franklin Folsom), is a truly adventurous tale that involves the young reader's imagination in a western setting. Will Jason & Doc suddenly find themselves too deep in trouble when they unravel the mystery of the JINX OF PAYROCK CANYON?",
