  "description": "Eloisa James meets E. L. James in Lavinia Kent’s deeply sensual Regency romance! Torn between duty and desire, London’s most infamous madam fights for a future with the love of her life: an insatiable, ruggedly charming American sailor. Emma Scanton’s grandfather wants her to marry. Though he means well, he has no idea that his sweet, shy granddaughter leads a double life as the proprietress of Madame Rouge’s. “Ruby” doesn’t mean to disappoint her family—in fact, there’s quite a bit about the job she would gladly leave behind—but she cannot bear the thought of losing her most beloved admirer: Captain Derek Price. What would she do without his muscular arms encircling her waist or his rough chin scraping her cheek? No, marriage is out of the question, for Ruby and for Emma. Beckoned back to England to assume his role as heir to the family fortune, Derek will soon enter into a suitable marriage. But not without one last visit to see Madame Rouge. During the long months away, Derek could only think of Ruby: her luscious lips and cobalt eyes, the swell of her breasts against the bodice of her gown. Derek’s rich, attractive fiancée, selected for him by his family, is perfectly lovely. But Derek wants the ravenous, ravishing Ruby . . . for far more than one night. Ravishing Ruby is intended for mature audiences.",
