Despite her reputation as a heartless femme fatale, Ruby Macintosh is not at all what she seems.Only a fool would double-cross the Organization, but Ruby doesn't have any choice—not if she's going to save her brother and mother from her stepfather. So she places her life in the hands of a man who turns her on as much as he ticks her off…The fake engagement may be the beginning of a high-stakes game of subterfuge, but when their hearts get involved, Lucas has to decide whether to break the rules or break Ruby's heart.",
