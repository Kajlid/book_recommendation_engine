But it isn’t.Haunted by a shared secret that threatens to destroy their relationship and claim their sanity, Zane is on a one-man mission to prevent Ari from falling apart.Then Commander Skyee drops the biggest bombshell of all, and everything Zane has taken for granted about the future is shattered overnight.Always and Forever: That’s what Zane has promised Ari. Keeping that promise is about to become the hardest thing he will ever do.***Special Note from the author:This Novella is narrated solely from Zane Anders’ point of view, and it depicts the events leading up to Ari’s move to Planet Novo. This is NOT a follow on from where Beyond Reach, Book 2 in the series, left off. This relays events prior to True Calling, Book 1. In order to ensure consistency and maximise reading enjoyment, I recommend that the stories within this series are read in the following sequence:True Calling – Book 1Lovestruck – Short StoryBeyond Reach – Book 2Light of a Thousand Stars – NovellaDestiny Rising – Book 3.",
