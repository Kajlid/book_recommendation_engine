  "title": "Wild Flower Walker: A Pilgrimage to Nature on the Bibbulmun Track",
  "description": "It sounded like heaven! A 967km walking track traversing national parks and nature reserves in Western Australia. To wander alone on a path through a beauty filled, wildflower abundant and varied landscape of forest, plains and ocean. Imagine the bliss of walking for weeks on end, deepening into the silence, communing with the nature spirits - a pilgrimage into the heart of nature.Of course, dreams are never quite like the grounded reality of life. But even with endurance challenges, freezing conditions, food shortages, snakes and a few pairs of walking boots, the indescribable beauty and magic of the heart’s path shines through. This is the story of a pilgrimage into nature, a gentle reweaving and reconnection of Self within the tapestry of Nature itself.“This engaging travel narrative unfolds as a genuine quest, filled with both humour and pathos. I found myself cheering for Heidi, and left with the most lovely of gifts, the inspiration to one day walk these beautiful landscapes for myself.” Karin Lindgaard PhD, author of Nature, Consciousness and Feeling“Heidi traverses an ancient pilgrimage path, which mirrors in a myriad of ways a deeply felt inner odyssey. This story is a reminder that every moment can hold the deepest of teachings if the mind is ripe.” Sharon Shostak, award winning filmmaker.“There is a gentleness and clarity in the way Heidi writes, and it is this honesty and her wonderful humour that shines through the pages. Her love of nature and flowers fills the book with exotic colours and fragrances of the beauty and wisdom which she connects with so well.” Niki Kirstin, BBC Film editor; Findhorn facilitator.",
