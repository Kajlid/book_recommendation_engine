  "title": "The Medieval Quest for Arthur",
  "description": "In this original look at the world of Arthur, the authors show how the people of medieval England engaged with the Arthurian legend. Individual chapters cover Winchester as the site of Camelot, the crown of Arthur presented by Edward I, and the various items associated with Dover, Glastonbury Abbey, and other sites. Far from being credulous and gullible, it is clear that people actively debated Arthurian history. The book concludes with a discussion of the 16th-century antiquarian John Leland and those who followed in his footsteps, continuing to search for the physical remains of Arthur and his court.",
