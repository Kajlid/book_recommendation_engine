  "title": "Weasels Ripped My Flesh!: Two-Fisted Stories From Men's Adventure Magazines of the 1950s, '60s & '70s",
  "description": "From the jungles to the deserts to the mean city streets, the men's adventure magazines of the 1950s, '60s and '70s - pulpy periodicals like REAL MEN, MALE, MAN'S LIFE, TRUE MEN STORIES, UNTAMED, EXOTIC ADVENTURE and GUSTO - left no male fantasy or interest unexplored. War stories, exotic adventure yarns, \"true, first-hand\" accounts of white-knuckle clashes between man and beast, and spicy tales of sadistic frauleins and tropical white queens hungry for companionship ... topped off with salacious expos√©s of then-shocking subjects like free love, the Beat Generation, homosexuality, LSD and the secret horniness hidden in calypso lyrics.Josh Alan Friedman (BLACK CRACKER) and Wyatt Doyle (STOP REQUESTED) join collector and historian Robert Deis of MensPulpMags.com for a guided safari through a jaw-dropping collection of classic men's adventure magazine stories in the first anthology from the genre ever published.Packed with pulp fiction created by writers who later went on to greater fame, sensational illustrations by masters of men's pulp art and wacky ads taken from the magazines' back pages, WEASELS RIPPED MY FLESH! is your passport to a gonzo world where every dame was a femme fatale or a scantily-clad damsel in distress and manly men fought small mammals bare-handed.",
