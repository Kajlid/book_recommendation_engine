  "description": "They say the course of true love never runs smooth. That’s nothing a magical cupcake can’t solve.  Julie  Buttercream. Vanilla. Fondant. Dark chocolate. Brown sugar. Molasses. Baking has always been my true love, but it wasn’t until my mother’s death, and the unexpected inheritance of Serendipity Gardens, that my bliss called me. Bittersweet. But Serendipity Gardens has more to offer than just a potential shopfront. An unusual recipe box left to me by a distant relative might be the key to unlocking my dreams.  Too bad the most powerful family in Chancellor has plans that could turn those dreams to ruins—literally.  Too bad the son of that powerful family is just the kind of guy I’ve been looking for.  Horatio I suppose being heir to the Hunter family’s Blushing Grape Winery should make me happy, but nothing could be further from the truth. With my mother gone, my father has taken me under his wing, and I despise everything about the way he does business. Sour grapes, indeed. Instead of raising money for charitable causes, my true passion, I’m chasing my father’s manifest destiny.  Too bad his dream includes paving paradise.  Too bad the property owner is the sweetest woman I’ve ever met.  The Cupcake Witch is a stand-alone sweet romance and book 2 of The Chancellor Fairy Tales series.",
