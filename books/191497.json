  "title": "Zora Neale Hurston: Novels & Stories",
  "description": "When she died in poverty and obscurity in 1960, all of Zora Neale Hurston's books were out of print. Today her groundbreaking works, suffused with the culture and traditions of African-Americans and the poetry of black speech, have won her recognition as one of the most significant African-American writers. This volume, with its companion, Zora Neale Hurston: Folklore, Memoirs & Other Writings brings together for the first time all of Hurston's best writings in one authoritative set. \"Folklore is the arts of the people,\" Hurston wrote, \"before they find out that there is any such thing as art.\"",
