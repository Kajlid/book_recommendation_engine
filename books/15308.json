  "description": "Published to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I, We Will Remember Them commemorates the veterans who are no longer among us. Featuring an introduction by the 110-year-old Henry Allingham—the only living survivor of the Battle of the Somme—this new anthology will contain interviews with the families of World War I veterans as well those still alive from the British, German, French, Russian, and other armies. These men have left their mark on history, and their personal stories are deeply moving. A concluding chapter places the “Great War” in context.",
