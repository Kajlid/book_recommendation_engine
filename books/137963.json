  "title": "Dragons Are Extra",
  "description": "\"My experiences haven't been in any way unusual,\" says Major Lewis Hastings. It isn't very likely that the reader will agree with him. It comes to the lot of few of us to lead so varied, so exciting, so strenuous a life as the author of Dragons are Extra.Africa and Europe, war and peace, the desert and the sown, thought and action, all have their share in these reminiscences. Sights, sounds, even smells - the acrid smell of lion at close quarters, the sweet scent of a flue-cured tobacco barn, the damp smell of Africa round Primasole bridge in the Sicily campaign; people - Bushmen, Nazis, divers, the black and the white and the brown, the hairy-heeled and the sophisticated, the hard-boiled and the half-baked - all are threads in the multicoloured pattern of an amazingly varied life.And if anyone discovers a propaganda motive in the book, the writer will be, says he, as surprised as the cannibal who was eaten by the missionary.",
