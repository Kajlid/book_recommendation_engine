  "description": "The Mighty Roman is a funny, fast-paced, thought-provoking novel about baseball and the modern American man. A contemporary Mutiny On The Bounty – with baseball bats and pranks -- the story centers on the relationship between old-school minor-league manager Roman Meister, a macho behemoth appalled by the changes in “his country,” and the team captain, an elfin free spirit who flows easily among his multicultural teammates – and takes on Roman when push comes to shove. Is Roman mighty? Was Gatsby great?",
