  "description": "When May Young transfers to Rothschild University, her new roommate makes her a startling bet—she'll convince her CEO parents to hire May's struggling mother if May can be the first to warm the heart of Sebastian Crane, their school’s top competitive swimmer. Sebastian is gorgeous, genius, and a notorious loner with nothing but ice for anyone who tries to get close, including May—until she's the only one there to rescue him from the ocean when an unexpected injury causes him to nearly drown. Sebastian demands his moment of weakness be kept secret, so May extracts a promise: she'll stay quiet if he agrees to spend the rest of the semester with her and her best friend, charismatic playboy Tanner. May's curious, naïve nature begins to soften Sebastian's cold exterior, and soon there's no hiding the heat between them from an increasingly jealous Tanner—or from Sebastian's millionaire father, who doesn't want anything distracting his son. But the closer May gets, the more she realizes that Sebastian’s teetering on the edge. He’s in a losing battle with his inner demons, and May finds herself unable to pull away—despite her personal vow never to fall in love, and despite the fact that her roommate’s motives might be just as dark as Sebastian’s past.*Some scenes not suitable for younger readers.",
