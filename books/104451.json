  "description": "Television production manager Starlene White has spent her life trying to overcome what she calls her “white trash” childhood. Born to a mother that changed husbands like most people change their toothbrushes, and after having raised her three younger siblings, she’s made a vow to never marry, or have children. For Star, family is overrated—big time.When Star receives a letter from her childhood nemesis, Cade O’Brien, asking her to come to Alaska to remove her deceased aunt’s possessions from her mobile home, a mobile home that sits on O’Brien land, Star’s first thought is to refuse. Cade made her childhood a living hell. She never understood why he disliked her so much, and the last thing she wants is to comply with his wishes. However, business takes her to Seward when her television show Update This! begins a series of home makeovers, using the homes of single Alaska men. Hoping to kill two birds with one stone, Star heads home.Cade O’Brien has always wanted a big family. A widower, struggling to raise his three kids while running a bed and breakfast/charter fishing business, he has his hands full. When he sends Star a letter, asking her to empty out her aunt’s place, he’s surprised when she shows up. And he’s even more surprised by the guilt and regret he feels at the way he treated her when they were kids. Cade sets out to make amends with Star.But old hurts die hard, and Star is slow to warm to Cade, and even slower to warm to his kids. Yet, Cade refuses to give up, especially when he knows in his heart that this hometown girl is the girl of his dreams.",
