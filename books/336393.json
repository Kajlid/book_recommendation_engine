  "description": "I know how villains are made.I’ve watched their secrets rise from the ashes and emerge from the shadows.As part of a family tree with roots so twisted, I’m strangled by their vine.Imprisoned in a world of decadence and sin, I’ve seen Gods among men.And he is one of them.He is the villain.He is the enemy who demands to be the lover.He is the monster who has shown me pleasure but gives so much pain.But something has changed…He’s different.Darker.Wildly possessive as his obsession with me grows to an inferno that can’t be controlled.Yes… he is the villain.And he is the end of my beginning.",
