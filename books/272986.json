  "description": "A Race Against Time There’s no rest for the wicked. Or for demon slayers. I’m both, so things have been busy. The sort of busy where I spend all my time trying not to get killed or discovered for what I really am—a Dragon Blood with the deadly power to create new magic.When a mysterious bomb goes off in my town and my closest friends are turned to stone, it becomes a race against the clock to stop the demon who is still at large. Every six hours, another bomb takes out more people.My only chance at catching the demon and reversing the spell is to team up with the too-sexy bounty hunter, Declan O’Shea. It’s nearly impossible to resist him, but I must. We’re natural born enemies, and if he discovers what I am, life as I know it would be over.Dragon Blood is a fast-paced urban fantasy adventure starring a kick butt heroine, a powerful hero, and magic that will blow your socks off.",
