  "description": "In this beautiful picture book by renowned artist Lisa McCue, Little Bunny discovers the importance - and pleasure - of dancing to your own kind of music.More than anything, Quiet Bunny loves the sounds of the forest: the birds chirping, the wind whispering shhhhh through the leaves, and, especially, the night song all the rabbits listen to.But, one day, he wonders: 'how can I join in?' Bunny wanders the woods asking animal after animal - but he just can't ch-cheet like the cricket, ssssss like the hissing snake, or o-uuuu like the howling wolves.Nothing feels just right - until Little Bunny finds the wonderful beat that's his and his alone.",
