  "description": "Surrounded by a loving family, relatives, and friends, Keisha is a small-town girl on the move up to her proper place in society, or is she?In Keisha's Killing , by Delores Dudley, it is tempting to name all that is wrong in the world right now, where the brief snap of a finger may be all it takes to change the course of one person's life. Yet in Keisha, there is that aspect of life, too, that may yet redeem and make up for all the dark notions of living, almost to the point of making them too accidental to be of real consequence.Find out how a little girl's unassuming life unfolds as she ventures outside of the little world she has known, where a deceptively simple turn of events could pose a situation that would challenge the things she has believed all her life.",
