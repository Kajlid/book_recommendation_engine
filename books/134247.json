  "description": "This is a sweeping, gut-wrenching portrait of soldiers at war from a man who fought, and saw friends die, in Vietnam. It is a saga of men from all walks of life, thrown together by the arbitrary nature of enlistment and the draft, of how they are forged into a team. Then in the unrelenting combat of Vietnam, each man in the team is put to the ultimate test -- combat. How they respond dictates who will live and who will die in the treacherous jungles and waterways of Vietnam.",
