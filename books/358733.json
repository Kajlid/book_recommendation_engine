  "description": "Illegitimate Polly Brandon has never felt like more than an ugly duckling. So she's amazed when Hugh Philippe Junot pays her such close attention as they sail for Portugal.Under ordinary circumstances she knows this distinguished lieutenant colonel of marines would never have looked at her, but having his protection for the journey is comforting--and something more that she's afraid to give a name to. Should she trust what she sees in Hugh's eyes--has she turned from an ugly duckling into a beautiful, desirable swan?",
