So when her cousin returns from Europe with a wealthy fianc√© in tow, Jorie's ready to take a good, hard look at her intended -- but she's totally unprepared for his dark, attractive former guardian.A prominent litigator, Simon Grant is stuffy, serious -- and seriously \"corporate\" -- definitely not freewheeling Jorie's type. So why does her pulse jump whenever he's around?This beautiful unconventional woman may be an ally in Simon's quest to prevent the impetuous young James from making a major mistake. But though Jorie's incredibly alluring, she's reckless and unpredictable -- with a deep inner passion Simon finds somewhat unnerving. If he's not careful, she'll have him feeling things he locked away inside himself long ago.But Lily and James know a budding romance when they see it -- and they'll do everything they can to help \"fire\" and \"ice\" mix to create something wondrous.",
