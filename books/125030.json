  "description": "Shade does very bad things, and she does them very well. She also doesn't exist. Trained as a thief, cat burglar, and master assassin, she’s a shade, a ghost. A chameleon that changes her face to suit her environment, no one who's ever seen Shade is alive to talk about it, and even Shade doesn’t know her true identity. When the man who raised them mysteriously disappears during a job, Shade and her brother are forced to work together against what appears to be the professional genocide of industry specialists. And Shade and Bas have already been targeted. As they continue to piece together a puzzle that spans continents and decades, they cross paths with another assassin with a reputation as dark as Shade’s, who seems to be manipulating the real game that none of them knew they were playing. But Shade has two tricks up her sleeves.",
