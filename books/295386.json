But reality is seldom as it appears In the days before she met her future husband, Vince Cooper, Nancy finished her college degree and had a bright future ahead of her. But then she met and fell in love with Vince, and her plans changed. Unfortunately, it wasn't until her honeymoon that Nancy discovered Vince's true nature-cruel and abusive one minute, sweet as can be the next. A dual personality.In the months that follow, Nancy falls into a vicious cycle. To avoid the horrible, abusive confrontations with her husband, she agrees to his lifestyle-drugs, sex, alcohol, and her complete submissiveness. Nancy believes the only way her husband will change is to have a baby, and her wish comes true a few months later. But things do not change, even when Nancy becomes pregnant with their second child.Feeling isolated, depressed, and fragile, Nancy struggles to hang onto her sanity. When she is arrested on drug charges, she must go through a two-week counseling session, and she finally understands the control Vince has over her life. But will she be able to break the cycle of abuse before it's too late?",
