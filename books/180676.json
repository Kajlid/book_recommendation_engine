  "description": "For the Children is a narrative memoir that tells the true story of the author’s family's escape from Hungary and immigration to Canada in 1956, told from the viewpoint of the seven year old child he was at the time. After numerous attempts to flee from a revolution torn Stalinist Hungary ending in capture and disappointment, the author’s parents’ pursuit to give their children a better life finally bears success as they walk to freedom across a well guarded and mine strewn border. This is a gripping tale of bravery and the will to survive, the sometimes heart-breaking struggle for freedom, and the wonder and difficulties inherent in starting a life in a new country.",
