  "description": "Once Upon a Time…...ageless tales were told from one generation to the next, filled with both wonders and warnings. Tales of handsome princes and wicked queens, of good-hearted folk and evil stepmothers. Tales of danger and caution and magic...classics that still echo in our hearts and memories even to this day, told from old, cherished books or from memory at Grandma's knee. Oh yes, tales have been told...but never quite like these. Journey with us through the pages of Gaslight and Grimm to discover timeless truths through lenses polished in the age of steam. contains:In Wolf’s Clothing by James ChambersWhen Pigs Fly by Christine NorrisFrom the Horses (sic) Mouth by Bernie MojzesThe Steamy Tale of Cinderella by Danny BirtThe Clockwork Nightingale by Jean Marie Ward !The Walking Horse by Jeff YoungThe Patented Troll by Gail Z.
