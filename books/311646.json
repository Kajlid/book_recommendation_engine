  "description": "My name is Oakleigh Wells and I shouldn't be here. That's what my father has drilled into my head since the day I was born. I don't know what real love is, not the way most people do at my age. If I could, I'd run away, but leaving Valor terrifies me. I wish I could fall asleep and wake up in a world that isn't so dark.She's thick, beautiful, and entirely too young for me. The shadows in her eyes tell me she's been through a lot. I convince myself to walk away from her. She doesn't need someone twice her age with just as many demons. That is until I see a guy put his hands on her in a way he shouldn't. As President of the Men of Valor MC, I don't let that stand. All it takes is for her to look up at me with her big beautiful brown eyes for me to fall. Now she's mine and always will be.",
