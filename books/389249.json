  "description": "Interweaving diaries penned forty years apart, The Bird House blends the fierce voice of a woman struggling against dementia to bond with her only grandchild, with her point of view as a young wife and mother. We witness the secrets of Ann Biddle's family through every lens: from the clarity of the rearview mirror, through the haze of Alzheimer's, and as a young housewife in 1960s suburbia grappling with illness, death, heartbreak and tragedy.",
