  "title": "Itche & Ari",
  "description": "Ari Wexler, a trans guy in his late twenties, is barely scraping by. Music has always fed his soul, but these days his band practically has to pay to play a gig and his not quite dreamy, but safe-feeling job as a clerk at a music library becomes unbearable when his beloved boss leaves. Meanwhile, his love life is such that he is thinking about abandoning romance altogether and joining the National Fern Society. Thank goodness for his best friend, Itche Mattes! Together they've gotten through hard times before. Ari begins to wonder if their mutual adoration might not be some variation of \"happily ever after.‚Äù But a famous actress comes to town and sweeps Itche off his feet, leaving her dreadful sidekick to step on Ari's toes. As Itche sails away on the love raft (which, to be fair, is not without a few holes), Ari sets sail for despair. When a fascinating music project becomes available to him, Ari is faced with a choice: to remain within his comfort zone, however small and stifling, or to take a risk that could bring meaning and joy to his life.",
