  "description": "From 1939 to 1960, Ernest Hemingway made Cuba home to his life and work. Upon winning the Nobel Prize, he pronounced himself a \"Cubano Sato\"—garden variety Cuban—and gave the award to the Cuban people. To this day the Cubans revere \"Ernesto,\" and the country that Hemingway loved remains unchanged in its character and beauty.Hemingway in Cuba is at once a literary journey for Hemingway aficionados and a rich companion to Papa’s time in Cuba and in neighboring Bimini and Key West. Hilary Hemingway gives new insight into her uncle’s life in Cuba, relating tales of his renowned passion for big game fishing, the women who competed for his affection, and the people who came to inhabit novels such as To Have and Have Not and Islands in the Stream. Readers of Hemingway will recognize Cojimar, the small fishing village featured in his best-known work, The Old Man and the Sea, as one example of how Cuba left an indelible mark on his work.In the care of Cuban curators since his death in 1961, Hemingway’s home in Cuba holds a trove of letters, books, and other documents vital to Hemingway scholarship. Hemingway in Cuba features revelations from the curators’ ongoing research at Finca Vigía, as well as details of the Hemingway Project, a historical collaborative agreement that allows select American scholars to examine this cache of Hemingway papers for the first time. Accompanied by 160 archival and contemporary photographs, Hemingway in Cuba is a must-have for the Hemingway enthusiast.",
