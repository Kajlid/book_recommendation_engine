  "description": "What if, in the near future, we could choose the body we wanted? We could visit a store front, much like a neighborhood mom-and-pop shop, and we’d see all the available bodies lined up in a glass-enclosed case. We’d be able to choose the body we wanted, purchase it, have an operation, and wham bam! wake up with our new body. Dr. Farkis begins his head transplant operations in secret in Oakland, California and Tokyo, Japan. When news filters out about his revolutionary surgery, individuals from all walks of life come forward, desperate for a new body and an improved life that only Dr. Farkis can offer. We Barry, so frantic for a new body, he stalks the doctor and bargains with a menacing ultimatum; Aiko, father of 19-year-old Kaneko, who demands that she undergo the operation to become more attractive to snag a husband; and finally, Baby, who finds out the hard way that demanding a new body may end up being fatal. Choosing the perfect physique from a smorgasbord of available bodies may seem like a dream . . . until it becomes a nightmare. *Are you a fan of the B-movie? You will enjoy this book - it's part serious, part scary and corny, and part seriously fun which may produce a giggle or two. It's also loosely based on the headlines of a real-life doctor who claims he'll become the world's first head transplant surgeon. See more",
