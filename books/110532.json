  "description": "Post-Civil War MississippiU.S. Marshal, Zack McCade, takes pride in protecting the good folks of Greenville—especially beautiful Dr. Suzanne Martindale. He doesn't always understand her need for independence, but he sure does like getting under her skin. It's not like he's looking to settle down—his job is too dangerous to risk taking a wife and family. In an era when women aren't readily accepted in the male dominated world of medicine, Suzanne doesn't have time for courting—especially a charming Cajun rogue like Zack. When he proposes a fake betrothal to keep the matchmaking town out of their hair, she's sure it's a bad idea but can't deny her longing for a respite from the over-zealous bachelors in town. Their ruse starts a fire in their hearts that neither expected, but will the re-emergence of Suzanne's real fiancé douse the flames?",
