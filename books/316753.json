  "description": "A fiery restaurant owner falls for her enigmatic head chef in this charming, emotional romance\nAmy Chambers: restaurant owner, micromanager, control freak.Amy will do anything to revive her ailing restaurant, including hiring a former reality-show finalist with good connections and a lot to prove. But her hopes that Sophie’s skills and celebrity status would bring her restaurant back from the brink of failure are beginning to wane…Sophie Brunet: grump in the kitchen/sunshine in the streets, took thirty years to figure out she was queer.Sophie just wants to cook. She doesn’t want to constantly post on social media for her dead-in-the-water reality TV career, she doesn’t want to deal with Amy’s take-charge personality and she doesn’t want to think about what her attraction to her boss might mean…Then, an opportunity: a new foodie TV show might provide the exposure they need. An uneasy truce is fine for starters, but making their dreams come true means making some personal and painful sacrifices and soon, there’s more than just the restaurant at stake.Carina Adores is home to romantic love stories where LGBTQ+ characters find their happily-ever-afters.",
