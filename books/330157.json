  "title": "Room Twenty-Eight: Their Willing Victim",
  "description": "When three men purchase my innocence, I can only pretend to hate what they do to me.Club Sin is a place of pleasure and sometimes of pain. People come here to indulge their fantasies, and for the strangers who've bought the chance to take my innocence, Room Twenty-Eight will be everything they've hoped for.I'm only here for the money. When the contract is fulfilled, Iâ€™ll pay off my debts and move on to a brighter future. At least, that's what I tell myself.Except, the three men who've bought me aren't strangers, and what they want from me is a lot more complex than I could imagine.Kylian, fierce and intense, wants to make me pay for the past.Nate was always my hero, but now he wants to leave his mark.Lyle, my childhood crush, has wickedness in his obsidian eyes, but the memory of our shared history lingers behind every touch.They introduce me to a world of dark desires and roleplay, and I'm their willing victim. I pretend I hate what they do to me, even when it feels like I might break apart from the pleasure. I ignore every sinister whisper and every controlling touch, even as I ache to obey.Because as hard as it is for me to surrender to their will, I know who they were before they were broken, and I'm determined to make them remember.",
