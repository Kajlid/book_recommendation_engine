  "description": "In 1976, 21-year-old Welshman, Kelvin Smith, met 18-year-old Richard Butler from the West Midlands whilst they were both serving at RAF Henlow, in Bedfordshire. Kelvin was and still is a poet, and Richard a keen guitarist. They soon found themselves writing songs together and, within weeks of meeting, they formed a band along with bass guitarist, Paul Clay and drummer, Bilbo Baggins, (they never did find out his real name). Richard played rhythm guitar and Kelvin was to be the lead singer, only because nobody else in the band would sing out front at the time, even though Richard had the better voice.The band was called, ‘Cucumber Droppings’ initially but, unfortunately, because of postings and detachments, etc in the forces, Richard and Kelvin soon became a duo and renamed themselves, Hot and Cold. This was because Richard’s stage name was Dick Hot and Kelvin was known as Kelly Cold. Ha!Both lads were avid fans of the Beatles and were very much influenced by them. Kelvin was also a huge fan of Gilbert O’Sullivan because of his lyrics.They spent a lot of time together writing as well as socializing, and were rarely seen apart, which got them into a lot of trouble with their mischievous antics.Richard was demobbed in 1979 and Kelvin was posted a year later. They lost contact up until the year 2001 when they rekindled their friendship and writing partnership by telephone and then later by WhatsApp.This book contains twenty-five of their many unearthed lyrics.",
