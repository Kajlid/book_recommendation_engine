  "description": "Why is everyone calling her \"Lila\"? Music teacher and part-time lingerie saleswoman Marnie Lundy's biggest thrill is playing piano at the local mall . . . until the night everyone seems to think she's somebody else! Suddenly she's being addressed in code, menaced by a man who claims to know her intimately and rescued by a handsome spymaster who thinks she's a threat to national security! But OPUS agent Noah Tennant has the feeling she's more Mata Hari than Mother Teresa. Could a woman this sexy truly be innocent, or is Marnie his opponent in a deadly game of spy vs. spy?",
