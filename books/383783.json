  "description": "When Marjorie Pay stepped into the Salt Lake Temple in 1937 to be married to Gordon B. Hinckley, she little knew what dramatic turns her life would take. How could any newlywed envision that she might someday be the eternal companion of the prophet and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?In Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley, dozens of family members and friends share experiences and feelings that demonstrate the character of a quietly remarkable woman. These vignettes combine with the words of Sister Hinckley herself, gleaned from talks, letters, and conversations, to create a portrait that is engaging and inspiring. From her profound yet simple faith to her optimism and sense of humor, from her love of mothering and grandmothering to her enthusiasm for learning, Sister Hinckley's personality traits are perfectly suited to her mission. She goes through life with a smile in her heart and a gift for loving that reaches out to embrace everyone she meets. As you meet her in these pages, you'll fall under the spell of her warmth, her genuineness, and her testimony.",
