  "description": "You are TARMUN VYKERS, the Reaper, laid low by a sorcerous wound and languishing in a sick bed for years until your services are unexpectedly required again, and the means to get you back on your feet rather conveniently appears in the person of Her Majesty's First Mage... CINDOR, the kingdom's most experienced wizard and a skilled politician. Can you trust him, and what will he ask in return for his help? And what of the beautiful healer, AOIFE, who insists on accompanying you on Cindor's quest? Surely, she's not as emotionally aloof as she pretends, and, if not, what is she hiding? LONG PETE, too, is caught up in Cindor's web. The wizard has plans for Long and his crew that may save the kingdom, but tear friendships and lives asunder. Ride with the half-crippled Reaper again, as he crosses a monster-filled sea and a dark and threatening continent to engage in the most unusual battle of his life and uncover an unthinkable secret. Are you a fan of: Joe Abercrombie's First Law series, Steven Erikson's The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Glen Cook's Chronicles of the Black Company, or Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicle?
