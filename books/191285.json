  "title": "Trading Alaska, Fur Traders",
  "description": "First of the three part series, Trading Alaska, Fur Traders is written by Alva Applegate, and edited by Sarah Matalas. In the style of Tom Robbins, Jitterbug Perfume, Skinny Legs and All and Richard Brautigan, The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster, Trout Fishing in America. Alva Applegate weaves a tale of discovery, intrigue, confounding visions, with a town of Northern Exposure-like characters that are as sexually liberated as possible while still possessing the ability to maintain the barest of threads in the civilized world. From erotic to hilarious, and at times perplexity romantic, this is one unique story that should not be missed.",
