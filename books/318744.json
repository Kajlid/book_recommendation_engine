  "description": "WHAT IF THE EVIL QUEEN WAS INNOCENT… BEFORE SHE WAS BETRAYED? In the realm of Jinn, enchantments and magical abilities are conceived and often exploited. At 17-years-old, Jezebel has developed a powerful shape-shifting Gift—and she’s determined to keep it a secret.When her friends find a portal to the human world, she reluctantly follows. There, she’s tempted to embrace her Gift. After all, no one but the humans will see. Unfortunately, one of her friends witnesses her secret, and he won’t let it go. He pushes her to use her ability for his own selfish purposes, no matter the cost. But when he crosses a line, Jezebel hits her breaking point. How far will his betrayal push her? THE SECRET GIFT is the first book in THE QUEEN’S RISE series, inspired by your favorite villains in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty and the Beast. It’s a spin-off from The Stolen Kingdom Series, but can also be read on its own. Over a century before the evil Queen Jezebel crosses paths with Arie, Rena, and Nesrin, she’s just an innocent Jinni girl… who was betrayed. If you love fairytale retellings like The Lunar Chronicles and supernatural abilities like the Graceling series, then you’ll love the Queen’s Rise series!",
