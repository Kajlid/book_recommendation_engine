  "description": "The first in a powerful new series from the author of THE RAINE STOCKTON DOG MYSTERIES... Almost two years ago the sleepy little community of Dogleg Island was the scene of one of the most brutal crimes in Florida history. The only eye witnesses were a border collie puppy and a police officer. Since that time Flash has grown from a puppy into a vital part of the Dogleg Island Police Department, and has lived happily with the two people who rescued him on that horrible Deputy Sheriff Ryan Grady and Police Chief Aggie Malone. Now the trial of the century is about to begin. The defendant, accused of slaughtering his parents in their beach home, maintains his innocence. Aggie and Ryan, the top witnesses for the prosecution, are convinced he is lying. But only Flash knows the truth. And with another murder to solve, a tangle of conflicting evidence to sort out, and a brutal storm on the way, the truth may come too late... for all of them. \"An ample murder mystery with an enthralling protagonist... thoroughly entertaining...\" --Kirkus Reviews \"Exceptionally entertaining and deftly crafted...\" --The Midwest Book Review More praise for the work of Donna “A maelstrom of suspense… gripping, intense” --Rendezvous “A major talent of the genre” --Publisher’s Weekly",
