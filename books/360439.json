  "description": "Bound by grief, branded by need too intense to ignore… After an accident kills Brett Miller’s parents, the reins of Steeplecrest Ranch fall to him. The arrival of rightful half-owner Cade Armstrong, who lost his parents in the same accident, only kicks up the tension. Brett would rather buy out Cade’s share and send the man back to New York, but his hands are tied. After seven years leading a hedonistic life in the big city, Cade returns to face his loss. Once he’s got acres of rolling ranch land back under his feet he discovers he wants to keep them planted on home ground—and show the man he’s lusted after since puberty just how good they’d be together. Then Cade’s friend, Jessica, arrives from the city and the sexual tension rockets from simmer to full boil. Brett finds himself incredibly turned on—and incredibly confused. Cade is through waiting for Brett’s mind to open wide enough to let love in. It’s time for the proper application of an emotional crowbar. Even if it means he could lose Brett forever.",
