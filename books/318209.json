Now a recent Stanford grad with a master’s in economics, she’s restless and bored in a desk job for U.S. Senator Colles in Washington. Letty’s ready to quit, but her skills have impressed Colles and he offers her a feet-on-the-ground investigative job in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security.Colles tells her that several oil companies in Texas have reported thefts of crude.
