  "description": "My job working for a clandestine government agency, AIR, allows me to use my powers without appearing crazy. With my partners, I protect the Lost, mythological creatures from other dimensions, and keep them hidden from the outside world. Throwing myself into work as much as possible keeps me focused, so I don’t have time to dwell on the uncertainty of the past. When a routine call starts with a gun pointed at me, I know it’s going to be a bad day, but at least it’s not my employer trying to kill me. Once the weapons are holstered, we discover a dead gnome. Was it natural causes or execution by an unknown assailant as the gnome's family claim? The case leads us to a string of deaths and a threat that could expose the Lost to the world. Forced to collaborate with teams outside of our agency means I need to keep my abilities in check. The deeper we delve into the investigation, the more my shattered soul becomes a liability, as I absorb the essence of victims and start to lose myself. At times, I’m not sure it’s still me inside my own skin. Why did I choose now to start dating? Based on the evidence, I go undercover to track a killer. It’s risky, especially with a drug addict at my side, but we will put an end to the monster responsible—even if it costs my life.",
