With her angel's face and womanly curves, Lady Claudia Chiavari was enough to tempt a saint to sin. And when she returned his kisses with innocent fire, Guy knew that he was bewitched. But in a matter of hours, everything changed, as he found himself betrayed, betrothed, and imprisoned, with only Claudia to blame.Untold TreacheryFive lonely years of exile under her uncle's tyrannical rule had taught Italian-born Claudia Chiavari to distrust all Englishmen—until Guy swept into her life. Now, determined to prove to the handsome knight that she had no part in her uncle's schemes, she will risk her life to help him escape. But when she rides with Guy to his magnificent fortress, she will discover a terrible truth: that she herself is a prisoner...and at the mercy of a man whose tumultuous passion could cost her her heart.",
