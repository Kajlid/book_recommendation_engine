  "description": "A heartbreakingly funny adventure about love, friendship, and loyalty. From the Amazon bestselling author and critically-acclaimed songwriter who has been entertaining audiences with his words for more than 20 years.  How far would you go for a friend?  One week ago, music legend Dash Nelson was on the way down. His music, iconic. Revered. And, it's not selling. But he's got one more record in him and it just might be his best one yet.  On the morning after the record release party for Heavy Clutch, Dash is roused from a scotch-induced slumber with the news that his long-time manager and best friend, Paul West, was found dead. Dash abandons his family, friends, and his record to keep a promise he made to Westie many years ago. A promise that he’s certain will land him in prison.  When Westie's body goes missing from the morgue, rumors circulate. A mysterious offshore transfer of three hundred thousand dollars brings the FBI to Nashville, but Dash is nowhere to be found.  After a cross-country road trip and a sacred burial ceremony that pushes Dash to the limits of his own sanity, he hops on a plane to a tiny Western Caribbean island to fulfill one final wish for Westie. An unexpected turn of events leaves him fighting for his life aboard a sailboat with Westie’s biggest secret.  From Dash and Westie’s aeonic friendship comes BURNING MAN. A simmering novel that twists in the grasp of DiCroce’s unique storytelling.  Includes opportunity to download the FREE BONUS SOUNDTRACK which includes a handpicked selection of original songs from three of the author's albums, some of which are featured throughout the story.",
