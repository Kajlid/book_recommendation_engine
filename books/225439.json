  "description": "For herein Fortune shows herself to be more kind Than is her custom.That's Shakespeare. In case you're wondering.If you were Delilah \"Baby\" Sampson, you’d already know that. Delilah got hooked on the Bard back in college. Then she briefly got hooked on Singapore Sling cocktails. And then she got tossed out of school. Yes, when Delilah discovers something she likes, she really sticks with it.These days, her addictions include sudoku, lime diet cola and now…Jimmy Choos. Oh, Baby’s gotta have those shoes! But on her window-washer salary, $700 for one pair is a stretch. Which leads us to her latest obsession…gambling.With an impromptu posse, including an elderly movie star, two Brazilian lesbians and Hillary Clinton (no, not that one!), Delilah hits the casinos and discovers that she’s a natural-born high-roller. Every win puts her closer to those beloved Choos. And as the “21s” keep dropping, so do the men…right at her feet. But for a girl who never knows when to fold ’em, gambling and casino guys are not healthy habits. She could end up losing her shirt, her head…and a whole lot more.",
