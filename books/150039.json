  "description": "Are you fed up with the youngsters getting all the action in romance novels? This book was created with the intention of enlightening people on the wonders of sex in middle age.  We take a journey through Sophie's life. We join her with her first love, who she gets torn away from. We go on to follow her life; hatches, matches and dispatches. Hers is not an easy life, but hold her hand through the bumpy bits to get to the good times.  Thank you to all my readers for picking this book in the first place, but thank you even more for your reviews. I'm an indie author and truly appreciate all your stars and comments.  People familiar with my work will already know that each of my books is standalone. You can pick a theme which suits your mood without worrying which order they should be read in. Each novel looks at love from a different viewpoint. Please feel free to browse my author profile to find out more, including details of how to get in contact.  CAUTION - explicit sex scenes in this book mean that nobody under 18 should read it.",
