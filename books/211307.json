  "title": "The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women",
  "description": "Taking readers on a provocative tour through thirty years of media images about mothers -- the superficial achievements of celebrity moms, the sensational coverage of dangerous day care, the media-manufactured \"mommy wars\" between working mothers and stay-at-home moms, and more -- The Mommy Myth contends that this \"new momism\" has been shaped by out-of-date mores, and that no matter how hard they try, women will never achieve it. In this must-read for every woman, Susan J. Douglas and Meredith W. Michaels shatter the myth of the perfect mom and all but shout, \"We're not gonna take it anymore!\"",
