  "description": "This title won the UNESCO prize for being one of the best ten books worldwide written on Motherhood (in 1964). Yet after four decades, the book is more relevant than ever. Surprisingly fresh thoughts and timeless values touch on the very difficult questions we face today both in rediscovering a sense of purpose and in raising a new generation. In this new gift book edition 23 paintings have been especially developed for Ilabnaty by the artist, Dr. Taher Abd Il Azim, and inspired by its 23 chapters. Book is written in Arabic.",
