  "description": "\"All races—the red, black, yellow, and white—were once believers in the beauty of the world. Brother Eagle, Sister Sky brings to mind the possibility of a world that once was paradise.\"—Jewell Praying Wolf James, lineal nephew of Chief Seattle\"How can you buy the sky? How can you own the rain and the wind?\"So begin the moving words attributed to a great American Indian chief—Chief Seattle—more than 100 years ago. They are words that eloquently capture the central belief of Native Americans: that this earth and every creature on it is sacred. It is these words and this belief that have inspired what has been truly a labor of love for Susan Jeffers; her most extraordinary paintings illuminate the words and world vision possessed by Native Americans.\"Each generation's newborn deserve the same chance as their ancestors—to breathe fresh air, to drink pure water, to hear the songs of nature in the winds, the trees, and resonating from the observing rocks that vibrate with the heartbeat of the earth itself. In Brother Eagle, Sister Sky Chief Seattle's words have been transformed into an experience children of all ages and localities can use to stimulate an awareness of a natural world that is rapidly losing its beauty. This book helps preserve what is being lost.\"—Jewell Praying Wolf James",
