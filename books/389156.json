  "description": "What happens in Vegas...sometimes follows you home...Pro bull rider Chase Reese knew things move faster than an eight-second ride in Las Vegas. He just never expected to be driving home with a national championship under his belt and a wedding band on his left hand with no clue how it got there. Yet he can't complain about the stripper bride beside him. From the moment his buddies bought him a lap dance from her, her trembles told him there was more to her than stiletto heels.Leesa Santiago has met the perfect guy. Her timing couldn't be worse though. If it was just their explosive sex, she could walk away. But from the moment her lap dance brought her this close to his baby blues, she was hooked. She can't lie that she couldn't be happier to bear his name--or guiltier that she's using it and his Oklahoma farm to hide out from mob hit men. That's before Chase's family gets involved. And his determination to do the right thing pushes her to do the one thing that will keep him safe. Break his heart. Do cowboy boots mix with stripper heels? And can a love that started out on the wrong foot end up on the right one? That's the risk you take waking up in Contains one happy-ending lap dance that will make you squirm, some pretty hot sex between two strangers who also happen to be married to each other, and a huge surprise conclusion.",
