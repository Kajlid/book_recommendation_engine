  "description": "In the ten years since his parents died in a fire he predicted but couldn't prevent, seventeen year old Matt is trying to stay out of trouble, biding his time until he ages out of foster care. All he wants is for the world to leave him alone so he won't be tortured by seeing someone's future he's powerless to change anyway. But his plans for keeping himself aloof fail when he interrupts a vicious attack on Amara, a girl he recognizes from school. Despite his best attempts to push her away, he can't ignore the connection they've formed. That's when glimpses of Amara's dangerous future start to invade the present â€” a future he fears is his fault. Now Matt has something to lose again . . . and something to fight for.",
