  "description": "New Zealand poet Avi Pranish presents his debut book - Wings. This is a collection of poems that explores the journey of a young man growing up in the island paradise of Fiji, then immigrating to New Zealand. These are feelings and reflections captured over thirty years exploring love, pain, heartbreak, emptiness, career aspirations, triumphs and losses. Each poem is beautifully illustrated to capture the essence of the prose. Wings is divided into four sections as a journey of the different phases of life. The Uninitiated covers themes such chasing dreams, seeking love and the high life, while the Maimed deals with grief, pain, and heartbreak. The Thinker captures reflections and rationalizations, and the Enlightened encapsulates finding true love and meaning in life.With the hope of sharing his experiences through poetic prose, this collection celebrates the journey of life in its entirety and empowers you to trust in your own resilience, self-acceptance and belief in your own soul.",
