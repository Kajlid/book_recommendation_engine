  "description": "Instead of Prince Charming, I got Him.SkylarI promised I’d save myself for my wedding night.Of course, I didn’t know it was going to be a fake marriage to a heavyweight MMA fighter. I couldn’t have known how good it would feel to be pinned under all those muscles and tattoos, squirming, panting, and even whimpering in ecstasy.None of us knew how deeply he was involved with the mafia.When he disrespects them, they think they can use me to punish him.They’re wrong.He’s a tank in human form.And he’s coming for me.AustinMen tap out inside the ring, women surrender themselves outside of it. That’s always been my specialty.I chose Skylar because she was so innocent. A good girl like her would help sell my reformed image to the public. To corrupt her and leave her ruined for all other men would be my hottest conquest yet.But I found more in Skylar than that. Who’d have thought that the first woman I wanted to lay more than once would be my wife?Now they think they can take away what is mine?Even if I have to kill every last member of the Bertolini Crime Family…I’m coming for her.",
