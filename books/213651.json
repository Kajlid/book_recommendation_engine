  "description": "“We have fought and slain Evagon. The War King is dead—Trel is free.” It’s been over two thousand years since Evagon, the evil king and last of the Ancients, was finally defeated. Even in defeat, Evagon’s loyal followers, the Faithful, have waged a never-ending war against the rest of the civilized world. Roland Hurel, the king of Sate, is well familiar with the Faithful, having defeated them in the past. Now a new, more powerful, version of the Faithful is on the march. Ancient creatures of legends are marching alongside men against the kingdom of Sate. Roland realizes that the Faithful are not just after his kingdom, but his family itself. His daughter Reya, the next in line to rule, his adopted daughter, Lorena, and his son Ian, are all in jeopardy, as the Faithful begin a campaign unlike any they have ever undertaken before. Eron Solon, the legendary Ragallan warrior may be Roland’s only hope. Leading a group of young swordsman, Eron arrives shortly before the Faithful with the warning of an ancient prophecy. What once was, will be again. Evagon will return—and the land will burn with his rage.",
