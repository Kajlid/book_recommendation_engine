When Gin defends his little sister against a bully, he decides to lend her his star power and change her senior year in ways she never imagined. But maybe the thorns are part of their beauty. When Gin declines Chase’s invitation to be part of the elite Sweet Sixteen, the repercussions turn both their lives upside down. But amidst the chaos, Gin and Chase find solace in one another. Together, they confront the ugly truth— that sometimes glory has a dark side. ***Warning—Sweet Sixteen is an upper YA book with mature themes and is intended for readers 18+.",
