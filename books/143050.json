  "description": "Tumblr's own Kayla Bashe serves up a \"thrillingly irreverent\" explosion of the beautiful dead girl mystique in Graveyard Sparrow, her new Regency romance starring a neuroatypical lady detective and a well-traveled professional witch. Katriona Sparrow, dubbed the Mad Heiress by most of London's upper class, is the deceptively fragile ward of a foreign nobleman. She can't stand making small talk with strangers, but she's unparalleled when it comes to deciphering the dead. On a routine investigation, though, something goes horribly wrong, leaving Katriona catatonic in an upscale hospital and a serial killer with an artistic bent stalking London's most vulnerable.Enter Anthea Garlant, a young witch and academic ostracized from polite society for traveling the world without a chaperone.She devises magical accommodations to protect Katriona from the side effects of her abilities — but as she grows more and more attached to the other woman, her professional façade begins to slip. Will they be able to stop the man who turns beautiful dead women into works of art — the man who is closer to Katriona than anyone suspects?",
