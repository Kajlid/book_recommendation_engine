  "title": "Brenda Bailey Cunningham's Ankle Bracelet",
  "description": "It was Brenda’s birthday and her husband Riley had presented her with a gift. It was an ankle bracelet with the letters BBC hanging off it. Neither Brenda nor Riley knew of the intended purpose of the bracelet. In the world of interracial swinging, BBC stood for Big Black Cock and when a white woman wore this, she was signaling not only a preference, but also a willingness to submit to black men. One night, a man named Marcus, who knows well the significance of the bracelet approaches Brenda. However, upon learning that she was unaware of the meaning of the bracelet, he sets off to turn her into a whore for black men to use as they see fit. Initially seduced by this man’s charms, Brenda gives herself to Marcus completely; willing to do whatever he asks of her.",
