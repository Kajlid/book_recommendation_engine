  "description": "There are some things people see in toilets that they wish they hadn’t. What Trevor Hawkins sees might even cost him his life.When Trevor takes voluntary redundancy, he hits the open road in his beat-up old camper van in search of adventure with his disciplinarily challenged dog, Milly. But the simple act of flushing a hotel toilet transforms his life from redundant sales assistant to fugitive from a gang of psychopathic villains, a private investigator, the police and MI5.With more twists and turns than an Escher-designed bobsleigh run, Trevor manages to give his various pursuers the slip long enough to take a peek inside the package he retrieves from a locker at the Leeds Festival. Not surprisingly, the contents leave him baffled as to why so many people are after him and, in particular, why some of them seem intent on doing him serious harm. It certainly wasn’t turning out to be the kind of adventure he’d had in mind when he’d first headed out on the highway with Born to be Wild  blaring from the speakers. Steppenwolf had a lot to answer for.Lifting the Lid is the first book in the 'Lifting the Lid' series, featuring Sandra Gray, Trevor Hawkins and his incorrigible dog, Milly.",
