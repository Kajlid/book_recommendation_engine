  "description": "1958: A Year to Remember by Susan Assunta BertucciTo the readers of this book, I hope more than anything else you will enjoy reading these words, and come to understand a glimpse of what immigrants went through in order to come to America and belong--carrying with them their hopes and dreams of making a better life for their families, and of leaving behind their native land and loved ones. So many in the beginning sobbed and probably thought What am I doing here? feeling lost in the new world in which they found themselves. I myself was just a child when I arrived in this country, so I didn't experience the true feelings an adult might have. For me, it wasn't a choice. But I will say that I'm so happy that the little guy with the fedora and the cigar had the guts to change his life--and ours, as well.Susan Assunta Bertucci immigrated to the United States in 1958 with her family, attended St. Denis Grammar School, and then went on to graduate from an American high school. After graduation, she decided to help her family in the family business, then later she became a partner in the family restaurant with her brother and sister.Together, they operated the business for forty-three years, eventually selling it and retiring. She now lives by the seashore in a home with her sister, and she travels whenever possible. Her other passions include painting, taking walks with her dog Dante, and visiting the Metropolitan Opera House in the city to listen to the most beautiful music ever composed, and topping it off with a great meal at Club 21 and a nightcap at the Oak Bar at the Plaza.",
