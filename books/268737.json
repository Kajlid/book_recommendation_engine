  "title": "Thicker Than Water: A Brother/Brother Threesome Breeding Novelette",
  "description": "As society deteriorates outside her window, Margo lives in dull safety as a worker in “social labor”, where she tends to the sexual needs of the nation’s highest executives. Worn from the constant selling of her body, Margo has been searching for a way out.Brothers Austin and Micah, two workers in the mysterious “manual labor” sector, share their new theory. They think that if a woman was to get pregnant, she wouldn’t have to be a sex slave. Margo is skeptical, but desperate, and would also do anything to have her way with a man.Though the siblings are willing to help her out, Margo is torn between choosing a brother, only to find that Austin and Micah might be a little too close. Margo prepares for them submissive Austin - who is dying to feel how the used girls feel every day, and sweet Micah, the younger brother that she can’t stop thinking about.It may seem like it’s just business, deciding who will father the child that will hopefully get her out of this place, but she might as well have a little fun with it.This novelette contains a MMF brother/brother threesome (no actual sex between relatives), breeding, pegging, femdom elements, and more. It is intended for readers 18 and over.",
