  "description": "Charles Williams’ best-known novels are War in Heaven, Descent into Hell and All Hallows' Eve. T. S. Eliot, who wrote an introduction for All Hallows’ Eve, described Williams’s novels as \"supernatural thrillers\" because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power, even spiritual power, can corrupt as well as sanctify. All of Williams’ fantasies, unlike those of J. R. R. Tolkien and most of those of C. S. Lewis, are set in the contemporary world.Charles’ writing took him to Oxford during World War 2, where Oxford University Press employed him. He later became a member, along with J.R.R. Tolkien & C.S. Lewis, of the informal literary group known as the Inklings.",
