If she leaves, she knows her former in-laws will be determined to take custody of her sons. So the countdown begins on finding a dragonman to mate her.

When the chance comes to claim Sarah as his own, Hudson puts his name forth to be her mate. Now he just needs to convince her to pick him. Despite the fact she’s divorced, Hudson soon discovers that Sarah was neglected, so he makes it his job to prove how desirable she really is.As Hudson does his best to persuade Sarah of how they’re combustible together in bed and a good team as parents out of it, her past comes back to haunt her. Not only does it threaten one of her sons, but it could also end up destroying the future she now yearns for with Hudson. Will she find a way to seize a happy ending for once? Or will Sarah end up losing everything she cares about?",
