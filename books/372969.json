And I changed for nothing.\"The clock downstairs chimes midnight.\"You don't believe that, do you?\"Zara and Nick are soul mates, meant to be together forever. But that's not how things have worked out. For starters, Nick is gone. He's been taken to some mythic place for warriors called Valhalla, where Zara and her friends might be able to get him back. It's just not going to be easy.Meanwhile, Bedford needs its warriors more than ever, since a group of evil pixies is devastating the place, with people going missing every day. An all-out war seems imminent. But even if Zara and her friends can find the way to Valhalla, there's that other small problem: Zara's been pixie kissed. When she finds Nick, will he even want to be with her? Especially since she hasn't turned into just any pixie... she's Astley's queen.",
