  "description": "For a thousand years and more, The Worlds of Man had been dominated by the Laowon Imperium. The aliens thought humans made good slaves and better pets, and they were fond of creating new breeds. And the Laowon made sure that their playthings never grew too powerful. Born one day, on the edge of Human Space, Jon Iehard was ordered to hunt Eblis Bey, a terrorist for Old Earth. And that was the beginning of the end for the Laowon. Because Iehard had been a Laowon slave. And Eblis Bey held half the key to a weapon that could destroy the Laowon tyranny and bring freedon once more to Mankind!",
