  "description": "According to the law of attraction, women and men can’t be friends.\n  Contrary to this myth, my friendship with Coriander Phillips does not rest on unrequited love or un-actualized lust. We’ve been inseparable since the day I pulled one of her pigtails and she punched me in the gut. She’s hilarious, fun to hang out with. Together, we’re like peanut butter and jelly, spaghetti and meatballs, wings and beer. A match made in heaven. She’s the bomb. Did I mention she’s smokin’ hot? I’ve checked her out…maybe once or twice. Hey, I’m a guy. Seriously, no awkwardness, no secret yearning for our relationship to escalate beyond the purely platonic. I’m the boy friend—the loyal shoulder she cries on, the dispenser of coffee, sympathy, hugs, advice, and affection with no expectations. Until the invisible line between friends and lovers became blurry. Now I want more. I want her. All I have to do is convince her we can be more than friends. Right? If only it were that easy.",
