Knowing six-year-old Caleb Holsheyer is likely to face a similar fate, David makes it his mission to find the boy a loving home.But in the midst of the Great Depression, most families are barely getting by. No one seems willing to take on the responsibility of caring for a small child, especially one who's crippled.Sadie Miller seems the perfect solution for this dilemma. With the recent loss of her father, Sadie is alone in a large house. She's left with means to provide, and David has never known a more kind and nurturing soul.Unfortunately, Sadie's status as a spinster presents another dilemma. If Child Welfare objects to Caleb being raised in the home of an unmarried woman, new arrangements must be found. David and Sadie team up in a desperate effort to find a home for the orphaned child they both love. While searching, might they find a family instead?",
