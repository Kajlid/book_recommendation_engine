  "description": "Book 4 - The Cloverleah Pack Series Can be read as a stand-alone Troy Peterson has been waiting three long months for his true mate to return from his deployment in the US Army. But when Anton doesnâ€™t turn up as planned, Troy starts to second guess everything he knows about his mate - and that's before he has even met him. Anton Sage fully intended on meeting Troy, the moment his ninety days service was up. But the Army had different ideas and now Anton is sitting in his wolf form, in a cage, wondering if he will ever get the chance to meet the man Fate intended for him. Even after they meet, things do not go well. Between the Army, the mysterious Kylan, another wolf with the hots for Troy, an overbearing friend, and some old fashioned misunderstandings, Troy and Anton might never have the happily ever after they had dreamed of. Sometimes the mating gift can prove to be a curse. Warning: This book is about two male wolf shifters. It includes fated mates, graphic gay sex, and references to BDSM, PTSD and cutting. Some foul language and violence.",
