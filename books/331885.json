When the interest proves to be mutual, he resolves to show her all the things she's missed out on in her sheltered life—both in and out of the bedroom. But there are still threats to Emma’s safety that could put their newfound relationship—not to mention her life—in jeopardy.This book contains strong language, sexual content, and themes of human trafficking and physical and verbal abuse.",
