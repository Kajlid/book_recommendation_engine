  "description": "First Class to New York’s Janie Anderson returns home to Portland after her long awaited, once-in-a-lifetime trip to New York City. She had spent two weeks in the Big Apple with the drop-dead gorgeous Matt Lathem, whom she had literally stumbled upon while embarking on her highly anticipated adventure. He had warned her that once her trip was over, so was their time together. But she had fallen head-over-heels for him anyway and had lacked the courage to tell him her true feelings. Heart-broken, she boarded the plane back to her life in Portland. Back in Oregon, Janie tries to forget him and move on, only to have everything remind her of what she had left in New York: a fresh start and another chance at love. When Matt realizes that the woman of his dreams and the love of his life is only a first class ticket to Portland away, he risks everything and boards the next plane for the West Coast. What had started as a “romantic fling” had blossomed into something he’d never felt before; an unyielding desire to spend the rest of his life with her. When Matt shows up without warning, Janie’s world is once again tipped upside down. First Class to Portland is an Adult Contemporary Romance novel that is the conclusion of Janie and Matt’s story that began in ‘First Class to New York’. It is the second book in the ‘First Class’ series, followed by 'First Class Justice'.",
