  "description": "Louisa was an heiress who knew, only too well, that her money - not her face - attracted suitors. She hated being on display, despised hearing the cruel comments about her appearance, and disappeared as often as possible from the social events held by her grandfather to find her a husband. One day she discovered a cave on her grandfather’s property, but it wasn’t just any cave. This one contained a library, a reading chair, and a mysterious man by the name of Douglas. Perhaps it was the darkness of the cave. Or perhaps it was because Douglas was hiding from the world, too, but a friendship developed and then an attraction. Louisa was adamant about discovering the reason Douglas was hiding, just as he was determined to keep Louisa from figuring out that he wasn’t exactly human. In the darkness almost anything is possible. An ugly woman can become beautiful and a vampire can live as a man.",
