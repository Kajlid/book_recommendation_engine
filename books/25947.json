  "title": "Singing Cowboys and Musical Mountaineers: Southern Culture and the Roots of Country Music",
  "description": "In this slim, lively book our foremost historian of country music recalls the lost worlds of pioneering fiddlers and pickers, balladeers and yodelers. As he looks at \"hillbilly\" music's pre-commercial era and its early popular growth through radio and recordings, Bill C. Malone shows us that it was a product not only of the British Isles but of diverse African, German, Spanish, French, and Mexican influences.",
