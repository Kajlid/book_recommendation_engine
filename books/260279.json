  "description": "Amanda Johnson is a witch in hiding, until she has a vision of a serial killer. She’s a witch, a seer, and perhaps more that she doesn’t understand yet. Driven to make a difference and save the young boy in her vision, she exposes herself to the supernatural community. She’d been hiding for a reason, to keep herself and others safe, though her mother who was also a seer never told her exactly why or what from before she died.She’s about to find out that it’s bigger than she could have imagined, and she’ll need to help others and be helped along the way.It’s their only chance for survival.Author’s Note: This is a full novel (over 56K words) unlike the Taylor Coven novellas. It is a slow burn, Reverse Harem Urban Fantasy, which doesn’t stint on the fantasy or the romance. There are mature situations in this book, but no actual sex, explicit or otherwise. There will be in the next three books, so be warned now. There are four planned books in this series, so minor cliffhangers are unavoidable in the series plotline and character development, but the main plot in this book will be tied up by the end.Most of the book is in the first person, from Amanda’s POV, but the men have some cameos in the third person limited POV.",
