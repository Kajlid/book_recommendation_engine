  "title": "The Question of Christmas",
  "description": "What is Christmas? Is it a season or a day, an event or an experience? To some it is a religious holiday. To others it is a season of good cheer and overindulgence with the staying power of maybe four-to-six weeks. The Question of Christmas, a novella, explores this very question through the eyes of a twelve-year-old boy who is forced to deal with grown-up problems while struggling with his own transition out of childhood. Set in the 1980s, he and his friends embark on a Christmas break adventure that could be described as a sort of blending of The Christmas Story, a Hallmark movie, and a Hardy Boys novel. Behind the fun the adventure provides, there is a family struggling deeply with the possibility of losing one of their own. They need a Christmas miracle, and together they learn that this can come in the strangest and most unexpected forms.",
