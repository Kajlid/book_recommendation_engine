  "description": "Nostalgia, identity, eccentricity, gin drinking and occasional violence... these are just some of the themes that stand-up comedian Dara O Briain explores in \"Tickling the English.\"O Briain moved to England many years ago, but when he takes his show on tour around the country - from deserted seaside towns and remote off-shore islands, to sprawling industrial cities and sleepy suburbs - it's clear to him that his adopted home is still a bit of an enigma.Why do the English pretend to be unhappy all the time?Why can't they accept they rank about fifth, in everything?And what's with all the fudge?But this Irishman loves a challenge; he's certainly got the gregarious personality and the sure-fire wit to bring down the barriers of that famous English reserve, and to have a good old rummage inside. Swapping anecdotes with his audiences and spending time wandering around their hometowns, this nosy neighbour holds England up to the light, while exploring some of the attitudes he brought over here with him too.As Dara goes door to door in search of England in this part-tour-diary, part-travelogue, the result is an affectionate, hilarious and often eye-opening journey through the Sceptered Isle.",
