  "description": "Poetry. African American Studies. \"Eisen-Martin's syntax lands somewhere between Sphinx and Thelonious…through poem he makes spare, efficient, wild-eyed jazz…rubs mud and accountability into the pores of the zeros and ones in the glass and steel city.

This work is as hungry as revolution, a necessary, deadly still in these shifting times…\"—Marc Bamuthi Joseph",
