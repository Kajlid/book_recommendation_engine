  "description": "Growing up, we hated each other. Now, we’re f**kin’ roommates for the summer.  ALY It’s been twelve years since I’ve seen him, but loathing Emmett Hoult still runs in my blood. Thanks to the hell he wreaked on my teenaged life, I’ve avoided the prick like the plague. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and after a fire destroys my apartment during the most important week of my life, I’m suddenly as desperate as they come.  Hence the roommate situation.  It’s his summer home. His family said he wouldn’t be around. They said I’d never run into him.  But oh, did I run into Emmett Hoult.  And in the worst way possible.  EMMETT I didn't expect to see her ever again, let alone the way that I did.  But now that she's back in my life, I'm not screwing things up. She still hates me -- I know that -- but it won't stop me from chasing the only two goals I've made for this summer.  Making things right.  And making her mine.",
