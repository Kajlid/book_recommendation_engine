  "description": "Harbour Ways is the sequel to Watery Ways, Valerie Poore's first memoir about living on a barge in Rotterdam's Oude Haven in the Netherlands. This second book tells of the first two years that she owned her own barge, the Vereeniging, and how she converts it from an empty hull into a home. Told with with Valerie's usual tongue-in-cheek humour, Harbour Ways can be read as a stand alone memoir or as the follow on to Watery Ways.",
