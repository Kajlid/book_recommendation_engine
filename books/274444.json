Once Jack Halder lived between two nations. Now he is filled with rage, chosen to spearhead a desperate secret mission-and to bring Rachel Stern into it. Once Harry Weaver was one of America's best and brightest. Now he is the only U.S. agent who can hunt down the man who was his friend, and the woman they both loved in 1939.In a stunning story that reaches from the teeming streets of Berlin to the feet of the great pyramids, three former friends are about to meet again: around a mission to assassinate FDR.",
