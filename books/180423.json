  "description": "Estranged relationships between parents and their children seem to be becoming more and more prominent. My mother and I were estranged for essentially ten years and this book takes the reader on a journey through my life, as the daughter, with all the events, all the struggles my mother and I faced to get us to the point we were at. Back and forth from the week I went back for my mother's funeral to all the events that got us to where we are, it is a long, emotional journey.   From the call with the news that my mother was no longer walking the Earth to their divorce, from getting back to where I left long ago to running away, from dealing with my sister who hates me to being in a psych hospital, from being back at the house that built me to having a custody battle for my daughter with my mom, from seeing all my mom's sisters again to being kicked out while my husband was deployed and I was pregnant, from being accused of our relationship issues to a wedding that was supposed to bring us all back together â€“ this book is my personal journey of self-discovery and admittance of everything that happened between my mom and I to get us to the point of no return.   'the loss of A MOTHER's loss' was a way for me to let the world know, especially those that saw it happen without knowing what happened, why things were the way they were. It became a personal desire to let other daughters that are struggling with their mother know they are not alone and it is okay to be your own person with your family no matter how your mother may want to try to make you feel about it.",
