  "title": "Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account",
  "description": "When the Nazis invaded Hungary in 1944, they sent virtually the entire Jewish population to Auschwitz. A Jew and a medical doctor, Dr. Miklos Nyiszli was spared from death for a grimmer fate: to perform “scientific research” on his fellow inmates under the supervision of the infamous “Angel of Death”: Dr. Josef Mengele. Nyiszli was named Mengele’s personal research pathologist. Miraculously, he survived to give this terrifying and sobering account, which is accompanied by a foreword by Bruno Bettelheim.“This is the best brief account of the Auschwitz experience available.” —",
