  "title": "Siberiak: My Cold War Adventure on the River Ob",
  "description": "Told in bold black and white illustrations and through adorable non-human characters, Siberiak is part travelogue, part coming-of-age memoir. The teen protagonist, a budding activist, signs up for a peace mission to the then-USSR. By rowboat, bicycle and raft, American and Soviet youth travel through Siberia camping along the River Ob. In her first trip without her parents, the recent high school graduate slowly comes out of her shell to make friends with both Russian and Americans. With sensitivity and humor, Siberiak tells the tale of a young woman's journey of self-discovery during one unique historical moment.",
