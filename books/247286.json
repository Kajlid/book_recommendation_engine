  "description": "Broken pod, wrecked ship, no water in sight!\n\n\n\nBut Piper Sage is a survivor!\n\n\nDiagnosed with an aggressive terminal cancer, the doctors on board her generational spaceship had no choice but to put her in stasis, hoping to keep her alive until a cure could be found. When she wakes, it's not to a miracle but a nightmare. Two blazing suns, nothing but sand and more sand...\nThere's no way she's going to just give up and die. Not a chance!\n\n\nBut long unused muscles and pale skin are making it impossible on this treacherous red planet!\n\n\nSalvation comes in the form of four powerful dragon-men. Enormous, seven-foot walls of muscle with wings and tails and scales, these four have decided to be Piper's protectors!\n\n\nThe only trouble is they don't want to share!\n\n\nKaidan, Ejder, Anguis and Mikhos are all possessively alpha and will do anything to be the one who gets to claim Piper as his treasure. She's got other ideas...\n\n\nAfter all, why choose one when you can have them all?\n\n\n\n\nNight Of The Dragons is a fully standalone novel. This is a TRUE reverse harem romance, NOT a love triangle. Expect steam, adventure, smoking hot alien-dragons and a feisty red-headed heroine.",
