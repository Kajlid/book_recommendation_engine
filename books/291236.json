  "description": "I was twenty-one when the gypsy read my future:  As punishment for your crimes, you will only love one woman...but she'll never love you back.  I didn't believe a word of it.  Until I met Sofia Romano almost ten years later.  I fell hard for this woman. Would die for this woman.  But she left me.  Now years have passed and Sofia needs a husband. Her father is gone and her mother is trying to marry her off to a man that can protect their family, protect their company.  She's looking for someone powerful.  Check.  Someone rich.  Check.  Someone handsome.  Double check.  Now it's my chance to have the only woman I've ever loved...and I'll make sure she feels the same way.  I have a lifetime to make that happen.",
