  "description": "The publication of Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch in 1970 was a landmark event, raising eyebrows & ire while creating a shockwave of recognition in women around the world with its steadfast assertion that sexual liberation is the key to women's liberation. Today, Greer's searing examination of the oppression of women in contemporary society is both an important historical record of where we've been & a relevant treatise on what still remains to be achieved.IntroductionBODY.
