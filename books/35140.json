This time, however, they are accompanied by their new band of magical misfits. By daylight, all seems peaceful since they've toppled the Regime, and the coven of rogue yet lovable monsters has finally found freedom. But Charlotte soon discovers that, much like her adopted Vampire family, she has developed a strange addiction of her own, and it's steadily destroying her from the inside out. Valek defies all odds, trying to save his love, but to no avail. With danger lurking around every corner, the couple begins to realize that their happily-ever-after might not end so happily after all. Will they conquer Charlotte's strange new disease...or will she drown in her own blood? Prepare for another epic quest amidst the monsters that hide in plain sight in this highly-anticipated sequel in the Of Light and Darkness series.",
