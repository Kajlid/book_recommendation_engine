  "description": "When Gerri’s VampLycan stepfather died, her mother moved them far from his clan. As a teen, it was the most devastating day of her life, because it took Gerri away from Wen, the boy she’d loved since childhood. Fifteen years later, that boy has become a gorgeous man straight out of her wildest fantasies—and when he requests to meet her, Gerri suspects just seeing him will set her up for heartbreak all over again.  The petite blonde he fell for as a young VampLycan is still beautiful—and all human. Though Gerri’s always been the one he longs to be with, Wen can’t mate her. After the death of his brother, Wen was forced to assume the duties of firstborn, which include mating another VampLycan. But he needs a human to pull off his current mission for his clan, hunting a rogue Vampire in a human city. And he’ll take any stolen moments with Gerri he can get.  As the danger surrounding the mission mounts, so does their passion, until it’s equally perilous. It will take everything in him to keep Wen from claiming his mate…because doing so could mean her death.",
