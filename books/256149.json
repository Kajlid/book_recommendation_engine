  "description": "For the first time, Preston reveals his employment at Brookhaven Labs and how his connections in the music industry were used for mind control and manipulation of the masses. Ultimately, Preston's real-life adventures lead to time travel, his own role in the future, and the efforts of his adversaries to arrest him and put him permanently out of commission. This includes the bone chilling story of John Ford, Preston's colleague, who is locked up without a trial for his own efforts to expose the truth. In a remarkable twist of fate, mysterious forces rescue Preston and begin a documented investigation and eventual conviction of the most politically powerful man on Long Island. This book reveals more layers of mystery in mankind's epic quest to understand the paradox of time and the imprisonment of consciousness.",
