They’ve got new dresses and the best show on either side of the Mississippi. But can they keep their act together long enough to get this show on the road? Find out in this hilarious tale of the old west! The Golly Sisters Go West by Newbery medalist Betsy Byars is a Level Three I Can Read, which means it contains a complex plot and challenging vocabulary—just right for the newly independent reader. As Carol Hurst's BooksInTheClassroom site \"Byars has the ability to construct believable, often loveable characters who face some of life's greatest hurdles. Her humor is visible everywhere as is her empathy with the difficulties faced by many children. She writes for many ages and her easy to read books are wonderful fare.\"",
