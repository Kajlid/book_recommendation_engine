  "description": "Adam James is so far in the closet he could find Narnia. But coming out would threaten all he's built as the attorney for the homophobic WMA Development, and the million-dollar paycheck waiting for him once they push their big land development deal through the city council. Then, on an early morning scuba dive, Adam meets a tall, lean rebreather diver named Sky who makes him want to live a different life.Sky Sea Mickeljohn doesn't compromise. He knows what he stands for and stands for it the environment, world peace, and being gay. So how could he find himself lusting after a damned developer? Especially the one working on the WMA land development deal, which would put thousands of people at risk by developing a toxic waste site they have neither the capital nor the know-how to clean up? And worse, what's going to happen when someone opens Adam's closet door?",
