  "title": "Whitehorn Woods",
  "description": "The tiny hamlet of Rossmore seems to be a village that progress passed by. But that changes when a new highway project threatens to destroy St. Ann's Well, a religious shrine and the Irish town's only tourist attraction. Maeve Binchy's sage Whitehorn Woods captures the first-person stories of townspeople grappling with their own problems as well as this moment of civic transition. As always, Binchy's realistically etched portraits seem perfectly tailored for a wide reading audience; different readers will identify with different characters.",
