  "description": "When Pibbin learns that a baby squirrel is missing, he's reluctant to do anything, especially since there's a box of puzzles involved and a booby-trapped tunnel. He's no good at puzzles, and the tunnel is frightening--and what he really wants to do is hand out cookie chips to earn a blue star. But perhaps that baby is more important. With Leeper and Alix on his team, he sets off to solve the puzzles, brave the tunnel, and find the missing squirrel. Book 3 in Tales of Friendship Bog~An easy reading adventure for ages 7 and up.~Includes black & white illustrations and story map.~Also available as ebook.",
