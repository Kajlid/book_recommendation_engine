  "description": "When an unlikely duo finally unravels the mystery of dark matter… will it save our world? Or destroy it? In a not-so-distant future of extreme income inequality, controlled by a handful of the über-elite, wealth, science, and the power of the human spirit get one last chance to determine humanity’s ultimate fate.Rudolph “Rudy” Dersch is the newly minted CEO of the world’s largest, multi-trillion-dollar corporate conglomerate. But the job comes with an unexpected twist–an invitation to join the Consortium, a small, secretive group of global elites who effectively decide what’s best for the rest of humanity. How does Rudy’s struggle to reconcile business and family impact the world’s future? And who, if anyone, can break the Consortium’s iron grip on the status quo?The answer may lie with a renegade physicist, close to unravelling one of the universe’s greatest mysteries. And a headstrong art curator, driven to find the meaning behind her increasingly compelling visions. From a life-changing moment in a crowded Singapore marketplace, to the business end of an assassin’s gun, they face a power beyond any the world has ever seen. To survive, they’ll have to decipher the truth about dark matter–before the Consortium can achieve its ruinous end game.",
