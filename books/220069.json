  "description": "Single female shifters from all across the country are flocking to the brand new territory in Greenlands, New Hampshire. After all, there's land to be claimed, sexy male shifters lurking behind every towering pine tree, and - death challenges? Apparently, Dakota Sheffield picked the wrong woman to impersonate when she decided to go undercover for a little vacation. Now she's falling hard for Miles Williams, the dominant Alpha Prime of the Fenris pack.  Throw in a pack of feral orphans who can't decide if they want to shank her or adopt her, a new best friend who just may be the death of them all, and a human government determined to see them all fail...and it will be a miracle if she escapes with her hide and her heart intact.",
