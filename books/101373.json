  "description": "Magic, gadgets & time-traveling pirates? It's just a day in the life of Disastrous Pirate Sue & her Steampunk nieces. What if it turned out that your grandfather invented time travel, your parents were airship pilots, and your aunt was a pirate? When Chloe and Bella lose their parents in a terrible time-traveling disaster, theyâ€™re shipped off to their last remaining relative. Auntie Sue seems to be a very old woman living on a very dirty boat. But not everything is what it seems. Little do they know that the boat is a famous pirate ship, and their aunt the infamous Disastrous Pirate Sue. The girls and their aunt embark on a wild adventure to the past to rescue their parents and stop von Helmholtz from destroying the last remaining time-travel machine. Thus begins the absolutely true account of the amazing Faradays, a family to whom wonderful (and often quite dreadful) things are always happening. Chloe and Bella are just discovering that this is their family. In this cross between \"\"Pirates of the Caribbean\"\" and Harry Potter, Susan Katherine Rits uses cheeky humor, daring characters, and Steampunk fashion to rivet young readers during this rollicking adventure to the past.\"",
