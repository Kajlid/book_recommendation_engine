But his past comes back in a big way when the stunning specimen of manhood he admires while in line at the movies turns out to be Eric Sparks. Fifteen years ago, Eric left the country with his military family, and their budding relationship met its end. Just out of the Marine Corps, Eric finds that his dormant feelings for Dean erupt when he once again holds the love he lost in his arms. But Dean is settled in his life, and Eric is starting over. Can love be given a second chance? Will life give them the opportunity denied all those years ago, or will it once again separate the two men?",
