  "title": "Eternal Hermes: From Greek God to Alchemical Magus",
  "description": "Phanes (fa-nays) means \"manifester\" or \"revealer\", and is related to the Greek words \"light\" and \"to shine forth\".Phanes Press was founded in 1985 to publish quality books on the spiritual, philosophical, and cosmological traditions of the Western world. Since that time, we have published 45 books, including five volumes of Alexandria, a book-length journal of cosmology, philosophy, myth, and culture.The year 2000 marks our fifteen-year anniversary, and we are working to bring out more interdisciplinary works, including books on creativity, psychology, literature, and the intersections between science, spirituality, and culture.Hermes -- the fascinating, mercurial messenger of the gods, eloquent revealer of hidden wisdom, and guardian of hidden knowledge -- has played a central role in the development of esotericism in the West. Drawing upon many rare books and manuscripts, this highly illustrated work explores the question of where Hermes Trismegistus came from, how he came to be a patron of the esoteric traditions, and how the figure of Hermes has remained lively and inspiring to our own day.",
