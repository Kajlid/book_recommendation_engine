  "description": "“Remind yourself what really matters with The Art of Forgetting . Fast-paced, painful, funny, and renewing at once. . . . Take a cue from the book and pass it along to your buds. ” – Daily Candy Marissa Rogers has always been just fine as a beta. After all, hadn’t taking charge without taking credit been paying off? It’s what vaulted her to senior editor at a glossy—if somewhat tedious—diet magazine and let her be best friends with gorgeous, charismatic, absolutely alpha Julia Ferrar. And then Julia is hit by a cab. Her external injuries are minor, but brain damage steals her memory and alters her personality. To help her friend, Marissa must assume the alpha role and help Julia recover her past. As Julia heals, she begins dredging up memories Marissa would rather forget—including the fact that Julia once asked her to abandon the love of her life.",
