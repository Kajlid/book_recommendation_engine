  "description": "Nobody ever said running a gay escort agency was going to be easy. Harry takes on more than he can chew when he recruits a new boy who might be straight, might just be confused, or might be interested in servicing someone other than the clients. Then there's a client whose specific kinks mean for the first time in years Harry will have to handle a job himself. Long-time boyfriend Liam may be losing patience with having his life so influenced by hookers and emergency phone calls. Looks like he might become ex-boyfriend Liam... but is that such a bad thing? What should be done about the pushy bottom who won't go away until Harry agrees to dominate him? Is the new boy cut out for this business? There are vultures in the city. Harry is just a big, sparkly, gay one.Words: 110,555",
