  "description": "When seventeen-year-old Jude Walker confesses to his priest that he’s gay, and in fact has an unhealthy attraction to the priest himself, the last thing he expects is compassion. Father Gray surprises him with his understanding and Jude accepts his offer of help in overcoming his condition. When Sebastian Gray extends an offer of help to a troubled teenager, the last thing he expects is that it is Jude that will save him. Yet Jude steadily breaks through the priest’s barriers, bringing him out of his self-imposed exile and into the world. As the two find surprising parallels between their lives and obsession gives way to affection, both men begin to understand that their love may cost them their souls. Jude stands to lose his family to the truth of his affections, and Sebastian could fail in his original task; saving Jude, no matter what the cost.Sarah Goodwin is currently undertaking a degree in Creative Writing from Bath Spa University, would love to one day have one of her books published on paper and hates talking about herself in the third person.

I loved her ability to bring this reader deeply into her lives of her characters and keep the story moving pretty smoothly. If you are looking for an emotional read with amazing and well written characters, this book is definitely for you. Just make sure you don’t start reading it before you go to bed, or you’ll be as sleep deprived as I was! Highly Recommended!\"",
