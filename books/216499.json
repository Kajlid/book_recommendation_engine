  "description": "Phil Hastings was a lucky man -- he had money, a growing reputation as a screenwriter, a happy, loving family with three kids, and he'd just moved into the house of his dreams in rural upstate New York. Life was wonderful, full of magic -- and about to be altered irrevocably by a magic more real than any he dared imagine. For with the Magic came the Bad Thing, and the Faerie, and then the Fool. . .and the resurrection of a primordial war with a forgotten people -- a war that not only the Hastings but the whole human race could lose.",
