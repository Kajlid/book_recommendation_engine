  "description": "Written by five artists of extraordinary talent, these very special, newly written stories celebrate the simple joys and traditions of Christmas -- with each heartwarming tale evoking its own unique style and flavor. â€” In Gayle L. Buck's \"Old Acquaintances,\" the magic of Christmas is remembered in a story of love and longing, while in \"A Gift of Fortune,\" Anita Mills writes of the snowbound reunion of two unlikely lovers. Both Edith Layton's \"The Duke's Progress\" and Mary Balogh's \"The Star of Bethlehem\" are moving stories of holiday sadness, hope and the renewal of spirit. And \"The Kissing Bough\" by Patricia Rice is a bittersweet tale of love and reconciliation.These are stories to warm your heart with the romance, generosities, and joys of the season -- holiday tales that can be read and enjoyed year after year.",
