  "description": "In Bram Stoker's immortal classic, Dracula, an extraordinary woman named Mina Harker became the living object of a vampire's obsession. He came to her in the night, like a demon lover, opening a vein in his chest—and pressing her tender lips to the wound. Consumed by passion, Mina drank of his blood. And from that moment on, his seductive power filled her senses with strange, forbidden longings. Only one thing saved her soul from eternal damnation: a stake driven through the heart of Count Dracula...But was the spell really broken? Could a mortal woman return to an ordinary life of marriage—after tasting the exquisite pleasures of Dracula's desire? In this sensual and haunting sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula, the dark prince's most famous mistress reveals the untold story of a timeless love that refused to die.",
