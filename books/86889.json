  "description": "Beside the still water...the zombies roam. A slightly different take on the zombie genre, Smooth asks if the world be better if we were all neutral and complacent (without violence, greed, hatred, and yes, love and compassion) as parts of our personalities? The road to absolute peace is filled with more than just bumps and gravel when catt dahman tells it; heads will roll...literally. The town of Cold Springs is about to receive the gift of full serenity and some people intend to fight it (as well as the zombies) all the way to the end!",
