  "description": "Allura Satou is in a funk. She’s tried to keep up appearances, but the post-breakup blues are dragging her down. Writing no longer holds much joy, though she continues to keep track of charms and rituals in her Book of Shadows. After a disastrous attempt at laugh yoga she badly needs the Spell to Dispel Embarrassment.  It’s good to have friends who want to help and a blind date with the attractive and intriguing Shiloh Liebermann is an excellent start. More dates follow, but when the devout Shiloh finds out about the Book of Shadows and Allura’s Pagan practice, it may be the final strike…  Newcomer Eva Indigo introduces two endearing women you’ll love in her sparkling debut romance.",
