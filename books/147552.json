  "title": "Royal Vendetta: The Crown of Spain 1829-1965",
  "description": "This book is about the split within the House of Bourbon between the family of Maria Christina and the previous kings' nephews, who saw themselves as the real rulers of Spain and were known as the Carlists. The rulling branch were mostly liberal-minded people and adhered to the rules laid out in the constitution of Nepoleonic times imposed on the country years before, while the Carlists were extreemly conservative and truly believed in 'Divine Right' pricples of personal rule. For years, Spain would go through turmoil as each succeeding pretender to the Spanish throne would issue, from exile abroad, proclamations to the people to 'rise up' and overthrow their governamnt--no matter who was in charge. Because of factions within the movment, plus ever-changing European politics in the Bismarkian Era, the Carlist victory is not forthcomming--but the battles are intense and not every pretender is a warrior.",
