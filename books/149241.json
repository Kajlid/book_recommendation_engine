After exploring new heights of pleasure with her best friend Isabella, Annika ventures deeper into Damien Cage's world.  Hidden behind the rock star's eyes are secrets he won't reveal. Something torments him, but Annika can't quite get to it. Instead, Damien Cage teaches her a hot and steamy lesson in submission that sends her into happy ecstasy.  But soon, Annika's world begins to fall apart. Bad news hits from all sides, causing her to do what she always does... run and hide. She races back to her mother's control and the security of being a protected child.  When tensions explode all around, threatening Annika's progress, help arrives from a surprising source... opening Annika up to yet another new world of \"sinful\" rapturous delight.
