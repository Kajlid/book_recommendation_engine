  "title": "Fatizen: The Graphic Novel, Part I",
  "description": "In our size-obsessed nation, the obese are ostracized and treated with disdain and polite discourtesy every time they step outside the front door. But what if the most powerful branch of government was the diet industry and thinness was not just a socially desirable virtue but a federal mandate? Could you maintain a low Body Mass Index if it was law? What if your life depended on it? The Graphic Novel shows us one woman's journey and how she stands up for her rights and inspires courage, hope, and a revolution. Join Delilah on her adventure and experience the tenacious human spirit that perseveres in the face of unrelenting adversity. This is the first in a three-part series based on the prose novel of the same name.",
