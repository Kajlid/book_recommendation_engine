  "description": "On a flat alternate reality, scruffy-bearded Rincewind, sixteen years at the lowest level of the Unseen University, silver letters on his droopy-brim pointed hat spell WIZZARD, and his robes of faded red, are the only proof of his profession. The harder he runs from trouble, the deeper he gets entangled.1 Sourcery 1988 is natural magic from Coin, the eighth son of the eighth son of the - you get it. His powerful papa-possessed staff jolts the lazy gluttonous professors against the wishes of the late ArchChancellor's determined talking hat. 2 Eric 1990 is a rude acne-pimpled boy who summons Rincewind instead of a demon to fulfill his wishes of riches and womanly partner in sort-of Aztec Mexico and Troy.3 Interesting Times 1994, like the Chinese curse, sends Rincewind to the Aurient where Ghengiz Cohen and the white-haired hobbling heroic Silver Horde of seven conquer villainous Vizier Hong with rumors of a ghost army and terra-cotta tomb soldiers.",
