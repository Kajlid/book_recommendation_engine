  "title": "Doctor Dolittle In The Moon",
  "description": "Doctor Dolittle in the Moon (1928) was intended to be the last of Hugh Lofting's Doctor Dolittle books, and differs considerably in tone from its predecessors; the stripped down narrative does not have room for any of the sub-plots and tales previously present. Instead there is a growing sense of an event about to happen that is almost spooky in tone. There are some very complex passages for a childrenâ€™s book; for example, it begins with a meditation about what the writer expects from the reader and vice versa.",
