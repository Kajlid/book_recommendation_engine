  "description": "Idyllic, quaint, and straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting is St. Claire Louisiana at least on the outside. Behind the veneer it’s anything but, that’s the secret of St. Claire. Born and raised in St. Claire, Lindsay Juneau’s life was seemingly full raising a six-year-old daughter, and caring for her widowed mother. Of course, things aren’t always what they seem, and the newest resident of St. Claire isn’t buying the ruse. Veterinarian, Nicole Allen is looking for something different she finds it in St. Claire with its hypochondriac rabbits, shotgun toting shut-ins, and eclectic mix of people. The most alluring though, is a woman that’s also looking for something different.",
