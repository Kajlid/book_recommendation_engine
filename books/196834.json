  "description": "Finally, an American Environmental History for everyone!  After years of teaching Environmental History at a major East Coast University without a textbook, Dan Allosso decided to take matters into his own hands. The result is American Environmental History, a concise, comprehensive survey covering the material from Dan's undergraduate course.  What do people say about the class?  \"This was my first semester and this course has created an incredible first impression. If all of the courses are this good, I am going to really enjoy my time here. The course has completely changed the way I look at the world.\" (Student in 2014 class)  \"One of the few classes I'm really sad is ending, the subject matter is fascinating and Dan is a great guide to it. His approach should be required of all students as it teaches an appreciation for a newer and better way of living.\" (Student in 2014 class)  \"Allosso's lectures are fantastic. The best I have ever had. So impressed. The material is always extremely interesting and well-presented.\" (Student in 2015 class)  \"It is just a perfect course that I think should be mandatory if we want to save our planet and live responsibly.\" (Student in 2015 class)  Beginning in prehistory and concluding in the present, American Environmental History explores the ways the environment has affected the choices that became our history, and how our choices affected the environment. The dynamic relationship between people and the world around them is missing from mainstream history. Putting the environment back into history helps us make sense of the past, which will help guide us toward a better future.",
