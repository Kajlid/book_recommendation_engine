  "title": "Kenk: A Graphic Portrait",
  "description": "A Graphic Portrait is an award-winning, 300-page, journalistic comic book surrounding Igor Kenk, \"the world's most prolific bicycle thief\" (The New York Times and The Guardian). In the summer of 2008, Kenk was arrested and nearly 3,000 bicycles were seized in what became one of the biggest news stories of the year. Built from an incredible mix of candid, filmed interviews prior to his arrest, found footage and archival material, treated with a dazzling visual style, KENK is a thought-provoking and surprisingly funny journalistic profile of an outsize neighborhood figure and a city in flux (in the tradition of New Yorker masters Joseph Mitchell and A.J. Liebling). KENK is a one-of-a-kind profile - a mash-up of mediums that culminates in a marriage of thorough investigative journalism and the comic book form in an entirely new way.",
