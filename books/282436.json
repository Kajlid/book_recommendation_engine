  "description": "So close. We were so close to getting free. A few more deals here. A few more nasty secrets there. All in the name of the cause of course. Then she walked in at the wrong place, wrong time.  Should we kill her? Keep her?  Making the right decision was critical, but we were literally at a crossroads. That’s how the top tier of Alpha Delta Omega inducted our unofficial fourth member. But we weren’t who we said we were. And danger threatened us on every corner. She should be very afraid of us.  Or should we be afraid of her?",
