  "description": "A companion volume to the exceptional The Lady and the Linden Tree (1962), this illustrate once again Miss Picard's knack of wrapping new story fabric around traditional material. The fourteen fairy tales presented here have ingenious plots and imaginative characterizations (worldly or otherwise); witness Count Bertrand and his strange triumph over Death; Count Alaric's Lady in which the Count meets the demands of perfect love, Tiger Lily and the Dragon, where poetry finds more than its own reward, and the title story's vivid climax. Fourteen talespinning delights.
