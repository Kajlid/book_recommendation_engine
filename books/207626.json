  "description": "Miranda Rose absolutely lives for writing. Unfortunately, there aren’t many readers that live for her books.At least she can distract herself from bad reviews with her favorite hobby - trolling Charlie Shivers online. That dinosaur smut peddler wouldn’t know literature if it mounted him from behind. And, for further distraction, she meets the world’s hottest guy at her favorite writing conference, and when he mounts her from behind, she forgets all about that wannabe author.Until she realizes Mr. Hottie Pants isn’t the cover model she’d presumed. He’s her archenemy in the flesh, Charlie Shivers.She’s mortified!And yet she still can’t keep her pants on around him.Joe McCoy, aka Charlie Shivers, is over the moon attending his first Romancing The World conference as a panelist, especially when he meets the smoking author at the bar. But now that he’s discovered the true identity of his one-night stand, he’s tangled in a sticky web, thicker than a spider shifter (dibs on writing that one next!)Though, sleeping with the enemy is kind of hot.And scandalous.And awesome.But then he finds himself falling hard for the too-serious novelist, and now he’s pretty sure there’s no way he’ll make it out on top.",
