  "description": "My ex-boyfriend was a dragon. A dying dragon. And not even a proper fire-breathing dragon. From Lemuria. Because Reasons. And they were dying. And I was in prison (again). Great. Just. Great.   Civil engineer Helena didn't intend to get mixed up with her smoldering-hot ex, Auryn. But an expired passport, a typhoon, and some corrupt government officials (and maybe the cosmos itself) had something to say about that.  She especially did not intend to get mixed up with dying alien space dragons living under the sea.  They're a nice enough bunch. Except they want her dead.  To survive, she'll have to prove that she's destined to be there... by spinning water into air.  This is gonna call for more duct tape.  Breath of Chaos is a slow-burn sci-fantasy reverse harem romance featuring a brilliant heroine who plays with dragon magic, ancient aliens, and potty water. Hold the beer, this is going to get weird.",
