  "description": "Charlie Cooper Profile:  - Underpaid precinct secretary at the Boston Police - Grew up in Springston, 90 miles from Boston – but still not far enough - Weekend plans: toffee caramel ice cream, crime shows and the Laundromat - No friends, no pets, no hobbies - Special gifts: tripping over her own feet - Finding Mr. Right: negative - Healthy diet: cookies and all things sweet  At age twenty-nine, Charlie Cooper’s life is not exactly a hit. Working as a precinct secretary at the Boston Police answering phones, making appointments and writing up crime reports means she might not be on the fast track to her ultimate dream job.  And her living situation? She is the proud inhabitant of the most minuscule “master suite” she can afford to pay, where she can brush her teeth, get her clothes out of the dresser drawer and turn on the hallway light without getting out of bed.  But when a job opportunity arises, she’s ready to take the bull by the horns and prove she is more than just a fast typist. Sure, she has to bite the bullet by returning to her hometown and living with her wacky family, but this is only the cover for her real assignment: finding clues involving a real big drug case.  What starts out to be just harmless snooping turns into a pile of dead bodies, slashed tires and threatening notes. But Charlie is determined to solve the case and catch the killer before he catches her.  Throw in two fearless waitresses and a hot fry cook who is not what he seems and you’ve got the perfect mix of a fast-paced and exciting mystery.",
