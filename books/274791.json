  "description": "Nestled deep in the sleepy heart of Enumclaw - a little town in Washington state - Hedy Leckermaul owns a bakery renowned for its strange, sugary confections. Unbeknownst to the town, she also hosts mysterious visitors. Hedy, Adelaide the ghost, and Hedy's menagerie of animals, offer a place of safety to Enumclaw's supernatural travelers. Life in the little town in the shadow of Mount Rainier may appear picturesque, but things are often not as they seem. Peace and tranquility rarely last, and it isn't long before arson and abduction rock the friendly town, turning the bakery's world upside down. Hedy must think fast when one of her own is now in danger. She has to solve the mystery before it is too late - seconds count before you are Burned to a Crisp. If you like mysteries with talking animals, paranormal cozy stories, fairy tales, mythology and a hefty dose of cookies, you'll love Burned to a Crisp.",
