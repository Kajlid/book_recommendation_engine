  "title": "Three Fifths of Love: A Story of Gay Marriage in New York",
  "description": "Have you ever loved someone? Have you ever married that someone, got in your car, and had your world and your love torn apart because you crossed state lines? In a ripped from the headlines novel of love, heartache, loss, and redemption, Three Fifths of Love tells the tale of Rebecca and Julie two women married legally in one state, but living in another. In the first chapter, Julie is injured in a car accident, and the reader is taken on Rebecca's journey, as she speaks to a comatose Julie from her bedside. Their history together is woven from Rebecca's words and Julie's diary entries, into a compelling picture of a love just as devoted and beautiful as any other traditional family. But the law does not see their love as equal...and Rebecca, a lawyer who thought she had covered every base to protect her family, must hire her own lawyer, and fight a battle bigger than she ever thought she would face...a precedent setting battle that, years later, is referenced by the U.S. Supreme Court when it finally weighs in on the question of gay marriage. Three Fifths of Love takes the reader behind the headlines, and eerily echoes the recent Supreme Court ruling",
