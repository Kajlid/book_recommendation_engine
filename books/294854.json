Running from a past filled with damning secrets, Elle's determined that this guilty pleasure remains buried in her deepest fantasies.Because she couldn't possibly indulge with the Theo Kershaw. Or make a mistake that draws attention to her under-the-radar life. And she especially couldn't be a mom to a pro-athlete's baby ... could she?",
