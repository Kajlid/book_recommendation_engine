  "title": "Feminists and Science : Critiques and Changing Perspectives in India",
  "description": "Feminists and Science, Volume 2 critiques the relationship between science, gender and patriarchies in the Indian context from different disciplinary locations. This volume addresses the complexity of local knowledge and the politics of knowledge-making; interrogates how creativity and the practices of science are gendered; explores methodologies of praticing science differently and moving towards a more inclusive pedagogy. It draws upon the experience of how science and technology have impacted the bodies, lives and work of Indian women, going beyond the problems of women scientists in institutions, and offering a pioneering contribution to both science studies and womenâ€™s studies.",
