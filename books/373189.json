  "description": "Matt Veal, the owner of a small timber mill in Georgia, has vanished from family and friends without a trace. When his brother, Chuck, asks for help from local law enforcement, he instead gets a royal run around and cold reaction to his concerns. Unable to trust everything the local Sheriff is telling him, Chuck asks his love interest and co-worker, Gail, to daringly go with him to Georgia and start a search. When she surprisingly agrees to go and help, the two walk right into a hornet's nest of trouble. Everything from crooked land deals to the unsolved murder of his Grandfather almost a century earlier comes into play with each new clue dropping them deeper into unseen dangers. With the help of Gail's psychic abilities, Chuck starts tracking clue one at his family's old Veal Cemetery, the last known place his brother had gone. From there the dominoes fall, tripping circuit breakers on all the wealthy in West Creek County. The crooked forces send out their army of \"Cops in their pocket\" fighters to meet the threat of exposure from Chuck's search, head on, and the rest of the story is breathless action to the conclusion. Whispering Pines \"The Beginning\" is a rework and retitlled editon of Wells' first book, \"Sand Hill Estates the Murders\" originally published in 2009 by Aspen Mountain Press. If you've read Sand Hill then you'll want to skip this one and move on to book two of the Whispering Pines Series, \"The Revenge.\" Otherwise, start here if you're looking for fast pasced and thrilling suspense with a southern flavor. Don't miss this 270 page anchor for the rest of the unpublished series. Available in both ebook and trade paperback print. (5.5 x 8.5)",
