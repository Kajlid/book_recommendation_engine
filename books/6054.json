  "description": "Finally back in print, In the Company of Newfies is one of the most beautiful books ever written about dogs. It has become a classic and a collectible. It is a book of love and loss...for owners of all breeds, not just Newfoundlands. Thousands have found, after the loss of their dogs, enduring comfort in it. Thousands have found eye-opening insights into the hearts of their dogs. Lerman recounts a year in the life of one litter, and in the lives of the rest of the dog family in her household who help to rear and train the pups. It is a year of many victories and some losses, and it is through both that the reader experiences a full sweep of the emotions dogs and humans share. By book's end, the reader will have laughed at the antics of the irrepressible Toby; admired the quiet strength and intelligence of the mother, Molly; delighted in the growing maturity of the pups Rosie and Silky; cheered as Ishtar takes her first championship ribbon; and wept for the death of noble Ben. Couples read it out loud to each other. In the Company of Newfies is a visionary book filled with stunning insights that teach us much about the profound bond between human and dog, about the almost limitless possibilities in our relationships with them. Lerman's observations, keen and deeply intuitive, reveal dogs' thinking and behavior in new and wonderful ways. Reading her book, it is hard to deny her belief that dogs want to commune with people, want to leave their wild selves and join our human community. Perhaps only a novelist of Rhoda Lerman's skill and sensitivity could have ranged so freely to tell us so much.",
