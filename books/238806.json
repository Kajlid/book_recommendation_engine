  "description": "Have you ever felt like you don't belong with your own kind? Been scared to be yourself? Well, join the club.  I'm a werewolf, forbidden to shift by my father, the Alpha. My beast locked away in a cage that weakens every day. A confrontation at training forces my beast to the surface and sends me on the run for my life. It turns out I'm not all werewolf, but part vampire too. My mortal enemy.  Does this mean my whole life has been a lie? How do I move forward with my truth, when my blood is nothing but false.  *This book is 50k long and contains coarse language, sexual situations and is a Reverse Harem (meaning one girl and multiple guys).",
