  "description": "A Paranormal Werebear Bear Shifter Romance Series.  This is a standalone of about 150 pages with a Happily Ever After ending and No cliffhanger. This book also contains several additional bonus stories to enjoy!  Sterling Mallory likes fast—fast cars and faster women, anything to keep the ghosts at bay. Living life on the edge catches up to him when he carelessly makes an enemy of Kyle Barns. Who knew that Kyle’s younger sister would turn out to be Sterling’s mate? Now, his mate hates him.  Ophelia Barns left her flourishing journalism career in Nashville to come back home to Burden, Texas. Her brother has always been her rock, and now it’s her turn to be there for him. When someone crosses him, they cross her.  When Ophelia is forced to interview Sterling for the local Burden Gazette, despite the fact that they don’t have an easy time dealing with each other, the attraction is so intense that they might each be willing to make some sacrifices.  NOTE This is a series centered around the southwestern town of Burden, Texas. For good ol’ bears Hawthorne, Wyatt, Hutch, Sterling, and Sam, livin’ is easy, beer flows freely, and pretty women are abundant. The last thing the shifters of Burden are thinking about is finding a mate or settling down. But, fate has its own plan…  WARNING: THIS BOOK CONTAINS GRAPHIC SCENES OF A SEXUAL NATURE AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR READERS UNDER 18.",
