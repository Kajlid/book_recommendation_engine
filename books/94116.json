  "title": "Neverland's Lament",
  "description": "If his body is forever a child, does his mind remain young also? Peter shrugged the question away. He was a boy and supposed to have fun. That was all that mattered. But the nightmares came every night. Something important was lost – someone he cared about. If only the boy could remember what had happened, but his mind didn’t dare venture into such painful waters. Though Neverland was his island, Peter feared losing control. Keeping power over the thoughts in his head was a constant struggle. Something precious was gone; and without any idea of where to look, a story from the young Wendy was his only hope of piecing together the mystery of his loss and returning to that place of eternal joy and happiness.",
