  "description": "No Ordinary Joe: The Life and Career of Joe Biden tells the story of Joseph Robinette Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2020 US presidential election. Over the course of his long career, Biden has bounced back from ridiculous gaffes, humiliating scandals, political defeats, unimaginable personal tragedy, and being read the last rites.Even Biden's rivals have paid tribute to his incredible capacity to continue through the worst that life can throw at him. If Joe Biden's latest - and probably final - campaign ends with him becoming the oldest man ever elected as America's president, it will be his most triumphant comeback of all.This is the remarkable life of the man who just might become the 46th President of the United States.",
