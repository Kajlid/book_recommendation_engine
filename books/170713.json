  "description": "Honor. Justice. Brains.Perched on the border between civilized ghoulkind and the chaos of the barbaric slickskins, the zombie sheriff must rescue his kidnapped friends from the dastardly McFarland and his notorious gang of outlaws. He assembles a posse of the most talented zombies around, including Mungo, a zombie chef interested in locally sourced ingredients, Bub, a barber whose enormous strength somewhat makes up for his complete lack of intelligence, and Dr. Callahan, a would-be pacifist who reattaches misplaced limbs with gusto. As the posse tracks McFarland, they soon realize that they themselves are being pursued. The ever-courteous Abernathy Jones, as quick with his business cards as he is with his deadly cane, is out to settle an old score from the sheriff’s pre-zombie past, though exactly what he wants is anyone’s guess.Even more troubling, the sheriff begins to hear rumors that the true reason for his friends’ abduction is to provide test subjects for the sadistic experiments of the mysterious Dr. Gimmler-Heichman.The Zombie Sheriff Takes Tucson: A Love Story is the absurd, tongue-through-cheek tale of reanimated cowboys, undying love, and the lengths to which one zombie will go for justice. And for brains.",
