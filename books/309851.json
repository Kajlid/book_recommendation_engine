  "description": "Most of the stories I’d heard about Scarlet Bay Penitentiary in New York, I never gave much thought. I mean, why would I when I had the power of the Diamond Empire behind me.Otherwise known as an American Mafia.On top of that, I never leave a trace of evidence behind. I burn it.People and all.Most importantly, I’m Aidan Hughes’s son, and for that reason alone, I’m damn good at being a criminal.I was born to follow in my father’s footsteps—a natural-born killer.But when I stepped inside that prison to serve years for a crime I didn’t commit, I knew that for however long I was going to be locked behind bars, I’d be living in the mouth of hell. Jaws just a snapping, ready to swallow a weak man whole.It’s a good thing I’m not a weak man.Except with her. Amber Solokov.The woman I’ve loved most of my life.The woman I let go.The woman who is now engaged to someone else.Now that I’m out, it’s time for war. On the person who set me up and the man Amber is engaged to.I would never have thought they’d be one and the same.",
