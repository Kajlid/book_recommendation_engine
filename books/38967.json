  "description": "Inside Out Prison is brutal. Rape, murder, and drug overdoses are normal. But not in one week. Can Perri Stone find a connection before more inmates die needlessly? Some thoughts from readers of Inside \"Intriguing Characters Made This A Page Turner\" \"Didn't see the ending coming\" \"Tough gritty prison detective story that weaves its way a prison setting. For Lt. Perri Stone, a supervising investigator in a prison a lot of people are dying a natural death or are they Perri wonders. The novel starts pretty rough as one convict rapes another convict and this scene is presented in graphic detail (not for the squeamish). When the rapist is questioned about the rape, he readily admits that it was indeed a rape. This arouses Lt Stone's suspicions because prisoners never admit to anything and even if they are caught red handed they always try to blame it on someone else.( I have questioned several criminals during my work career, I believe this is a Standard Operating Procedure for a criminal.) Further adding to her suspicions was the fact that both victim and perpetrator had no previous relationship yet both were in an area neither should have been in at the time.\"",
