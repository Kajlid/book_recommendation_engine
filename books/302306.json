Another world.Where his wasn’t falling apart.And hers wasn’t already in pieces.-High school senior Holden Eastwood only has one fear in life: growing up.He spends his days unmotivated, moving from one game to the next, searching for his next challenge.He never expected that challenge to come in the form of a girl…A girl with zero fashion sense, a filthy mouth, and a bullsh*t attitude.Unlike Holden, Jameson Taylor had no choice but to grow up.Neglected, isolated, and forced to raise herself, Jameson only has one goal in life: graduate and move on.The last thing she needs is some guy she can’t stand suddenly declaring her as his new hobby.Their lives couldn’t be more opposite.Their pasts a complete paradox.But in each other, they find the unexpected…They find solace.Fragments of forever…A forever that might tear them to pieces.",
