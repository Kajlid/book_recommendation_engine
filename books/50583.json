  "title": "Semper Fi: Stories of the United States Marines from Boot Camp to Battle",
  "description": "Semper Fi collects into one volume the best, most compelling stories and eyewitness accounts from the vast literature about the elite few who call themselves United States Marines. The history of the Marine Corps is inextricably intertwined with that of the country it defendsâ€”from its formation during the American Revolution through the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War, right up to its recent role in Afghanistan. Marines not only played a deciding role in many of the moments which have determined our history, but set a standard for honor, self-sacrifice, and courage which has defined the best of military heroism in this country for generations. Including the most compelling excerpts from classics old and new by authors such as Thomas Ricks (Making the Corps), James Brady (The Coldest War), Studs Terkel (The Good War), Lewis B. Puller, Jr. (Fortunate Son), James W. Johnson (The Long Road of War), Joseph Alexander (Edson's Raiders), John C. Stevens III (Court-Martial At Parris Island), Anthony Swofford (Jarhead), and Frank and John Schaeffer (Keeping Faith), this anthology will bring readers the pain, pride, and glory of being a member of America's most renowned fighting group.",
