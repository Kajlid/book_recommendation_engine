So, when she finds herself married to Richard Bretton, 12th Duke of Cuthland, and living in his haunted house, she wonders if she’s going mad.As the new mistress of Amberley Court, Carys discovers she’s now in charge of a house the size of a small village. And, as if that isn’t enough to be getting on with, she finds herself in the most unpopular of roles: a stepmother to young Cecily and Evie.Carys desperately needs help but she doesn’t expect it to come from an eighteenth-century duchess who simply refuses to leave Amberley.Three Graces is a romantic fantasy about mothers, daughters, lovers and ghosts, and how the past always manages to find its way into the present.* * *By the bestselling author of romantic comedies A Weekend with Mr Darcy and Molly's Millions, Three Graces was published in Germany in 2009. This is the first time it’s been published in the English language.",
