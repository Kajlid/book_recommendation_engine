  "description": "Ophelia Redwine has been having dreams about a beautiful young lady singing a nonsensical tune… “with bells on her fingers and rings on her toes.” And she won’t go away. A forty year old, unidentified corpse and a mysterious, little old man who appears to know more than he’s letting on, connect to Ophelia’s dream in a most disturbing way. Can Ophelia fit the pieces of the puzzle together in time to prevent more mayhem? That depends. Can she keep history from repeating itself? She’s going to give it her best shot.You can contact the author (and order the book) at:jerre@turnipseedsbookstore.com",
