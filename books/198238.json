As time goes by, boredom and estrangement creep into nuptial bed.There are those who accept it, others fight, some escape into adultery, some change partners, entertaining an illusion that the new relationship will work out better.Is there a solution, or is it really true that love lives for three years, and there’s nothing to be done about it?The main character is Daria, a psychologist, gender relations are within the scope of her professional interests. And then comes a point when her own marital sex becomes lackluster, and love begins to fade fast. Unwilling to resign to it, she goes into action, totally unaware where it is going to take her--This novel is a manual, a guide, a formula of “love till the very end” for those who dream about it. It is highly provocative, unorthodox, controversial, extremely uninhibited, outspoken, sexy; what is undisputable is that it shows each woman a way to become The Only One for her partner.\"The MASK or the Formula of a Perfect Wife\" is the novel's new name. The old one, \"Boredom or Love Till the Very End\", made many people uneasy for no reason at all.",
