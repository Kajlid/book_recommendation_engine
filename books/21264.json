  "title": "How to be YOU! A Winner's Guide to Self-Empowerment",
  "description": "You have inner powers. You use them every day, mostly to defeat yourself. This book shows you how to use those same powers to bring health, happiness, and prosperity into your life. Regardless of how beaten-down or hard-done-by you may feel, the real truth about you, no matter who you are, is that you are a dynamically perfect, deserving, and empowered child of a bountiful, benevolent, and provident Universe. As long as you can keep your own ego from reacting to 'control-freaks' in whose interest it is to deny you that God-given status, you can use the powerful connection between your subconscious mind and the Universal Subconscious to actualize any desire you may have that is both respectful of others and consistent with Universal Harmony. In other words, you can, on your own and without help from any outside source, change yourself and your fortunes for the better, no matter how dismal your present situation may appear to you. In this book, I explain a simple, logical, time-tested method that can enable you, step-by-step, not only to realize your fondest dreams but also to attain many goals that you never even dared to think you were worthy of, just by changing your attitude about yourself and your relationship to the world around you.",
