  "description": "Zacharias Arsenault is the last of the Keithville Brethren without his promised mate, until he finds her on New Year’s Eve. He cannot believe how perfect she is for him and that she wants to be with him even knowing he is Brethren. An unforeseen occurrence tests their bond with each other, one that could throw the world into Armageddon should it break. The Brethren face another dilemma, they must perform a ritual with limited knowledge of what is needed and no solutions are forthcoming. If the Brethren fail in the ritual, Hell will gain a relic it once lost, which will cost the world dearly.Brittney Wagner has been an amazing asset to the Brethren over the last year. She has assisted them all with their wedding rings, catering their weddings and making their wedding cakes, but there is one member of the Keithville Brethren she has never met until New Year’s Eve. She cannot believe how instantly attracted she is to him, even knowing he is not human. An unforeseen occurrence will test their bond more than any of the other Brethren. Can their bond stand the trials placed on it and not break?",
