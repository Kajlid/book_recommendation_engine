  "description": "Raised in a trading port, I'd seen my share of attractive sailors.But I'd never cared to get to know one, let alone allow one to follow me around, drawing my neighbors' suspicions that I was a seductress.Until the day I pulled him from the water.I found him drowned and alone, and I breathed life into him before I knew his name.But the moment Kye opened his golden-brown eyes, I fell under a spell I couldn't escapeâ€”until I found myself trapped under his knife.He betrayed me to my enemies, this man who owes me his life. And I hate him.To him, it's a game of power. But to me, it's freedom or captivity.With every dark gaze, every whispered threat, I find myself drawn to him against my will. But I refuse to fall for him a second time.He'll have to kill me first.",
