  "description": "Lucy Tuttle is a workaholic financial planner whose biggest worry is how to line up the sticky notes on her desk just so, until her free-spirited, vivacious aunt dies in a car accident halfway across the world.With her last remaining family member gone, a landmark birthday approaching, domestication closing in, and her faltering biological clock a never-ending reminder of the time she isn't spending building a family, Lucy attempts to make a home for herself in the house she's inherited. But as she struggles to settle into a life of cohabitation, organic lentils, and sock thievery, she starts to wonder how she ended up there--and when she'll feel alive again.As she works through her grief and tries to find somewhere to belong, Lucy begins to understand that sometimes, realizing one dream means giving up another. Can a person who spends her time fixing other people's lives learn to let go enough to live her own?The Sock Wars is a poignant, funny reminder that there's one thing harder than living up to other people's expectations; facing your own.The Sock Wars has been a top 100 digital bestseller.
