  "description": "After most of Earth's population has left for other planets, life is simple in the isolated village of Tober Cove. Fullin, a twenty-year-old musician, lives well off of his craft. But soon he must make a life-afflicting decision that all residents of Tober Cove must make. Up until their twenty-first birthday, the people of Tober Cove change gender every year. But at the age of 21, they must commit to being male, female or a Neut (essentially a Hermaphrodite) for the rest of their lives. As Fullin nears the moment of decision his faith becomes shaken when he uncovers secrets that distort his beliefs.",
