  "description": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that doctors make the worst patients. This is my story as a patient through a doctorâ€™s eyes with the hope that healthcare professionals will read it, in particular young doctors and medical students, and understand exactly what being a patient is really like and how their behaviours, no matter how small can impact massively on their patients. It is also a story of my own personal battles with control and learning how and when to relinquish it.",
