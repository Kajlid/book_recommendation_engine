  "description": "Owl is gone, Werewolf Jones has moved in, and everything as Megg and Mogg know it begins to fall apart. Hanselmann’s comic premise of his previous graphic novels — eternally stoned, slacker roommates — stretches at the seams as his characters reflect the psychological toll that their years of unsustainable, determined insouciance and self-medication has inflicted.",
