  "title": "SWAP: The Best Way To Make Your Dreams Come True.",
  "description": "The SWAP Process is the easy way to move from “stuck in a rut” to “dreams come true.” Imagine if everything in your life were to be perfect - what would that be like? You’d sleep like a dormouse, your career would leap ahead, your earnings would go off the richter scale, your relationships would be loving and happy - you would be in sync with the world. Such a life does not have to exist only in the realms of fantasy. Your dreams can come true. You can make your life the way you want it to be.The SWAP Process is, in many respects, the story of how the author has coached thousands of people to release themselves from their inhibitions and achieve what is important to them. Twenty five years of coaching experience has gone into developing this unique path to a happy, fulfilling and rewarding life. Fundamental to the process is the knowledge that when it comes to achieving what you want in life dreams are far more motivating than goals. Then, once you have the motivation, it provides a provenly effective way to move past your doubts so that you can achieve what you desire.When it comes to making your dreams come true the issue is not your lack of ability - what really hinders you are the barriers that you place across your own path - your limiting beliefs, fears and past history. These prevent you from making progress just as effectively as the disc brakes on your motor car. Ask yourself these “do you have a really clear, detailed picture of how you would like your life to be? Have you developed an exciting way of making your dream come true? Do you have an effective way of overcoming your anxieties and limiting beliefs? Is your attitude as positive as the achievers you know? Are you chiselling away day after day at the Big Idea that will make your dream come true?”If you answered “no” to any of the questions above the time has come to start making progress. The SWAP Process will make your dream glow like a magnetic flame that will light the path to your personal nirvana. It will enable you to overcome your inhibitions and hurdle your barriers so that you can experience the wonder of feeling happy and fulfilled every day.Built into the SWAP Process are a number of hypnotic suggestions that will smooth your path, make it easy for you to make your dreams to come true.",
