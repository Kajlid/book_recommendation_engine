  "description": "The world is ending. Everyone knows it. What they don't realize is that the culprit won't be an asteroid, or global warming, or even the sun turning into a red giant. No, the world is going to end because there are four other worlds just like it trying to exist in the same space.  I can either save the world or end it, the choice is mine, at least according to the four weird guys that I keep running into. They keep telling me that demons are after me, and that they want me to save the world. All I know is that I'm drawn to all four of them, and the only demon I know of is my oceanography professor.  Strange things are happening all around me though, and I'm starting to think their theories and warnings might be true. Either that or I'm finally starting to lose my mind.  My name is Tessa Morningstar and apparently I'm the Key, with a capital K, to this whole shebang. Now, let's hope I don't accidentally make the wrong choice and doom us all. *Previously titled Water. 18+ #whychoose romance. Content Warning: Steamy love scenes and plenty of sexy warriors who will leave you wanting more.*",
