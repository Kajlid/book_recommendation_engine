  "description": "Dr Anna McBride’s life is starting to unravel. The mother of two boys and a dedicated GP, she is being sued for medical negligence—a case of delayed diagnosis. Anna’s day-to-day work becomes increasingly difficult as she starts to scrutinise her every action and question her worth. Deeply ashamed of her mistake, she retreats into family life, only to find that her husband seems preoccupied with a younger colleague. As the date for mediation draws closer and the lawyers’ demands become ever more pressing, Anna also senses someone else’s cries for attention—someone who wishes her harm.Dissection is an original and confronting portrayal of a woman facing personal and professional crises. It examines an extended moment of inner turmoil, after which nothing will ever be the same again.",
