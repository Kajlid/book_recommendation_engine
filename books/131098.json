  "description": "Alfred Jarry is best known as the author of the proto-Dada play \"Ubu Roi,\" but this anarchic novel of absurdist philosophy is widely regarded as the central work to his oeuvre. Refused for publication in the author's lifetime, \"Exploits and Opinion of Dr. Faustroll\" recounts the adventures of the inventor of \"Pataphysics . . . the science of imaginary solutions.\" Pataphysics has since inspired artists as diverse as Marcel Duchamp and the 60s rock band Soft Machine, as well as the mythic literary organization the College de Pataphysique. Simon Watson Taylor's superb annotated translation (which in turn inspired a new French edition of the text) was first published by Grove Press in 1965 as part of their now out-of-print collection, \"Selected Works of Alfred Jarry.\" As a result, this most important novel by Jarry has never before been published under its own title in English.",
