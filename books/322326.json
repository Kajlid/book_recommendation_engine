  "description": "Without Roar – you try pronouncing it, okay? -- I’d be dead in that pod. And when he purrs and does that thing with his... I think I’ll keep him.Abducted by space lizards? Check.Experimented on? Check.Rescued by seven feet of hot, alien male? Check!Roar’s a bit shy, furry with claws and a metal arm, and his best friend is a spaceship named Killer. That’s a little scary.Almost as scary as the zombie.And the giant, angry insects.And the hungry shadow monsters.Roar doesn’t want to dishonor me or something like that so we’re keeping things casual. (Sort of. Maybe. Definitely not.) And if I live through this without getting my brain eaten, we might have a chance at something more.Stranger things have happened.Roar! is a full-length (and I mean full-length) alien warrior romance with pulse-pounding action, a snarky AI, more aliens than you can shake a blaster at, and all the hotness.If you like alien abduction romance with a twist, give Roar! a try. HEA guaranteed.",
