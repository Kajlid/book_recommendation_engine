  "description": "“Life and temporality are indispensably attached to the inevitability of death. Is ‘living’ a fight against inevitability?”\n“A stimulating Existentialist Novella!” - “Embark upon a contemplative journey of self-discovering.”The story encompasses an existentialist’s perspective with the protagonist exploring various elements of existentialism including alienation, freedom, death, hope and despair. The protagonist, Murk Zilch, living an isolated life amongst the mountains undergoes a metamorphosis after the ‘tragic’ death of his little brother.  Through the impactful events of the past and his understanding of life, he discovers the essence by deriving meaning in the nothingness of the world.It acknowledges the absurdity that lay within the foundation of our existence and aims to form out its own subjective essence, thereby defining its individuality. It attempts to provide its readers with an optimistic perspective towards life by shedding materialism and their preconceptions of reality. The quintessential aspect of the story is that in its entirety it provokes readers to contemplate along with the protagonist over the \ntemporality of existence\n and the \ninevitability of death\n. It incorporates Socrates’ method of dialectics as a mode of self-interrogation through monologues, allowing readers to question the genesis of the subject itself.​Fewer amongst a few out there. A contrast to a simple and daily read. A companion for life. Thought-provoking. Attempts to elevating the readers from the grasp of despair towards a path of enlightenment. Provide a different and yet intriguing way of living.“Existentialism exploration.”",
