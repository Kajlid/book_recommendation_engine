  "title": "Leeds House",
  "description": "Leeds House is a post-Empire horror novel about the millennial generation that asks the question, \"How do you scare a group of kids who have already seen everything on the internet?\" T/James Reagan, after satirizing celebrities and the fashion industry, moves on to the horror genre for his most twisted novel yet. In Leeds House, members of the metalcore band \"Lies As Language\" end up in New Jersey's Pine Barrens, where they're confronted with every millennial's ultimate fear- being held accountable for their actions. With no one else to blame, each character is forced to pay the debts they've accrued through their own narcissistic actions. The story plays out as Eastbound & Down meets The Evil Dead, and the novel explores such topics as Christianity, homosexuality, and the crumbling music business. Offensive humor, VHS horror movie nostalgia, and an immersive narrative all converge to make Reagan's third novel a unique experience for those readers willing to step inside Leeds House.",
