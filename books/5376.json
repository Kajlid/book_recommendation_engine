  "title": "The Outsiders of Uskoken Castle",
  "description": "Known to the people of the town as Zora's Gang and known to themselves as the Uskoken, a group of five homeless youngsters ranged over the countryside near the Adriatic coast in Yugoslavia (Croatia). Sleeping, eating, all everyday concerns were difficult for them, but every day brought new adventure and new challenge. They lived secretly in an ancient 'haunted' castle, found what food they could in the countryside, ate stale bread the baker gave them, and stole the rest.The elders of the town (Senj), the police, and the schoolboys waged perpetual war on the gang - and the Uskoken vented their anger on the town. Resolutely defending their friends and battling against those who interfered with them, they were outlaws in the true Robin Hood tradition.The outsiders of Uskoken Castle is a story based on fact. It gives a true and vivid portrait of the lives of some orphaned children in Europe at the time of World War II.",
