She coped with her heartbreak by finishing her doctorate in Celtic Artwork, and now her career is taking off. Except Tavish keeps showing up at her job sites and butting into her businessâ€”all the while wearing that stupid sexy kilt.But she's here to see the ruins, not Tavish.

Why does he seem to know more about it than she does?",
