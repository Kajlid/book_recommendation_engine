  "description": "Ariana Rose’s Twisted is a steamy, emotionally charged, contemporary romance written in K. Bromberg’s Driven Worlds project.I bought into fairytales. I was raised around them.My grandparents are one. My parents are another.I spent hours playing the hero big brother by reading them to my sister when she was little. It was easy to think they were attainable.I even had one until three years ago.Then she showed me love just isn't enough.Ever since, I've worked hard to avoid feeling and anything that resembles deep emotion. My life was ordered, specific, and calm. Until a dance in a dark, crowded nightclub.Dylan is a game changer.Thanks to her, I'm finally healing.She pushes my thoughts, my limits, and my needs to the edge.We work hard and play even harder.I don't know where it's going, but I know I'm enjoying the ride.",
