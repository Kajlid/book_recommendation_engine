  "title": "8 Deadly Sins",
  "description": "The Church has settled on a list of 7 mortal sins but the Fathers of the Church more often referred to 8. The deadly or capital sins - covetousness, envy, sloth, gluttony, lust, anger, vainglory and pride - are the most significant and insidious temptations with which we must contend. A first step in countering their influence is understanding their psychological and spiritual roots in human experience. Standing humbly in the truth about ourselves, we will appreciate the power of God's love to heal and strengthen our nature, for love is not jealous or boastful, not arrogant or rude, not irritable or resentful.The Deeper Christianity Series delves into the mysteries of Christianity, opening up the spiritual treasures of the Church.",
