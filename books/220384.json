  "title": "Clara Awake",
  "description": "Ever since anthropology PhD student Clara Lemont started researching the African-Brazilian religion of Odùn, her days and nights became filled with dreams of swirling figures of white, drum beats and yellow eyes haunting her in the darkness. When Clara travels to Brazil to do fieldwork, she quickly finds herself immersed in a world of dark intrigue, political corruption, black magic and desire. Travelling across time and space to be reunited with her eternal lover, history, politics and sex all collide as the female energy of the goddesses and the transformative power of love combat the dark forces of evil. An evocative and sweeping tale of myth and magic, from a seventeenth-century escaped slave community in northern Brazil to 1930s Rio de Janeiro, Clara Awake will take you on a sensual journey of intense passion, intrigue and love.\"A magical, sensual journey into the primal heart of darkness, an exploration of magic, spirituality and sexuality. Do we create our own futures or are our destinies decided by the gods and goddesses of old? A compelling novel about the universal energies that connect us to one another and to the purest good, and the deepest evil. If we follow the truth within our souls, the power of love can bring triumphant freedom, enduring strength and a vivid lust for life.\"—Lisa de Nikolits, award-winning author of Between the Cracks She Fell and The Nearly Girl",
