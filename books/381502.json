  "description": "From one of our most distinguished Shakespeare scholars. here is a fascinating. lively. anecdotal work of forensic biography that firmly places Shakespeare within the hectic. exhilarating world in which he lived and wrote. Theater in Shakespeare's day was a burgeoning “growth industry. Everyone knew everyone else. and they all sought to learn. borrow or steal from one another. As Stanley Wells To see Shakespeare as one among a great company is only to enhance our sense of what made him unique. ”Wells explores Elizabethan and Jacobean theater. both behind the scenes and in front of the curtain. He examines how the great actors of the time influenced Shakespeare's work. He writes about the lives and works of the other major writers of Shakespeare's day and discusses Shakespeare's relationships-sometimes collaborative-with each of them.",
