  "description": "Do you ever wonder where the stuff around you all came from? No, not from eBay. I mean, who had the amazing idea of making a mobile phone or the annoying idea of building a school? For example, did you know that Velcro was invented by a dog and WiFi by a movie star? (Spoiler alert - it wasn’t Zendaya.)In the fourth laugh-out-loud book from Adam Kay and Henry Paker, you’ll learn all about the coolest, grossest and most ridiculous inventions in the world. You’ll meet the queen who used the first ever toilet, learn why margarine used to be full of maggots and find out why Ancient Greeks wiped their bums on dinner plates. Oh, and hopefully some slightly more useful facts as well…An A to Kay to Z of the random, ridiculous and revolutionary inventions that changed our lives.
