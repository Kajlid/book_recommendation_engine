  "description": "A boy who never plays by the rules. A girl who always does. But love is always a risk.AlexI am distinctly charming. Don’t worry, you’re not the first to fall for my extreme wit and handsomeness. QuinnThose were definitely not the words that came to my mind.AlexI’ve also been called striking. Once there was even a mention of god-like. QuinnSo, you talk to yourself frequently, do you?Careful Quinn believes in perfection: her perfectly nice boyfriend, her perfect GPA, and her perfect plan for her life. Unfortunately, the decidedly imperfect Alex has been assigned to her group project and is messing up absolutely everything. What begins as strictly necessary communication for the class slowly becomes more frequent and serious as she gets to know him. From his total lack of respect for school to the undeniable chemistry they share, Alex is beginning to make Quinn question everything she thought was true, especially about love. Is his constant, playful flirting with her real or just another game for him?With its sharp sarcasm and wit, Textual Chemistry is a romantic comedy that will appeal to fans of John Green. Readers who love intellectual banter and savvy references won’t be able to put down this romance between the smart slacker guy and the overly perfectionist girl, similar to Rory and Jess from Gilmore Girls. This hilarious rom-com will keep you laughing and turning the page to see if this dynamic couple will or won’t get together.",
