  "description": "It's about bows and arrows and guns; it's about hunters and hunted; it's about the snowstorm of the century . . . and it's about murder.Boreal Dreams, short listed for the Robertson Davies Prize, is the story of corporate greed and corruption as a major producer of genetically altered corn desperately tries to cover up a contaminated shipment destined for a third world country. Tension mounts as Sheriff Ray Lackner and his deputy set out in search of a snowmobile accident during an unpredicted blinding snowstorm. Events escalate when they learn it is not an accident but murder they are looking at; all hell breaks loose when state troopers, forensic people and a mysterious French detective from Montreal arrive on the scene. What secrets are hidden within the caves up in the hills? How many murders have been committed? What is the mystery behind the reclusive wealthy landowner and the disappearance of his wife? And what about the Mohawks and the Abenakis . . . are they at war? Boreal Dreams has a wide-ranging cast of characters that reflect the rich diversity of humans found in communities everywhere.Honesty, loyalty, trust and vulnerability; greed, lust and betrayal . . . it's all there.",
