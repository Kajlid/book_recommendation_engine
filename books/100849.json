And that’s how many were now mentally linked to me through a blood bond.Two days. Three valium. Fourteen hours of sleep.That’s what it took to realize I wasn’t losing my mind as a result of the noise in my own head.Sixteen.That’s how many days have passed since I almost killed Alex. That’s how many days I’ve sat by his bedside, waiting for him to wake up. To ease the guilt, to understand his betrayal, to remember the exact shade of brown in his eyes.Zero.That’s my chances of skating by with Gordon Steppe and the Hunter Council. They want me for questioning. I’m afraid what’ll happen if I give them answers.",
