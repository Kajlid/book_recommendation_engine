  "title": "Bay City Babylon: The Unbelievable, But True Story Of The Bay City Rollers",
  "description": "(NEW REVISED EDITION) Bay City Babylon tells the story of the unlikely pop phenomenon that was the Bay City Rollers--from their humble Scottish beginnings to worldwide fame and adulation, and what's happened to them since. It's a classic tale of rock stardom with all the trappings, excesses, anguish, and exhilaration that go with it. Featuring interviews with band members and those that were along for the \"Rollermania\" ride in the '70s. Plus, many never before published photographs and new \"10th Anniversary\" chapters that update the BCR story with details of their groundbreaking lawsuit for millions of dollars in unpaid record company royalties and their 2015 reunion.",
