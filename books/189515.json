We moved to Callup, Idaho after my dad blew out his back and had to go on disability. Boonie’s family lived next to ours. Every afternoon he’d swagger off the school bus after kindergarten like a conquering king. For the first week he ignored me, until I impressed him by climbing nearly thirty feet up in the tree behind his trailer. They had to call the fire department to get me down, but it was worth it to see the respect in his five-year-old eyes. He gave me a worm in honor of my accomplishment. I fell in love. The next day he made me eat the worm and our relationship has been complicated ever since.
