  "description": "Angela is Charlie's best friend, or best fiend as Charlie accidentally wrote in her essay. But fiend is probably a better word, as it's Angela who puts a spider in Miss Menzies' sandwich, and plasters glue all over Laurence Parker's chair... Angela has a knack of getting Charlie into heaps of trouble but friend or fiend, life is never dull for Charlie when Angela is around!",
