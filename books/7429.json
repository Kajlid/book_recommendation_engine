When his neighbor begins having trouble with a stalker, he takes it upon himself to watch out for her. The problem is that he lusts after her as he watches her. He believes he is too rough of a lover for someone like her. Somehow he has to keep her safe from not only the stalker, but from him as well. Tina Antonelli works as a coding consultant during the day and spies on her hunky neighbor at night. When the man who attacked her a year ago but was never caught returns to stalk her, Tina accepts her neighbor's offer of help. But will her attraction to him lead to even more problems?",
