  "title": "Duke's Baby Deal",
  "description": "All his life, Bram’s been told what he would be, and what he would do. No one ever gave a thought to what Bram might think he wanted. There was only one career option for an omega—a mating and pups and looking after the household. But Bram wants more. He wants adventure and excitement and romance, and something different than looking after pups for the rest of his life. He flirts and teases with all the alphas, but the one he wants, he can’t figure out how to get. Until one of his more dangerous suitors goes too far, and Bram finds himself in a situation that could ruin him for life. Until Duke steps in with an offer of a respectable mating, and everything Bram wanted is somehow now within reach. But all gifts come with trials, and both Duke and Bram have difficult paths to tread on the way to happiness.  94,000 words in length This book can be read on its own, but contains numerous references to characters and events in the first two books. It would be best read in series.",
