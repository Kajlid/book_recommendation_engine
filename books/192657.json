  "description": "In the second installment in the Chambers of the Heart series, Rayne Storm's life has become reminiscent of an early morning's mist hovering over the surface of her beloved bayou. She follows the path her mother, Charlie Grace, and Grant had designed for her years ago and accepts Grant's proposal. At the engagement party, Samantha \"Sam\" LeJeune and Rayne allow their deepest layers of doubt and insecurity to shroud their undeniable attraction to each other and say goodbye as Sam moves to Florida for her residency. During her residency at the University of Alabama, Rayne explores the local gay community and makes friends there who reawaken her. Now Rayne finds herself in a fog of choices between an upbringing she both loves yet resents for its deep southern values and a life she knows she has no choice but to live. At some point she knows the rain will fall and when it rains . . . it pours.",
