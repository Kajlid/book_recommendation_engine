  "title": "All Men Dream of Earthwomen and Other Aeons",
  "description": "I have traveled in vision from futures near at hand to those immeasurably remote and returned with tales of mystery and wonder, sorrow and hope, humanity and what comes after, and further yet, to the time beyond the end of time, and perhaps glimpsed eternity.I convoke the witness of my dreams of things to come, and reveal them as curios and treasures. Behold future wars and children's power armor, see the planetkiller seeking immortal vengeance against planetkillers, learn whom the choosers of the slain will choose for love, or when the dolphins will inherit the earth, or why all men dream of earthwomen.",
