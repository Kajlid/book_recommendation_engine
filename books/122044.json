  "description": "An entire campus knows my name. Women throw themselves at me, hoping I’ll take them home that night. Whispers from the NHL say I’m the one to watch. And the weight of each game is on my shoulders because if our opposing team scores … that’s on me. All the things that keep me up at night are probably someone else’s dreams. From the moment I saw Ryann Denver in my Business 101 class, I was intrigued and determined to get to know her. But unlike most girls at Brooks, she hates athletes. And when I introduce myself to her, she makes it perfectly clear that she's not interested. So, I walk away forever with my tail tucked firmly between my legs. But as fate would have it, we’re paired up together in a charity dance event. And now, whether she likes it or not, she has to spend time with me. A lot of time. I guess I’m in luck because it turns out she can use me in her corner right now. And when she finds herself in trouble and I’m the only one she can run to, she figures out maybe I’m not that bad after all. Ryann is going to see I’m not like the players she’s dated in the past. Especially now that I’m her husband.",
