  "description": "*****Recommended for 18+*****  Anna Brookes also known by her Professional name 15, did what she had never done before. She didn’t kill her target, HiT 149. HiT 149 better known as Ben Pearson did something he had never done before. He fell in love with Anna Brookes. In Hit for Freedom, the sequel to HiT 149, a nemesis so powerful, terrifying and frightening is threatening the safety of Anna’s love, Ben and his hometown, St Cloud. 15 must deal with a force that may be too dangerous even for her skilled ways. With limited information on her new HiT, she willingly infiltrates his trust to acquire the knowledge she needs to implode the operations of the deadly man.  “What you saw earlier must be playing around in your head. But you didn’t scream or freak out which tells me you are either very strong or very broken. Either way, the information I give you from here on in, you must understand that I will kill you if you choose to repeat it to anyone.” I’ll let him believe that. ~ Anna Brookes",
