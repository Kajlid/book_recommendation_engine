  "description": "The entire Gabrini clan comes together in this explosive new interracial romance about love, and lost, and family.Reno Gabrini is the ultimate family man. Although he works harder than he should, and often finds it difficult to spend the kind of quality time he deeply wants to spend with his family, whenever they need him, he is always there. That’s why, when Tommy and Grace need a break after Grace suffers a traumatic event in Seattle, Reno urges them to come to Vegas and be with the family. Sal Luca also comes along for the ride, to the delight (and anguish) of Gemma Jones, and Jimmy begins to come into his own as Reno’s right hand man.But Reno’s love of family is put to the test in a dramatic way when the ghosts of his past attempts to spook him again. And the love affair he has with his wife becomes the only source of strength he has, until that, too, gets tested.The seventh installment of the Mob Boss series finds Reno and Trina, Tommy and Grace, and Sal and Jimmy Mack celebrating life and family, even as the past seeks to undermine their joy.",
