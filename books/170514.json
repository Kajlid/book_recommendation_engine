  "description": "Part one of Beach Billionaire Con, a three-part series from author Jill Lang.  She was sent to con him; instead, she stole his heart.  Tessa Schilling has a penchant for making poor choices and suffering the consequences… and she’s about to do it again. Down on her luck and in debt, she agrees to take a dubious job, traveling to the Caribbean to hack a rich man’s computer, but she never anticipated finding the man attractive—sexy, actually.  Having lost his wife two years earlier to breast cancer, Benjamin Kent is accustomed to loneliness and jealousy, being attracted to his younger brother’s wife, Patty. After meeting Tessa, who he believes to be a woman named Haven, he finds her striking, yet sparks don’t fly immediately, until he kisses her … then all bets are off. The contact kindles something dormant and buried, along with the yearning to make this woman his.  He should be careful, though, because Haven is not what she seems…  To be continued in Beach Billionaire Con 2",
