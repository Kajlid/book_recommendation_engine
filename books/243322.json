  "description": "The world has been cursed by the gods, or so argue the priests and loremasters, with the alchemists adding their own tedious opinions from time to time. Curse or happenstance, the word has become a hard place—a second dark age, some say. Wright doesn't particularly care. She's a knight, sworn to serve—and her latest duty is to retrieve a captured spy, pay the ransom, and return.But the simple errand leads to a mission far more difficult: retrieval of a legendary counteragent that could destroy the curse once and for all. Wright's duty is to retrieve it all costs, no matter who stands in her way—even if that someone is a useless drunk of a knight she doesn't hate as much as she should.Words: 43,200",
