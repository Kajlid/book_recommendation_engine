  "description": "Joshua Dawson is my best friend's ex-boyfriend. That alone should be reason enough for me to keep my distance. Add in that he's a well mannered, loyal, hardworking artist and I should be running in the other direction.  He's damn near perfect, and I prefer my men hard to love and easy to leave. Josh's only flaw is he wants forever, and for the first time I might want the same. But loving someone doesnâ€™t mean you deserve them.  He's all I want and everything I can't have.  This is a full length standalone friends to lovers romance.",
