  "description": "A must read Romantic Comedy.  Being called the worst boyfriend can do a number on a man’s ego. But I handled it the way any full-grown adult male would—by eating copious amounts of carbs and wallowing over whether I was good enough. I admit, it wasn’t the best of moments, but it made me realize I needed answers to the question, what are women looking for inside and out of the bedroom? After I researched the subject, I compiled my data into a solution.  Thirty days. Thirty right moves.  But I needed to test out my newfound theories, and my best friend, Tenley, was going to help. It was a foolproof plan. We would date and act like a real couple, all in the name of research. And when the thirty days were up, we would go back to being just friends. Piece of cake, right? Only, I forgot to take into consideration the multiple outcomes. Specifically, the one where it left me wanting more and refusing to go back to what we were... ever again.",
