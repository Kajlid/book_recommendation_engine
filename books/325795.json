All her Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency needs now is enough business to pay the rent and put some serious sweets on the table.No sooner does Savannah complete her first case--finding the long-lost sister of a local real estate broker--than murder enters the picture. Framed in a diabolically clever double-cross, she sets out to find the real culprit...only to discover that she's the prime suspect among the lovers, losers and liars lurking in the shadows of the victim's past. Each of them has a motive. Not one of them has an alibi. Now Savannah must call upon all her resources to sort out the baffling clues, clear her own name, and corner a killer whose appetite for murder is growing every day...In Bitter Sweets, G. A. McKevett serves up a mystery where the suspense is sweet and everyone gets their just desserts. And in Savannah Reid, she give us an earthy, exuberant sleuth to believe in, root for and care about.\"Delightful.\" -- John Westerman, author of The Honor Farm",
