  "description": "As she lies alone and injured in the wilderness, twenty year old Skylar believes her life is coming to an end, but in reality a whole new life for her is about to begin. She awakens in a strange place, having been nursed back to health by two strangers whose enormous size, exotic technology, and odd habits indicate that they are not of this world.  After a thorough, embarrassing examination, Skylar is informed that her rescuers have found extensive manuals on caring for human females—manuals that sound suspiciously similar to her favorite erotic fiction. She is told that from now on she will to refer to them as “Daddy” and “Papa” and that she will be expected to behave well and follow their instructions.  Skylar soon discovers that disobedience will result in a bright-red bare bottom and that a sound spanking is not the only way to punish a naughty girl. When she is good, though, her handsome guardians can pleasure her in ways which never before entered her wildest fantasies. Will she remain defiant and continue plotting her escape or can she learn to embrace a life far happier than anything she has known before?  Publisher’s Note: Skylar’s Guardians is an erotic novel that includes spankings, anal play, sexual scenes, exhibitionism, elements of age play and medical play, and more. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.",
