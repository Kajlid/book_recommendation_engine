  "description": "EXPLICIT CONTENT (SEX, VIOLENCE, DRUGS, PROFANITY) Volumes 3 & 4 of The Paradox Chronicles printed as one book! In the land of Eden, twin Divine order gods Mordecio and Astothan train to become Angels of Death for the gods themselves. Things go tragically wrong during their internship, and their lives take an unexpected turn. Even the gods bend to a will. That will is Paradox, and Its machinations are ultimately Its own, for Paradox has plans for Its realms, and Mordecio and Astothan will find out, to their horror, just what they are. Relationships between order gods and chaos gods are forbidden, for the offspring of such a union is prophesied to usher in the apocalypse, but when Mordecio and Astothan fall in love with Eliara and Lavidia, twin chaos gods and daughters of the King, they can’t resist the call of the void. At once heart-rending, bawdy, illuminating, and mysterious, Gori Suture reveals just how like us our deities really are, and how terrifying that truly is. Expand the mind, expand the soul! The Paradox Chronicles are a series of metaphysical allegories that use extreme imagery and scenarios to jolt the psyche as a catalyst for spiritual growth, employing imagination and emotion to stimulate a state of neural plasticity in the brain, empowering the reader to expand the mind, inducing higher dimensional thinking, utilizing ‘as below, so above’ to catalyze microcosmic causality, and ultimately, altering the mind of God. Shatter Kinder is about overcoming the rule of the super ego to pursue one’s true self.",
