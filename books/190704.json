Sometimes you have to break the thing you love in order to put the pieces back together again.  \"Life is all about choices. Do I want pizza or a hamburger for dinner?

Now my ex is back in my life. He's still angry and...he's my new boss.\"  Pretty Broken Girl is the passionate retelling of a marriage gone wrong.  From the boardroom to the bedroom, Dakota Atwell and Samuel Seaforth are locked in a battle of wits and desire. One of them will break. One of them will pay. Both of them want to win.
