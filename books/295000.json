  "description": "Allow yourself to be enchanted by these delightful Regency Christmas romances.  A woman seeking a killer infiltrates the war department only to find herself matched with an irresistible spymaster. A shopkeeper soon discovers that kissing the man she’s determined to hate is so much better than being his enemy. A rake with no interest in wallflowers or bluestockings is enchanted when he finds both in the form of one woman. A duke determined to woo a beautiful widow and make her his own. Only she has no interest in marrying again. A rogue and a lady give in to their passion. Now everything they hold dear is in jeopardy—most of all their hearts. A lady is neglected by her betrothed. Until he sees her at a ball and must ask why he's been trying to avoid her. A duke with an icy heart finds himself falling for the one woman he was never supposed to love...his wife. A countess, now a stranger to her husband after a riding accident makes him forget her, fights to reclaim his love.  For the first time, you can get these eight previously published books in one must-read bundle.",
