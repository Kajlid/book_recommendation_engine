  "description": "Artist Tim Stevenson has been creating still life, porttrait and landscape paintings for over 40 years. In the tradition of the Old Masters, his watercolors have a profound effect on the viewer, often evoking surprise and astonishment; 'you can do THAT with watercolor?' Precision drawing skills and an intense understanding of color resonate for novices, practicing and professional artists, and art admirers alike. Alabama born Stevenson is a self-taught artist who got his start at age three by drawing pictures for cookies. His practice and discipline, one who's pure desire to paint leads, not drives him in each project, has followed him through careers as a sign painter, billboard painter and art instructor. He now runs his own school in hometown Florence, Alabama. He finishes a new painting roughly every two weeks.In this stunning collection of 75 images and over five years notes and reflections on what it means to be an artist and a creator, Stevenson has produced a treasure of inspiring wisdom for any artist, writer, maker. You will be moved, motivated and awakened.Purchase a copy of this ebook",
