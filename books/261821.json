  "description": "A dashing highwayman lying low from the Bow Street runners and a dowager's companion join in a Gothic adventure with vampires and time travel.Young Sophie de Courcy, living as companion to an elderly countess in an isolated mansion on the mountains in North Wales, dreams of romance and adventure.Their unpleasant neighbour Kenrick, with his wild talk of the legends of Transylvannia and of what the Countess calls his 'Mischievous Experiments' with time travel, hardly counts.When Sophie's long term hero, the rascally Émile Dubois, comes with his confidential manservant on a suspiciously hasty visit to his aunt the countess, Kenrick's machinations draw him, and Sophie too, into a world of man vampires and time warps.Obviously there can be nothing in the gossip that Émile is also the notorious highwayman Monsieur Gilles, or that Georges is his companion in crime.It is lucky for Sophie that she has a staunch ally in her lady's maid Agnes, who combines common sense with a talent for Tarot reading.Winner of the coveted BRAG medallion for outstanding self-published fiction, this over-the-top Gothic adventure is full of dark humour, romance and derring-do and an affectionate spoof on the themes of classical Gothic.",
