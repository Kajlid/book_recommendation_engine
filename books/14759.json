Flight of the Hilsa explores and demystifies the same while tracing the story of Avantika Sengupta. As a creative soul—restless and opinionated—life to her has been unkind, even in her chosen career, painting. A chanced encounter with a boat owner; some twenty years her senior, changes everything. With a new found 'success mantra' and the 'boat guy' by her side, she starts striding towards her long-cherished notion of happiness—of being a rich and famous painter. But will the Hilsa discover her true calling and happiness? A gripping tale till the end.",
