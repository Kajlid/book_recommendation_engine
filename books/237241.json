  "description": "Perfection is the last place on earth. Everything else was destroyed long before I was born but I don't know how. Don't ask questions. That's what they've always taught me. Don't ask questions and keep the law. Or what? I never knew the answer to that until someone kidnapped me and showed me what was really behind the walls of Perfection. Now I'm breaking the law every day, I can't trust anyone, and I'm learning exactly what it takes to make a place so Perfect. But around here, too much knowledge will lead to your death.",
