  "description": "As I awaken to this new night, I have no idea what Theoden has planned for me. I know there are more lessons he wants to teach me… I just don’t know how painful… or how pleasurable they will be. I do know that I’ve given into Theoden in ways that I’d never thought I would. Not only that, but he’s made me feel… pleasure unlike anything I’d ever experienced. I want to resist him, I need to resist him, but I’m finding it nearly impossible to resist him. His hold over me is stronger than my will to fight him and with each passing day, I know that I’m losing this battle. On top of personal experiences, I’m discovering secrets the human world never knew. I’m beginning to understand why the humans lost the war and how insignificant my rebellion actually was. This realization has been the cruelest lesson of all. Warning: This novelette series contains hardcore sexual situations between men, not meant for sensitive eyes.
