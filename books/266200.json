  "description": "Aimee Han likes her life as spicy as the Korean-influenced food she makes, and when she and her best friend Callie escape from Callie’s father and the oppressive Den he controls, Aimee believes her life may finally be heating up. At last she can follow her dreams of opening a restaurant. And with Callie off with her new mate, Aimee’s got the gorgeous grizzly she’s fallen for (and his gourmet kitchen) all to herself. Dominick is as tasty as the feasts she loves to make, and he seems to find her irresistible.  At least she does until the suffering caused by their fight with the Den makes him wild. The post-fight Dom is in constant pain and pulling away from Aimee as if afraid he might break her.  Can Aimee convince Dom that she’s stronger than she looks in time to prevent his bear side from overwhelming the man she loves?",
