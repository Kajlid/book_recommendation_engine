  "description": "Zena (short for Zenobia) Lawson honors all things African--art, culture, history. So when fortune hands her a twenty-year-old Nigerian girl in need of temporary housing, Zena and her husband, Lucius, jump at the chance to help. To Zena, Ifa Olongo is an exotic beauty with enough haughtiness and grace for three royal families. Not to mention the daughter she never had. But as Zena's best friend, Vy, keeps reminding her, Ifa is no girl. Crackling with wit, intelligence, and hard-earned wisdom, Do Unto Others turns political correctness and Afrocentricity upside down, reminding us that there is only one golden rule.",
