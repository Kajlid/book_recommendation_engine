  "title": "Mrs. Hemingway",
  "description": "[Read by Kate Reading]Told in four parts and populated with members of the fabled ''Lost Generation'' - - including Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott Fitzgerald - - '' Mrs. Hemingway '' interweaves the love letters, diaries, and telegrams of four very different women into one spellbinding tale. '' The Paris Wife '' was only the beginning of the story . . . Paula McLain's New York Times bestselling novel piqued readers' interest about Ernest Hemingway's romantic life. But Hadley was only one of four women married, in turn, to the legendary writer. Just as T. C. Boyle's bestseller '' The Women '' completed the picture begun by Nancy Horan's '' Loving Frank '', Naomi Wood's '' Mrs. Hemingway '' tells the story of how it was to love, and be loved by, the most famous and dashing writer of his generation. As each wife struggles with his mistress for Ernest's heart, and a place in his bed, each marriage slips from tenderness to treachery. Each Mrs. Hemingway thought it would last forever. Each one was wrong.",
