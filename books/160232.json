  "title": "Zululand Snow",
  "description": "While Zululand reels under the blows of a lunatic’s hammer, half-hearted schoolboy Craig's imagination ignites when he links an Anglo-Zulu War letter his grandfather bequeathed him, to his History teacher's mesmerising tale of the lost inKatha, ‘The Soul of the Zulu Nation’.However, in his feverish quest to find the relic he unwittingly sets in motion a chain of events which disturbs the dark equilibrium of forces in his hometown; forces both past and present, and steeped in malice. As chance encounters with his History teacher become alarmingly more frequent, events explode when the boys clash with caddies from the local golf-course, the malevolent greenkeeper makes a sinister threat and the finger of suspicion drifts towards a friend’s father when the lunatic’s hammer falls once again.Set in a small town in Zululand during the turbulent summer of 1983, Zululand Snow is the tale of a boy searching for a way to bring a glorious past back to life. It’s a tale of history and imagination, of folklore and legend, and the gravitational pull they exert on the marrow in a boy’s bones.",
