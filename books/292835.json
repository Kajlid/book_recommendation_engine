Until rumors started flying about the bad boy prodigy kicked off his team. I thought he was nothing but another cocky playboy, but there was another side to him under the facade. Late training sessions, secret getaways, and a delicious sleeve of tattoos led to temptation. We kept our relationship private, but I wasn’t the only secret he was keeping. And it’s only a matter of time before the truth comes out.",
