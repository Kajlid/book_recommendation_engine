  "description": "San Diego private investigator Jason Duffy is hired by a group of concert promoters after a serial killer leaves a note near a 17-year-old girl who was beaten and drowned in a toilet during one of their shows. The note informs the police that she is his fourth victim and suggests that he’ll continue to kill until he shuts down the concert industry because he believes that “concerts are evil.”Jason meets with the detectives heading the investigations in four major California cities, but is quickly stymied by a bureaucratic state task force leader with selfish priorities. Before being shut out, Jason learns that the killer not only changed cities for each attack, but also his method of murder and physical appearance. As a former club musician, Jason is forced to work the case from a unique angle. Aided by the concert promoters and an SDPD detective, he narrows the killer’s options. But a story in the San Diego free press brings Jason into the killer’s sights and puts at risk everyone he holds near and dear.The author of 2010 Mystery/Thriller of the Year Rock & Roll Rip-Off once again adds LOL humor in between compelling action scenes. Besides offering readers a backstage pass to the music industry, The Concert Killer brings to light a potentially catastrophic danger that few have ever considered.Click on Amazon’s “Look Inside” feature to read the opening to this rock fiction murder mystery.",
