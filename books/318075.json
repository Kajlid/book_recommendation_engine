  "description": "When Robert crossed the bridge, he wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary. He was on the way to meet his girlfriend, but when he reached the other side, she didn’t know who he was. Robert finds himself thrown back in time, further and further, reliving the history of Amsterdam through war, riots and the plague. Each time, his fate is bound up with the same woman, and with the work of the Netherlands' greatest painter, Rembrandt. Robert is caught in a race against time. Will he make it back to his normal life? Or will he be trapped in the past with his discovery as his insulin runs out?",
