  "description": "They thought finding each other would heal them both, but life in Saint Lakes doesn’t make it that simple. Sage Rickman was in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least that’s what he think when the vampires kidnap him. Working through the mental anguish of all the vampires did to him is difficult to get through to say the very least. Peace of mind is an elusive creature though. He thought finding his mate would make things better, but trust doesn’t come easy. Garridan Arach can’t remember anything about his past. He’s been in his dragon form far too long for a normal shifter to take. Being feral is the least of his worries though, especially when his memory starts coming back. Not that he cares about his past. All he wants is his mate. A mate that keeps rejecting him every time they’re together. His past has a way of catching up with him, and he discovers things that will make life in Saint Lakes less than peaceful.",
