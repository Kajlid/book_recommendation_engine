Produced in collaboration with MOJO magazine--U.K.'s leading rock monthly--the book is organized alphabetically and covers more than 1,000 bands. This massive labor of love has it all-from Abba to ZZ Top, B. B. King to Queen, James Brown to Pink Floyd, Radiohead to Television. In short it contains everything you need to know about everyone you need to know about. Each band entry features complete discographies that detail every record released, full track listings for each album, B-sides for each single, expanded biographies and band histories, catalogue ordering numbers, top U.S. and U.K. chart positions, and recommendations of must-have recordings and essential listening.",
