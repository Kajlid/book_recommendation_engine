  "description": "The Ara Pacis of Augustus, the Augustan Alter of Peace, was restored in 1938 to celebrate the bi-millennial birthday of Augustus and is now being refurbished by the American architect, Richard Meier. It is the most-revered ancient Roman monument. However, this book shows that it is not the altar that everyone thinks it is, but rather a commemorative altar erected under the reign of Tiberius.",
