  "description": "Jaxey's Master Reese Gabriel \"Book 4 in the More Than Male series.\" Jaxey is only the second female ever to attend the elite Guardian Training Academy. She is smart and strong and beautiful and designed to hold her own against any primale. Her only weakness is Korlon, her gorgeous classmate. The two are irresistibly attracted, despite Korlon's engagement to the obedient Desela. When a training mission puts Korlon and Jaxey into deep space alone, all bets are off, especially when Jaxey discovers it's not just sex-making she desires, but complete submission to Korlon as her lord and Master.",
