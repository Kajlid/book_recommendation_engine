As creator and lady-boss behind the top beauty blog on the internet, she gets to travel the world trying out new spas and is even on the verge of having her journalistic dreams come true.

Can they manage to get past everything that night from all those years ago and the painful feelings that still linger, or is the damage done forever?",
