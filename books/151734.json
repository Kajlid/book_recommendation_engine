  "description": "Publishers Weekly Select: MYSTERY/THRILLER top ten, September 29th, 2014\"THE BROTHERS CRO-MAGNON is a thrilling ride into a world few authors dare to go. Roger Pepper writes so vividly, you can almost feel the arctic chill sinking into your bones.\"-- Tess Gerritsen, NYT bestselling author of DIE AGAIN Man, the most dangerous animal ever to roam the earth, destroys Siberia's Pleistocene Park. Soviet scientists found human sperm on the skirt of a Neanderthal woman recovered from the permafrost. Sperm rapidly cooled to subzero temperatures in the sterile environment of pure ice, as well preserved as it would be in a modern sperm bank. When New York reporter Corky Mason returns to her Siberian homeland to visit a Russian paleontologist, she plans to cover a story about mammoths but unearths the frightening account of a prehistoric rape that casts a shadow over her. She learns that she might be the sister of four Cro-Magnon brothers born from the prehistoric sperm, brothers who murder people that threaten their freedom. They unleash the mammoths from the park and start a war with Russia's secret police. On the run from the FSB, fighting Siberia's turbulent elements at a time of global warming, starving polar bears and a 'brother' who thinks he's a caveman, Corky fights for her life.",
