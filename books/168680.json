  "description": "His hair was dark, long, and straight. His eyes were as blue as the deepest part of the ocean, very similar to my own. The band’s bassist looked like a walking orgasm. His eyes were on me, captivating me…devouring me. Donovan Milano could have any girl he wants, but he singles me out from his spot on the stage. The talented bassist heats my body in ways that I’ve never know before now. With just one look, I find myself captured in his web of erotic desires. When my health takes a turn for the worse, will he stay by my side, or pack his things to go on to the next stop in his road to stardom? 50% of the proceeds from Fully Loaded will be donated to the charity, Star Treatments.",
