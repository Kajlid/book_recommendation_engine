  "description": "Carly Macalister intended to live the perfect life in the ideal world. When her husband, Paul, leaves his job to become an artist (with no talent whatsoever, but he loves the idea of it!), she still has Patrice, the young and lovely nanny who keeps everything and everyone together; and childhood friend Alex, who never stopped loving Carly and shares with her a tragedy long past but never resolved. A few days before Christmas, Paul and Patrice disappear, leaving Carly with financial problems that must be resolved, a bruised ego that must be healed, and a desperate need to be strong for her children. In Tracy Davis’s novel My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss Her, the author creates a funny, poignant, and sometimes heartbreaking story of one woman’s struggle to survive. From the first frantic scene to the surprise ending, readers will be carried along by this wonderfully compelling page turner.",
