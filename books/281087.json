  "description": "Beauty is skin deep, and apparently, so were my alien powers.They say sometimes you have to shed your skin to become who you’re meant to be. I thought that metaphor was pretty lame until it happened to me. Literally.After the only boy I’ve ever loved betrayed me, all I wanted was to leave and start over, but when a freak lightning strike leaves my human body in ashes, that saying takes on a whole new meaning.Turns out the person I was doesn’t exist. She never did.My entire life has been a lie, and when I’m kidnapped and forced to attend a hidden school for people like me, the reality of how much I don’t know slaps me in the face.Now, I’m faced with two choices: prove my worth as an elite spy or become government property for the rest of my life.Oh, and did I mention my only hope is an infuriatingly hot snob who’s dating my mortal enemy?When Lightning Strikes is the first full length novel in the hotly anticipated Alien Academy series. With a jaw-dropping academy for alien teens, plus a little flirting on the side, this unique young adult story is your next new obsession.Pre-order Alien Academy now!",
