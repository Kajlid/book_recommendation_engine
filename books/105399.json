  "title": "Midsummer Night",
  "description": "It’s a flashback to when Lady Julia married Nicholas Brisbane, her partner in detection. We had just a peek at their wedding at the end of SILENT ON THE MOOR, but this tale has all the details of the big day — who was invited, who crashed the party, and who tried to burn down Bellmont Abbey...With all the usual madness of the Marches, MIDSUMMER NIGHT is a particular treat for readers who can’t get enough of Julia’s eccentric clan. And for readers who are especially fond of Nicholas, there’s a river scene you won’t want to miss.",
