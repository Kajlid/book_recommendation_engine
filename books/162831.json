  "description": "As the web of lies dissolves and the truth nears the surface, the fate of Clifton Manor hangs in the balance, pulled between a glorious past and an uncertain future…Elizabeth’s investigation into the machinations of her sister, Lady Jane, is cut short when a letter arrives from George, the brother she thought she lost aboard the Titanic. Anna in particular is affected by this news, but with her and James's relationship only just blossoming, can she set aside her feelings and exchange a forbidden tryst for a love that fits her station?Meanwhile, George uses his anonymity in New York to his advantage in pursuing the elusive development company whose name he’s seen all over his family’s records. What are their plans for the Clifton estate, and if they are sinister, does George maintain enough power in the New World to thwart them?Among all those who are not what they appear to be, a little boy arrives on Clifton Manor’s stoop with a message which will undoubtedly change the lives of the staff—and perhaps the family itself—forever.",
