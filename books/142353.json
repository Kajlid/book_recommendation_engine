  "description": "Robert York returned from the 1988 Seoul Olympics a silver medalist in Greco-Roman wrestling and as a hero in everyone’s eyes but his own. His failure, he swears, was due to his opponent using illegal steroids, something he soon took up himself to keep from ever losing again. But when he’s caught cheating the US Olympic Committee gives him the option of quietly retiring, as much for him to save face as for them. He agrees and stays as close to his sport as possible by taking the coaching position at Thomas Jefferson High School in Palisades, Washington State. His team becomes an immediate success, but with a secret. The State championships rack up and the TJ wrestling reputation quickly becomes legend.Alex King, the best of the best on a team full of champions, does everything his coach asks for. He trains hard, he obeys, and most of all, he wins. But after he loses his brother to a drug-induced early death and loses the full-ride scholarship his coach promised would be his--due to a failed drug test--Alex's star fades and he ends up in a life of hard labor instead of under the lights of an NCAA wrestling mat.After years of hate boils over inside of him, Alex decides to rally the rest of his teammates--those still alive--to exact revenge on Coach York.",
