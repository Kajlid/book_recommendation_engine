  "description": "Guess Who's Coming Home: Black Fighting Men Recorded Live in Vietnam is the first recorded history of black soldiers in any war. For two years, Wallace Terry traveled the length and breadth of Vietnam from 1967 to 1969 interviewing black soldiers-- infantry as well as officers--for Time magazine and for this recording. He found his story everywhere, from the battlefields of Hamburger Hill and the Ashau Valley to the black-only hootches in Da Nang. The Bloods rap about the issues of the day--racism in the military and back home in the \"World\", Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, the Black Panthers, and Ho Chi Minh. In this recording, you will discover a war within a war, a double battleground between blacks and whites. The humor, intensity and anguish as the Bloods rap in Guess Who's Coming Home will make you laugh, it may make you angry, and it may make you cry as you share their world at war.",
