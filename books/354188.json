  "description": "Let me introduce you to Signora Psyche Zenobia. An adopted name of course, but for someone so flamboyant, appropriate.The good signora has aspirations. She would like to be a writer. At present she is the corresponding secretary to an interesting group of notables in Philadelphia which goes by a lengthy name with the initials of P.R.E.T.T.Y. B.L.U.E. B.A.T.C.H.!But how to get published? She travels to Edinburgh to meet with the esteemed proprietor and editor of 'Blackwood Magazine.' A real publication of the 1830s. He proceeds to tell her about the kinds of articles that catch the attention of readers in Blackwood's. Another humorous Poe short story. But is there more to it then that?",
