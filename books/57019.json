  "title": "The Intercessor",
  "description": "Since the death of her brother on 9/11, CIA anti-terrorism analyst Dani Gordon became obsessed with waging the world wide war on terrorism; often working over eighty hours a week in a personal vendetta to defeat the rising tide of fanatical Islam. However, the Lord has other plans for the closet Christian that would take her to new spiritual heights as she meets Tyler Perkins, the Intercessor, at a Christian retreat called Pentecost in the mountains of North Carolina. Tyler is a Nazarite, taking ascetic vows of devotion to the Lord for heightened spiritual sensitivity. In exchange for his faith and obedience, the Lord gives Tyler revelations on how to defeat the enemies of the United States. While at Pentecost, Tyler teaches Dani that, “…our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”The practical application of Christian spiritual warfare and high tech weapons of the CIA prove to be effective weapons to combat the rising power of evil in the world… until Pentecost itself becomes the next target.",
