  "description": "Come with me! There are all kinds of remarkable things to discover from A to Z. We'll drift into delightful dreams, find flying fairies among flowers, meet mean and marvelous monsters, and snooze in secret shelters. We might even see a winter wren in the whistling wind. Then when we're done, let's start all over again!Gyo Fujikawa's beautiful illustrations captivate young and old alike and add to the fun of reading this lively book. Brimming with adorable animals, busy babies, and carefree children, the charming black-and-white drawings and warm color paintings take us from the big city to the heart of the jungle while introducing the letters of the alphabet.",
