She is the lock around my husband's heart; she is the barrier between me and everything I ever wanted.I have decided to fight. For his heart, for my father, for the Jimmy Choos that rest on my perfectly manicured feet. The problem with a fight is that there is ultimately a loser. And in a situation like this, she has the advantage and a clear head start.But I am here, and she is not. And I have not shared everything. I have some secrets and some advantages of my own. I will fight to the death, if not of my body, than of my heart. And if my heart is destroyed in this battle, I will find a way to survive. Poor planning may not be the final chapter in my story.\n*Do Us Part is a novella, 16,000 words in length, and is the final volume of The Dumont Diaries, a 4-part series.",
