  "description": "Review by James Gormley - \"'Velocity Syndrome' is a cohesive, fast-paced story of a post-diluvian Earth peopled by the products of unfettered genetic experimentation that have enhanced abilities, the main character, Luke Dorsey, who, like The Flash from comic-book lore, can move at speeds above-and-beyond what is normally possible; cyborgs (called Fleshmechs); and Grafters (people who live longer by salvaging replacement organs and body parts.) In this dystopian chaos, there is a committed but insane group of resistance fighters who want to put an end to the Big Brother-like world of control chips, storm troopers and thousands of laws that have enslaved humanity, but their solution is a ghastly one, unless Luke can stop them, although it may be too late for that.\"(Originally published as a novella in the I EAT BUTTERFLIES anthology by Raven c.s. McCracken.)",
