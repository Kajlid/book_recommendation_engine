  "description": "Peridot Lightglimmer was a meadow fairy. She had blue hair and pointed ears. She wore red-striped socks up to the top of her legs and you could always find her with a pad of paper. Peridot Lightglimmer was a dreamer. She dreamed of being a princess, cowgirl, knight and even a clown. But mostly she dreamed of playing on the moon. Peridot learned there were more things than dreaming. Learning how to take care of the meadow, one of the fairies responsibilities. Learning how to fly, for when she got her wings. Spending time with friends and learning new games. Peridot's favorite was learning how to write. She wanted to write all about adventures, places and even playing on the moon. She went to school just like everyone else. It was important for her to learn new skills for when she grew up. In the cool of the night, Peridot would lay on her back looking up at the moon wondering what it would be like to play on it. Would she be able to swing? Touch a star? Look down and see her mom and dad? Would she be able to dance? Jump and lay on a pillow cloud? Peridot Lightglimmer was a dreamer.",
