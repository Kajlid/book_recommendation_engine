  "description": "When Martie Fleming breezed into small town Pontotoc, Mississippi, determined to settle down and teach jazzercise in her home studio, she never expected to land next door to the minister. She never expected her playful golden retriever to steal his shorts right off the clothes line. And she certainly never expected to fall in love. Everybody in town would agree they are so wrong for each other â€“ everybody but Paul Donovan. With her gypsy outfits, her lively music and her irrepressible spirit, Martie is exactly the angel the preacher needs. But can he convince her? Can their love and his career survive the small town gossip and the fireworks Martie creates wherever she goes?The other books in this romantic comedy series are Sleepless Nights (2), Hallie's Destiny (3), Any Thursday (4) and Higher Than Eagles (5).",
