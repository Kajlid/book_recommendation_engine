  "title": "Nobility",
  "description": "One broken man battles a brutal gang of pickpockets on board the Amtrak Crescent with some help from a girl who's no angel--not yet. Hitchcock meets Tarantino in a tale that fuses high drama, suspense and romance. The novel was inspired by an old James Coburn film called Harry In Your Pocket. And Reb's additional research into the light-fingered art will leave readers wondering what's still in their wallets. Or where their wallets are.",
