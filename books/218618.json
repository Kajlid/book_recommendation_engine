  "description": "Mike wanted to be in his brother's band in the worst way, but this plan was ridiculous. Because of the accident, Mike's voice hadn't changed â€“ he had a great set of pipes but he sounded like a girl. He shouldn't have volunteered to sing lead on the demo tape because now the band needed him... to be their new girl singer!",
