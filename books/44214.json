  "description": "Lilah Easton in suburbia? Hostessing a posh dinner party? For Boston journalist Cory Goodwin, it's worth crossing New England in a blizzard to see this. How on earth did a rich science publisher tame the legendary Delilah? And what's the scoop on the conflict supposedly brewing among Bruce Easton's distinguished guests? According to Cory’s editor, it centers on Henry Howrigan, top Harvard biologist and soon-to-be-author. Does the newly widowed Olive Chute hope to lure him away to run Chute Labs? Will rising star Jeff Abels edge him out? Is Jeff sleeping with Bruce’s secretary? Is Bruce sleeping with Henry's editor, Melinda Doerr? Is it just coincidence these same guests were all here last summer when Bruce’s only son drowned in the pond? As the snow deepens, a string of nasty practical jokes spurs the party to break up--but no one can get out. Only one last unwelcome guest gets in: the drunk and uninvited Tony Cyr, whom Melinda divorced and Bruce fired. Most shocked to see Tony is Cory, who met him cold sober on the road two hours ago. When the final prank turns fatal, it's up to Cory--daughter of NY detective Archie Goodwin, and the group's only outsider--to trap the killer.",
