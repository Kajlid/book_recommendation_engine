  "description": "Can Beauty tame her BEAST?\n  Isabella — Grady Williams is a national treasure, the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, America’s scarred superhero. With tattooed arms sculpted from carrying M-16s, this bad boy has girls begging from sea to shining sea to get a piece of his action.  When my father squanders away my college fund, I make a deal with this dirty-talking Devil Dog — I will pretend to be Grady’s girlfriend for the Marine Corps Ball, and my dad will write Grady’s war memoir.  Grady is fearless. Hell, this badass jumped on a grenade to save his fellow Marines! As much as I crave him, I refuse to allow myself to become addicted to a dangerous man who will detonate my heart.  Grady — Isabella Cuesta is an angel who can see beyond my mangled skin, a pawn used to repay her father’s debt, a woman who makes me feel like a man instead of a monster.  But I no longer believe in fairy tales.  She’s mine until our contract ends. I’ll take her hard and rough, listen to all her hopes and fears, lay down my life to protect her.  This beauty will never let herself love a dangerous man like me — a man who has killed, a man who runs towards gunfire, a man who never backs down from a fight.  But without her love, I’m not a man — I’ll remain forever a beast.  Publisher's note: This is a full-length, standalone novel. Happily Ever After. No cliffhanger. No cheating.",
