  "description": "\"Some of the finest examples of contemporary, genuinely American prose. White's style incorporates eloquence without affection, profundity without pomposity, and wit without frivolity or hostility. Like his predecessors Thoreau and Twain, White's creative, humane, and graceful perceptions are an education for the sensibilities.\"  —  Washington Post The classic collection by one of the greatest essayists of our time. Selected by E.B. White himself, the essays in this volume span a lifetime of writing and a body of work without peer.  \"I have chosen the ones that have amused me in the rereading,\" he writes in the Foreword, \"alone with a few that seemed to have the odor of durability clinging to them.\" These essays are incomparable; this is a volume to treasure and savor at one's leisure.",
