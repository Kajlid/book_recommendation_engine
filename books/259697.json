A one-night stands turns into so much more than Tessa bargained for. Luke is Tessa’s opposite in every way, yet still, she finds herself drawn to him. Luke wants commitment, Tessa wants to life in the moment. When fate and Tessa’s best friends start pushing them together, her whole life begins to change, and not in a way that Tessa’s ready for. If it were anyone else, she’d give up and move on to the next guy, but Luke is different. But is he different enough to get her to stay? Find out in the first installment of the Far From… series!",
