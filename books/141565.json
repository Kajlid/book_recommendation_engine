Logen MacDugall must discover who killed three previous lairds if he hopes to survive for long in the position. He believes Coiraâ€™s new sense can help him root out the conspirators, but after her disastrous time in the Highlands, the last thing she wants is to get involved with another laird. Logen must help Coira gain control of her talent in time to save him and their clan from those intent on destroying MacDugall. Can Coira believe this laird truly loves her? Or will her memories lead her to madness again?",
