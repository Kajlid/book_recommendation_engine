  "description": "Neil and Liz measure their lives by the regularity of the seasons, until one year when autumn doesn’t arrive and all weather breaks loose. Neil and Liz Maloney have a secret: Their father is the keeper of the Weatherbox, a magical phone booth that rings four times a year, signaling the changing of the seasons. But this summer when the family gathers to send off the season, the phone doesn’t ring and autumn does not arrive. Instead a mysterious tourist of magic shows up at their doorstep, along with two nonsensical hags and one cat-shaped bog beast. The only one not taken by surprise is their neighbor Mrs. Fitzgerald, who seems to be able to make the elements of weather itself do her bidding. Now it’s up to Neil and Liz to discover the source of Mrs. Fitzgerald’s power and restore order to the climate.",
