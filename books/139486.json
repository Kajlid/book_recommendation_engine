  "description": "Ex-Army Ranger, Brand Killien, has always been good. A good friend, a good soldier, a good everything. .The problem is, good hasn’t gotten him anything but a crushed heart. So after licking his wounds, he decides to move on. And moving on doesn’t include being good anymore. Bad sounds so much better. Jaded and detached, Brand is determined to never open himself up to anyone again. It’s not worth the pain. Instead, he becomes closed, hardened, aloof. But then he’s called back home for a family emergency… a family that he is estranged from. A family that he put out of his mind a long time ago for very good reasons…reasons that involve secrets and pain. Reasons he tried hard to forget. But home is where the heart is, and it just might be where Brand finds his again. Why? Because home is where Nora Greene is. A fiery, red-headed spitfire, Nora is a thing from his past. A beautiful, feisty thing. When Brand left, she was away at boarding school. But she’s back now. And she wants Brand, scars and all.",
