  "description": "Lovers of the USA TODAY Bestselling Crush Series will fall in love with this companion novel featuring beloved character Russ Weston. **(Note: This book CAN be read as a stand alone novel, however it will have spoilers to the previous three books, Crush, Smitten, & Love, that make up the initial Crush series.) **Recommended for ages 18+ for mild mature themes.   Overview: Russ knew true love existed—he’d seen it first hand—he simply didn’t believe it existed for him. And then she walked into his life. Russ didn’t know what had hit him . . . all he knew was that she made him burn.  Blurb: The last thing Russ Weston ever wanted was to be called a hero. A normal guy, out doing the job he was trained to do, he’s nothing special—at least he doesn’t think so. All that changes, though, on the day he rescues renowned psychiatrist, Evelyn McKnight, from drowning. Suddenly thrown in the spotlight, Russ becomes the center of media frenzy and he hates it. One thing he doesn’t hate, however, is the good doctor. Unable to deny the sparks between them, Russ wants Evie in a bad way. Unfortunately for him, Evie seems determined to continue nursing the broken heart she’s been clinging to for years, since the death of her fiancé. Always up for a good challenge, Russ pursues her anyway, steadily chipping away at her walls of resistance. Just when he thinks he finally has her in his grasp, everything falls apart and Russ discovers that love can be messy, messy, messy. Desperately trying to pick up the pieces, Russ realizes sometimes when you love someone you have to set them free—even if doing so may cost him Evie, permanently.",
