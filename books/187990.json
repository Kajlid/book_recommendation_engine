She was quite happy with her life until her father signed a marriage contract for her to marry their neighbor’s nephew, the Earl of Rydover. Determined to ruin this union before it even began, she decided to make herself as unappealing as possible to the Earl. Dressed as a boy, she spied a man swimming in a lake. Thinking it was her betrothed, she approached him and boldly stated that she wanted to see him naked. To her dismay, the stranger was not who she thought, but the man her father was meeting with to transport cotton to England! Michael St. John was a very successful man. He traveled the world for his family’s company convincing people to use them to transport their products all over the globe. He would do whatever it took to get the contracts signed. However, the one contract he vowed to never have his signature on was a marriage contract. He was a confirmed bachelor and planned on keeping it that way. But his bachelor days came to an abrupt end when he was caught in a compromising position with the plantation owner’s daughter. Despite the forced union, will Michael fall for the southern beauty and find himself allowing his heart to belong to The Wild Belle?",
