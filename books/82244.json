  "description": "Raised by her father on the East Coast, Logan Kessler, was as far-removed as she could be from the world of Hollywood where her mother, an A-List actress, made a name for herself. Only gaining snippets of what life in Hollywood was like from the summers she spent with her mom, she didn’t know how much she didn’t want to be a part of that world until her face was splayed across the tabloids linking her to up-and-coming actor, Garrett Lewis, a friend from her childhood who was just that – a friend. But the paparazzi seem to think otherwise. So when she moves to Los Angeles to attend the University of Southern California, Logan just wants to lay low and avoid the celebrity scene as much as she can. But that becomes harder than she thinks when she meets the famous Jason “Jase” Brady at a party. Of course all of her assumptions about one of the most sought-after young actors in Hollywood are shot down when she realizes that Jase is one of the sweetest, most unassuming, adorable guys she’s ever met, and he’s so down to earth. How could she not like him?But in Hollywood, appearances can be deceiving. Jase has secrets in his past that he knows could come back to haunt him at any moment. He can’t leave his house without getting swarmed by women who want a piece of him, and the paparazzi seem to always be lying in wait to capture his every move. Logan soon realizes that dating one of the hottest actors in the world has some major drawbacks, but is she willing to put those aside for the person Jase is on the inside? Can she love someone who comes with a whole world of baggage she never planned to carry?",
