  "description": "I made my choice, and it wasn’t him. But Kingston Farrell won’t take no for an answer, and I’m not sure I want him to.Noah gave me his mark, made me his, and vanished all in the same night. Kingston used that moment to claim me and bind me to him irrevocably. What he couldn’t know was by sealing our bond, he set something in motion none of us can stop.He unlocked my wolf, freed her from her cage, and she wants nothing more than to make up for lost time by starting off with a bang…literally. His mark throws me straight into my first heat. My wolf mate can give me his knot, but I’m insatiable. I need more. I need them all.My Norse demigod.My royal vampire.My fated wolf.My tortured priest.But we can’t afford the distraction. A war is brewing, and there’s no denying I’m at the center of it all. Not when girls who look just like me keep dying.I thought I’d gotten rid of the target on my back, but when I find myself in a demon’s clutches I know it’s not over.Something evil is coming. It’s stalking my dreams. Making me second guess everything. And with each new attack one question looms…What if that evil is me?Warning: This book is not for the faint of heart. It contains an obsessive stalker, a foul-mouthed, inked and pierced werewolf, a naughty professor with a fondness for watching, a god of mischief, and plenty of heat. If you don’t like your books spicy, your men broody, built, and more bad than good, this is not the series for you. But if you do...read on, and welcome to The Mate Games.AUTHORS NOTES: Please refer to authors' website for all tropes, tags, and CWs.",
