  "description": "Everywhere Nick looks lately, he’s faced with people who are demanding too much from him. He has a good, but stressful job as a construction manager, but lately his job site has fallen victim to costly attacks by vandals. When he meets handsome Connor Easton at a fancy party for his boss, the blond detective looks at him like a chicken hawk looks at a baby chicken. Connor soon teaches Nick that he’s not quite the Dom he thought he was. Connor is assigned to the vandalism case, and though Nick is determined to prove how strong he is, old secrets have begun to haunt him again. When Connor learns Nick has been cutting himself, he uses his forceful manner to make him see a psychiatrist and then brings Nick home to stay with him. But while Nick knows he’s a masochist, he rebels against the idea of being Connor’s sub. Connor begins to train him in BDSM anyway, not realizing just how fragile Nick is, and how desperately he needs to keep his secrets.",
