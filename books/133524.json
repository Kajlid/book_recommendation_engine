  "description": "Shadow Island is under siege.Just a few short months ago, Sheriff Rebecca West thought her toughest battles were behind her. But nothing could have prepared her for the turmoil she’s faced since coming to Shadow Island. Attempts on her life. Heartbreak. Betrayal. And that’s just the beginning.The worst is yet to come.Still reeling from the shocking discovery of who’s behind Shadow Island’s exclusive and depraved \"men’s\" club, Rebecca is determined to take them down. There’s only one problem. One by one, the members end up dead. Tongues cut out, hands chopped off—the message is clear...Dead witnesses can’t talk. Now everyone is a potential victim.Is there a traitor in the club’s midst? An accomplice turned executioner? Or is the Yacht Club killing its own members rather than risking the police questioning them?As the desperation of the masterminds behind the Yacht Club increases, so does the body count. In her relentless pursuit of the truth, Rebecca risks unraveling not just the secrets of the Yacht Club, but the very fabric of her own heart.Shadow’s Siege, the tensely climactic fifteenth installment of the Shadow Island Series by Mary Stone and Lori Rhodes, is a chilling reminder that just when you think things can’t get worse, they do.",
