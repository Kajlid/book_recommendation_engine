  "description": "Tank knows that Zachary is his mate. He just doesn't understand why Zachary won't allow himself to be claimed. The waiting is tearing him apart. But with the Elite Force after them and a bounty on their heads, keeping Zachary alive seems more important than claiming him. When the Lady Blue is unexpectedly sucked through a wormhole and crash lands on old Earth, keeping Zachary alive may be harder than Tank originally thought. With the ship needing repairs and the threat of discovery hanging over their heads, Tank tries to keep Zachary safe while keeping him at arm's length. When he learns that Zachary wants to mate him, he just has to perform a sacred ritual of his people first, Tank does everything in his power to get Zachary back to his planet and their own time period. But will it be enough? Or will they be discovered before Tank can claim his mate?",
