  "description": "Two months after what is now known as ‘The Proxy Incident’ has every chimera who was present during Elish’s discipline living in fear. Elish and Jade are taking great joy in personally crafting punishments for the family members that have wronged them, and without Silas to stop the two, they’re free to do whatever they want.  But though Jade has been having fun being involved in Elish’s plans, the more time that goes on, the more Jade realizes there is something wrong with his husband. Elish isn’t acting like his normal self, and not only that, Jade suspects that the new King of Skyfall is hiding something from him.  And far away from Skyfall, Reaver and Killian are both trapped in a distant land, with an unexpected third party. Not only do they have to try and make their way back to civilization in a land of mutated monsters and proxy worms, but Reaver finds himself drawn off of their planned path towards someone unknown: a suspected born immortal who has left them a trail of macabre bread crumbs.",
