  "description": "A cozy, visually rich celebration of Christmas to pore overReaders are off to the North Pole in this brimming holiday treat. On each page, a deceptively simple item--stocking, snowman, reindeer--pulls readers into a nostalgic, exquisitely detailed moment of the yuletide journey: a trip in Santa's sleigh, supper with Mr. and Mrs. Claus, watching the elves hard at work, and finally arriving home in time for Christmas morning.Secret clues, plus hidden allusions to classic Christmas carols, elevate this from a gorgeous book to an interactive holiday treasure hunt--a natural fit for the whole family at Christmastime.",
