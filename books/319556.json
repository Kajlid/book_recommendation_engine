  "description": "It's good to be King... Bane Rivera: my name is well-known and feared in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles. There is only one rule that I live by—only one rule that matters—never let a woman get in the way of business. Ever. Then Wren Montana happened. She barged into my office—into my life—like a beautiful wildfire, demanding something of me I couldn’t ever give her: a pass for her brother’s mistake. From the moment I saw her, I knew I had to have her. To feel her spirit break under my crushing grip as she gave her very soul to me. Until she was dependent on me like a junkie for their next fix. But she wasn't like the other women I'd used and discarded. No, my Wren, my Little Bird, she was strong. Every time she told me no, every time she walked away, it only fanned the flames of my need, consuming me… Causing me to forget my one and only rule.",
