  "description": "On days when your faith is shaken, remember... A seed falls to the ground. A child moves away from home. Can life bloom in a new place? With gentle storytelling and poetic language, Joanna Rowland explores what it means to have hope--hope that things will get better, hope that you are cared for even when things are hard, and hope that new growth is waiting to burst forth, just around the corner.",
