  "title": "The World of Winnie-the-Pooh",
  "description": "In 1926, \"Winnie-the-Pooh,\" a collection of stories about a rather stout, somewhat confused bear, was published in England and America. The enchanting tales of Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Christopher Robin, and the others were an immediate success, and firmly established A.A. Milne, already an acclaimed dramatist, as a major author of children's books. \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" was followed in 1928 by a second collection, \"The House at Pooh Corner,\" which continued the adventures from the Hundred Acre Wood and introduced bouncy, lovable Tigger.This deluxe volume brings all of the Pooh stories together in one full-colour, large-format book. The texts are complete and unabridged, and all of the illustrations, each gloriously recoloured, are included. Here are the beloved stories of Pooh stuck in Rabbit's doorway, of gloomy Eeyore and his nearly forgotten birthday, of playing Poohsticks on the bridge, and so many more.",
