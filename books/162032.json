  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Lucas Duff has absolutely nothing. To the rest of the world, he is the bad boy and a lost cause with a fatal case of apathy. His whole family is dead. His definition of love is closer to lust; his heart was broken and repairing it took too much effort when he knew it would just get smashed like it had previously. Desperate to feel something, he grasps at anything that offers even the slightest hint of reprieve from his boredom. With nowhere else to go, his options are limited, and now hes trapped in Seattles most feared gangSeattles Eyes. Stripped of his humanity, he becomes inextricably entangled in a trap of obligations, blackmail, and violence from which there is seemingly no escape. Hes convinced that things are at an all-time low, and with nothing left to lose, Lucas will bring the gang down once and for all. But whom can he trust?",
