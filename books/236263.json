  "description": "My name is Maddy, and I am Batman. Just kidding. In truth, I'm a computer hacker who tracks down criminals at night and turns them over to the police. The only thing missing is a cape. I work alone, and I like it that way. That is, until my internet sleuthing gets interrupted by a group of hackers that call themselves the Fab Four. Turns out, I'm not the only one hunting down the baddies online, and when we meet... Let's just say, my days of flying solo are over.   This is a contemporary reverse harem suspense series",
