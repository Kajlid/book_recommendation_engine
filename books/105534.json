  "description": "Ray Hogan has over 100 books in print -- Hogan's work has been filmed, televised and translated into sixteen languages.Here are two Western novels crafted with Ray Hogan's signature style: compelling depth of character combined with narrative that is as intensely interesting as it is emotionally involving. In \"Fire River,\" Joel Kane is returning to the Circle K Ranch in New Mexico that he left at fifteen when his mother died. Ten years later he's answering a plea for help from his father. Against all odds and with little hope of help, Joel is determined to fight for his father and his home. \"Guns of Freedom\" is set in Cuba in 1851. Cain Ruby's prime objective is to blow up Montaqa Sangre, the infamous Spanish prison. His second is to locate the daughter of a New Orleans merchant who was visiting Cuba at the time of the Spanish embargo. When he arrives in Cuba, Ruby finds that nothing is what he expected.",
