Some things, once shattered, cannot be made whole again.Still, all it takes is a look from him and I start to melt. When he offers me an even sweeter deal, will I be able to say no?The Dancer is a contemporary billionaire romance from Wall Street Journal Bestseller Vivian Wood. It's full length and the second of three books in the gritty, raw, passionate Broken Slipper Trilogy.",
