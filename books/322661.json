  "title": "Thanksgiving With Dad's Best Friend",
  "description": "I’ve been infatuated with him ever since I heard his name as a child, and as I got older, and sorted through pictures of him and my dad I started to feel…other things.Things I shouldn’t but do.  But all those desires I tried to keep to myself? I don’t need to anymore. Because one look in his hungry eyes and I know he feels the same.  Tate is clearly trouble, and not just with the law.  I thought that a hardened man like Tate would only ever see me as a girl, an off-limits kid due to my age, lacking experience, and of course there is my dad.  But when my dad’s best friend stops by for Thanksgiving dinner he doesn’t just come for a meal. He comes for his prize. Me.  I’m thankful for a lot of things this Thanksgiving day, but none more than my dad’s best friend…my man…my everything.",
