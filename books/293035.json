  "description": "Never cross a trickster when death is on the line...For Loki and Odin, it was supposed to be a typical night out for a couple of Norse gods with the regular drinking, carousing, and contests to see who could eat the most whole roast cows in a row—in other words, the usual. But when a group of Jotnar attack—totally throwing a spear in their plans, Odin is mortally wounded, and only one of Idunn's golden apples can save his life.There’s just one problem...Idunn is missing, and everyone is pointing the finger at Loki (who really resents that he’s always the first god they suspect, even though they usually are right).Between getting his back thrown out (literally, Thor rips out his spine in a tantrum) and Odin sliding closer to death with every second, Loki has his hands full...of knives.It’s a game of triple-crossing a double-cross, which should be child’s play for the trickster god. But with the fate of Asgard and the man he loves hanging in the balance, even Loki’s luck may run out...",
