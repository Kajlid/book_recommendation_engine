  "title": "The Painterly Approach: An Artist's Guide To Seeing, Painting And Expressing",
  "description": "Create paintings with feeling The Painterly Approach bridges the gap between what you see as an artist, and what you feel. More than painting an appealing landscape, it's about making your viewer feel the wind, experience the dance of shadows and sunlight, and admire the wondrous intermingling of colors that attracted you to your subject in the first place. In this gorgeously illustrated book, Bob Rohm shows you how to see the world from a painterly perspective and translate it into expressive, poetic paintings that elicit an emotional response from your viewer.",
