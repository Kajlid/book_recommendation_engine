  "description": "One of the most important works of American supernatural fiction since those of Poe, The King in Yellow was among the first attempts to establish the horror of the nameless and the unimaginable. A treasured source used by almost all the significant writers in the American pulp tradition — H. P. Lovecraft, A. Merritt, Robert E. Howard, and many others — it endures as a work of remarkable power and one of the most chillingly original books in the genre.This collection reprints all the supernatural stories from The King in Yellow , including the grisly \"Yellow Sign,\" the disquieting \"Repairer of Reputations,\" the tender \"Demoiselle d'Ys,\" and others. Robert W. Chambers' finest stories from other sources have also been added, such as the thrilling \"Maker of Moons\" and \"The Messenger.\" In addition, an unusual pleasure awaits those who know Chambers only by his horror three of his finest early biological science-fiction fantasies from In Search of the Unknown appear here as well.",
