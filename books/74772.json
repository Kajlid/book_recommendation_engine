  "description": "What if you woke up one morning and could turn invisible? Would you fight crime? Save the world? If you're like Leopold, you'd rather play tricks on your big sister and steal her caramels! But being invisible isnâ€™t all it's cracked up to be. Leopold can make his body disappear, but not his clothes. How will he pull his pranks with his pajamas showing? Is he brave enough to play his tricks in the nude? Maybe the right magic word is all he needs!",
