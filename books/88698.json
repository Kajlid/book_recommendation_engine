  "description": "Hockey is my life. It’s all I’ve ever wanted, all I’ve ever needed, and everything was going according to plan. All I had to do was focus on the game, keep my head down, then get drafted into the NHL.With my team by my side I was focused solely on the game. I thought nothing could stop me, but then my father came along and ruined everything. He demanded a business marriage for my sister, and I knew I had no choice but to step in and take her place so she could be happy.My only real solace is that I get to pick my bride from a list he has deemed worthy.I just never could have guessed that my sister’s best friend would be on that list. Hallie Rose Sanders has been one of my closest friends for years, and now she is the only reasonable choice I can pick as my future wife.But what do I do when the lines between us begin to blur? When I don’t know where our friendship ends or our marriage starts, and instead of focusing on taking down my father, all I can see is her.",
