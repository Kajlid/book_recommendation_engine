  "title": "American Heiress: The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst",
  "description": "On February 4, 1974, Patty Hearst, a sophomore in college and heiress to the Hearst Family fortune, was kidnapped by a ragtag group of self-styled revolutionaries calling itself the Symbonese Liberation Army. The weird turns that followed in this already sensational take are truly astonishing--the Hearst family tried to secure Patty's release by feeding the people of Oakland and San Francisco for free; bank security cameras captured \"Tania\" wielding a machine gun during a roberry; the LAPD engaged in the largest police shoot-out in American history; the first breaking news event was broadcast live on telelvision stations across the country; and then there was Patty's circuslike trial, filled with theatrical courtroom confrontations and a dramatic last-minute reversal, after which the term \"Stockholm syndrome\" entered the lexicon.Â Ultimately, the saga highlighted a decade in which America seemed to be suffering a collective nervous breakdown.",
