  "description": "The People of Gotham City... and Batman. When Batman pursues a criminal into the Robinson Central railway terminal, six assorted people whose lives rarely intersect with his are present in the crowds. A doughnut seller, an elderly couple, two business people and a former convict all carry on their days barely affected by this, as other events are far more important to them. Joel Mayfield learns that he has a terminal illness, Jennifer Lee meets a charming stranger, and Dionisio Viella decides to return to a life of crime.",
