It is highly recommended you read Shalia’s Diary, Books 1 and 2 before reading this story. Shalia’s Diary Book 3 picks up immediately where Book 2 left off. Told in the passages of her ongoing diary, Shalia Monroe’s adventures continue when she leaves Earth to find and join a clan on Kalquor. However, her heart still breaks for young Clan Dusa, making Shalia wonder if she can indeed find love again. With new friends Candy and Katrina, Shalia vows to never again fall for men she cannot keep. However, Kalquorians are always a willing temptation and Shalia is a magnet for dilemmas. She’s got more trouble than she ever bargained for on board the Kalquorian transport, with surprises and new enemies coming at her from every side. Men who push her boundaries, someone new to worry over, and a universe full of hostile entities are only a few of the challenges Shalia faces as she begins her journey to a new life.",
