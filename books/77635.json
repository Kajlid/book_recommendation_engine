  "description": "Development threatens Abbotsville, but not for long when Miss Julia takes on the cause  When developers threaten to bulldoze the old courthouse to make way for condominiums, Miss Julia is dismayed. She enlists the help of Etta Mae Wiggins in a plot to scare off the money by exposing the town's many eccentric characters. Abbotsville has plenty of local color of the kind not usually listed in brochures for upscale condos: Tonya's sex change, Julia's stint as a biker chick, Brother Vern's evangelistic passion, and a mysterious apparition on a church wall. As if this isn't enough to keep Miss Julia busy, she soon also discovers that several of her friends' husbands have vanished, and her own husband seems to be as scarce as hen's teeth. Marriages, divorces, fraud charges, and reconciliations all play out against a backdrop of Miss Julia's struggle to save Abbotsville's historic courthouse, her marriage, and her sanity. Miss Julia Paints the Town is another rollicking good ride for fans of the winning series.",
