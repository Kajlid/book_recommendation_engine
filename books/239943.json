  "description": "August's got a mouth on her. With that fiery red hair, freckles, and fierce scowl, she orders us around like she owns us. And the rest of the band seems fine with letting her run the show. But not me. She might be our manager, but there's no way she can manage me. She thinks falling for a musician is a mistake. I'm going to be the best mistake she'll ever make.",
