  "description": "A young woman in France finds her heart broken and seeks solace from her sister. Reluctantly seeking help from a monk, who happens to be her uncle, she has an unusual dining experience. He discloses a tale that feels literally like a veil being lifted from her eyes. Involving a prostitute and a priest, this story captivates and entices the young lady. The otherworldly descriptions of grace and the Holy Spirit prove to be her undoing, challenging what she thought she already knew. Her intimacy lost proves to be a doorway to that which often people can only dream.",
