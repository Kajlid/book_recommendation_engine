  "title": "Disciple: A Novel of Mary Magdalene",
  "description": "On the shore of the Sea of Galilee, in first century Palestine, a spirit possessed a woman, Mary of Magdala-a generous and learned woman of business. Mary drew together a community of outcasts, rescued from lives of poverty and humiliation. Longing for children, she brought into her circle a Greek slave girl, Demetria, and adopted her as a daughter. Though she was a devout Jew, it was natural for Mary to show compassion to all those who were looked upon as \"other\"-gentile, prostitute, and leper. Because of the demon that afflicted her, Mary resolved never to wed. Still, three men loved her. Marcus Quintius Severus, quintessential Roman noble, could have any woman he wanted. But not this woman, for he had made a sacred vow never to speak to her of his love. Mummius, gifted Egyptian scribe and magus, served Mary as steward and physician. Jesus, itinerant rabbi, recognizing in Mary the Wisdom of God, liberated her by driving out her demon in a terrible battle. This book is the story of how Mary brings her spiritual power to light as leader and beloved disciple, the one who truly understood Jesus' message and lived it fully.",
