  "description": "Jade Kinsley has spent the majority of her life on the run. But with no family, and no memory of her childhood, Jade has nowhere left to go. That is, until she finds herself in the company of witches.  But sometimes the past doesn't stop looking for you.  After absorbing ancient magic from a spell book, Jade is left with no choice but to accept what fate has in store for her. Edge Aldrige is a mysterious enigma with a shady past. One he tried to put behind him, until Jade appeared, and turned his world upside down. Getting caught up between two covens at war was the last thing he wanted to be involved in.  Between Edge's past, and his connection to those who hunt Jade make him the worst choice for Jade's protection. Or is he? With her life on the line, can Jade trust Edge's promise that he'll do everything in his power to keep her safe?",
