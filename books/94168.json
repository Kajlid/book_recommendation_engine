Her fascination with the snail's strange anatomy and its midnight wanderings kindles an interest that saves her sanity.The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating is an inspiring and intimate story of resilience, and an affirmation of the healing power of nature. It reminds us of how a small part of the natural world can illuminate our existence and deepen our appreciation of what it means to be fully alive.‘This is an entrancing record of spiral love, one which grows from the delicate devotion the author feels for a snail-companion, out into the widest whorls of biophilia.’JAY GRIFFITHS‘Put away the laptop and the phone. Treat yourself to a moment of inner stillnes, courtesy of this remarkable book.’TONI JORDAN",
