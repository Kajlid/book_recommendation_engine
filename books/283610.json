Tamsyn's pretty sure she's being haunted, and not by just any ghost but by Doctor Dreamy's dead uncle. If she can't harness her powers in time to figure out the truth behind his mysterious death, she may never have a moment of peace again.When death strikes the island’s controversial real estate mogul, will Tamsyn’s newly discovered powers be any match for murder?",
