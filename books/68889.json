  "title": "The Pinky Bean Chronicles",
  "description": "A new diary. Nothing is better. All these fresh, clean pages. Inside this diary I will write about fashion, and my friends, and my utterly ordinary life. My only goals for this summer are to have something happen to me, and to get kissed. I know, I know: These are pathetic goals. But this is my diary, with my secrets, so for once I can say what I really mean, without worrying about being judged. I am Pinky Bean, I am fourteen, and this is my diary. If you find it, burn it! xxoo",
