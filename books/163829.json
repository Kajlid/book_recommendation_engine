  "title": "B-Boy Blues: A Seriously Sexy, Fiercely Funny, Black-on-Black Love Story",
  "description": "James Earl Hardy's classic novel celebrates its 25th Anniversary — and, for the first time, is available on eBook! Years before \"homo thug\" and \"down low\" became infamous catchphrases, Omar Little put the \"G\" in Gangsta on HBO's critically acclaimed series The Wire, and Lil Nas X claimed a same gender loving space in pop music ... there was B-BOY BLUES. Revisit or experience for the first time the story that ushered in the Africentric gay fiction genre, and put Black-on-Black male love on both the map and the bestseller lists! Mitchell Crawford always wished, hoped, and dreamed for a RUFFNECK — a hip-hop-lovin', street-struttin', cool posin', crazy crotch-grabbin' brotha. And he finally finds one in Raheim Rivers, who is a vision of six feet tall and 215 pounds of mocha-chocolate muscle. Mitchell knows Raheim will take him for a walk on the wild side, especially between the sheets. But he doesn't count on getting behind Raheim's mask — and finding someone he can love. Praise for B-Boy \"Hardy has successfully crafted the first gay hip hop love story. It sexily sizzles off the page.\" - E. Lynn Harris \"Not since Terry McMillan's Disappearing Acts has it felt so good to be loved so bad. A-.\" - Entertainment Weekly \"Hardy proves that Black love is just as dizzying and gratifying when boy meets boy.\" - Vibe \"A masterpiece of both Black and gay literature.\" - Booklist",
