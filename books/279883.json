  "title": "Bastards",
  "description": "Forgotten. Rejected. A collection of outcasts and failures. The debut work by indie musician and painter Christopher Edge, bastards is an assembly of a year's worth of discarded and seemingly unrelated poems. Unified only by their difference and their status as the \"un-belonging\", bastards portrays not just the frustrations, sadness, growth, and spirit of the author, but captures a subtle portrait of the contemporary American landscape.",
