He still doesn't know who he is, but the blue Police Box outside looks vaguely familiar.Giving private tuition to a dazzlingly gifted ten-year-old named Miranda, the Doctor learns that she and her family have fled the planet Klade. There was a bloody revolution there, in which all the imperial family was slaughtered, with the exception of the infant Miranda. Her nanny brought her to Earth, to save her from the atrocities of the Republicans, but the Imperialists are after her too.",
