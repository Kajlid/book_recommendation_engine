  "description": "The Hero and the Fiend is a twelve-thousand word novelette set in the same world, and featuring some of the same characters, as Glenn G. Thater's Harbinger of Doom series of fantasy novels and novellas. Hero, however, is a stand-alone story that requires no familiarity with his other books to enjoy.Like much of Thater's work, Hero explores the nature of good and evil, and plumbs the depths of heroism and courage. Morzagast, Prince of Nifleheim, an immortal fiend of frightening power rampages across Lomion City on an insatiable quest for blood and souls. Stalwart soldiers, gallant knights, and grayed wizards cannot kill it or contain it. Yet a lone warrior, bound by duty, and girded with courage and cold steel, sacrifices all to bar its path.
