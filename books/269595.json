  "description": "Ellie Agresti's not sure anything could be worse than being dumped by her boyfriend, Hunter, the first day of senior year.But sharing a \"life skills\" class with him and his new girlfriend, Brynn? AND getting partnered with a \"family\" of misfits (A.J., the loudmouth; Isaiah, the horse-racing obsessive; and Luke, the tattooed stunt-biker)?It's a recipe for certain disaster...until an in-class competition allows Ellie to channel her angst into beating Hunter and Brynn's team, and she unexpectedly bonds with her own group–especially Luke–in the process.But as Ellie soon discovers, it will take more than classroom triumphs to heal her broken heart–and find herself again.",
