Letting go of the most important person in my life. Tracy was my first best friend, my first love— my first everything. After a falling out, I left her and our small town behind, never looking back. But when the big city chewed me up and spit me out, I ran home with my tail tucked between my legs. Now that I’m back, I realize just how stupid I was for letting her go.TracySeven years. It’s been seven years since I’ve spoken to Jessie. Seven years since I’ve let myself think about him. To do so would be a fall into a downward spiral that I can’t allow myself to plummet into. Again. I finally have my life on track, running my own business, and taking care of the most important thing— me. That is until he blows back into town like a forbidden gust of wind that takes my breath away and reignites the sparks I’ve tried to smolder for so long.Distance was what I thought I needed to heal from the heartbreak he caused, but now that he’s back, I can’t think straight. Do I listen to my heart and give him another chance, or do I listen to my gut and run like hell to avoid another heartache?All the Right Reasons is a steamy, small town, second chance romance. Grady Romances are all able to be read as standalone books, but you will get more from reading them in order.",
