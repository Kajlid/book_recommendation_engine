  "description": "Stone Rivers is a sin I can’t commit.After years of playing the trophy, puppet, perfectionist,I’ve forgotten who I am.Until the boy from my past walks back into my life.Handsome as sin, charming beyond belief—Stone Rivers is temptation personified.Our combustible chemistry shatters my resolve.His blistering kisses remind me of everything I used to want.But, our present is just as messy as our past,And reckless as it may be, I can’t let him go.My name is Regan Wilde.I’m a mother, a sister, a daughter.But Stone and I?We’re a scandal in the making.",
