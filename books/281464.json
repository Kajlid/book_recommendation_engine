  "description": "Cannabis – a word that stirs a lot of discussion and debate. But when we come to think of it, it is just an herb, a plant that has been used for medicinal, religious, and trading purposes for decades. However, despite its historical merits. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), also known by their taxonomical names Human alphaherpesvirus 1 and Human alphaherpesvirus 2, are two members of the human Herpesviridae family, a set of viruses that produce viral infections in the majority of humans. Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are common and contagious.hen a herpes outbreak occurs, the virus is attacking cell tissues in the mucous membranes, causing pain, blisters and inflammation. This is caused in part by white blood cells rushing to the area to combat the attack. White blood cells are part of our immune system, and if CBD can really interact with our immune system through the ECS, then it could help this process to work more effectively. What’s more, CBD is actually a patented anti-inflammatory in the United States. This means that it could take down the inflammation in the area and lessen any pain caused as a result. A few studies are being carried out into CBD as an anti-viral. While nothing is yet set in stone, some conclusions have been positive. For example, a study in 2010 suggested phytocannabinoids (those found in plants) were able to help in the fight against persistent infections – like herpes.",
