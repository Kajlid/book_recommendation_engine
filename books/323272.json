  "description": "I’m a professional chickenblocker.Except “chicken” is a euphemism.I get paid to follow a womanizing troglodyte who thinks rules are for other people and that my pants are the next pair he’s getting into.Dream on.Bet your first professional job didn’t involve babysitting an extremely hot, muscle-bound Scottish Highlander with an ego the size of a kilt and a libido bigger than his…well…Chicken.Keeping Scottish football (that’s ‘soccer” to us Americans) player Hamish McCormick away from inappropriate scandals while he does product endorsement campaigns is my mission.No problem.Until Hamish decides I’m his next scandal.And maybe more….Shopping for a Highlander is an enemies-to-lovers, slow burn romance that opens with a surprise kiss and ends with a happily ever after. This sports comedy in the New York Times bestselling Shopping for a Billionaire world contains no actual chickens, but it has plenty of locker room scenes, a fake relationship, very real banter, and more. You do not have to have read the previous books in this world, though after you read about Amy and Hamish, you’ll want to. ;)",
