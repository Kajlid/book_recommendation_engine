  "description": "Alternate cover image for ASIN: B00YEZKMJGWarning: Contains sexual content & profanity. Intended for readers aged 18+.  Beauty lies in the truth.  A wife with a thirst for revenge desperately trying to save her marriage while hiding in the shadows of her memories... A woman with questionable intentions, a sketchy past and a taste for unavailable men... A husband in love with his wife, a man mesmerized by his mistress, a willing hostage caught between two obsessive women.  A murderer, a liar and a cheater. You think you know which one is which, but nothing is as it seems. After all, everyone wears a mask. Some are just better at hiding the truth than others.  Lies will be exposed, truths revealed, and blood shed - all in the name of something far more potent than love and much more toxic.",
