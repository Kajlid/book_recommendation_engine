They appeared on 60 Minutes and soon were known as \"superstars in the world of autism,\" shining examples of two people who refused to give up in the face of their mutual challenges.But just when it appeared that their lives would enjoy a fairy-tale ending, their marriage fell apart. The Hollywood feeding frenzy was too much to handle, and they divorced. After years of heartache, soul searching, and personal growth, Jerry and Mary remarried. Today, with their union stronger than ever, they have dedicated themselves to helping countless other people with Asperger's and autism lead lives of dignity.
