  "description": "A must-read for every parent who wants to raise smart, emotionally stable, responsible, stress-proof kids! Stress is rising alarmingly in our children, both at school and at home. Across the world, hearts are racing, faces are pale â€” and most of the time we're unaware that many of our children are chronically stressed. Drawing on cutting-edge research from the Institute of HeartMath, California, as well as Shelley Davidow's extensive experience in working with children and teens, Raising Stress-Proof Kids explores the powerful and potentially long-term effects of stress on our children. Most importantly, it offers simple but effective steps that parents can take to minimise the impact of stress at home and at school. These include tools from the author's 'Restorative Parenting Toolbox', empowering parents with the necessary skills to: resolve behaviour issues; deal with temper tantrums; resolve sibling rivalries; handle bullying; cope with teenagers testing their independence; navigate the challenges posed by the virtual world; and, provide firm, effective guidance when problems arise.",
