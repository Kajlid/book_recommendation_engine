  "title": "The Revelations of August Barton",
  "description": "August Barton thought his tribulations were over, but some truths are hard to swallow. He’s been with Rose Varley for over a year, and has his heart set on taking the next step: a marriage proposal. He’s not prepared, however, for the obstacles that soon find their way into Augie’s life—tornadoes, drunken bachelorette parties, and an earth-shattering confession from his stepdad John are all trials Augie will need to overcome if he’s going to keep the girl. With his Grandma Gertie and mom off at a retreat in the Cayman Islands, the revelation Augie never prepared himself for was that, for once, he was going to have to figure it out all on his own.",
