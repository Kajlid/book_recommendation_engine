  "description": "When time shatters, the survivors must fight their way to the ends of the Earth before it's too late.They call it \"the Event\"--an unimaginable cataclysm that renders 600 million years of the world's timeline into jumbled fragments. Our Earth is gone, instantly replaced by a new one made of fractured remnants of the past, present, and future. All exist alongside one another in a nightmare patchwork of \"time shards\"--some hundreds of miles long, and others no more than a few feet across.With surprising help from throughout history, an American girl and her companions first must save ancient Alexandria, the last bastion of civilization, from a panzer tank invasion. Then they will face the ultimate challenge at the end of the world... the shatterfield.Crossing it sends them on a final quest spanning time, space, and dimensions. Only then will they learn if their mission will save their world--or destroy it.",
