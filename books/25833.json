  "title": "The Babbling Brook Naked Poker Club - Book Seven: A Senior Sleuth Cozy Mystery",
  "description": "Once again, Josephine and Lill are on the lookout for a mystery, but all that presents itself is the plaster dog that has fled Brookside Retirement Community and is now flitting about the world sending postcards to its owner. But then, Josephine remembers the odd Naked Poker story told by one of the more unpleasant residents. That resident has since moved on, but that doesn’t mean the hints she may have murdered her first husband have moved on with her.Josephine and Lill begin to investigate, but soon decide the most likely explanation for the man’s disappearance was that after a night of heavy drinking, he took a wrong turn on the way home and ended up in the Ohio River. They arrange for a couple with sonar equipment to search the part of the river where they suspect the car might be. Instead, a different vehicle is discovered, and it contains a body. They’re not about to walk away without learning more about that body and, most especially, how it got there.",
