She tries drugs--Neo Citran, Ativan, Wellbutrin, crack, crystal meth--and after two hospitalizations, she undergoes electroconvulsive therapy.Haunting and expressive, this immersive memoir explores love in all its facets--needy, obsessive, healthy, self-directed--and plunges the reader headlong into the intense and immediate experience of mental illness.",
