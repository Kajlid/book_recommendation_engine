  "description": "Book Description A rom-com for all lovers of vintage dresses! Product Description It looks, Frankie thought happily to herself, like a proper fabulous frock shop! Francesca Meredith has always had a penchant for vintage dresses. So when she inherits a retro dress shop in the quaint Berkshire village of Kingston Dapple, it's better than winning the lottery. Life is just perfect for Frankie, but it's about to get complicated when she sees a masculine vision setting up shop outside her door - heart-throb florist Dexter Valentine. As Frankie tries her best to make 'Francesca's Fabulous Frocks' into a success, Dexter's philandering proves the ultimate distraction. That is, until the village medium insists that Frankie's shop is haunted and Frankie starts witnessing some very strange shenanigans. Will Dexter think she's crazy? Will Frankie's terribly ordinary life return to normal ever again? Does she even want it to. . .? About the Author Christina Jones has been writing all her life. As well as writing novels, Christina contributes short stories and articles to national magazines and newspapers. She lives with her husband Rob and a houseful of rescued cats.",
