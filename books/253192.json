  "description": "In Kerry Lynne’s exceptional novels “The Pirate Captain, Chronicles of a Legend” and “Nor Gold” Lynne takes the reader into the violent and dangerous seas of the mid-eighteenth-century Caribbean waters. “Treasured Treasures” is the third volume of Captain Nathanael Blackthorne’s saga. Once again, Nathan discovers that Death can be an entirely temporary state. It also changes nothing: both his enemies and his past still pursue him. One might be out-run, but as to the other…? The story is a testimony to Nathan’s lofty goal of protecting what he holds dear: his ship and—treasure of treasures—Cate Mackenzie. In the meantime, Cate wrestles with her own struggles of learning how to live once more—a not so easy task—and living down her own ghosts. One should never, ever count out the tenacity of a pirate captain to see his treasure safe. Nathan’s world is treacherous with deadly consequences, but through trust and humanity, Nathan and Cate seek to celebrate the joy of their victory.“Treasured Treasures, The Pirate Captain Chronicles of a Legend” answers the questions of who is in command of the Ciara Morganse? What awaits the Morganse’s crew off the shores and amid the treacherous waters off Dead Goat Island?",
