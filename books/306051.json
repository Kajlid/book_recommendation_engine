  "description": "An intergalactic war would change a lot of aspects of your life as you know it today. At least it did for Lizzy. Lizzy is a human, but she is not from earth or any other planet you may have heard about. The pressure became a bit too much for her, after her dad almost died, hence she decided to go on a vacation with her best friend, Riley, to earth! But of course, it was not one of her best ideas.",
