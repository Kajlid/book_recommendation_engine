  "description": "A poignant and often humorous tale of betrayal, guilt and reconciliation.................................................................................................................Jack’s a glass half empty man. Maggie’s is always half full. At least it was until that fateful day when he drove his car into a brook. The challenge now seems to be to get him to change his outlook, to try to look forward with hope instead of back with regret. But Jack has time on his hands, time to reminisce, and the doctor’s diagnosis isn’t the only thing troubling him. Will he find solace in his writing? Unburden himself that way? Finally take Maggie into his confidence? Give his brother a second chance? Or will he keep his guilty family secret under lock and key?",
