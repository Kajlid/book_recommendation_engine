  "description": "Queen of Anarchy is the heart-pounding second installment in the Dirty Broken Savages series.Note: The blurb below contains spoilers for the first book, so I'd highly recommend not reading it until you've finished reading book one, Kings of Chaos. You've been warned!***I was a good girl once. But bad b*tches get shit done.My list is finished. Every name has been crossed off. I should be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere, breathing easy for the first time in years.But I’m not.Because that asshole Ivan St. James refused to stay at the bottom of the river where Knox put him.Because someone dragged his body up from the depths and laid it out as a very public, very gruesome warning.Because I swear it was Hannah’s eyes I saw behind that mask.Nothing makes sense anymore, and if I thought I might find some peace in knowing that the men who hurt us are dead, I was wrong.The game isn’t over yet. The original deal I struck with the Kings of Chaos is null and void, and despite my plan to walk away from them when this was all done, there’s no way I can do that now.Our fates are entwined, at least until we sort out this mess.Honestly, I don’t know how to feel about that. Because as much as I refuse to let my walls down for anyone, I’m starting to think these four brutal, dangerous men…Might be the only ones I can trust.Queen of Anarchy is a full length mafia/gang new adult romance featuring a slightly psycho heroine and four even more psychotic men. This book contains dark themes, so please read at your own discretion. It is book 2 of 4.",
