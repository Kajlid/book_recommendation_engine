  "description": "As commander of a Roman garrison in remote Britain, Justin finds a lot of things strange about his new home. Mainly it's the village attitude toward wolves that surprises him; hunting them is forbidden, and he can't understand why. At least Justin can't understand it until he meets Falan, who's the village healer, and a werewolf, to boot. When his commanding officer wants to come to his village for a hunt, Justin puts himself on the line for Falan and his people, and pays the price for his protection. Can he and Falan find a way to save themselves?",
