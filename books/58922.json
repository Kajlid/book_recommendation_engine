His books, blog posts, magazine articles, and speeches have inspired countless entrepreneurs, marketing people, innovators, and managers around the world.   Now, for the first time, Godin has collected the most provocative short pieces from his pioneering blog—ranked #70 by Feedster (out of millions published) in worldwide readership. This book also includes his most popular columns from Fast Company magazine, and several of the short e-books he has written in the last few years. A sample:   • Bon Jovi And The Pirates   • Christmas Card Spam   • Clinging To Your Job Title?   • How Much Would You Pay to Be on Oprah’s Show?   • The Persistence of Really Bad Ideas   • The Seduction of “Good Enough”   • What Happens When It's All on Tape?   • Would You Buy Life Insurance at a Rock Concert?Small is the New Big is a huge bowl of inspiration that you can gobble in one sitting or dip into at any time. As Godin writes in his introduction: “I guarantee that you'll find some ideas that don’t work for you. But I’m certain that you're smart enough to see the stuff you’ve always wanted to do, buried deep inside one of these riffs. And I’m betting that once inspired, you’ll actually make something happen.”",
