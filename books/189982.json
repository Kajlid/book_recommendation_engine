  "description": "In the sentient land of Veridia, Fila dreams of a simple future: using her women’s magic of creation to help the Toiler people of the countryside. But when Veridia loses its Servant, the human conduit linking Veridia and its peoples, it chooses her daughter—Fila—as its new Servant.  Mourning her mother and her lost dreams and doubting her worthiness, Fila sets out for the capital to be invested. On her journey, assassins attack, sent by a usurper with corrupted magic. Fila escapes with the help of two unlikely allies: Celatu, a secretive scholar who has renounced his male magic of destruction, and Shadow, an ancient evil spirit who is eager to help Fila . . . for a price.  When those she trusts most betray her, Fila must draw on her own resources to reach the capital to fight the usurper to attain her destiny as Servant . . . a destiny she doesn’t even want.",
