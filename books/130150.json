After the deaths of several guards a year ago, however, Keegan is afraid he’s going to unravel at the seams. His worry over keeping everyone safe robs him of sleep and any hope of peace.And people are noticing. Members of the guards he is captain of think he needs to get laid, or at least remember how to laugh. Keegan thinks they need to learn that there are boundaries they shouldn’t cross with him.When he learns of a security breach by Marcus’ brother Aidan, exposing a flaw in the safety measures Keegan has set in place, Keegan is desperate to find someone to make sure the electronics at the shifter compound are break-in proof.Marcus and Nathan are worried about Keegan. When they find someone to do the job Keegan needs done, they make sure Keegan is the one to take a short trip to Brazil to pick up the security expert, Olin.But when Olin and Keegan meet, they snap and snarl at each other while fighting the mating bond that keeps flaring between them.Then something happens that makes them both have to depend on each other, and if they’re lucky enough, they might even survive the ordeal.But first they’ll have to escape their would-be captors, and make it through the rainforest, where strange things are bound to happen.",
