  "title": "The Inheritance",
  "description": "Notwithstanding its author credits, this short story collection was written by one person. \"Robin Hobb\" and \"Megan Lindholm\" are both pseudonyms used by California-born Margaret Ogden, who from 1983 to 1992, published exclusively as Lindholm. This generous, 400-page hardcover original brings together short stories and novellas penned under both authorial bylines. As Hobb herself notes, \"their\" writing and styles differ in significant ways. (P.S. This collection includes stories previously unpublished in the United States.)",
