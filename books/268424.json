  "description": "An international political thriller, THE RAINBOW VINTNER, is set largely in Bordeaux, France. Morgan Kenworthy, a Berkeley student studying abroad at the University of Bordeaux and a guest of the de Carduzacs, family friends in the wine business, uncovers a coup against the government of France. Soon after she arrives, bombing at the Brassault aviation plant kills several ministers. The investigation, led by General Tolbert, the deputy head of French intelligence and a friend of Joseph de Carduzac, points to jihadists. However, clues unearthed by Morgan suggest that the two blew up the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in 1985 and committed other nefarious acts while serving President Mitterand. After another explosion, killing most of the cabinet, Tolbert announces that he is in charge. As General Tolbert suspects she knows about the plots, Morgan's life and the life of her lover, Alex, Joseph's stepson, are in danger. Morgan's attempt to leave Europe is thwarted and Alex is captured by the general's thugs. Now the two must rely on their wits, and their friends, for survival until they can convince the French Government who the real criminals are...With the Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan and other events in France and the rise of the far right throughout Europe, the story is very relevant; I wrote the book while living in Bordeaux over the past few years, partly to bring to light the gravity of the situation as well as to explore some of the historical antecedents to what is happening now in France and across Europe.",
