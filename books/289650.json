  "title": "Bound",
  "description": "Father Creighton and Smith Sinclair. Two dangerous men inexplicably drawn to me. One bound by a holy vow, the other by duty and honor.  One emphatically covets my soul. The other, despite his regrets, desires my heart. Each demands I surrender my body to his control.  A priest and a soldier. A demon and a knight. An eternity in darkness, or a lifetime of love and light.  In the end, I have only seconds to decide.   While Bound can be read as a standalone, it is the third book in The Devil's Due series and is best enjoyed after reading Depraved and Delivered. Bound has no cliffhanger.",
