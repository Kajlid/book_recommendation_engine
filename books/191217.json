  "title": "The Button",
  "description": "A button that can destroy the world. The one man that guards it—and the enemy within. One of acclaimed author Nicholas Ponticello's earliest works, The Button originally appeared online in 2006, one of two short stories describing the dark relationship between humans and the world they've created. Nearly a decade later—and for the first time in e-book format—this revised edition offers readers a rare glimpse into Ponticello's psyche in the years preceding the publication of his recent hit novel: Do Not Resuscitate. Available for instant download through Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program, or for purchase in Kindle format on Amazon.com.",
