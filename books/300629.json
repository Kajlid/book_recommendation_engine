  "description": "Malfred Murd is supremely talented but undeniably abrasive. Freshly booted from his 20-year gig as the Royal Jester, Fred is finding it tough to jingle out a living on the street, even with the dubious help of a sassy talking bird.He isn’t thinking of the future when rival buskers chase him into a Tekologically advanced country that, like him, lies squarely in the King’s disfavor. He has no idea that the ruler of this country has made plans to save her people— plans that are rapidly unraveling, missing messenger, ominous omen and all.So when Fred’s flying friend brings him a bag that looks to be full of shinies, his decision to try and wring a little reward money out of the situation doesn’t seem particularly perilous. But surprise! It lands him in the midst of a rescue mission gone horribly, hilariously wrong.",
