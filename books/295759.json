  "description": "As the god of death, Hades has had a complicated past with emotions. As it is, she prefers to not have them. It's an opinion often ignored by her unlikely best friend, Eros, the god of love. Determined to bring her happiness, Eros bends his own rules and shoots Hades with golden arrows that aren't guided by fate. False loves fade until one day Hades finds her gaze lingering on Persephone, the goddess of Spring. Eros takes the shot.  Bound by the arrow, Hades and Persephone are trapped in the Underworld together, determined to ignore each other until the arrow fades. Hades and Persephone war against themselves and the expectations that weigh on them as an unshakable trust grows between them. Persephone isn’t as bright as people believe and Hades isn’t as dark. As they grow to accept each other’s complexities, trust turns to love and they prepare to fight back against fate.",
