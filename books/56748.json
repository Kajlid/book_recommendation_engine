  "description": "Miss Julia Springer, a proper Southern woman, is the principal figure of this Southern comic novel. Recently widowed by the death of her husband, the late Wesley Springer, she is busy with the distribution of his estate when she is visited by Wesley's hitherto unknown mistress and a young boy, Wesley's hitherto unknown bastard. Disappointed in the results of the will, the mistress leaves the boy with Julia, forcing Julia to exercise \"good Christian charity.\" Julia is incensed at these events and at the scandal that follows, and she rips into everyone and everything in her way with true \"Steel Magnolias\" poise. She speaks her mind about all the unsavory activities her husband left behind, and about much more. \"I absolutely loved this book!\" (Fannie Flagg)",
