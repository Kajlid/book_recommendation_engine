  "title": "Christ Walks Where Evil Reigned: Responding to the Rwandan Genocide",
  "description": "The genocide in 1994 left the Rwandan people feeling God was lost or hidden, a common feeling when people have experienced violent abuse. Because of the appalling slaughter of genocide, Satan and evil are often perceived to be more powerful than God. This book suggests a way forward. Although God was not responsible for the carnage of the genocide, he does want to be part of the healing of its wounds. Christ Walks Where Evil Reigned is a book of action, outlining God's plans for Rwanda and in all countries and communities like it that are searching for healing and wholeness. People seeking healing from past trauma and those wishing to widen their relationship with Christ with a greater understanding of evil and the triumph and redemption of his finished work will greatly benefit from reading this book.",
