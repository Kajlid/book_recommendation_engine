  "description": "Men and women of all ages will warm to Cramer's elegant prose and Southern charm. William Faulkner once insisted that great stories must capture the \"old universal truths...love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.\" Sutter's Cross delivers the truth in grand style. Sutter's Cross is a resort town in the southern Appalachians, where people live in comfortable homes, have comfortable portfolios, and wear comfortable clothes. They expect their lives, their weather, even their God, to be cooperative and predictable--until a stranger calling himself \"Harley\" shows up in the buffet line at the church's annual spring picnic looking like a wreck and wearing stolen jeans. Can God use an outcast to change a town?",
