  "description": "Astronaut Rain Picture Book for Kids. Iâ€™m just like most, little boys my age. Who wants to be an astronaut when they get older? I want to walk on the moon or even fly in a real rocket someday. I wanted the next future astronauts to see some cool photos taken from my person camera as a birthday gift. The photo was just too cool for me to keep all to myself. I wanted to share these amazing photos to kids all around the world.",
