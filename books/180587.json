  "description": "“Good Sabbath to you, Elizabeth.”“How do you fare, Elijah? You look troubled.”“I am well. The men have chosen me and therefore it is my duty to fulfill,” said Elijah, his tone calculated.“I beg to differ – you have lost the color in your face,” said Beth gently, “This is a strong, sudden change.”“It is,” agreed Elijah, “And though I knew before I was baptized that this fate might one day befall me – I am frightened.”“Frightened? Pray tell.”“There are times,” said Elijah with a glint in his eyes, “my faith is tested. Times I wonder if I am worthy of service to the Lord.”Her ears pulsated as she dropped to her knees. A gasp of titillated shock escaped his lips, followed by heavy breathing and a short struggle as Beth snapped off the clasps of his suspenders and gripped the waist of his leggings. A sudden thrill perforated the pores of her skin, lust coursing through her veins – here was a man who was about to devote his heart, mind and soul to God, and something about that made the space between her legs tingle. She looked up at him longingly, not breaking her gaze as she unfurled his leggings, yanking them to his ankles.“Let me be of service to you.”For Adults. 18+!!!!",
