  "title": "The Apostolic School That Wasn’t…: A Memoir of Immaculate Conception Apostolic School in Colfax, California",
  "description": "The Apostolic School That Wasn’t… narrates a gripping account of how a rugged and picturesque 240 acre property in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada slowly transformed into an accredited minor seminary, junior high and high school for boys interested in the Catholic priesthood, then flourished, floundered, and finally shuttered. Situated between the action of God’s divine providence and human realities, the narration seeks to give witness to the faith and effort of the many persons involved in the project, while exploring the possible reasons that led to the school’s ultimate demise. The narration takes place within the backdrop of the Vatican ordered purification and renewal of the Legionaries of Christ and hopes to offer insights into creating a more stable and flourishing environment for present and future apostolic institutions.",
