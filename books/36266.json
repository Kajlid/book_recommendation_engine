  "title": "Uncle Hitler: A Child's Traumatic Journey Through Nazi Hell to the Safety of Britain",
  "description": "Alfred Nestor - born a German child, now a British man - son of a high-ranking SS officer writes with an intense directness in his book Uncle Hitler. Without claiming the usual badly done to victimship or literary elaboration, Alfred unveils an extraordinarily moving and important account of growing up in Nazi Germany while living right next door to Adolf Hitler and his eventual evacuation under special licence as the first post World War Two German child to Ayr in Scotland, and then on to England where he now lives. Whilst literally living right next door to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, Hitler's long time companion; Alfred is innocently unaware of whom the true identities of 'Uncle' Hitler and 'Aunty' Eva really are. With an intense directness, Alfred brings the whole period alive when he paints a powerfully personal and vivid picture of the destructive character of conflict. This remarkable story has many twists and turns, culminating in him being reunited with the father he thought was dead for 53 years! Although there is no fake outpouring of emotions, you simply cannot help but feel close to the sentiments of Alfred as he is innocently caught in the ravages of a war that brings his childhood world crumbling down. As war approached an end in 1945, Soviet reprisals against German civilians were full of raw emotion when the advancing Red Army went on a killing spree; resulting in the spontaneous flight and evacuation of Germans. Trying to stay ahead of the advancing Red Army, Alfred and his mother escaped death by mere seconds. A warm and frank wartime memoir to the current times, this is his story.",
