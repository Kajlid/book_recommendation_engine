  "description": "Favours always come with a cost, and after the vampires helped us save Jacob, we found their price was more than we’d bargained for. I thought my family was safe. We’d fought against our biggest threat and were still reeling from our losses. But Davion and his clan were facing a threat, and even if I wanted to, I couldn’t turn them away. Not when there was so much on the line. But the problem with stepping up to help in someone else’s fight is that it can paint an even bigger target on your back. And now that we’d exposed ourselves, the shadows were coming. But this was a war we didn’t know how to fight, and I had no idea how we could survive.
