  "description": "It's Emma’s thirtieth birthday…and it might just be her last!  A weekend in London leads to kidnapping after one hot night with a sexy Green Beret. For political journalist Emma Jane Lewis, Captain Nathan James Oliver, code name, Outlaw, represents exactly the kind of man she never wanted to date. Too stubborn, too muscled, and too much of an alpha male for her tastes. But his touch sends tingles throughout her entire body. His nearness makes her hot and bothered, and despite her better judgement, she wants him. It was one night. What could be the harm? When Nate meets Emma, the attraction is instant. Something about her pulls him in even though old ghosts haunt him still and his heart remains stuck in the past. But a one-night stand with the contrary Emma is something he can’t resist. When she goes missing, evidence points to Black Jihad, and its leader, Mohammed al-Waleed. Worse, Nate knows it’s his fault she’s been targeted. As Nate and his men search for clues, more is revealed about Emma that sends him reeling, feeling both angry and betrayed. Can Nate set aside their differences and come to terms with his past in time to save Emma from a brutal death at the hands of a dangerous terrorist? Find out.",
