  "description": "Like every other McCall werewolf in history, Link is headed down a short road to insanity, but he’s determined to go out on his own terms. Those terms? Repay the people the broken McCall pack has hurt before Ian Silver has to put him down. Hope is a dangerous thing for a doomed man like him, but when he meets Nicole, an instant and undeniable connection sparks between them. She might not be a typical beauty, but she’s stunning to him and stirring his inner monster up in ways that make him think that maybe, just maybe, she can save him from the McCall madness.  Nicole Brand is in Alaska to discover a part of her life she didn’t know existed. The father she never knew was killed by a wolf, and in an effort to understand who he was, she throws herself into wilderness living. But a chance meeting with a tall, dark, and growly stranger has her thinking that maybe it is fate that has brought her to Galena, Alaska. The more she gets to know the man she is falling desperately hard for, the more of Link’s dark secrets surface—and some of those revolve around her father. She should’ve listened when Link warned her about how dangerous he is, but now it’s too late. She’ll have to decide whether to return to her safe life in the lower forty-eight, or to stay and fight for the man who seems to think she can save him.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
