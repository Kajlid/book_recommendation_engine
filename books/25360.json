  "title": "The Buddha Walks into a Bar...: A Guide to Life for a New Generation",
  "description": "There's a new thirst for spirituality among young people today-but they're less inclined to adjust their lives around traditional religious forms than they are to look for transformation within their existing lifestyles. And they have a natural affinity for Buddhism. This is a book for them-by one of them. Lodro Rinzler speaks the language of Generation O, as his compatriots are known, and he's a respected Buddhist teacher in his own right. His book is a complete introduction to Buddhism, without the cultural trappings, in language that anyone can understand but that will be especially appreciated by young people today under thirty. It's entertaining, chatty, and often funny, but also very serious. It's for anyone who wants to use the Buddha's teachings to awaken like he did.",
