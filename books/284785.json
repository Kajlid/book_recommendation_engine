  "description": "As if one Archon loose on the Southern continent wasn’t enough, now the snake-goddess Utuni has awakened.  And she’s joined forces with Miralea.  But the jaguar goddess is still weak after her defeat at Gryff’s hands, so there’s still a chance for Gryff to capture her.  All he has to do is infiltrate enemy territory, travel to the heart of Utun’s capital, and try not to get ritually sacrificed along the way.",
