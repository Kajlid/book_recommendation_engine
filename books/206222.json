  "description": "Will her irreplaceable spirit win the heart of the warrior she loves? Lily Ramsay is the sunshine at the center of the Ramsay clan. Even as a wee lassie, sick with a childhood illness, she had the power to spread smiles and laughter wherever she went. But when Lily’s beloved brother marries and becomes laird of the clan, Lily feels lost. Her once steadfast companion has little time for her, and his new wife has assumed the duties she used to carry out for the clan. While she couldn’t be happier for her loved ones, she longs for something more for herself. In truth, she longs for her brother’s best friend—the braw warrior she’s loved all her life. Kyle Maule has made it his mission to do aught he can to honor his sire’s legacy. His appointment as the new Ramsay laird’s second is a dream come true, but Lily Ramsay’s beauty and irrepressible spirit threaten to make Kyle forget himself and fumble on the job. Desperate to do his duty to his laird and his fallen sire, Kyle tries to quell his feelings for Lily—to protect her without succumbing to the desire to be with her. But Lily is not the sort of lass to be held at arm’s length. When an unexpected threat befalls her, Kyle will have to decide to either let her in all the way or step away from her forever. A stand-alone novel.",
