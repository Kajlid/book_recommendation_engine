  "description": "Life was pretty straightforward for Cutter, a wolf shifter and an agent for the Supernatural Enforcers Agency – solve cases, attend anger management classes and avoid the attentions of a cute but tenacious hedgehog shifter. That is until his old partner is murdered, and a witness from a former case goes missing. Now, Cutter finds himself the prime suspect and with nowhere else to turn but to the one person he knows won’t betray him.  Curvy hedgehog shifter Lucie has spent a year chasing the commitment phobic wolf, and is she downhearted that he still runs in the opposite direction when he sees her coming? You bet your sweet patootie she isn’t! He may be playing hard to get, but she’ll wear him down yet. But, before she can say nutty fudgkins, Lucie comes home to find her wolf, naked and bleeding all over her couch, and Lucie, in spite of his howling objections, is determined to help him solve his case.  While working shoulder to, uh, shoulder, can Lucie convince him that she’s the right hedgehog for him? And will Cutter finally give in and admit to the feelings that have been dogging him ever since the adorable hedgehog bounced into his life?  Caution! This does contain swearing (there’s a lot of use of the f word!), as well as scenes of a sexual nature with m/f interaction intended for mature readers.",
