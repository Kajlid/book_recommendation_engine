  "description": "“Sean Turner is not the man for you,” people warned me. They judged him based on his career, on his past. But they didn’t know him like I did. They couldn’t look past the tattoos and scars to see the gentle soul that lived inside him. But I could.We were both scarred, both a little broken. But somehow when I was with him, breathing was a little easier. His past didn’t matter, and neither did mine. Loving him could cost me my family and friends. Not loving him though? That could break me.This book was previously published under another title. This version has been completely rewritten.",
