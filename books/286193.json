  "description": "One simple run-in got me more than I bargained for...and now I can’t go back. It might be dangerous, but it might just be worth a shot.  Victoria Angel…  It was just a cup of coffee…that’s all I was after. Some much-needed caffeine to get me through wedding dress shopping. That’s it. But I guess the universe had other plans. How do I go from getting coffee to waking up in the hospital after being involved in a drive-by? And how does my mysterious hero go from taking a bullet for me to getting arrested and put in prison? His last name is Goodman, but according to the police, he’s not at all a good man. However, it feels as though fate brought us together. The police don’t agree…and my fiancé definitely doesn’t either.  Tristan Goodman…  She thinks I’m her hero, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Because of the business that I’m in and the people I surround myself with, there’s always a target on my back, and anyone associated with me is in the line of fire, including the quirky yet gorgeous Victoria Angel. I’ve brought nothing but danger to her life the minute she bumped into me in that coffee shop. I know she’s not mine, but that certainly doesn’t stop me from going after what I want. And what I want is an angel. She’d be wise to end all contact with me, exactly like her fiancé wishes, but I can’t leave her alone…especially after I have a taste of heaven.",
