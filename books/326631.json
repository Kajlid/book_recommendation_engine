  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Mila hasn't spoken in the five years since she became an Onra, a first level Everfall witch. After failing the test to reclaim her voice and control her magic, her mentor sends Mila to Achten Tan–City of Dust and Bones–a dangerous desert town built in the massive ribcage of an extinct leviathan.Mila must steal a magical staff capable of releasing her power, from the sky-high lair of the Bone Master, Chief Opu Haku.Her only resources are the magical luminous elixirs of the cursed caverns where she grew up, and a band of unlikely allies; a quirky inventor, a giant-ant rider, a healer, a librarian's assistant, a Tar-tule rider, and the chief's playboy son. But in the City of Bones, enemies and friends are not who they seem and trusting the wrong person can be deadly. If Mila fails she will never speak again and her bones may be added to the wasteland.",
