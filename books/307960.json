It healed us.This time dance isn’t enough.It’s time to face our enemies. It’s time I fight back.But at what cost?My soul? The death of everyone I care about?All I can be certain of is this...I’m willing to do anything to protect the people I love.Even becoming a monster.This time there'll be no rehearsals, just our grand finale.I pray it won’t be our last.**Finale is book 4 of 4 in this new, gritty, contemporary reverse harem academy romance for 17+ readers. It deals with adult themes and some subjects you may find upsetting. If you love dance, your men on the criminal side, alpha hot holes, and the friends-to-enemies-to-lovers trope, this is for you. Contains foul language, sexual scenes and of course a HEA. For some of the characters at least.**",
