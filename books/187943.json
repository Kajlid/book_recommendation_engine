In Touching the Heart of God you will learn about this King and His Kingdom-its order, its benefits, and the privilege afforded to its citizens in celebrating the greatest military and spiritual victories in recorded history. The God of all creation actually keeps a calendar that celebrates His activity in the history of mankind and encourages our participation in the feasts.

These are the days of Elijah! • The Feasts of the Lord...you have an engraved invitation! • Your citizenship in the Kingdom of God brings major benefits to your life today! • How can Christians and Jews walk as One New Man and change our world today? • Clearly see how the Old and New Testaments integrate for His purpose. • Is it possible to Touch the Heart of God?",
