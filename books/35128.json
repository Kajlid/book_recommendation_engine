  "description": "Dream magic is the most dangerous of magics because it is so difficult to control. Apprentice mage Glimmer-Not a Glimmer of Magic-realizes this when he discovers that his apparent lack of magical talent is because his magic manifests only when he is dreaming. His first attempt at dream magery conjures a dragon, and just before dying in dragonfire, Glimmer, in desperation, locks the dragon within the stones of his master's house. How, though, do you live in a house that is also a dragon? And how can you even sleep-knowing that dream might slip to nightmare?",
