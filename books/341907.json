  "description": "A Mercenary haunted by his sinister past…Gregor MacLachlan has much to hide. Not only has he made a name for himself throughout Scotland as a man that knew how to kill, but no one knows his true identity as that of the laird of MacLachlan's son—banished from his home. Gregor has been content with his life, never relying on anyone or anything. Until Fiona....A powerful Druid priestess…Fiona Sinclair depends on one person—herself. She learned early on that she was alone in this world, a world that took her sisters and her parents. Yet, the call to The Druid's Glen is strong, and the man responsible for her parent's death stalks her. There is only one man that can get her safely to the Glen, but can she afford the price Gregor asks when it means giving up both her freedom... and her heart?",
