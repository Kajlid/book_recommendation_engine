  "description": "The world was dying, and Asahn was the only one who could save it. At least that’s the tale Old Durn the tribe storyteller was weaving this time. It seemed absurd at first, but then everything spun out of control.A strange new religion is hunting the Kahn Shogal, and the secret to why may reside in the clouded history of Asahn’s people. The mighty Highlands warriors are left with no choice but to flee into the wilderness of their homeland, but it has become a harsh and unforgiving place as the world withers.While the Kahn Shogal face danger on every side, their great chieftain is too consumed by pride and tradition to lead them. Only Asahn, heir to the Kah Hrah, has the authority to confront his father in his missteps. But for a son who always looked up to his father, such betrayal will not come easily.With every step, Asahn will confront new dangers to his people and his world. And with every step, he will drive himself against all odds to become the person Old Durn swears he can be, their only salvation.",
