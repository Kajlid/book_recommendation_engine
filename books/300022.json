  "description": "In her classic books, Laura Ingalls Wilder lovingly described the many little houses she and her family lived in as they traveled across the American frontier. Today, these houses have been preserved as sites and museums that thousands of fans visit every year. The Little House Guidebook contains detailed information on these sites, as well as guidance on where to eat and stay, and other places to explore in the surrounding areas. Special features included colored tabs on each chapter for easy reference, a room-by-room tour of Laura's Rocky Ridge Farmhouse, and a walking tour and street map of De Smet, Laura's little town on the prairie, as well as guidance on how to get to the sites, where to eat and stay, and other places to explore in the surrounding areas.Lavishly illustrated throughout with beautiful full-color photographs of Laura's houses and memorabilia, and gently colorized versions of Garth Williams' original art from the Little House books, this guidebook is the perfect companion for anyone who wants to visit Laura's little houses or just read about them.",
