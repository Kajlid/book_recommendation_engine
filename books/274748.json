  "description": "Reaper was the unknown biker around the Renegade Souls MC. They said he ghosted his silence into the woodwork, carrying his secret past close to his chest, never confiding his pain in anyone.  \"I'll always, always love you.\"  He had reasons for everything he’d done. For the one he called his priority. Nothing was too much. Even murder. Loyal to his club, he knew one day if he had to choose between them and her, he’d walk away without a backward glance.  There's no madness like a biker obsessed.  The bikers called her diner girl but to Reaper, Paige was the woman he watched intensely without ever asking her for a date. They shared an overprotective – borderline possessive friendship but years later, Paige was still alone. Still worshipping him from afar. Still inexplicably drawn to the biker.  “There's three people in my relationship; me, him and her.\"  The past isn’t always better left behind. Sometimes it needs to resurface in order to have a future with the man who brought passion.  Loving the quiet man was the easiest thing on earth, like she was made only for him. But secrets had a habit of coming back and making a love that was unbreakable suddenly…fragile.  Disclaimer: This is not, not, NOT a cheating book. For the people in the back, this is not a cheating book. Stop hiding, it’s completely safe.",
