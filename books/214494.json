  "description": "Taylin Nichols has the perfect job as a nurse in the newborn unit in her hometown of Mitchel Creek, Georgia, but as for the perfect boyfriend—not so much. She knows she needs to dump the guy, but figures it will happen naturally if she’s accepted for the work abroad program. On a day when she should’ve stayed home, she runs into Luke McKay—literally. He’s new at the hospital and already has a reputation as an unfriendly, brooding male. Even though he’s hotter than a Georgia summer, he’s not Taylin’s type—at least that’s what she tells herself, but after spending time together, she can’t deny her feelings anymore. The only problem is Luke has baggage from a lousy marriage and isn’t ready for a relationship. He desperately tries to keep Taylin in the “friend zone”, but it doesn’t take long to realize that will never work. Just when he and Taylin decide love is worth the risk, Luke’s past presents an unexpected challenge, leaving both of them to wonder if their love will be enough.",
