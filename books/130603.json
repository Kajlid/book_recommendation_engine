  "description": "One night was all I wanted, to be carefree and wild but one night was never going to be enough. I knew the moment that shot of whiskey hit my lips that there was no going back to my old life, not after this. I had heard the stories about Jameson Rice long before I ever met him, he was Boone, North Carolina’s personal Boogie Man.MC President? Check.Outlaw? Check.God’s gift to women wrapped in a leather vest? Check, check. He was destined to be my downfall but what if I’m his destruction? Men like him don’t fall for southern belles. He told me he’d help me walk on the wild side of life but he had no idea that my life was going to flip his upside down.",
