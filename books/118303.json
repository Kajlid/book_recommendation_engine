  "title": "Shuttering the Manning House",
  "description": "This is the sequel to 'What Happened to Alex Manning?'  The Manning Family has lived in the mansion overlooking the Atlantic for more than 200 years. With wealth and power, they enjoyed lives of privilege beyond reason. But 1929 is looming, and dark clouds are gathering.  This is a story of exceptional loyalty between devoted friends and the dark side of survival. Kim Scottâ€™s highly anticipated tale of historical fiction, told in her uniquely tantalizing style, will take you back to the end of the 1920s on the coast of Maine. Listen to the waves breaking on the beach, smell the salt in the air, and taste the smooth, aged Whisky.",
