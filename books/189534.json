  "description": "Sixteen – with a bullet. That’s what Maya’s Mom calls her. It’s the sort of name you get when your Mom works for an Agency so secret it doesn’t actually exist. Not that Maya minds. As far as she’s concerned a pink Glock and a short skirt solve pretty much any problem, especially male ones. So new town, a new school? No big deal. She’s been there, done that and mostly blown someone’s head off in the process. There’s nothing Maya doesn’t know about the family business. Thing is, the Cute Guy in the front row won’t stay dead, yesterday’s getting a bad habit of turning into tomorrow and Maya’s starting to think she doesn’t know jack. She doesn’t - but she’s going to find out real soon. Because Jack’s back. Jack and Maya. Maya and Jack. Someone’s gonna die. Someone has to live. So sit down, put your head between your knees and kiss your pasts goodbye.",
