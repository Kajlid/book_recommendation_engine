  "description": "\"Scottish author, publisher, and bookseller ROBERT CHAMBERS (1802¿1871) knew that the radical theories about natural evolution he was espousing in this groundbreaking work would be controversial, so he published anonymously in 1844, and kept his identity a secret until 1884, long after Charles Darwin¿s seminal Origin of Species had changed the tenor of modern scientific discourse. Indeed, Darwin praised Chambers¿ daring, calling his book an ¿excellent service¿ that had swept away prejudice and prepared the public for introduction to Darwin¿s similar ideas, for Chambers anticipated Darwin with his discussions ¿ the geological formation of the earth ¿ hypotheses on the development of the plant and animal kingdoms ¿ the early history of mankind ¿ and much more. Anyone interested in the history of science, the study of evolution, or the politics of science in the 19th century will enjoy this historic book. \"",
