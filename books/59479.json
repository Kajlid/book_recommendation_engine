Hey, it¹s a livin¹ and Meg, well, she¹s darn good at it! But she and her bear companion Phil (who tends to be a bit less hot-blooded) just may have their hands full when they set out to capture Neil Voss, elfin bad dude. There¹s one tall his pet ain¹t no bear, it¹s a fire-breathin¹ dragon the size of a house! With Moore¹s inimitable sense of timing, action, sexiness and... dry humor! Collects the first 4-issue mini-series with additional pin-up art and a new story all at a larger size showing off Moore¹s great art to better effect!",
