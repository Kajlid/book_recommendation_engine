  "description": "There were three things in life that I truly baseball, women, and my family. Not necessarily in that order. The funny thing about life is that it can change in an instant, and the things you love are taken in a heartbeat.It was a new year, a new start, a fresh beginning. Or so I thought. My career was over before it had started, and I found myself stranded in a town even smaller than Haven Brook. The only good thing about getting stuck there was that there was only one mechanic in town, and she was hot.Kayce was as wild as the purple in her hair. Her infectious laughter and witty banter were enough to pull me in, but the darkness in her eyes hinted that she was hiding something. Something big.Her secrets quickly caught up with her, and there was nowhere to run. Everything she thought she knew wasn’t what it seemed, and I found myself tangled up in the webs of lies spinning around her. I had fought death before, but this time, I wasn’t so sure I would be so lucky.",
