  "title": "Political Fictions",
  "description": "In these coolly observant essays, the iconic bestselling writer looks at the American political process and at that handful of insiders who invent, year in and year out, the narrative of public life.Through the deconstruction of the sound bites and photo ops of three presidential campaigns, one presidential impeachment, and an unforgettable sex scandal, Didion reveals the mechanics of American politics. She tells us the uncomfortable truth about the way we vote, the candidates we vote for, and the people who tell us to vote for them. These pieces build, one on the other, into a disturbing portrait of the American political landscape, providing essential reading on our democracy.",
