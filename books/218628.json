Lindon has reached Copper, taking the first step on the road to power, but the warriors of the outside world are still far beyond him.  To advance, he turns to the arcane skills of the Soulsmiths, who craft weapons from the stuff of souls. With new powers come new enemies, and Lindon soon finds himself facing an entire sect of Golds.",
