  "description": "Andrew Hayes, a brilliant but troubled guitarist in an up-and-coming band, has been haunted since childhood by the presence of his muse. One night during a performance in San Francisco he spots her--but she vanishes before he can catch her. Desperate to find her, he accepts a curious offer to stay in the city, moving into a dilapidated Victorian undergoing renovations that stir up far more than dust. Andrew's life soon becomes even more chaotic with the arrival of martini-swilling ghosts and a troupe of flesh-and-blood stoner spiritualists bringing bad tidings from the Great Beyond.The dark side of his obsession creates visions both thrilling and menacing. As he struggles to solve the mysteries threatening the woman he loves, Andrew discovers his life is repeating a refrain more deadly than he'd ever imagined. Inspired by the sexy noirs and comedies of the past, Grave Refrain transports the reader to where the things that go bump in the night not only thrill you, but might just take your breath away for good.",
