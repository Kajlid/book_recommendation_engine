Yet the longer Anna remains at Lake House, the more she realises that no one and nothing is quite as it appears. Not her fellow patients, her husband, her family -- not even herself.Will Anna discover the freedom she seeks, or plunge so far into the recesses of the mind that she might never escape?",
