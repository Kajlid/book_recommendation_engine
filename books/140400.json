Ryan Walters committed suicide just days earlier.Ryan tells Steven that he didn't kill himself. He believes he was murdered and that his death is linked to an article he was working on for the school paper. Steven sets out to solve the mystery, but as the story unfolds, so does Ryan's secret life of sex with guys and depression.

And despite revelations of his friend's closeted life, he must face the truth that Ryan doesn't--and never will--love him.",
