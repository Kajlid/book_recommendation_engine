  "description": "As the dawn breaks on a new year, Azusa decides it's time for the girls of the Pop Music Club to tuck away their tea and cakes. Pick up their instruments! And bring the rock 'n' roll with another performance! But even though Afterschool Tea Time is starting to sound like a real band, Mio's stage fright is going to make any live show tricky. What better way to cure shyness than with a part-time job?! At a maid caf√©?!",
