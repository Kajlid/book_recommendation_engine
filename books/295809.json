  "title": "The Princess of Clèves",
  "description": "Entering life at the French royal court, a world in which \"what is shown is rarely the truth,\" the young Princess of Clèves learns of passion's torments, of heartbreak, and of the agony of love. Claire Bouilhac and Catel Muller's graphic-novel adaption of this classic tale—often referred to as the forerunner of the modern psychological novel—remains faithful to the original 17th-century text, while also providing surprising and original insight into both the mystery of the creative act, and the link between the author, Madame de La Fayette, and her heroine, the Princess of Clèves.",
