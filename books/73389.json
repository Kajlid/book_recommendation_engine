  "description": "Domingo Rhodes, a once prominent journalist from London, is desperate for a story that will heighten his interest in journalism again. He finds that story in Veracruz, Mexico, and he teams up with a local journalist, Noelia Lizaldi, covering the story and their source is none other than a fearless gun smuggler, Clive Wilson, who is on the run from the law and a rebel group led by the notorious Lady Martinez. Domingo becomes a target as well and he must adapt quickly to life on the run and being hunted by a rebel group and corrupt law enforcement.As Domingo dives deeper into the criminal underworld of gun smuggling, he begins to question his own morality and those around him. Noelia is head strong, often choosing righteous no matter the circumstance, and Domingo sees Clive as a loose cannon, a threat to himself more so than others. The danger of getting the story becomes a thrill, and he begins to question whether he wants the fame more than reporting the corruption and criminal activity that is taking place.",
