  "title": "Waiting for Peter",
  "description": "The day is almost boiling hot. I lay on the hot pavement of the driveway, my ears pricked forward, my eyes attentive, my heart racing—not only from the heat, but from hope. Perhaps this will be the day he returns... Peter is a young teen who is emotionally and physically scarred following a tragic accident. Hoping to find a way to help Peter reconnect with his family, his mother, Lanie, agrees to let him adopt a dog from the Humane Society. So begins the relationship between Peter and his neurotic mutt, Sunny. Told from the alternating points of view of Sunny and Lanie, Waiting for Peter is the story of the healing power of love between a boy and his dog and an analogy of how we should view our relationship with God, our Master. ELIZABETH MUSSER, an Atlanta native and the bestselling author of The Swan House, is a novelist who writes what she calls ‘entertainment with a soul’ from her writing chalet outside Lyon, France. For over twenty-five years, Elizabeth and her husband, Paul, have been involved in missions work with International Teams. The Mussers have two sons, a daughter-in-law and three grandchildren.",
