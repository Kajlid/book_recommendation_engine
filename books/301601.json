  "description": "Bilingual Edition. In these lyrical tributes to Anne Frank's courage and individualism, Chilean poet Marjorie Agosín captures the wrenching paradox of the young diarist's unshakable love of life, a love which endured unspeakable horrors. In this bilingual collection, first published in 1994, Agosín makes the girl's humanity palpable even as it damns the inhumanity of those who perpetrated the destruction around her.",
