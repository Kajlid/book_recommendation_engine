  "description": "HE WAS POSSESSIVE, DOMINANT, AND GORGEOUS—A LETHAL COMBINATION FOR MY HEART.Growing up in high society isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.So once a year, I take a three-week holiday with my best friend and leave it all behind—time away from the prying eyes and reprimanding words.Things change when my eyes scan the hotel lobby and end up landing on former rugby player Wills Taylor.His dominant personality was too much, but it still somehow pulled me in, and I ended up in his bed. I know his type, though. So, I make sure to leave before facing the dreaded ‘morning-after.’Except, Wills has other plans for us. What was just supposed to be a fun trip with my best friend turns into me finding a man I fall for too fast and too hard.Then when an argument between us spirals into me catching another woman trying to kiss him, I can’t do it. I bolt. And being alone in a foreign country has me finding out I’ve been hurt in ways I don’t know I’ll get over.Three years later, he storms into my life again. This time, it’s either listen to the hard truth and deal with the baggage Wills and I both carry or walk away from what might be my only chance at a life I truly want.",
