Even if it means uprooting her own life for a bit of crazy…New roommate Ryan might be gorgeous, but he’s incredibly moody and mysterious. Could there be more to him than the playboy that dates models? It doesn’t matter anyway. She’s far too busy trying to deal with the rest of her life; her bullying boss, pushy mother and three brothers, each with their own dramas. But Jazz will always find the time for a bit of trouble…Will Poppy be able to get back to her orderly life? Or will she prefer the unconventional set up she’s found herself in?",
