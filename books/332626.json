  "title": "The Lockdown Collection",
  "description": "The Lockdown Collection is a compilation of forty poems about serious subjects such as Brexit and the Irish lockdown. Poems are dedicated to a hospital cleaner; former U.S. president Donald Trump's mob storming the Capitol; holding the Catholic Church accountable; the North Korean dictator; the Chinese leader; the Arab Spring; social snobbery; and the environment. Less serious subjects include St Patrick's Day going virtual and Mayo never winning an All-Ireland, and celebrities such as Conor McGregor, Rory McIlroy and Marcus Rashford. There is a tourism-inspired poem about the Wild Atlantic Way and one about the Queen's visit, a poem about Ireland as a bankrupt nation reviving its international reputation, and even poems about the poet's pet cat, Ireland's weather, and a love poem about Ireland with deeper meaning.Written during the COVID-19 lockdown in Ireland, this collection seeks to cheer up and give a psychological lift to an Irish public battered by the pandemic and to revive hope for the future.",
