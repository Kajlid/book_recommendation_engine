  "description": "Robin Burcell has worked as a cop, hostage negotiator, and as an FBI-trained, forensic artist . She’s also the author of award-winning thrillers. Now she uses that unparalleled experience to reboot Carolyn Weston’s groundbreaking series of books, which were the basis for the hit TV show \"The Streets of San Francisco.\" Sgt. Al Krug and his younger, college-educated partner Casey Kellog are investigating a string of strangulation killings when another victim is found at the Presidio…but a surprising, violent incident at the crime scene makes them wonder if everything is what it seems. The two miss-matched cops, with sharply conflicting approaches to detective work, are under intense pressure to get results. It’s a race-against-the-clock investigation that propels them into the deadly intersection of politics, real estate, media and vice… the fertile, fog-shrouded killing field of a ruthless murderer.\"Robin Burcell has expertly updated the Krug & Kellog series for old and new readers alike. She knows her stuff and puts it to good use in this entertaining and authentic police procedural.\"  —Alafair Burke, New York Times Bestselling Author of All Day and a Night\"The Last Good Place is a fabulous reboot of a beloved classic. With smart, clever writing and an elegant plot, Robin Burcell has nailed it. All hail the reincarnation of Krug and Kellog.\" —J.T. Ellison, New York Times bestselling author of What Lies Behind",
