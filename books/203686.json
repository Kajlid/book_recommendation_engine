  "description": "Sarah has spent her whole life fighting against her father's wishes. She doesn't care about his old beliefs and traditions; she just wants to go to college. Sarah's determined to do something with her life that doesn't involve baking pies and being a good wife, and she's convinced that with enough hard work, she'll manage it all. That is, until she gets put on a class assignment with Robert Hasting who seems intent on causing trouble in her life in more ways than one. Robert is sick of his father telling him what to do and who to date. When he leaves for college, he promises himself that he's finally going to have some fun. That is, until he meets Sarah. She's everything that Robert has ever wanted, but can he make her notice him when all she seems to care about is coursework?",
