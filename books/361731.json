  "description": "Valentine Nichols wants two things for her birthday-for Shane Daniels to notice her, and a taste of the wild D/s sex scene she's been longing to experience. When she sees Shane at the local BDSM club, she hatches a plan to have both and convinces Shane to give her lessons in submission. Shane Daniels has wanted Valentine for years but as his best friend's little sister, she's strictly off-limits. But when Valentine talks him into giving her D/s lessons, he gives in to some of his darker urges and dominates her sexually. Now they are locked in a battle of wills as Valentine pushes him for a consummation of their new relationship while Shane tries to keep himself from taking her completely. Who will win? They'll both find out when Valentine takes her spanking.",
