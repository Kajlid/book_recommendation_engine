  "description": "Total number of pages 549 (274 + 275)Louisa Anne Meredith was the wife of one of the early settlers in Van Diemen’s Land. Both she and her husband Charles delighted in the natural world and it is this delight coupled with Louisa’s exquisitive observations that bring to life the bush and the days of settlement in Van Diemen’s Land. Her account of the long journey across the land with her husband, her baby, a nurse and a servant is unforgettable.Their amusement at the trials occasioned by an attempt to keep an opossum as a pet and her recount of a hunting party’s encounter with a Tasmanian tiger are just two of the many precious glimpses of life in the mid-nineteenth century. Louisa’s description of the floods and destruction they caused, struggles with and by aborigines and the trials of establishing gracious homes and gardens in an often tempestuous and treacherous land is essential reading for anyone who seeks to achieve an understanding of those early days.",
