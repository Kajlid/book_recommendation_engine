Dropped in an unknown location, presumably still on the planet, she only has a monolithic book — the Caudex — as her guide, but it’s not giving up its answers easily. Will she be able to uncover the mysteries?In the meantime, Trae and Kani are on a mission of their own, which may turn out to be disastrous. With Fenton dead and Runa gone, their next course of action is to strike Videus back where he’ll hurt most. Will their plan succeed to bring down the mysterious man behind the Helix? Will Runa be able to find her way back to her friends? Or is the fate of the planet doomed?",
