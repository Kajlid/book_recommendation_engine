  "title": "The Sources of Taize",
  "description": "The \"source book\" on which the common life in Taize is based, this short volume is fundamental for understanding the vocation of Taize. It is presented like a letter that Brother Roger addresses personally to each reader, telling how in spite of discouragement and even doubt we can constantly find refreshment in returning again and again to the sources of faith. In the second part of the book, Brother Roger speaks particularly to the brothers of the community, recalling the essentials that make life together possible. In his own particular style, Taize's founder expresses himself in words that go straight to the heart. In page after page, he is careful not to write a single word that he has not first of all tried to live out himself.",
