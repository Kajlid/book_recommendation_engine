Tessa loves roaming the local parkland and often goes there for walks with the family dog. When developers threaten to destroy this, for the first time in her life Tessa decides to make a stand and joins a demonstration. There she meets Wolfie. She's seen him at school and he is well-known as a local activist. He is incredibly kind and helpful to her, and gradually as they find they have a lot in common, they fall deeply in love.

But just when things couldn't be working out better, tragedy strikes...",
