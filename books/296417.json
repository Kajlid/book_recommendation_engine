  "description": "“I am yours.” I whisper.My skin and bones feel cold when Kiah stands, taking away his touch. He lifts me to my feet, holding me against him for a moment more when he feels the same chill. We are in a trance that lasts long enough to rattle the universe. I squeeze him tighter. He loves me harder.“Evee.” He speaks my name from his heart. “Do you know how often I dreamed of you loving me the way I love you? I would trade my eyesight for my hearing just to hear you speak those words to me.”We walk arm-in arm, on a narrow stretch of grass between the sand and the trees with our hearts wide open to one another. Holding on to each other because we want to, and for no other reason. This is beautiful. To love without shame. To love without fear. To allow someone in your heart to see the darkest parts of you knowing that they will love them too. I am free to love him as hard as I want. I am free to love him as I am. And my Kiah is here for it all.",
