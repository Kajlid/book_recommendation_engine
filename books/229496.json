  "description": "Alternative cover edition for ASIN B00LE51WGG. Q: Who would stalk Isis? A: Somebody with a deathwish. Isis always knew her bank robbers were ruthless, dangerous, and brilliant. After all, they take their names from gods. They’ve eluded law enforcement agencies across the globe. And with just the crook of a little finger they’re able to bend her to their every kinky desire. But it isn’t until the threatening letter arrives for her that she realizes just how ruthless, dangerous and brilliant her three men are. The stalker’s threats unleash the robbers’ most primal and possessive instincts as they blaze a path of destruction through the criminal underground. The culprit lands in a prison hospital before the outlaws can get their hands on him, but at least Isis is safe. Or is she? Can the robbers let go of their obsession with banks long enough to recognize the danger swirling around her?",
