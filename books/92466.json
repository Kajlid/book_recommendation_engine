  "description": "Georgie can run but she can't hide from the man who stalks her dreams and throws her ordered life into a tailspin. Emotional entanglement is not on Georgie Martin's to do list. She has turned her back on her sophisticated Sydney lifestyle, determined to renovate her parents old flower farm and her shattered ego. However, the challenges prove more than she bargained for until a madcap scheme comes to fruition and the Protea Boys are born. The team of efficient, well-tapered six-packs solve her farming problems, but their leader presents a different kind of challenge - their first spark of attraction ignites a passion she cannot ignore. Tom Morgan likes his women \"pretty and entertaining,\" not \"efficient and driven,\" but the threat of being co-opted as a wine waiter or worse, chef in his brother's restaurant encourages him to take up what he sees as the highly amusing challenge of managing the Protea Boys. It is the perfect distraction while he waits for a new assignment - or so he thinks until he realizes he has found the one woman he cannot run away from.",
