Seventeen-year-old Tom's macho denial unravels when his mother disowns him. The odds look slim that closeted All-American Tom will experience a healing connection on the streets of the Windy City. Joe Todd is a decent young man from South Carolina.At 22, he's an ex-Marine living with a personal crisis. He relocates to Chicago to work through his feelings for a fellow serviceman, but Joe's heroic stint in the Corps was only extended boot camp for the real action to come.
