  "description": "Part 3 of 3 (2014 Rev) for the Shadow Lake series of Spencer Kane Adventures. After the rescue of his dad and friends from Shadow Lake in book #2, Escape From Shadow Lake, Spencer and his family try to get back to a normal home life. Just as the family settles into their routine, they are visited by a group of American Indians that insist on meeting with Spencer and the others who took part in the removal of ancient objects from the ground at a neighbor's cottage. Running Fox explains to the teens and their parents the necessary actions that must be performed in order to rid the lake of the evil spirits they uncovered. If the ceremony is not performed, the families will never be able to return to their cottages without the fear that drove them away only weeks before. One family, the Claytons, who already returned to the lake under the assumption that the evil had gone, are now fighting for their lives at a Michigan hospital. The teens have the opportunity and feel the responsibility to do as the ancient book instructs, and possibly save the lives of their lake neighbors. The teens encounter unexpected surprises on their way from central Indiana to Shadow Lake, Michigan, but remain vigilant in their “mission”. Their support for each other keeps them going, no matter how frightening the situation becomes.",
