  "description": "Whether your family is nuclear, blended, extended or unrelated; whether you are single, divorced, living together or married; at a family dinner or dinner party; engaged in combat with the neighbors or the relatives -- there is simply no substitute for the core of civility that must reside at the heart of every house, condo or apartment if it is truly to be a home. With her trademark wit and insight, Miss Manners knocks household discourteousness off its foundation by revealing the secrets Getting the housework done when you can't complain about the servant problem -- because the servant is youKindling warm memories rather than heated conflict at family occasionsMaking use of common rooms instead of turning them into a mess or a museum --  while everyone huddles in their respective allotted upstairs spaces aloneReviving the art of entertaining to make friends who will love you for yourself (it beats staying home alone watching TV)Being pleasant enough to the neighbors so you're not afraid to walk out yourown front doorRefusing to recognize that the harried household cannot meet proper standards of behavior, especially since all households are now harried, Miss Manners explains how to return a sense of propriety -- and most of all, tranquility -- to domestic life.",
