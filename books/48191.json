  "description": "April is an exceptional young lady and something of a snoop. After a chance encounter with a spy, she finds herself involved with political intrigues that stretch her abilities.There is a terrible danger she, and her friends and family, will lose the only home she has ever known, and be forced to live on the slum ball Earth below. It's more than an almost fourteen year old should have to deal with. Fortunately she has a lot of smart friends and allies.It's a good thing, because things get very rough and dicey. They challenge the political status quo, and with a small population the only advantage they have in war is a thin technological edge.",
