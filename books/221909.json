  "description": "****Don't miss this first book in the brand new Wolves of Winter's Edge standalone series from T. S. Joyce****  Gentry Striker is right back where he swore he would never be again—his hometown. All he has to do is tie up some loose ends and escape the darkness that has enveloped this place, but he can feel his destiny pulling him deeper into the shadows of this old town. The local pack has been taken over by one seriously unstable alpha, and Gentry is a rogue on a mission to escape. That is, until a striking beauty grabs his attention and demands to stay at the home he is renting out. The problem? She’s human, and isn’t safe in a town full of monsters. Perhaps Gentry is the biggest monster of all, but she’s got him wanting to dig back into his old life and become a better man. She doesn’t know it yet, but she has his wolf hunting her. And he’s not the only one.  Blaire Hayward is on a last-minute vacation to escape the monotony of her life for a little while. The plan is to spend some time in a cabin in snow country relaxing, but when she coasts into Rangeley, nothing is what it seems. The people in this town are acting strangely, and there is something dark going on under the surface that she can’t quite figure out. And at the center of it all is Gentry Striker. Tall, snarly, sexy, and mysterious, he’s calling to her heart in ways she never thought possible. But - the longer she stays, the more uncertain her life becomes, because Rangeley is no normal town. It’s a town of beasts, and Blaire is falling for the most dangerous of them all.  Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
