It picks up around 1911 and tells the story of the love of May's life, takes her through the fears of WWI, the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, Federal prohibition, the roaring twenties, the Great Depression, and family turmoil with two more husbands and children. She and her family cope with WWII and the immense changes in Atlanta throughout the mid-1950s. As usual, May's actions are somewhat questionable but regardless, we want her and her family to overcome the obstacles set before them.",
