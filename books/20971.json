  "description": "Utterly chilling. Frighteningly plausible. A classic of medical horror that could come only from Robin Cook.In dire financial straits, it was a pregnancy neither Adam Schonberg nor his wife Jennifer wanted. But both rejected abortion, so Adam abandoned his medical studies, overcame his scruples, and started work as a salesman with Arolen Pharmaceuticals.Soon his curiosity was aroused. Why did the computer print-outs on his doctor customers reveal so much personal information? And why did so many of them give up private practice for the mysterious Julian Clinic after returning from one of Arolen's lavish Caribbean cruises? Was there a connection between the unusually high number of abortions performed at the clinic and Arolen's foetal research centre in Puerto Rico?The alarm bells started ringing when Jennifer's doctor, just back from a cruise, joined the clinic and started prescribing Arolen drugs which he had previously rejected. Now there was much more than morality at stake as Adam's investigations led him on a trail of unimaginable horror and a race against time to save his wife and unborn child - and the soul of medicine - from the obscene evil that was Mindbend...Moving from gleaming hospital corridors that shelter dark secrets to luxurious cruise ships that are not what they seem, from action-packed chases to scenes of spell-binding scientific terror, Mindbend will draw all those who read so much as a page into its web of irresistible suspenseâ€”and hold them fast.",
