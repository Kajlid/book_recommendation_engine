  "description": "It's 1943, and the U.S. Navy is caught in a fierce battle against the Japanese in the South Pacific. At stake, is the Allies' newly won Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. But Isoroku Yamamoto, admiral of the Combined Fleet and architect of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, desperately wants Guadalcanal back and prepares to launch a series of bombing raids in the Solomons.In response, the Allies introduce the proximity fuse to the fleet-a top-secret antiaircraft detonator that can greatly assist the U.S. Navy in their fight against Japanese dive-bombers and torpedo planes. But in the heat of combat, Commander Jerry Landa refuses to use the fuse, and the USS Howell is torn in half. Lieutenant Commander Todd Ingram confronts Landa, questioning his authority. As the two become enemies in the midst of war, Yamamoto directs the raids that will return him to the glory of December 7, 1941-raids that will facilitate the recapture of Guadalcanal and will cripple the U.S. Navy forever.",
