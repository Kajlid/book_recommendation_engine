  "description": "When an accident shatters his leg, Sam Johnston buries his dream of being a pilot, becomes a successful contractor instead, and settles into a solitary life of work and routine. Walking with a cane and convinced that no woman in her right mind would ever choose him over an able-bodied man, he has long abandoned thoughts of love and marriage and likes his uneventful life just fine. But then he puts an ad in the paper, Mountain Cottage for Rent, and unwittingly sets himself up for an emotional roller coaster when Sarah Oâ€™Connor, a single mom with a ten year old boy, answers the ad.",
