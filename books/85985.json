  "description": "Rose “Maria McCarthy” Anding was trapped in a life of addiction, crime, sex, violence, and homelessness for over twenty-five years. Her life turned on an axis of High Heels, Honey Lips, and White Powder. During that time, she was raped, robbed, beaten, shot at, and became involved in the infamous drug scandal of Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C.; she was even jailed. After four marriages and decades acting the harlot, leading men astray with her high heel, honeyed lips, and perfumed sheets, Maria hit rock bottom.That is when world-weary Maria McCarthy found herself on the doorstep of a spiritual rehab center. She finally met her Savior and was reintroduced to Rose, the woman God created her to be. Once she'd traded her high heels for a Bible, and her cocaine for a relationship with Jesus, only then could she perform the task God made her do. Mere months after completing drug rehabilitation, Rose was counseling and sharing her story with other women leading similar lifestyles to hers. Because Rose met and fell in love with Jesus, this book is her way of telling everyone that it doesn't matter who you are or what your addiction is; if you feel helpless and alone, Jesus can set you free—just come and fall in love with Jesus!",
