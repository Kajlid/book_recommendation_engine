  "description": "When my job lands me in Dogwood Cove, I have no intention of pretending to be someone I’m not. I especially didn’t intend to fall for a cautious, small-town bookstore owner who brings out a side of me I was convinced no longer existed.We couldn’t be more opposite, but I can’t seem to stay away from her.The problem is, if Paige knew the truth of who I was, how broken I really am, she’d run in the other direction. My emotional scars run deep, the chains of guilt weigh me down.So when the truth comes to light, will I lose the love that has changed me forever?Truth and Temptation is a heartwarming, swoony love story, perfect for readers who enjoy steamy small town romance with a heroine who has no idea what she’s missing in her love life, and a broken alpha hero determined to help her figure it out. Readers who want a dash of angst and a heavy dose of spice, with characters who help heal each other, and grow together as they fall in love with a guaranteed HEA. It is the fourth book in the Dogwood Cove series and can be read as a standalone, although the series is best enjoyed if read in order.",
