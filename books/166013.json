  "description": "I'm his dirty little secret.\n\nI'm the person he can't control.\n\nI'm the woman who caused him to start breaking his rules.\nMorgana Drake may have had a few rough patches in her life, especially when it came to men, but now she is determined to focus on one thing: her job. If she can work hard enough as the assistant to the VP at Mimir, then she has a chance at getting into the Executive Development Program.There is only one thing turning this path of accomplishment into a steep climb, her boss Mr. Payne. Henrik Payne has worked hard to amass his wealth and turn a struggling start up into the third largest online retailer. He has sworn off women, drinking, and anything else that might break his rules for success. It's not until a clumsy yet curvaceous redheaded assistant tests his resolve that he begins to see life isn't all work and no play.  Rules of Payne is the first half of the story inspired by the popular character blog Payne In The Blog. If you like goofy heroines, love-to-hate heroes, and books that cause you to become addicted to cake, then you will love Elizabeth Lynx's humorous, yet steamy take on office romance.***There is a cliffhanger at the end. This is book 1 or a 2 book series.******",
