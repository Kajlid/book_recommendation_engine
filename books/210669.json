Perceived failure to meet that expectation leads to the painful feeling of rejection.Whether being rejected by family members, teachers, coaches, or peers in the classroom, rejected girls become rejected teens become rejected women. Rejection is a seed that, once it takes root, spreads its negative emotions and behaviors in other facets of life. It impacts decisions and life choices.In No Longer A Woman's Journey from Rejection to Freedom , author Janice Broyles highlights several aspects of rejection and takes a look at what it means to be rejected and how isolating it can be. Through inspirational narratives and a study of Biblical accounts of women, connections will be drawn from one circumstance to the next. Women who have experienced heart-wrenching, agonizing rejection will be discussed, along with how God proved to be ever-faithful in every situation.",
