  "description": "Spoiled Christa has never wanted for anything in her life. She drives a brand new Mustang, is head cheerleader, and will graduate valedictorian of her high school class this year. All the boys want to date her and every girl wants to be her—but Christa has been keeping a secret. Her parents divorced over a year ago and her mother re-married over the summer. No one knows that her new stepfather watches her practice her cheers in the yard from the bathroom window, and steals her panties out of the laundry, and watches her get undressed at night—because Christa leaves her door wide open. No one knows how much Christa wants to get back at her parents—or how much she desperately wants to steal her new stepfather right out from her mother’s nose. And spoiled Christa always gets what she wants.",
