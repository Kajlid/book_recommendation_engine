  "description": "Thomas’ life was seemingly perfect. His father was someone he loved and respected, he had a family that cared deeply for him, and he had a friend to whom he could look for guidance. Most perfect of all, Thomas' best friend was also the love of his life, Mary Lyte, who he planned to one day marry. Unfortunately, when Thomas’ father refuses to accept a call from the Prophet and is subsequently excommunicated from the Church, Thomas finds his perfect life suddenly spiraling out of control. Confused at the happenings and torn between following the father he loved and holding on to the life he once had, Thomas makes choices which lead him to suffering. Eventually, he becomes entangled in an evil plan which he does not understand and which he does not expect to escalate into the tragedy it becomes.Unlike Andrews' other works which are intended for general audiences, Raising the Barn is intended for those who enjoy reading LDS religious fiction or who enjoy fiction and have a basic understanding of the LDS religion.",
