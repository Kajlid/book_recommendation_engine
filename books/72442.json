  "description": "A much-loved tale featuring Jacqueline's most popular character.     STRICTLY PRIVATE. KEEP OUT ON PAIN OF DEATH.     I'm Tracy Beaker. I'm 10 years old and 2 months. I live in a children's home. I call it The Dumping Ground. My best friend was Louise but she has gone off with Justine. I don't care though, I expect my mum will come and get me soon anyway. I never cry. Ever. I've done a bit of screaming and stamping in my time mind you... I like eating birthday cake. And any other type of cake. And Smarties and Mars Bars and Big Macs with French fries and strawberry milkshakes. I also like story writing. This is my autobiography. I like that word. There are some really good bits in it. Honest.",
