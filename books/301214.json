Because from the very first moment I met the men I've claimed as my tribe, I knew that I was looking into the faces of monsters.

So I think it’s time I showed the world my claws.I’m sick of people thinking they own me. My Night Keepers and now the members of this twisted club all need to learn a lesson in that.I’m not a doll made to dance to their tune, I’m not a puppet intended to play a part and I’m certainly no plaything to be used and destroyed.

And everyone who wants to stand in my way had better get used to the idea of falling to ruin at my feet.When everything you thought you could rely on is ripped away from you, you have no choice but to find out what you’re truly made of. And deep down in the depths of my soul, I know that I was made to survive.I have suffered through torment, fought against my oppressors and tamed the creatures who tried to bury me in the dark.It’s time that everyone stopped underestimating me.I’m done being a queen without a crown.I’m ready for my coronation.This is a high school bully romance series. Start with book 1 Kings of Quarantine.",
