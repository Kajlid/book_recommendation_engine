  "description": "Bienvenue à la maisonThe song beckons me. Haunting, tragic and utterly lovely. It calls me to a place deep in the Louisiana Bayou, where impossible things creep in the shadows.Following the voice on the wind, I scratch at the blood coating my skin and dance along the swamps with the crickets. Hands caress my arms and lips coax at mine, begging for me to let them inside. Begging me to surrender. Two men...if you can call them men, tell me I'll never leave this place. These lights, this music, this nightmare... It scares me but it thrills me. Enough that I can almost forget about the blood on my skin.My name is Moria Laveau, and I think I've done something very, very wrong.This is a standalone dark ménage romance. This is a why choose book, in which the MC does not have to choose between two love interests. Not suitable for anyone under the age of 18 due to extreme violence, depictions of death, graphic sex and references to triggering subjects.",
