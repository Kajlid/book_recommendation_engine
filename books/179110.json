  "description": "In 1939, as World War 2 began, a Jew named Analiese Baldwin is rescued from an explosion by a German soldier. She has only his dog tag to remember him by. Now, four years later, she is rounded up like all the other Jews to be placed in a cruel concentration camp. Cruelty is not unfamiliar, though. While she can’t remember her past, she knows it is not one worth remembering. It is not full of love or happiness because Jews can’t find love or have happiness. Yet, little does she know that the place where she loses it all will be the very same place where she finds everything.",
