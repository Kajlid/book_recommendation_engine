  "description": "\"Aurora Award finalist for Best Young Adult Novel (2023) Black Hole Radio – Ka’Azula!\"Stay tuned for another fantastic episode of Black Hole Radio – Ka’Azula!Fifth-graders Hawk, Matt and Celeste have been given special gifts by the amazing aliens they’ve met so far on their intergalactic adventures. ESP and telekinesis come in handy when they are transported to the racist planet, Ka’Azula, where only blue skin is accepted. They have an action-packed adventure in a matrix-type video game with azulanimals and azulizards and a tricky escape room finale. With help from a sweet, red-skinned alien named Teal, they prove that what counts is not outside skin color but what's on the inside. But does Matt now understand what his father’s family has to endure on Planet Earth?“Friendship, peace, and acceptance are the themes in Black Hole Radio. Even if it doesn’t yet apply to alien races in ‘real-life’ it is still something everyone should strive for in their lives. In a sense, the author wants her readers to apply the same beliefs in love, peace, and friendship that Hawk and Matt [and Celeste] share.”—Entrada Book Review",
