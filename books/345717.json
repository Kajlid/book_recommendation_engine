  "title": "Al Ghazali's Revival Of The Religious Sciences: An Abridgement",
  "description": "Ihya al-'Ulum al-Din (The Revival of the Religious Sciences) is the masterwork of Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE), widely considered as one of the most significant figures in Islamic intellectual history. The widely-praised abridgement by the Syrian scholar Salih Ahmad al-Shami preserves the gist of each chapter without adding anything to the original text, and has retained only those Prophetic reports (ahadith) regarded as authentic, relying on the works of the hadith specialist al-Hafiz al-Iraqi and Murtada al-Zabidi. The abridgement is accompanied by indexes of Qur'anic verses, Prophetic reports and of persons, as well as a general subject index to provide for full and easy referencing. Presented conveniently in a single volume, this first authoritative abridgement in English of al-Ghazali's \"Revival\" will be of broad interest to specialists in classical Islamic Thought as well as to general readers and students.",
