  "description": "The girls from The Heartbreakers are back, and this time, they're looking to fall in love.Raven behaves as if it's okay for her to be applying the code to just anyone, but (not surprisingly), she finds it works best when directed at her kinda-sorta actual boyfriend, whether she's ready to commit to him or not. Alexia needs all the help she can get, because Ben is her first love and she's in way over her head. Sydney's back with longtime boyfriend Drew after a brief-but-terrible breakup, and this time she's determined not to mess things up with him. And Kelly is by herself, not dating anyone at all. Though there is someone she has her eye on.",
