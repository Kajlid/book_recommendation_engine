  "description": "Visit the Okefenokee for a lesson in pursuing goals.LEARNING TO PERSEVEREThe Okefenokee Swamp is home to water lilies and alligators, cinnamon ferns and coachwhip snakes, swamp iris and purple gallinules. It is also home to a green treefrog named Jackson, who has learned that a new brochure is being prepared to draw tourists to the famed wildlife refuge and all its beautiful and beastly inhabitants. Jackson is determined that the diminutive treefrogs will not be left out, and he has a plan.Author Linda Talley's story tells a comic tale of perseverance in the face of obstacles. It takes Jackson on a madcap photo shoot that is also a tour of the three habitats of Okefenokee - the swampy woods, the piney woods, and the sun-drenched marshlands - all captured by artist Andra Chase in glowing watercolor illustrations. Not all problems have easy or speedy solutions. The persistent Jackson demonstrates for young people the rewards of making a plan and sticking with it.",
