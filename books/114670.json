  "description": "As a youth in the middle and late 1990's, it was important to be against something- even if it was yourself. Come relive those angst-ridden times with this reflective look back at one boy's battle against a society that..... really had no problem with him. Rage against the dying of the light with this collection of rambling, free-verse poetry that was to a former generation what angry tweeting is today...... noise signifying nothing.",
