  "description": "Everybody needs a friend, especially kidnappers and cannibals! That's one of the many moral lessons gleaned by Harkheed as he sets off on an journey to kill a bunch of people who tried to kill him and to better understand why his gnarled heart is suddenly so consumed with Sicksack, the adorable little people-eater. There will be friendship. There will be heartache. There will be unicorns. There will be lots of people dying and there will be plenty of laughs. With soul-crushing issues concerning what might be love, possible and quite probable cannibalism, a cat, a stolen sandwich and a man who shouldâ€™ve stayed home and cried himself to sleep instead, this ghastly tale will surely haunt you until the day you die. Enjoy! :)Oopsies! is the first booksie in the Whoopsies! five booksie saga! So have yourself a looksie and don't forget to tell any and all friends, strangers, kidnappers and cannibals all about how tickled or ticked this ghastly gem made you!",
