  "description": "Our first meeting was at a nightclub, and it was something straight out of my most romantic fantasies. My ovaries exploded at the sight of the Russian God. And by God, I mean he was ripped, tall, dark, and deadly attractive. There were enough sparks between us to light up a city.Then an explosion blasted through the nightclub, and we got trapped together for three hours, sharing our most personal details... everything but our names. Two years later, our second meeting is the complete opposite of the first. It's clear Misha Petrov, a Russian enforcer for the bratva, despises me. The emotional night we shared meant nothing to him.You see, my family is sworn enemies with the bratva and Italian mafia, which means Misha considers me a threat.I wish I could hate him the way he hates me. But nooo, my stupid heart wants what it wants.Every rough touch from Misha makes my skin tingle.Every low-rumbling threat growled through his clenched teeth has my breath speeding up.We might be sworn enemies, but I can't stop myself from wanting this dangerous man. Then there's the other problem.If I can, by some miracle, get Misha to fall in love with me, we'll only have to face the entire bratva and my family.What could possibly go wrong?
