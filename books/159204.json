  "description": "For three months, Simi Gill gets to do what she loves – train to be a doctor and learn more about medicine. As a bonus, she gets to forget about the shallow boyfriend who dumped her, and worse, who hurt her. Living it up in New York, far from her home in India, she is saved by the delicious Rudy Bhatnagar, not once, but two times in one night! A talented surgeon with a heart of gold, Rudy can’t stop himself from thinking about Simi Gill. He tries very hard - for having had his heart broken before, he’s not sure he can risk it again. But fate has other plans. Thrown together by bizarre circumstances, they survive booze and babysitting with aplomb. Will they realize they’re perfect for each other or will they let precious love slip through their fingers?",
