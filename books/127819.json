Boyfriend.\nCashel Burgess's PR team has come up with a plan to salvage his reputation and show his \"softer\" side by entering him in a Valentine's Day competition to find Australia's Most Romantic Couple. It's so ridiculous it might actually work. The hitch? He doesn't even have a girlfriend. But that's not about to stop him.Thanks to a good-for-nothing ex, gardener Lucy Grant hates Valentine's Day. But when Cash makes her an offer too good to refuse, Lucy finds herself half of the most cynical couple in Australia! The only problem is, when a man fakes it this well, a girl might be tempted to turn fiction into fact.",
