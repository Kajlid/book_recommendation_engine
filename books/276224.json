  "description": "A ruthless executive. A destitute woman. Both on the way up.  Selina Hale is on her way to the top. She's been working towards a boardroom position on the thirteenth floor for her entire career. And no one is going to get in her way. Not her clueless boss, her soon to be ex-wife, and most certainly not the homeless person who has moved into the car park at work. Kate Morgan fell through the cracks in a broken support system and found herself destitute. Determined and strong-willed, she's not about to accept help from a mean business woman who can't even remember the names of her own nephews. As their lives continue to intertwine, they have no choice but to work together and follow each other on their journey up.62,000 words",
