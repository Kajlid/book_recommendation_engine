  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07RJTFXRJOnce upon a time, a girl from our world found a gate to the Faerie realm...  All Isobel wants is a quiet place to read, but apparently that's too much to ask. She only needs to make it through one last summer with her broken family before she can leave for university and get on with her life. At least she has her books and the solitude of the woods.  But there are wolves in these woods.  Caught out in the forest after dark, Isobel is pursued by a disturbingly intelligent pack of wolves. When the grizzly bear who rescues her turns out to be a cursed fae prince, she realizes her life isn’t the only thing in danger. She could lose her heart.  Trapped by the wolves at the prince’s home in Faerie, Isobel tries to unravel the mystery behind the surly prince’s scars. Because time is running out for the castle’s inhabitants, and if Isobel can’t find a way to break the spell and save the prince from the Unseelie Queen, she may lose everything she’s come to love.   If you love magic, adventure, and a clean romance, try The Rose Gate. This is a stand-alone story that kicks off the Faerie Tale Romances series  ** The e-book edition does not include the illustrations done for the paperback edition**",
