Both men are killed in a car accident, leaving him no answers, no closure. No chance to say, \"I hate you,\" or \"I love you,\" and not sure which he'd have said if given the chance. Now, Brian's running away from home. Just running, without a plan or a destination.Tobias Red Hawk is a Park Ranger in Montana, where being out of the closet still seems like a dream. After saving the life of blatantly gay and thoroughly attractive Brian, he begins to question his conviction of staying secretly gay. But before he can face his own identity crisis, there is a mystery to be solved at the top of the Bitterroot mountain range and the answers may lie in the myths of his childhood. And when Hawk’s past returns to kill him, both men discover there’s nothing like facing death up close to make a man find his survival instinct.",
