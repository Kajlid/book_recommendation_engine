  "description": "Wicked Christmas is the 8th and last book in USA Today Bestselling Author, Carole Mortimer’s, all Amazon #1 Regency Sinners series. It is also her 240th published book.  Author’s Note: The 8th book in the series promises to be just as steaming hot as the previous ones—after all, there will be SEVEN red-hot heroes, all intent on enjoying the Christmas Season of 1816 with their equally passionate wives.  The Sinners have all gathered in Kent at the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Stonewell, and the house is full of adults and children enjoying a time of joy and happiness, but most of all peace, following all they suffered through together the previous year.  But peace has never been something the Sinners have been able to enjoy for very long, and in amongst falling in love, marrying, and having their children, they had forgotten to account for the one person they had believed to be insignificant but who was in fact as much responsible for Napoleon’s escape from Elba the previous year, and the battles and deaths that followed, as the person who was hanged for the crime.  Will the Sinners discover their mistake in time or will another one of them suffer the devastation of losing someone they love?",
