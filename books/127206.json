  "description": "When a skinned corpse found in a cemetery rises from the dead, supernatural agents Avi Grissom and Jakob Ender hunt for the killer. But Grissom is more interested in his partner’s mysterious disappearance two years ago and his recent return. Something isn’t right with Ender, and the werewolf in Grissom desperately needs to sniff out what has Ender so tight-lipped while fighting off the desire for the secretive vampire that has only grown during his absence. His quest to solve the murder unearths personal truths of vengeance and death magic, and reveals one of their most notorious enemies.",
