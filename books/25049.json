The author does a wonderful job of telling this story in an understanding, historically accurate, and compelling way.\" - Seira Wilson, Amazon EditorIn 1934, Ruth Harkness had never seen a panda bear.  Not many people in the world had.But soon the young Mrs. Harkness would inherit an expedition from her explorer the hunt for a panda.  She knew that bringing back a panda would be hard. Impossible, even.  But she intended to try.So she went to China, where she found a guide, built traps, gathered supplies, and had explorers' clothes made—unheard of for a woman in those days.  Then she set out up the Yangtze River and into the wilderness.  What she discovered would awe an adorable baby panda she named Su Lin, which means \"a little bit of something very cute.\"With breathtaking illustrations from Caldecott Honor artist Melissa Sweet, this little-known true story shares the tale of an adventurous woman who was bold and brave—and the unforgettable journey that helped shape American attitudes toward wildlife.",
