  "title": "The Grinning Dog",
  "description": "The Grinning Dog is a tale of many facets. It is an edge of the seat thriller and a black comedy, but also in two completely different ways a love story. As the title suggests it is about the love one man, John, has for his dog, Molly. It is also, however, about what happens when his new human love interest and her cat move in and try to come between them. How far will a man go to protect his friendship with his four legged friend? The story of John and his dog does, however, impact on a great many other people. The plot continually diverges and converges back again as the intertwined lives of the characters play out with sometimes shocking but more often hysterical consequences. Extra marital affairs, regret, fraudulent behaviour and murder all form part of the plot as the story unfolds, but so do heartbreak and romance as well as a bit of good old fashioned timely coincidence. The Grinning Dog is available in paperback or ebook from Amazonhttp://www.amazon.com/Mr-Ed-Halliday/...",
