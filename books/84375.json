  "description": "Winner of the Golden Quill Best First Book Contest,  the Holt Medallion for Best Mainstream/Single Title and the Holt Award of Merit for Best First Book Laura Hayes has been acting since she was an infant, making Hollywood the only home she has ever known. But when she moves to Pennsylvania's Amish country to film her next movie, she discovers there's more to life than a pair of Jimmy Choos and a Marie Claire cover. Intrigued by the Amish simplicity, she's soon gardening and baking plum pies--and enjoying it. And when her neighbor turns out to be the local heartthrob and a talented furniture maker, she realizes that what's missing from her life might be the love of a good man--not to mention the perfect heirloom tomato. Jacob fights the urge to question the teachings of his Amish beliefs--despite his desire to create furniture that is beautiful as well as useful--and struggles with his longing for the sexy stranger who makes him feel truly alive for the first time. As his attraction grows, so do his doubts, until he's forced to face temptation and decide once and for all what is truly worth the fight.",
