  "description": "Though she was freed from prison, a new danger awaits.... For months she suffered in Shanghai Prison Number 14. When Mei Lin was released and returned to her life in the rural village of Tanching, she should have been content. She lived at home with her father and grandmother, working in the rice fields and sharing the gospel alongside Liko, her fianc√©. But when a friend invites her to help in an orphanage for the summer, Mei Lin knows that God has given her both the desire and the opportunity to serve him in a new way. Liko, though, fears Mei Lin's return to Shanghai so soon after her incarceration and so soon after his own father died for his faith. But while Mei Lin is away, it is Liko who ends up facing the greater danger, in a form no one expected.... In this sequel to Daughter of China, author C. Hope Flinchbaugh again opens a window on the shocking struggles and inspiring faith of Christians in the Chinese church.",
