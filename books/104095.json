He must support his family, his people. He must provide, protect. The oldest of eight children these drives have been instilled in him, but a new drive threatens all of the others. The first time he went to the Dakota, he went for his mother. He found more than the four deer she had asked for. He found Susan.

She married excitement, adventure and dreams. Her inexperience with men and love made her rush into a life she wanted yet had never expected. It made her stronger. She never developed the love she had expected to with her husband, there had never been time. The man returned back east to fight for the confederacy, to fight for his father. Susan was left in the wilderness of the Dakota. She struggled to survive and eventually learned the skills she needed.The story of their relationship crosses from rural life in the Dakota Territory into the world of the Cheyenne and back again.",
