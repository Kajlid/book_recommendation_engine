  "description": "Why is the moth attracted to the very glow that will kill it? How should an aspiring author write a wrong? A maniacal killer is preying upon a firefighter's family, stripping them from his life: one by one; piece by piece. It took every ounce of energy Lieutenant Gabe McLaughlin possessed in resisting the undertow of a mental breakdown as his best friend, Detective Jeff Spencer, told him the horrific news. And Jeff was fighting the same fight, against the same psychological beast, as he uttered the grisly details: Gabe's mother, Ira McLaughlin, had been butchered to death: Dissected... slowly. Apparently, the killer took pleasure in cutting off appendages- one section at a time- at each of the major joints in the extremities. A tourniquet had been applied preventing massive blood loss... the victim eventually succumbed to shock. As insult to injury, the killer had also etched a note into the victim's torso: \"will U-turn and look the other way, or watch while I kill?\" -KiLLuR A high-octane storyline, fueled with a cutthroat hell-bent on preying for a slice of heaven, U-TURN KiLLuR is the thriller that's bound to burn as the pages turn! Lil' devils sport such a wicked grin. U-TURN KiLLuR... KiLLuR THRiLLuR.",
