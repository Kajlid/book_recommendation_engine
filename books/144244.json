  "description": "During Prohibition in 1920s Galveston, the Island was called the \"Free State of Galveston\" due to its lax laws and laissez faire attitude toward gambling, girls and bootlegging. Young society reporter Jasmine (Jazz) Cross longs to cover hard news, but she's stuck between two clashing the world of gossip and glamour vs. gangsters and gamblers.  After Downtown Gang leader Johnny Jack Nounes is released from jail, all hell breaks Prohibition Agent James Burton’s life is threatened and he must go into hiding for his own safety. But when he’s framed for murder, he and Jazz must work together to prove his innocence. Johnny Jack blames Jasmine’s half-brother Sammy Cook, owner of the Oasis speakeasy, for his arrest and forces him to work overtime in a variety of dangerous mob jobs as punishment.  When a bookie is murdered, Jazz looks for clues linking the two murders and delves deeper into the underworld of poker games, slot machines and horse-racing. Meanwhile, Jazz tries to keep both Burton and her brother safe, and alive, while they face off against a common enemy.",
