  "title": "Otto Dix",
  "description": "This generously illustrated monograph on Otto Dix presents the work of the controversial German artist renowned for his unflinching portrayal of life during war time and the aftermath of violence. The celebrated German artist Otto Dix, a volunteer for the German army during World War I, went on to create some of the most powerful anti-war images of the modern age. His work also includes unsettling depictions of civilian life in the Weimar Republic following World War I. This book examines every aspect of Dix's career, from his expressionist work to his gradual embrace of classically influenced realism. Though many of Dix's works were destroyed under the Third Reich, a number of his rarely seen landscapes from that era as well as later works of religious allegory are included here.",
