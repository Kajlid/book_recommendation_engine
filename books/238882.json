  "description": "In the first novel of the American Parable series, Christian Sterling has cultivated a work of unparalleled excitement, tension, and storytelling. Ashes and Embers takes us to a world of warfare, calamity, humor, and romance in a way you have never read before. The time marks a new era of American democracy, and gangs hold as much power as the politicians and police. In spite of a corrupt establishment, these criminal organizations thrive as leaders of their communities. Tensions begin to stir in the Southern and Midwest United States, igniting a bloodied frenzy fueled by racial hatred and struggles for power. The countryâ€™s three largest gangs, The Revelators, DC-2, and The Young Guns strive for dominance, vengeance, and peace amid romantic entanglements and personal journeys for moral enlightenment. The leaders of these gangs walk the line of rising above all they oppose without becoming everything they stand against. Enemies make themselves present, others hide in the shadows, and some appear as friends in this story of gangs led by veterans, technical geniuses, and ascending sons.Passion, tragedy, and heartache cascade through this tale of endless enthrallment from its first pages to its last, for every type of literary exhilaration is found within American Parable: Ashes and Embers.",
