Wrong.For Lincoln Hollis, this is his world, and there isn’t a clapperboard in sight. A trained killer and advocate of justice, he’s been sent to unravel the neat little bow tied around Kate Fletcher’s perfect life, exposing her to the brutal truths she’s been so meticulously shielded from, before delivering the ultimate punishment for her family’s sins. There’s just one problem. They’re his family’s sins, too, and he must make a choice. Who will he say goodbye to first?(Not suitable for readers under the age of 18, due to language, violence, and sexual content)",
