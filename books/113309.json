  "description": "This is a rewrite of a book, I wrote some eight years ago. Due to mass interest, I have published it again, and also have written a sequel. A normally mild mannered man becomes the most notorious serial killer of modern times. Billy Woods unconsciously murders the daughter of a local gangster and he is pursued across Turkey and Crete by the vengeful family and the police. Ruth Vickers, a detective with CID becomes infatuated with catching Woods and joins the manhunt. A brutally, blood curdling read that is a guaranteed page turner.",
