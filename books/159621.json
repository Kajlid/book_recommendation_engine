Determined to keep the struggling farm open, she plans to impress the museum's wealthy benefactress, Cynthia Cherry, with a Civil War reenactment on the farm's grounds.Unfortunately, the first shot in the battle isn't from a period soldier. It's from Cynthia's greedy nephew, Maxwell, who fires a threat at Kelsey to cut the museum's funding. The next morning, things go from bad to worse when Kelsey discovers Maxwell dead. Now Kelsey is the police's number one suspect, and she must start her own investigation to save Barton Farm . . . and herself.",
