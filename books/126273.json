  "description": "Shannon Kelly’s life has been anything but typical. Her life has been altered viciously at the hands of others twice. However horrible they have been, it’s these changes that have given her a family and career…now possibly love. The last thirteen years she has been supported and loved by her protector, her entertainer, and her comforter, but never a lover. When Dylan Kellerman enters Shannon’s life he changes its course in more ways than one. He gives her hope and promise of a future she was convinced wasn’t attainable. Just as she begins to believe she has finally turned her life into something she can build a future on…blackness takes over.",
