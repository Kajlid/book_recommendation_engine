  "description": "The boundaries of time and reality can stretch in surprising ways. And, even those closest to you may not be what they appear to be.Atrocity, deception, bravery, commitment... all combine in the small, southern town of Glendylan, awaiting Thomas MacLachlan. His colleague has been murdered, and he's come to find out why. As he investigates the crime, Thomas finds an abiding darkness of intimidation, violence, and continuing vestiges of slave days thought long gone. But these entwine with a century-old mystery, shaping the cryptic mentality of the only people who can lead him to the answers he seeks. Help comes to Thomas from the past and present alike, as the town's most hidden secret is brought to light, and a long-delayed judgment is brought to its people.",
