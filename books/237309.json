  "description": "Over cocktails an executive describes to a friend the disturbing history of a strangely potent guardian angel. A young mom tries to perfect and prolong her daughter's childhood with obsessive parenting. A critic's petty denouncement of an ingEnue's performance leads to a theatrical night of reckoning. A cult member makes nice for a parole board hearing years after committing an infamous crime.A multiple Shirley Jackson Award nominee, S.P. Miskowski serves up an uncompromising collection of thirteen modern tales of desire and self-destruction. \nStrange is the Night\n offers further proof that Miskowski is--as Black Static book reviewer Peter Tennant notes--\"one of the most interesting and original writers to emerge in recent years.\"Every story showcases Miskowski’s versatility and gift with prose and taps into a dark, writhing undercurrent of palpable unease beneath the mundanity of everyday life.”- Publishers Weekly starred review",
