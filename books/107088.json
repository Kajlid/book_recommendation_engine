  "description": "Book Three of the #1 Amazon bestselling Seasons of the Heart Series. Recurring characters appear in the #1 Amazon short story Here in My Heart , and in Let Me Love You Again , the heartwarming second book in the Echoes of the Heart series. Law Beaumont and Kristen Hemmings have watched each other from a distance for years. But Law, a bartender with a bad-boy past, and Kristen, an assistant principal devoted to helping her community, couldn’t seem more different. When they unite to mentor a young foster child and to help Law’s troubled daughter through the aftermath of her parents’ ugly divorce, their attraction deepens. They face the undeniable connection between them, and a whirlwind of challenges they can only conquer together. A stirring love story and a candid look at the complexities of divorce, substance abuse, and our country’s foster care system, Love on Mimosa Lane is a love song to an entire community, and a novel about the power of family―the family you’ve been given, the one you’ve chosen, and the one that can lift you up, even when the world is tearing you down.",
