  "title": "Killing Time in Saudi Arabia: An American Experience",
  "description": "In the immediate aftermath of the attack on Iraq in 2003, the Saudi Arabian peninsula erupted with an armed insurrection that was kept hidden from an indifferent world. It was because of the killing and terror in Saudi Arabia, that it was still possible for the author to find romance with a beautiful South African nurse in this non-fiction story of loss, love and survival. You will find an amazing story about survival, friendship and maintaining a sense of normalcy in a world that is anything but. From the first word to the last, Killing Time in Saudi Arabia is a way to travel Middle East fashion and learn about the Arab Culture and Saudi Arabia in the face of adversity. It is about who you can really trust in the Middle East, and who you can't.",
