  "description": "Julian Sayarer grew up riding a bicycle and worked as a bike courier in London. When the world record for a circumnavigation by bike is broken—the biker riding in conjunction with banks and big business—Julian sets out to take it back. This is his story of that record, riding 110 miles a day for six months on only £7.82 a day, through jungles, snow, and twenty different countries. He finds himself stranded without money in the deserts of Kazakhstan, bitten by a dog in North Carolina, and sleeping under motorway bridges in China. Taken by life on the road and a spirit of adventure, he loves every minute of it. A tale of excitement and world politics by bicycle, travelling at 12 mph, Julian finds that the Tartars of Central Asia aren’t so different to the trailer families of Louisiana. This book is a reminder that the world is out there, and it’s waiting for us.",
