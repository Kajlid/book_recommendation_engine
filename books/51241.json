  "title": "Chloe Does Yale",
  "description": "Go back to college with Natalie Krinsky in this frothy, first novel from the sex columnist for the Yale Daily News , now in paperback Chloe Carrington is a typical Yale student, except that along with toiling through the usual grind of coursework, she pens a notorious and much dished-over sex column for the campus newspaper. This touch of scandal has wrought havoc on her social and love life, turning it into an open book. Chloe doesnt help matters much; she likes to share, and cant resist divulging the gory details of her most recent date (or lack thereof) in her column, baring her soul, and sometimes the souls of others, for all to see. And that's where the trouble begins. As Chloe probes the campus hot spots, we get a peek at what goes on behind the Ivy League's dormitory doors -- from drinking at Toad's, to Exotic Erotic, Yale's answer to a Playboy mansion bash, complete with coeds in skimpy bikinis and a lacrosse team clad only in socks. Of course there's perhaps the most favorite extracurricular activity -- lots and lots of sex. Teeming with exuberance and late-night shenanigans, Chloe Does Yale is filled with humor and candor about typical college situations, both inside and outside the dorm rooms.",
