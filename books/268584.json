  "description": "Susan Sinclair has it great job, great apartment -- and on some days she even manages great hair. She doesn't have a great man, but she's far too successful to have time for one. The she gets a frantic summons to return to where it all began -- Copper Creek, her home in Michigan -- only to discover that her grown daughter has followed in her not-so-proud footsteps by getting pregnant without getting married and her widowed mom seems to be scandalously juggling more men then she can count ... And, worst of all, he's still there -- Jon Laker -- still the man most likely to drive her crazy. So she marches into his business and declares she's there to discuss their daughter -- and nothing else. After all, she made her choices a long time ago ... but hours later -- after not doing very much talking at all -- Susan realizes that seeing Jon has turned her well-ordered world upside down. And Jon -- plus mom and daughter -- means it's going to be a long, hot summer in this small, small town.",
