  "title": "My Best Friend's Brother",
  "description": "We used to call ourselves The Three Musketeers. I know it's clich√©, but we were only kids. They usually took turns being in charge, which was fine with me. I was just happy to go along with them. After all, I thought I was the luckiest little girl in the whole world. Most of my classmates only had one best friend, but I had two: my best friend Izzy and her twin brother. Back then, I hoped things would never change, but that's the problem with more. Once I saw a glimpse of it, it was impossible to stop wanting it. Especially when it came to Shane. **This standalone best friend romance has no cheating, no cliffhangers, and is intended for a mature audience.",
