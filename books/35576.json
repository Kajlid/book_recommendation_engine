  "description": "Book two of The Outcast Chronicles; the thrilling story of Imoshen, Tobazim, Ronnyn and Aravelle, continues. The Outcast Chronicles follows the fate of a tribe of dispossessed mystics. Vastly outnumbered by people without magical abilities, they are persecuted because ordinary people fear their gifts. This persecution culminates in a bloody pogrom sanctioned by the king who lays siege to the Celestial City, last bastion of the mystics. When the city falls, the mystic leader negotiates their surrender and her people are exiled from their homeland.      King Chald has banished the mystics. Their leader, Imoshen, hopes to find a new home for her people but first, they must reach port. Fearing they will be waylaid, robbed and murdered, Imoshen offers a reward for living mystics.      When he arrives in port, Tobazim discovers the mystics’ ships have been stolen and merchants are charging exorbitant prices for supplies. Meanwhile, Ronnyn and his family are kidnapped by fishermen eager for the reward.      Whether the ships are ready or not, on the first day of winter all the mystics must leave. Those who remain behind will be hunted down and executed. Time is running out for Imoshen, Tobazim, and the children.",
