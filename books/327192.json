He’s already put his family in danger and it’s time he faces the dark destiny that awaits him. He has so many regrets, but none as powerful as the day he met Camel. The alpha’s kisses are torture and his touches are a poison that make Fulton want what doesn’t belong to him.Fulton is jealous of a man he hasn’t met, a man he’ll never meet if he dies attempting to take back his future.
