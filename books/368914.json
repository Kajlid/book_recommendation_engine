For each of them, the night meant something different: It was a chance to be beautiful—or dangerous; it was a time to reveal a secret, to even a score, or to fall in love.Of course their paths crossed. And for some, their dreams came true. But none of them could have guessed the surprises the night would hold—surprises that would change their lives. Because for Beth, Anne, Molly, Emily, and Kip, nothing would be the same after Saturday Night.",
