  "description": "***THIS IS THE SEQUEL TO THE RAIN***  Tanner and Dusty and Ernest and Voley stare out at the lead of brown foam. Russell and Clemmy should have been back days ago. And now it's come to a choice--to go in and follow them, or to continue south in the hope of better weather. Ernest's thermometer is recording temperatures he hasn't seen since before the rain started, and there's something strange in the distant mountains. A splotch of white.  They must decide whether to push in, with strange and treacherous seas, or move on. And no one wants to make the final say. But Tanner knows in her heart she cannot abandon Russell. They must go in--attempt to find them, and what became of their journey into Leadville.",
