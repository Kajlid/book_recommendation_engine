  "description": "As one of the main characters, the intellectual Juan, puts it: to one person the City might appear as Paris, to another it might be where one goes upon getting out of bed in Barcelona; to another it might appear as a beer hall in Oslo. This cityscape, as Carlos Fuentes describes it, \"seems drawn up by the Marx Brothers with an assist from Bela Lugosi!\" It is the meeting place for a wild assortment of bohemians in a novel described by The New York Times as \"Deeply touching, enjoyable, beautifully written and fascinatingly mysterious.\" Library Journal has said 62: A Model Kit is \"a highly satisfying work by one of the most extraordinary writers of our time.\"",
