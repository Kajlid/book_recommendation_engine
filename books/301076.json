  "description": "Ryder I live for the adrenaline rush. Never once have I not. All my life, it’s been one adventure after another. Now I find myself on the most dangerous one yet. Finding her the way I did; I knew without a doubt I’d claim her as mine. Didn’t matter if she agreed or not. She’d come to my way of thinking sooner or later. Only when the worse kind of rush rears its head, do I find myself conflicted of whether or not to keep my beauty. She is nothing like she seems and I’m not sure she can handle the life I lead. It’s only a matter of time before the fires catch us in their grasps. Will she cave to my demands or will I let her go? The rush of a lifetime is ahead of the both of us.",
