  "description": "The classic novel by an iconic Finnish author, a finalist for the World Fantasy Award. a city like no other, populated by talking insects, as observed by the nameless narrator, who is far from home...“The novel contains scenes of startling beauty and strangeness that change how the reader sees the world. Krohn effortlessly melds the literal with the metaphorical, so that the narrator's exploration of the city through its inhabitants encompasses both the speculation of science fiction and the resonant symbolism of the surreal.” - Locus“ Leena Krohn has given us a lens of words through which to consider reality, a microscope to reveal yearning and wonder, a telescope to look for what it means to be human, a window and a mirror and an eye other than our own.” - Matthew Cheney",
