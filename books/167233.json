Then it suddenly spits out Julie's dad—Rapunzel's prince—and things take a seriously enchanted turn. He's gallant, he's handsome, and he's totally clueless about life in the 20th century! (You try teaching a five hundred year old prince how to text message.)When Julie's daring dad dashes off to save a kidnapped Sleeping Beauty, she must embark on a magical cross-country adventure to bring him home, protect the family secret, and while she's at it, save the world! Because if she fails, everyone will spend eternity in a fairy tale.",
