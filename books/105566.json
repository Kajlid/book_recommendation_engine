  "title": "Luna's Heart: A nymph's Heart",
  "description": "I bet you've probably heard about a nymph...or not. Maybe you heard about them in a class back in like fourth grade. Maybe it was in one of those movies that you watch with a box of popcorn. Well their versions are definitely wrong. Movies are a pretty bad source of information when it comes to creatures like us. Nymph's are really beings created with the Earth itself. We are the keepers of earth. After we become of age we reach our maximum power. For ages, Nymph's have shaped the world that it is today. Well, this isn't the other nymph's story, it's mine. Luna's life has been burned to ashes, literally. All of her family except for her brother has died in a horrible fire caused by the narcs, a race of paranormal hunters. For centuries they have killed beings like her, but that was twelve years ago. Now Luna is sixteen and living a normal human life with her older brother, Jay. Of course she can never be really human for she is a half nymph, but she tries. That peaceful life that they've created is shattered when Jay goes on a business trip. Luna faces a new dangerous power, love. She meets Kaden. A narc that is handsome and caring. Together they face an enemy who steals Luna's necklace that keeps her humanity in check, without it she can go insane. Kaden and Luna try to sort out their teenage hormonal selves and the paranormal ones as well. When Sam, their enemy, cuts the necklace he shreds Luna's sanity. It turns her into something that she feared about for years. Can she still love? Can Kaden save her?",
