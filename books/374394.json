Scarred in more ways than one and traumatized, he’s trying to settle into a new life with the family he never knew he had.

Even though his siblings claim to care about him, Noah feels that because of his haunted past, he’s unworthy of their devotion.Only one thing brings him any sense happiness, a tiger shifter named Seth. The problem is, Seth is the complete opposite of Noah. A soldier in every sense of the word, he’s strong, sexy and honorable. Noah knows the other man is out of his league, so he vows to keep his feelings a secret.Then one day Seth offers to help Noah learn how to defend himself. Even though Noah knows he should refuse, he agrees. His driving need to not be weak anymore and his deep feelings for Seth make the temptation too much to resist.
