  "description": "What if your perfectly contented life was suddenly turned upside down and you were forced to face a decision you never imagined you’d have to? Ariane Reis has a husband who loves her, a young son and a cosy family routine. When she starts a new job in the heart of London, she has no idea she is about to embark on a scorching sensory journey of eroticism and self-discovery that will irrevocably alter her life. Luka Volkov is a smart and unnervingly intense Russian on her team. He is young, sharp and insatiable. He doesn’t just seduce her body. He seduces her mind and the very essence of her being. Despite the emotional angst she finds herself in, Ariane must fight to get through the impossible task of untangling love from lust, or risk losing everything she holds dear. The problem is - not everything is black and white.  A story both delightful and heartbreaking about regular people in unanticipated circumstances.  Warning: This book contains explicit sex scenes and should not be read by people under 18.",
