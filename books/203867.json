Although she has the blonde bombshell looks to attract a sugar daddy, she’s not the gold digger Lucas accused her of being. Her mom might have lured his dad into marriage before their untimely death, but Jade is focused on making it on her own.Now they’re permanently connected by their parent’s marriage, the terms of his dad’s will—and the fact that Jade is carrying her step-brother's baby.",
