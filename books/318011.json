  "description": "A woman learns the hard way about mixing business with pleasure in this hilarious new romantic comedy by USA Today bestselling author Sharon C. Cooper.\nI am beautiful. I am confident. I am lovable. I am a lottery winner.This is the mantra that will get Dreamy Daniels through each day until she makes it big. So what if she lives in a seedy part of Los Angeles in a house that's one earthquake away from crumbling, or works an unfulfilling secretarial job while struggling to finish her bachelor's degree? All Dreamy needs to do is win the lottery, which she's been entering in as a weekly tradition with her grandfather. When she catches the attention of her boss's potential investor, Dreamy has to remind herself to focus on her career goals so she can be her own boss. Who cares if he has the social grace of the Duke of Sussex and the suaveness of Idris Elba? No distractions allowed.Growing up with a father who is an A-list actor and a socialite mother, venture capitalist Karter Redford lives in the world of the rich and famous. Instead of attending movie premieres, however, he prefers spending his time helping the less fortunate, backing start-up companies and investing in cutting edge ideas. Karter is used to his life revolving around work, but when he decides he wants someone to share it with, he falls for someone his mother would never approve of: hilarious, quirky Dreamy, who has goals of her own...but also isn't a wealthy, upper-crust socialite. Though it's clear they're from different worlds, their relationship might just be his greatest investment yet.",
