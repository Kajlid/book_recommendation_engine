Her keys, purse, and shoes all remained with the badly damaged vehicle she drove. But there was no trace of Kim or her body, just a vicious looking pinecone drenched in her blood. Had she been murdered? And if she had, who would want her dead? Only through one disturbing dream that leads to the Letters will they discover the truth.",
