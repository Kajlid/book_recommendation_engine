Old friendships will break her heart as her past and present clash with tragic results.  While Faith faces the memories of her shattered childhood and the Faircloughs play games with her future. Will she be strong enough to stand firm and not run? When her ultimate challenge arrives Faith will need to decide what sort of woman she wants to be. Will she remember the promises made with gold before her tears run free forever.",
