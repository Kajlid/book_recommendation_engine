  "description": "Daniel’s got everything figured out. He makes a good living as an artist ... mostly through offering \"private shows\" to the wives of local wealthy businessmen. He never stops playing the game and never lets anyone touch his heart. But when his current fling offers him a few hundred an hour for art lessons for her reclusive, college-dropout daughter, Daniel finds himself forgetting his own rules. The girl is rude. Insulting. Incredible.And she sees straight through him.Stella is hiding from the world, not because she wants to, but because crippling panic attacks await her every time she tries to live a normal life. She's determined to push everyone--including her handsome new art teacher—away. But Daniel makes it utterly impossible. The guy is irritating. Mocking. Magnetic.And makes her want things she knows she can never have.What starts as a battle of wills turns into passion, where giving in means facing the things that scare them most.",
