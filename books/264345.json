  "description": "From the author of Ricochet and Backfire, comes the final book in the dark and gritty Vigilantes world ...  Ballistic is a delicious twisty, dark and unputdownable book. Keri has ended this series of standalone books with a BALLISTIC bang. -Kathy Coopmans, USA Today Bestselling Author  A life for a life. On the streets of Detroit, it’s the code we live by. You take from me, I take from you. A balance of power, and a ceaseless war between rivals. As a foster kid from the projects, I never had much, besides an unshakable addiction to women and drugs. Only took one glance into the amber eyes of a slave for me to realize my two worst vices could be one and the same. And the woman behind those eyes quickly became my obsession. Nicoleta is more than she seems. An enigma I’m determined to crack before time runs out and our enemies hunt her down. Except, she moves by her own trajectory, an unstoppable bullet on the warpath to track down the men who murdered a girl from her past. Me? I’m the rogue whose path is less predictable. A junkie, fiending for the one thing I shouldn’t want: the only woman who gets me high. I want to keep her for myself, but when the unstoppable bullet finally hits her mark and secrets begin to unravel, another life must be paid. A heart for a heart.  ***BALLISTIC can be read as a complete standalone.  Other Books In This Series: RICOCHET BACKFIRE INTREPID",
