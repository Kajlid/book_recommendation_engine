The fallen hero was determined to drown out the ghosts of war with an unrelenting path of self-destruction. He had no plans to set foot in his hometown of West Bend, Colorado ever again. Until the Inferno MC betrayed him. Now, there's nowhere left for him to run, except back to his father's ranch. Where he would come face to face with her. June Barton. The Navy surgeon was his first love, but now she's all grown up. She gave up her scalpel to return home, tired of losing her patients to war. All she wants is peace and quiet, but when Axe shows up, he turns everything upside down. Can two broken and damaged people get a second chance at happiness? And when the Inferno MC commits the ultimate betrayal, will Axe's need for vengeance destroy his soul - or could June be his salvation? This is a standalone full-length novel with a HEA and no cheating! The series can be read in any order, although it is recommended to start with book one, Taming Blaze, in order to understand the club dynamics.",
