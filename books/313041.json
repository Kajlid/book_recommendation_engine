  "title": "Mother Mary is Here!: Spiritual Photography",
  "description": "I began doing photography roughly five years ago after witnessing spiritual visions in the clouds. It expanded to other places like a brick wall, rug, bathwater, sand on a car mat, pours from drinks on the ground, eggs cooking, pancakes, toast, etc.Many times I had been given the 'heads up' beforehand to ready. I know they are His Grace that's been given to me as His works to report to the world. I hope they find an interested audience.The cover is of Mother Mary appearing on the carpet in our kitchen. Signs were given to me of Cistene chapels ceiling of God touching man two days prior to it appearing. That sign that I received at church was followed by a lady with a rosary on her hand who I met casually and I could tell by her glance that she witnessed my vision... the next day I saw it move from were she and I met over to our kitchen area and that's when it was discovered. Simultaneously my Brother returned came into the house and brought a DVD entitled Genesis- When In Rome. At the start they pan the skyline and show the Vatican. Swear to God.The book (second in collection) also co gains what I feel is a picture of Michael's face as well as what may be the face of God. Captured together. There is also a Buddha made from my Brother tracking sand into my car mat from the beach.My own mothers face is also there on a wooden floor. My Fathers name for me 'Ace' is somewhere in my collection of over 600 pictures as well. Jesus Is Here! is the first of the collection. Enjoy!",
