  "title": "Revelation Was Wrong",
  "description": "When a drunken prophet in Scotland's roughest town predicts a coming Apocalypse, no one takes much notice. After all, not even one of his previous prognostications has come true. But five days later, events appear to be unfolding exactly as prophesied. A certain tonic wine - infamous for its ability to bring on berserk violence - plays a pivotal role in proceedings, as do two otherworldly visitors.Loaded with humour and incisive social commentary, this work of short fiction paints a truer picture of contemporary Scottish culture than any guide book ever has. Like our whiskies, it comes with a kick.",
