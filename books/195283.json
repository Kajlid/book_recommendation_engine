  "description": "Zach Johnson went looking for a little bit of adventure before heading to graduate school in a new place. Rocky Mountain National Park seemed just the ticket and as good a place as any. Stumbling into a ranger talk, he meets Park Ranger Ryan Jenkins expert on pine trees and alluring with his friendly smiles and lingering handshakes. Not to mention he looks pretty sexy in the green and gray.At first, Zach can’t tell if he’s just being friendly or perhaps it’s something more and a hike through the rain just makes him more curious. An invite to Ryan’s cabin to watch the Perseid meteor shower is the last straw, he has to know. What he finds in the woods is more than he though and goes to show that wishing on stars might be more worth it than he ever thought.This story is also included in Love in Uniform Anthology.",
