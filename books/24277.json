  "description": "I couldn’t resist putting together all those little ideas that have popped into my mind then out onto paper as the years have flown. Most have fallen by the wayside into the bin of ‘of my’ but some stayed and here they are. These pieces have also tested my abilities and certainly stretched my brain towards a variety of genres, styles and ways of looking at the world and the people in it.From comedy to a touch of horror, romance, fantasy and fun to solemn, and maybe some things in between – I’ve had a go.Hope you like this collection – how could I help but indulge; like that first piece of dark chocolate and sip of rich, steaming coffee, while snuggling with my soul mate on a freezing winter’s night?Enjoy.",
