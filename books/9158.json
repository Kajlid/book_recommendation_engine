Things take a turn for the worse when James makes it clear he wants to go dancing at one of the gay clubs the city has to offer. Patrick not only doesn't want to go, he doesn't even want to be spotted in the neighborhood. Will they be able to salvage the unexpectedly gone-wrong evening, or should they stick to getting together via web-cam?",
