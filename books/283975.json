  "title": "Tucker",
  "description": "*Note from Author* This can be a stand alone book, but would be better if read after both the Texas Knights MC books and the Texas Kings MC books. After a hard childhood and a long stint in prison for his mistakes, Tucker Martin is learning how to live a new life, surrounded by his new brothers in The Texas Kings MC. Life has taught him quite a few lessons though, and one of those lessons is to never show weakness. As much as he wants to belong, he can't do that until he bares it all to his new brothers in the club. As hard as it is for him, he has to know that they will be there at his back, supporting him through it all. Drea Dawson grew up around both the Texas Knights MC and the Texas Kings MC, and is considered family to the brothers in both clubs. Her smart mouth and fierce loyalty are appreciated by her friends, and through the years they have helped her deal with the problems she has in her family life. When Tucker and Drea get together, they have to learn to trust themselves at the same time they are learning to trust each other. Through highs and lows, and shocking revelations, Tucker and Drea find out that they are stronger side by side than they ever were apart.",
