  "description": "We have all heard of women expressing fear regarding moving into a sales “Oh, I could never be in sales.” Many of us are, or have been, in administrative and service roles where we’ve won and supported the sale only to watch someone else take the credit. Others of us have gone through divorces, single parenthood, and the economic hell that has catapulted us out of our fear and into a place of career action. We all sell in one way or another. We sell to our friends, peers, and customers—directly and indirectly—in any business setting. Written by a professional salesperson, sales director, and coach, this book is aimed at helping women who feel apprehensive about moving into a sales role, or businesswomen who would like techniques and tools to improve their sales confidence. It is a sales methodology written for women as a response to the vast majority that were written by male authors, and historically, for male salespeople. The Authentic Sale is about empowering women through coaching and traditional sales techniques and by building upon their authentic behavioral styles. Her goal is to show every woman that she can become a Sales Goddess in all circumstances.",
