  "description": "Imogen was four the first time it happened. As she flipped through her grandma's dusty photo album gazing into the faded, monochrome faces of her grandma's somber family--relatives with funny names like Aunt Ada and Uncle Paul and Aunt Phyllis and Uncle Gordy, and second cousins Percy and Viola from Missoula--suddenly, the universe tilted, and for a brief instant Imogen found herself inside of one of the pictures.One of only a handful of individuals who can time travel through photos, she establishes an investigative business to help people recover lost items and unearth the stories and secrets of friends and relatives from the past.Step into time with Imogen Oliver in this first book in the Time Tourists Trilogy as she investigates a teenage girl who disappeared to 1967 San Francisco with her boyfriend, then journeys back to 1912 to locate a set of missing stereoscopic glass plates that hold a curious connection to her own life.",
