  "title": "Positively Conflicted: Engaging with Courage, Compassion, and Wisdom in a Combative World",
  "description": "Most of us have a messy relationship with conflict. When confronted with it, our fight-or-flight response kicks in and we either rush into battle or back away. By defaulting to one of these options, however, we risk damaging ties to people we care about, opening ourselves up to future retaliation, or allowing resentments to fester.Positively Conflicted invites us to reexamine our instinctive and often destructive reactions to conflict. With decades of experience in mediation, Sam Ardery doesn’t offer advice on how to win every fight, nor does he promise a one-size-fits-all solution to complex issues that defy them. Instead, he presents a different perspective—one that enables us to engage with conflict in novel and courageous ways. Readers will learn to ...Reconsider preconceived notions about fairnessListen—really listenRespond in counterintuitive waysSelf-advocate without being combativeFull of stories from the author’s own life and the mediations he’s facilitated, Positively Conflicted shows us how conflict can be productive—even nourishing—when approached with curiosity, kindness, and openness.",
