  "description": "John Caldigate (1879) possesses in abundance the virtues of Trollope's an engrossing story told by a worldly-wise, kindly, fair-minded narrator, and a tale strong on what Trollope claimed as the leading feature of his novels, \"real\" characters. But John Caldigate has some strikingand distinctive calls on the reader's Australian gold-mining scenes, the prominence given to matters of law and a criminal trial, and the stronger than usual attack on religious fanaticism. Moreover, the main character is accused of and standing trial for bigamy on the testimony of hisformer mistress.",
