  "title": "A Maine Christmas Carol",
  "description": "A Maine Christmas Carol is more than a retelling of the Dickens classic.Set in Hallowell, Maine we find old Scrooge replaced by 16 year old TJ. Having lost his father in Iraq, TJ has turned to drugs in an attempt to cope with a world that he feels has spun out of control. TJ alienates himself from his family and friends and his father returns in spirit, like Bob Marley of old, in an attempt to steer his son from the path of self-destruction. As one reviewer says of the novel, \"In the guise of the well-loved tale it reminds us of the effects of modern life-its drugs, wars and poverty-on its people. It gives us the hope and optimism that is much needed in our contemporary world.\"",
