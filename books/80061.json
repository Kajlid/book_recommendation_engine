  "description": "There's something strange going on at Washington Irving Elementary School. Kids are turning into monsters―literally!Angie knows freaky things happen sometimes. After all, it wasn't so long ago that her younger brother, Sebastian, turned into a vampire. But she wasn't at all prepared to become an unwilling witch! Now Angie has to figure out how to pass the power along to the right person―before it lands in the hands of the wrong person….With its blend of humor and horror, The Unwilling Witch will appeal to the same audience that has made David Lubar's Weenies short story collections such a success.",
