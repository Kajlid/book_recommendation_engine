  "description": "This is the bestselling story of Eric, a boy with leukemia who refused to give up livingas told by the person who was with him through it all, his mother.      Eric was seventeen when he heard the doctor's verdict about the disease that wanted his life. At first he and his family could not believe it. Eric was the picture of everything a youth should bea champion athlete, a splendid human being, vibrant with energy and loved by all who knew him.     The doctors could promise little. They would do as much as was medically possible. Eric had to do as much as was humanly possible. But if the odds were not good, they were good enough for Eric. Given the choice between life and death, Eric chose to live.",
