  "description": "The full moon is a week away, and although Lydia is as excited as it gets to run as a wolf for the first time, she is also fighting to keep her independence while trying to understand her role in the lives of the three males that have come to rule hers: compassionate, tender Taylor; impetuous, fun-loving Ryan and distant, cold Lawrence.There's also a fourth man in Lydia's life. Brendan, her previous \"friend with benefits\", is tirelessly searching for her. He's about to uncover things that should be kept hidden.However, the testosterone surrounding her is the last thing she should be worrying about. Her family bear truths about her heritage she's not ready to face ... she may not have a choice, because the greatest danger to them all comes from within. The past never stays buried for long, and among the shadows of their species it is rising with a vengeance, threatening to tear their pack apart for good.Notes: Book two of a series - it is highly recommended that book one be read first. This is an adult, paranormal fantasy short novel (over 55,000 words) containing scenes of explicit sexual content and some violence, entwined with romantic elements. (Written in British English.)",
