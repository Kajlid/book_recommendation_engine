  "title": "An American Detective in London",
  "description": "PLEASE NOTE: An American Detective in London contains scenes of an explicit and adult nature. It is not suitable for minors, or those easily offended by violence or graphic sexual content.  An American Detective in London, ostensibly a prelude to a more extensive work, is a gritty and thrilling introduction to the “American detective”. There will be a series of equally action-packed stories to follow as Tom Conrad’s all new/traditional character (an uncompromising cop with his own dark agenda), scratches beneath the shadowy surface of respectability, dishing out his unique brand of justice.  For those familiar with Tom Conrad’s previous work, think Rich Pickings for Ravens, but without the madcap humour, ex-girlfriends... or ghosts.",
