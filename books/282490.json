They call themselves Unusuals and finally, finally, Robert belongs.When a tall figure, immune to their powers, discovers them, the first family that Robert has ever wanted is at risk of being destroyed. The only way to keep themall together is to get his powers under control.But control is a sacrifice he might not be willing to make.",
