  "description": "Feeling dead in her marriage of 22 years, Elizabeth Fairchild, in her young forties, ditches the dream of her seemingly perfect life with her husband in search of who she really is. She had gone from her parents' house to her husband's home and never learned to stand on her own two feet. Her husband, Greg, isn't abusive or cruel, just rather neglectful. Her kids are all out of the house, off to college. Feeling that not much is left for her at home, she leaves her comfortable life in Napa Valley, California in search of her inner fire in New York City. She didn't leave to find another man, but soon finds herself involved with two very different men: Jack Stevens and Kevin Parker.Jack is older than Elizabeth by 9 years. He has heart-stopping good looks, is wildly successful, and very much in control of everything around him - especially Elizabeth. Kevin is younger, by 14 years. He is carefree, has a heart of 24k gold, is a middle school Spanish teacher, and is quite okay with Elizabeth taking the reins.Which dream is really Elizabeth's? Her quiet life in Napa? Or her wild ways in New York?",
