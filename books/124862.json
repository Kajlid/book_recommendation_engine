  "title": "Black Rose, Wilted",
  "description": "Gothic poetry with metaphorical references of things in the realm of dark arts. Edgar Allen Poe was a great inspiration in these macabre writings. Also, much more with poems of life, death, and the ghosts who haunt sanitoriums of Waverly Hills. There is a certain mysticism in this collection of dark gothic poems. Black Rose, Wilted is darker than the previous book black rose with unfortunate deaths of loved ones that impacted the authors feelings at the time. A very moving selection with the doom and gloom and the never ending love of a good horrific gothic romantic collection.",
