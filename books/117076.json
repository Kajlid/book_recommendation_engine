  "description": "The mine called to Cara from deep in the San Juan Mountains, near the town of Silverthread. Surrounded by a murderous tapestry of lies, it had once been rich in ore, overflowing with wealth that could make a family's fortune—or destroy it. But also in its labyrinthine tunnels lay the path to redemption and love, a magic that could draw a woman one hundred years into the past, into the arms of one who could make her life whole. But crossing time was just the beginning. To right wrongs already done, to paint a new future, one brighter and full of love, Cara would have to unravel the mine’s mysteries. She would have to depend upon the rugged man who emerged from its opening and trust his vow to keep her safe and cherish her forever. Then, and only then, would she truly understand the danger—and the power—of the promise.Winner of the Prism Award, the Promise is the third book in Dee Davis’ newly re-released time travel trilogy.",
