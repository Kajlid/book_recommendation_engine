  "description": "With his scientific background, Dr Sami Ashouri took nothing for granted unless substantiated by scientific means. When he first studied the Qur'an, the first question to come to his mind \"How do we know this is not the work of a human being?\" He observed statements, interspersed throughout the book, which drew his attention and carried him on a journey of scientific research and exploration that lasted several years. He presents his findings to the reader in this book wherein he has described modern scientific data with clarity and devoid of any complexity. He takes the reader on interesting journeys through ancient and medieval accounts to show how mankind arrived at modern scientific discoveries. Finally, he draws specific conclusions as to the similarity between these Qur'anic statements and modern day scientific discoveries. Dr. Ashouri then leaves it up to the reader to answer, for his own, the question , \"Could these statements have been made, in the seventh century, by a human being?\" or as differently stated, \"Is the Qur'an God's word? .",
