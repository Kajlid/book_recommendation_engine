The Complete What Ukulele Players Really Want To Know! Barry Maz - creator of the popular Got A Ukulele website brings you over 50 detailed chapters aimed at advising new ukulele players on the things that most tutor books leave out, with everything from how to hold the uke, fingernail care, to basic theory and advice on practice regimes. Want advice on cases, on performing, on types of wood? Look no further. What about electronics, how to tune up, advice on strings - that's covered too. In fact, just about everything a new player will think about is in here. This is NOT a how to play or a song book, but has been called an 'owners manual for new players' -an answer to all those niggling questions that will hit you when you first start playing. Barry recommends that his guides are read alongside traditional tuition (whether you are learning online, from books or with a teacher) as a means to supplement your all round knowledge of the ukulele.
