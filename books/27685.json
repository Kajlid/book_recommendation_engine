  "description": "Excellence in Media “Silver Angel Award”Virginia, the young daughter of a wealthy doctor’s family, sees her life forever altered by the Great Depression. Forced to give up her own room so that relatives can move in, her resentment at those circumstances is altered as she helps her father, who spends his spare time giving medical attention to the people of “Soo City.” Soo City is a makeshift camp near the Soo Line tracks. But her father’s goodwill clashes with powerful people who wish the camp destroyed. The violent strike of workers in the grain mill district brings tragedy to the strikers, and the father is severely wounded while helping the people of Soo City as the police are clearing out the camp. What happens next will astound you!“In this seamless and well-researched narrative, Tatlock provides a compelling look at the Depression through a child’s eyes. At the same time, she accurately conveys the exuberance, naivete, humor and optimism typical of young teens.” --CBA MarketplaceForeign editions in the following Norwegian, DutchNorth Carolina fiction by North Carolina authors.",
