  "title": "Rumpole of the Bailey",
  "description": "These six short stories introduce all the lovable (or not so lovable) characters from the delightful Rumpole series.Horace Rumpole, the irreverent, iconoclastic, claret-swilling, poetry-spouting barrister at law, is among the most beloved characters of English crime literature. He is not a particularly gifted attorney, nor is he particularly fond of the law by courts if it comes to that, but he'd rather be swinging at a case than bowing to his wife Hilda, She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed.In this first title of the popular series featuring Rumpole, all of the major characters who occupy the Rumpole stories make their introductions: the sneaky, slightly effeminate Erskine-Brown, the bumbling Guthrie Featherstone and various and sundry other lawyers and clerks whose lives weave in and out of these stories.These six stories include: Rumpole and the Younger Generation, Rumpole and the Alternative Society, Rumpole and the Honourable Member, Rumpole and the Married Lady, Rumpole and the Learned Friends, and Rumpole and the Heavy Brigade.",
