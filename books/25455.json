  "description": "Fashionista, socialite,â€¦spy? Hey, if the shoe fits...She poses as a haughty socialite in glass stilettos by day--and okay, sometimes by night. But Cinderella is actually Fabletown's master spy. Tasked with doing jobs too dirty and deadly for the average Fable, Cindy's faced down dangers from a dozen worlds and lives to tell tales (over cocktails in a hot tub, if you're lucky).But every secret agent has one annoyingly ruthless archnemesis, and Cindy is no exception. Back in the Big '80s, Cindy encountered her dark mirror, a rogue American Fable, who was in league with the mysterious Shadow Fabletown. Cindy thought she'd destroyed her rival years ago. But when a powerful magician turns up dead and another seeks her help, Cindy's hunt for her old enemy begins anew. From the frigid back alleys of Russia to the steaming desert, Cindy will follow the clues down the blood-flecked yellow brick road and risk everything she's got--including her secret identity--to solve the crime and finally get revenge on Silver Slipper.Collecting: Cinderella: Fables Are Forever 1-6 and Fables #51",
