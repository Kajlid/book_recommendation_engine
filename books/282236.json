  "description": "Josie Barton is a force to be reckoned with. After defeating the infamous Unseelie Lord, Fir Darrig, and joining the fight to bring peace to the divided faerie courts, her life has only grown more complicated. Working for the King of the Faeries and chasing down spell-slinging troublemakers is a full-time gig, and it turns out balancing a normal human life and a world of mad magic is much more challenging than she thought. But as a powerful fledgling sorceress determined to prove herself, now isn't the time to start backing down.Especially when whispers of an ancient darkness--the same evil that drove the faeries from their homeland ages ago--begin rippling through the court. And when prominent members of the Seelie Court also vanish in the wake of the appearance of a rival sorcerer, Josie knows she can't afford to waste a single second on doubt.Partnered with her roguish changeling soulmate, Josie must brave the twisted world of magic, spells, and secrets once again. This time, however, a new enemy has emerged from her long-buried past that may push her abilities to the brink. Can Josie find the strength to stand against someone that close to her heart? Or will past pain force her hand to turn against the man she loves?",
