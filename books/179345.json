  "description": "Free bird-  He calls me free bird, yet I’m not the one who’s free. At least not as free as he is.  He’s covered in tattoos, roaring down a Texas highway, and living life. I sit here, pondering what my life could be.  It was only supposed to be some fun, not like this.  I’m Avery, flustered Barista- looking for a diversion. I’m not like the others. I’m not ready to give-in and accept my fate.  2 Piece-  I didn’t have a clue that the pull would be so strong. To concede, or relent, to just accept my feelings for her.  She came looking for me, when I had no idea I wanted to be found.  She’s so strong, it’s mesmerizing, but I’m not the only one who notices. Just when it hits me of what’s right in front of me, waiting, things turn chaotic.  I’m 2 Piece, a stubborn member of the Oath Keepers MC. You think you know me because I’m a typical biker? You don’t have a clue.  Together, this is our story.  Can we relinquish and submit to our hearts?  239 pages-paperback This is book 3 in a series.
