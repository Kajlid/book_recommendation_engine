  "title": "The Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed",
  "description": "OverviewThe controversial bestseller on the failure of the Reagan Revolution.Editorial Review: Library JournalThis memoir is a bitter review of Stockman's years in the Reagan Administration. It is a book with few heroes and many fools. The author claims naivete as his excuse. Although the narrative is somewhat confusing, overall, its backstage view of policymaking leaves one discouraged, even frightened by the superficiality. The book is a necessary library purchase for two reasons: the notoriety of the book and its author, and the insider's view of key policies still in place and key personalities still in power.
