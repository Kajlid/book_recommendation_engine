  "description": "Note to my stupid cupid self: The next time I go and anchor myself to a hot covey, make sure those anchors aren't about to compete in a fight to the death.  Yeah. Total downer.  I have a body now and I don't intend to lose it. I also don't intend to lose the genfins that I've grown so attached to. So it's time to return to the kingdom island and hope like hell that my guys make it through the royal trials of the culling. I also have to hope that the prince of the realm doesn't spot me. If he does, I'm pretty sure I have imprisonment and torture to look forward to.  But we can make it through this. I know we can. I'm at least 70% sure we can, anyway. Okay, maybe it's more like fifty-fifty. But after we do? Well, my to-do list is long, but convincing my genfins that they belong with me is pretty high up there. So is dessert. And trying some fairy wine. And skinny dipping. Also sex. Lots and lots of sex.  But mostly, I just want what I've always wantedâ€”to have love of my own. Wings crossed that the genfins get on board with that plan. This cupid has her work cut out for her.",
