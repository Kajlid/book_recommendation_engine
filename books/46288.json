  "description": "These accursed things haven’t stopped me from thinking. My mind burns in hatred of myself, of these creatures. I’d hoped I could have been stronger, could have pushed away and fought the paralysis of free will. My stomach churns as they feed, releasing their hold on me. My stomach warm with blood, my movements become my own again. They are still in there waiting. I can feel them moving.",
