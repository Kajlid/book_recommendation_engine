Dori Seward can’t wait to get out of Eastcove, a sleepy fishing village on the border of New Brunswick and Maine.

Then Tor Riley comes to town and he has everything Dori dreams of in a boyfriend–looks, athleticism and mystery.  But Tor also has a tantalizing secret and Dori is determined to find out what it is. The truth is crazier than her wildest imaginations and more dangerous, too.  Dori has new fantastical enemies , and they will do anything to get to her.  Her life, her dreams and her love for Tor are all weighing in the balance. Will Dori risk it all in order to have it all?",
