  "title": "The Devil's Gentleman: Privilege, Poison, and the Trial That Ushered in the Twentieth Century",
  "description": "The wayward son of a revered Civil War general, Roland Molineux enjoyed good looks, status, and fortune--hardly the qualities of a prime suspect in a series of shocking, merciless cyanide killings. Molineux's subsequent indictment for murder led to two explosive trials and a sex-infused scandal that shocked the nation. Bringing to life Manhattan's Gilded Age, Schechter captures all the colors of the tumultuous legal proceedings, gathering his own evidence and tackling subjects no one dared address at the time--all in hopes of answering a tantalizing question: What powerfully dark motives could drive the wealthy scion of an eminent New York family to murder?",
