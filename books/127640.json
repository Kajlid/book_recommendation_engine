  "title": "After the Bombing",
  "description": "Alma Braithwaite was a teenager when Exeter, and her boarding school, were wrecked by bombardments in 1942. Twenty-one years later, she is stuck in a groove carved by the war, living alone in her parents' house and teaching music at her old school. It takes a new student - the daughter of a man Alma hasn't seen since 1942 - to bring back the painful yet exhilarating summer that followed the air-raids, and an antagonistic new headmistress to jolt her out of the past and make her seize the future.",
