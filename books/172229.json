  "title": "Sick Love",
  "description": "Warning: Contains explicit scenes, graphic descriptions and foul language. Not suitable for anyone under 21. His name is Kevin. And he's in trouble. Again. Therapy hasn't helped. Infatuated with someone forbidden to him, he drowns himself in fantasies alone in his room, until one night he's allowed a taste of what \"normal\" young men take for granted: the warmth of a woman. His first experience takes him to new highs. But his confusion between sex and love leaves him spiraling out of control. If the reader is squeamish about some pretty dark erotica, then stop. Don’t read this. It’s dark. It’s disturbing. It's violent. It's sick. It's a twisted coming of age tale. Step inside the mind of a confused, sad and lonely boy. He’s obsessive. He’s a stalker. He’s an egocentric, scared, introverted, delusional college freshman. Hate him or pity him. Just don’t say you weren’t warned.",
