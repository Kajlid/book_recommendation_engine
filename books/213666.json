  "description": "Taro is still trying to come to terms with his new role of dragon king. His coronation was but a few short days ago, and yet the man is given no time to rest. After being plagued by a strange dream, he wakes up to find that a shadow has fallen over the horizon. There’s a beast of the worst sort moving towards them, and fast. It quickly becomes apparent that this is not a creature the humans nor the dragons can face down on their own. Taro’s only hope is to unite these two groups, who have been warring with each other for countless years.",
