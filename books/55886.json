  "description": "British national Greg Stephens knew there would be challenges in his new relationship with handsome American Navy officer Danny long distance; Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell; the Defense of Marriage Act; US immigration…. But he didn’t anticipate his greatest Danny’s born-again Christian mother, Vivien. A secretary in a small-town Southern Baptist church in Texas, she bristles at Greg’s secular beliefs. Through passive-aggressive manipulation, subtle deceit, or outright battle, Vivien resolves to banish Greg and return Danny to the fold, come hell or high water. Greg’s hold on Danny’s heart is pitted against Vivien’s crusade for Danny’s soul. All the while, Greg devotes himself to keeping Danny happy while negotiating the cultural differences of his life in America. Danny’s new career as a lawyer takes them from his native Texas to New York. But with Vivien testing Greg’s stiff upper lip at every turn, something has to give. The British Devil is a semiautobiographical novel exploring culture, religion, and love in a bi-national relationship.",
