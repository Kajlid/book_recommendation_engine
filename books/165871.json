Until someone threatens to ruin it all…  A prodigal son…  Vincent Marcano walked away from his own life of crime five years ago. Now he’s back and wants in on Trey’s crew. Trey has no reason to trust Vincent—he’s from a rival family and has proved to be a traitor in the past, but the boss allows Vincent to join the team in spite of Trey’s protests. But Vincent’s keeping a lot of secrets…about where he’s been, why he’s back, and the fact that he’s in love with Trey’s younger sister, Bela. Desperate to prove his loyalty to Trey, Vincent plays a dangerous game of cat and mouse that threatens to expose his relationship with Bela and the truth about his past.  And the only girl who could come between them…  The daughter of a mob boss, Bela has grown up to hate organized crime, but she loves Vincent enough to overlook his decision to join her brother’s gang. His mission will test her beliefs, strain their relationship and turn her world inside out. As Vincent becomes more embroiled in the mob’s dark world, the threat of exposure heightens. Can Bela continue to be with Vincent, knowing her love could sign his death sentence?  Disclaimer: Men of Honor is a new adult romance, not intended for readers under the age of eighteen.
