  "description": "Remember Me When is the second and final book in the heart-rending and passionate Unforgettable Duet from USA Today Bestselling Author Brooke Blaine. My worst nightmare and your greatest fear became a reality: You don’t remember me. You don’t remember the accident, or the weeks afterward. You don’t remember my bed as your safe place, or when, against all odds, you fell for me. You remember me only as the casual acquaintance you saw as you grabbed your daily coffee. Three sugars, two creamers. Perhaps an acquaintance is all I’ll ever be to you now. Maybe I can shoulder the heartbreak and the loss of you, if it means you’ll be happy. Unless… You remember me when.Remember Me When is the second and final book in The Unforgettable Duet and should only be read following Forget Me Not.",
