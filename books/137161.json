  "title": "Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom",
  "description": "In Firing Back , six-term Congressman Todd Akin describes in eye-opening detail what it is like to be an unapologetic conservative in a town dominated by media bullies, back-room bosses, and liberals of either party. Although he tried to be a loyal Republican, Akin's first allegiance was always to the Constitution and his conservative principles. When the Bush administration lobbied him to approve its progressive legislative initiatives, No Child Left Behind and the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Akin refused. In the process, he made some serious enemies.   Those enemies got their revenge after Akin made an awkward comment about rape. Although he had just won a hard-fought Republican primary in Missouri for US Senate, party bosses tried to coerce him to yield the nomination to their preferred candidate. When Akin refused, the bosses turned their back on him and let Democrat Claire McCaskill win.   In Firing Back , Akin tells the story of how the Republican leadership not only threw him under the bus but also ran over him a few times for good measure. Not one of them explained what it was about Akin's remarks that so deeply offended them.   Akin names names and takes numbers in Firing Back , but this book is much more than a tell-all. It is a battle-tested guide to Republicans and conservatives to help them find their courage, reclaim their integrity, and, by doing so, help preserve America's faith and freedom.",
