  "title": "Rumpole for the Defence",
  "description": "This book is a sheer delight. Mortimer gives us humor as only the British can dish it out. And what great fun to contemplate what it would be like to be Rumpole, an utterly unflappable character, slightly detached from and amused by all of life's challenges, whether they occur in a court of law or as a result of living with a spouse he calls She Who Must Be Obeyed.",
