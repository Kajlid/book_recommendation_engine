  "description": "Little Mermaid. Three spirited warriors. A realm in peril.  Nyssa's not your typical princess. She rebellious, and sneaks down to the Shark Bait bar with her friends, to get away from the pressures of palace life. Each time a hot Sharkrider chats her up, she develops a serious case of fin in the mouth disease, and embarrasses herself. All that changes when her father announces she's to marry the cruel and scheming commander of his army. She'd rather digest in the belly of a whale than marry that slug.  When Nyssa digs a little deeper, she uncovers that the commander is using a spell to control her father. In wedding her, the commander plans to kill the king, and rule the underwater realm. With the help of three mersoldiers who pledged their allegiance to her, Nyssa must save her father and the kingdom. Now she must navigate new emotional currents while keeping her head above, or below, water...even if that means drowning in the soldier's love.  Mermaids, loyalty, passion and vengeance collide in this spellbinding romance that finds its 'Happily Ever After.'  Note: Each book in the Haven Realm series is a standalone book.",
