  "description": "Emboldened by the enthusiastic response to Belly Button (Round); a song from her Grammy-nominated book/CD, Philadelphia Chickens; Sandra Boynton further contemplates this mesmerizing subject.  Featuring a beachful of bare-bellied hippos; including one tiny baby who can only say \"Bee Bo\" the Belly Button Book is the latest quirky addition to the phenomenally successful Boynton on Board series. Every page captivates with Sandra Boynton's inimitable illustrations and joyful rhyming text:Soon after dark, upon the beach, we sing a hippo song, and if you're feeling in the mood, we hope you'll sing along: \"Belly Belly Button, you're oh so fine. Ooo, Belly Button, I'm so happy you're mine.\" Shiny and sturdy, and featuring a great (navel-shaped, naturally) die-cut cover that offers a provocative glimpse of the merriment inside, the Belly Button Book  provides enduring, giggly, read-aloud fun.",
