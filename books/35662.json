  "description": "The battle over Midgard begins with just one girl...  Earth has been without a Guardian since its creation, but Loki means to take it for himself. His daughter, sixteen-year-old Desolation, wants nothing more than to stay in Hel where it’s cold and lonely and totally predictable. Instead, she’s sent to Midgard to make her choice -- and what she chooses will determine not only her own future but the fate of all the worlds.",
