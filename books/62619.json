  "description": "Making My Own Rainbows: Poems of love, life, and lamentation\n is an attempt to dispel the narrow definitions still forced upon African-American women and present the complexities of their humanity. It is a journey through the vicissitudes of life, a journey which includes, among many subjects, love, triumph, temptation, defeat, jealousy, and joy. Buckle your seat belts and be warned. This is not your grandmother's poetry! Making My Own Rainbows is an excellent choice for any book club.",
