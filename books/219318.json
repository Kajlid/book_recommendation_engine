She claims the feeling is mutual...until she frames Calvin for murder and blackmails him. The price? Not much. Calvin just has to do her bidding in a black-market industry catering to the very rich and the oh-so-very depraved. Maybe he's just better off at the bar. From Jeff Menapace, bestselling author of the Bad Games trilogy, comes Numb, a disturbing noir thriller with tongue firmly planted in cheek...until it's ripped out.",
