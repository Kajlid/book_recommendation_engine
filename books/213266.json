  "description": "Charlotte  I had no idea that when I accepted to lead the latest space exploration mission, I would end up in some strange galaxy, about to be sold as a slave. Then he saved me. A muscled warrior, a commander in a race of beautiful aliens. He entranced and captivated me.  Ryker  I had no idea that by attacking a slave ship, I would meet the most exotic creature I had ever seen. There was no species like it in the federation.  I am a war dog, built for battle, not love. I am not good enough for a creature like her but I can only resist for so long. If she doesnâ€™t return to her planet soon my control will snap. Then nothing will stop me from making her mine, not even the ones who want to steal her back from me.",
