  "description": "I am the man on the park bench, the one behind you in line, and the one you pass on the street. I am everyone and I am no one. I am nothing to anyone, and if you have ever seen me you wouldn’t remember. Having never known my name, they simply call me Simon.Lilly wasn’t supposed to notice me. She wasn’t supposed to remember me. She wasn’t supposed to talk to me--or fall in love with me. I wasn’t supposed to notice her ethereal beauty, or care what she thought of me, or want to see her again, or wonder what it would be like to…to…hug… her. I definitely was not supposed to fall in love with her.What would the Counsel do to us if they ever found out?",
