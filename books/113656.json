  "description": "The Bequeathal: GODSENTIn a post-crash, rebooted world, Eugene Reece is one of the billions of pre-indebted citizens whose lives are augmented by the virtualized intellects of the deceased. If anything, his stats tag him average, though a notch more disillusioned and a degree less spirited than the next, permanently connected individual but his surplus dose of ironic self-derision makes him slightly discrepant. The tedium of Eugene's drudge is forever broken during one of his habitual visits to Soho and a too-good-to-pass offer of beta-testing a personal entertainment clone. This results in expensive and fatal biological damage and, although accidental, his indecipherable crime earns him the attentions of the anti-terror agency, subjection to unimaginable torture, and untimely physical death.And that's when his life really begins...Prior to the filming of a blockbuster trilogy, Keany Reeves said he was required to read three books before he even saw the script. One of those was by Jean Baudrillard and another from the internationally acclaimed Introducing... series.Now, in GODSENT, a contributor to several books from the same series, and co-author of Introducing Baudrillard, who has also had rare personal access to the great cultural theorist, has taken simulacra to reality. In this fast-paced SF novel, he combines fresh philosophical notions with original concepts of digitised afterlife and reconstructed psyche to bring us to a brand-new evolutionary stage.",
