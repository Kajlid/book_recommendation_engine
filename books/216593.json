  "description": "This is no normal tale. It is mouse to your cat, fox to your hound, Moriarty to your Sherlock, and it will dash ahead of you calling, “Catch me if you can!” And if you can, you are not normal either. Cast off where you are and what you know and gather together in the dark with the Dusties. ____ In a world that has lost its light, a tiny colony of newly awakened and lost Dusties struggle to make sense of their bizarre surroundings. But as the survivors penetrate the enveloping darkness and tug at the mysteries around them, they begin to discover both a deadly threat and the elusive pattern that could save their existence.",
