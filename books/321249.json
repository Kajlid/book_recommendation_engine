Edison.-Here’s a collection of short stories to inspire the readers.Although this book has been named after the city of Chandausi, it contains stories from various places like Rishikesh, Agra, Champaran, Tilhar, Sambhal, Kanpur, Banaras, Lucknow and many others. These are the short stories of a bygone era-a period when India had either not gained independence or had been independent for not more than 35 years. These are the tales of journeys-taken up from the early 20th century to the end of a millennium, from Shahjahanpur to Delhi, from Bijnor to Hyderabad, from Hathras to Sweden & Norway, from Lakshmi Talkies, Allahabad to Night Watchman, Bangalore, from Panki to USA, from Dehradun to Canada, from Chandausi to Australia and many others. We are sure in all these stories, you will be able to find at least one character, which reminds you of your own self-of what you are, were or always wanted to be. Let us know the character with whom you have been able to relate to the most.Happy reading.",
