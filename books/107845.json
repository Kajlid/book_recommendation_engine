  "description": "The follow-up volume to \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" collects seven more of Montague Rhodes James's classic horror stories, including \"A School Story,\" \"The Rose Garden,\" \"Casting the Runes,\" and \"Martin's Close.\"\"...gifted with an almost diabolic power of calling horror by gentle steps from the midst of prosaic daily life, is the scholarly Montague Rhodes James, Provost of Eton College, antiquary of note, and recognized authority on medi√¶val manuscripts and cathedral history. Dr. James, long fond of telling spectral tales at Christmastide, has become by slow degrees a literary weird fictionist of the very first rank!\" -- H.P. Lovecraft",
