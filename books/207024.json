  "description": "Life hasn't always been kind to Hope Robertson. What with a crazy and abusive mother, hell bent on making her life a mess before kicking the bucket, a damn stalker alienating all of her friends in school, a mess of a bank account and an extremely inconvenient crush on the black sheep at work, well, one sure wouldnâ€™t want to walk a mile her shoes now, would they. So what happens when said bad boy sets his sights on Hope? Nothing good, alright. At least, not to begin with. The end of the story is a whole different matter, isn't it?",
