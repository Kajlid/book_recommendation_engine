  "description": "When Devany wanders into another world's war, she ends up with power she doesn't understand, a job she doesn't want, and a demon who thinks she belongs to him. She doesn't know how she's going to get out of the mess she's in. She doesn't know any martial arts, she's never been in a fight. Heck, she doesn't even own any leather pants. Then a group of outcast witches takes her kids and they find out just how bad ass this mother can be, because nobody messes with her kids. Nobody.",
