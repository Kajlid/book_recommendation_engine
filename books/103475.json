  "title": "Dirt Matters: The Foundation For a Healthy, Vibrant, And Effective Congregation",
  "description": "Every church has a unique culture that serves as the soil where its ministry occurs. A church's culture is the somewhat nebulous and complex blend of norms, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and practices that define the congregation. The culture establishes the environment that often predetermines the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of God's Word within that body of believers. It influences a congregation's potential impact more than techniques, programs, or pragmatic changes. Dirt Matters explains and illustrates the importance of church culture, connecting it to a simple analogy that anyone can understand. It also shares how it's possible to cultivate and nurture a healthier church environment that can put you and your congregation in a better position to bear fruit for God's glory.",
