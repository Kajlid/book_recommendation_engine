  "description": "A rebel bent on revenge. An heiress hiding secrets. And a ship about to burn... In the near future, the world balances on the brink of chaos. The Grand Voyager promises lavish decadence--but only for the powerful elites. But beneath the glittering fa√ßade, the ship hides explosive secrets.  Posing as a ship's officer, ruthless Gabriel will do anything to bring down the corrupt elites--until he falls for the daughter of his sworn enemy. Beautiful, privileged Amelia is much more than she appears. And when loyal Micah uncovers a deadly conspiracy, he must make a terrible choice.  Everything changes in an instant when the ship is hijacked. Hurled into a terrible nightmare, each passenger faces danger, treachery, and their own worst fears. There's nowhere to run, no one to trust, and nothing is as it seems. To escape, they'll have to risk everything they love.  But an even greater threat looms, one that may shatter the world as they know it. Survival is only the beginning . . .",
