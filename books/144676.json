  "description": "It's not important what our parents did. It matters what we do. Someone has to save the world. You're someone. Do the math. The critically acclaimed team of Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie reinvent the teen super-hero comic for the 21st century - uniting Wiccan, Hulkling and Kate \"Hawkeye\" Bishop with Kid Loki, Marvel Boy and Miss America. No pressure, right? When Wiccan makes a horrible mistake that comes back to bite everyone on their communal posteriors, we cue five issues of hormonal panic. Fight scenes! Fake IDs! Plentiful feels! (a.k.a. \"meaningful emotional character beats\" for people who aren't on tumblr.) Young Avengers is as NOW! as the air in your lungs and twice as vital.Collecting: Young Avengers 1-15, material from Marvel Now! Point One.1",
