  "description": "“If I were to make a diorama of ‘I Will Always Be Your Whore,’ I would construct three slightly run-down Victorians: one for past, one for present, one for dream. I would make a spooky ghost figure representing Billy Corgan and suspend that over everything. And then I would have the people inside the dioramas yearn and fuck and spill their tea and fidget with their hair ties. Alexandra Naughton writes about love and desire with a pleasing specificity and the cadence of a rapper, and her great achievement with this book is her invention of Corgan as a mutable muse. As ghost, lover, crush, and memory, Corgan haunts the fuck out of this text, making the poems below quake and join together.” —Amy Berkowitz, poet & author of ‘Listen to Her Heart’, Spooky Girlfriend Press",
