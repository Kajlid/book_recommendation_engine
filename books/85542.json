  "description": "A day in the life of a superheroine! We follow Silverlash as she encounters a new \"brick\" super attempting to rob an ATM, and others at a weapons shop. She meets with Metrocity's demonic knight hero, Razorwing at the scene of Metrocity's recent major averted disaster, and gets together with several other heroes (Impact, Psycom) as well as some of the non-hero supers over lunch.This is a short story set in the H.E.R.O. superhero universe. The story stands alone, but \"officially\" fits in between H.E.R.O. Shorts - Gatecrasher, and H.E.R.O. - Gene Front in the most extensive superhero book series of the decade.The short story includes four images of the heroes created solely for this book. The story is approximately 11,500 words long.",
