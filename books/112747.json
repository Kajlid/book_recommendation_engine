She arrives to find Alexander St. Claire visiting with her grandmother. What she doesn't know is that he is a very lonely vampire, who made a mistake years ago when he thought he was in love with Adeline. He has spent many years trying to help out the family where he can. But Adeline's Alzheimer's is getting worse, and Beth knows her grandmother doesn't have very much longer to live. Both alone, Beth and Alex make a spontaneous decision to spend Christmas Eve together and are recipients to more than one miracle. But what will happen the next morning? Is Beth strong enough to handle the truth about Alex? This book contains dubious consent. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
