Once a beggar and still a fugitive from the king's justice, Daven is also a hero with unrivaled powers. A brush with one of the deadly dragons left him forever bonded to the beast and able to tap into the ever-shifting maelstrom of Chaos that roils beneath man's fragile reality.It is a dangerous connection, one that threatens to consume him. Can he pay even that ultimate price if it means the salvation of humanity?",
