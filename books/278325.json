  "description": "Millie loves being a mail cow even more than she used to love scaring the mail carrier. And helping him deliver the town's holiday presents is the highlight of her winter. She does such a good job that the mail carrier trusts Millie to deliver his gifts to everyone on the farm. But when she gets lost on her way back, Millie wonders if she'll ever make it home to deliver the rest of the gifts. Luckily, the farm was right beneath her nose-and the snow-the whole time. Now if only those presents could make it to their rightful owners . . . and in one piece. This heartwarming story will hit home with any kid who's ever been lost-or only thought she was-and will keep the laughs coming as readers enjoy the silly illustrations of Millie and her farmyard friends.",
