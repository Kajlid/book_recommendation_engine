  "description": "Do you believe in ghosts? Do we really live on in some conscious form after we die, capable of communicating with the world of the living?Aye, right.That was Jack Parlabane's stance on the matter, anyway. But this was before he found himself in the more compromising position of being not only dead himself, but dead with an exclusive still to file.From his position on high, Parlabane relates the events leading up to his demise, concerning the efforts of charismatic psychic Gabriel Lafayette to reconcile the scientific with the spiritual by submitting to controlled laboratory tests.Parlabane is brought in as an observer, due to his capabilities as both a sceptic and an expert on deception, but his certainties crumble and his assumptions turn upside down as he encounters phenomena for which he can deduce no rational explanation.One thing he knows for certain, however: death his not the end - it's the ultimate undercover assignment.",
