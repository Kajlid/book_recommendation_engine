  "title": "Mate Fur Hire",
  "description": "**The full-length third book in T. S. Joyce’s new Bears Fur Hire series.**  Vera Masterson has been called a lot of names through the years: witch, misfit, mad scientist. She’s let the rumors go because they kept her safe. But now she’s ready to leave the secluded island she was banished to, and she’ll need some big protection if she is going to escape the biggest rule of Perl Island: no misfit leaves. She has a plan, a burning desire for a better life, and her sights set on Tobias Silver, a dominant grizzly shifter, Alaskan bush pilot, and muscle-bound shifter enforcer. She doesn’t have much to bargain with, but she has the ability to make something he needs. And the second she lays eyes on the growly, sexy stranger, she’s pretty sure he has exactly what she needs too.  Tobias Silver is flying to the notoriously dangerous Perl Island to talk to a misfit about a rumor he’s heard. Some say Vera Masterson can suppress shifter animals, and he’s headed into a brutal hibernation season desperate to cure his grizzly instincts. What he doesn’t expect is to meet a smart-mouthed enchantress who is determined to hire him as her mate. She’s hiding a mountain of secrets, and she’ll need more protection than he’s prepared for, but she could be the answer to all his hibernation problems. All that’s left to do now is keep carefully detached from his accidental mate, because falling for the secretive woman could spell disaster for them both.  Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
