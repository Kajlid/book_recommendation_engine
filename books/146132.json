  "description": "I know that I am here for a reason. Stonehart abducted me, starved me, and left me in the dark... all for a reason. He is a cold man, but he is not irrational. He has his purpose. I have not yet discovered what it is. I should despise him. I should feel nothing but disgust when I think of him. And yet... yet sometimes, I don't. Because there are those precious moments when he makes me feel magnificent. Treasured. Like a real person. One who actually matters to him. I know those fleeting displays of affection should not sway my resolve. But I am not him. I do not possess his self-control. I cannot stay unaffected forever. Bit by bit, my stand is wearing at me. Do I still want revenge? Do I still want vengeance? Yes. Yes, of course I do. I want revenge. I want retribution. But Stonehart wants something from me, too. And the terrifying question that lurks in the back of my mind In the end, will it be his retribution, or mine?",
