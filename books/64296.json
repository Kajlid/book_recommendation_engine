  "description": "The brothers, Jehovah and Hades, have always been at the top of their game as a high IQ computer hacker from M.I.T. and an unkillable assassin. When they're contacted by Rick to free a people oppressed by a dictator, both jump at the chance. Once they reach the Philippines, however, they realize that their limited resources and constant attacks sent from an unknown source severely limit their abilities. To make matters worse, the mayor has his own personal army that seems to anticipate their actions. Will they be able to rely solely on their brains and brawn to get the job done?",
