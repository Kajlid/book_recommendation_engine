  "title": "Infected",
  "description": "The first outbreak was in New York. Within hours, the city was quarantined, but it was too late. Nowhere is safe from the undead. Tom Clemens has been living in the shadows, searching for those responsible for the death of his family. Framed for murder, he is on the run when the first outbreak occurs. With thousands of others, he fights his way out of New York and joins the exodus searching for a safe refuge somewhere in America. On that journey he learns the identity of those responsible for the betrayal of the species, and of a scientist who might be able to stop the living dead. So begins his quest to save humanity. Here We Stand 1: Infected & 2: Divided are part of the post-apocalyptic series Surviving the Evacuation. This story of patient zero and Sholtoâ€™s attempt to stop the outbreak can be read before or after Surviving the Evacuation Books 1-7. Please As the President of the United States is a background character, and the presidential election a background event, American English has been used in this book though with some British spellings as most of Surviving the Evacuation takes place in the United Kingdom and Ireland.",
