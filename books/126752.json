  "description": "Georgiana Warne is stuck in the country taking care of her invalid father when she'd rather be in town having good times with her college friends. Smart, spunky, and energetic, she bears her situation with a good will and exercises her considerable talents for the good of those she loves. Before long, a Mr. Jefferson comes to board and Georgiana invites her cousin—rich, town-bred cousin Jeannette—to visit. Companioned by her childhood friend Jimps and fast-moving suitor Miles Channing, Georgiana won't be bored for long! Written in 1916.",
