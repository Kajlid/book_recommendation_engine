  "description": "What woman could resist such a passionate protector as Royce Grenville, Viscount Stonehurst? Certainly not I, Lady Aimee Daventry. Ten years ago, I was the sole witness to my mother's scandalous murder. Now the memory of that fateful day has begun to haunt my dreams. And only I can finally bring the fiend to justice . . . if he doesn't find me first. With my life in grave danger, Royce is only too willing to watch over me. The last time I saw Royce I was just a girl. I was drawn to him even then, though he returned from war with dark secrets of his own. I've sworn that nothing will keep me from avenging my mother . . . but with my desire for the devastatingly handsome Royce raging out of control, how can I resist the perfect seduction?",
