  "description": "Parsley the cat sat with his back to the garden wall. He stared at Rosemary, his mouth set in a strange grin. \"Stop that,\" said Rosemary. \"It looks so silly.\" Parsley did not move, so she looked behind her. Nothing moved there either. Not a leaf rustled ... not a fly buzzed ... It was a magic spell. Ten-year-old Rosemary thinks the word cut into the marker stone in her aunt's old herb garden in Maine should be spelled T-H-Y-M-E until she tastes a sprig of it, and finds everything but herself ... stopped! Flies hang in mid-flight, a measuring worm in mid-reach. Not a leaf rustles. Before long Rosemary, a rather timid, proper child, is plunged into an extraordinary adventure-- in the eighteenth century!",
