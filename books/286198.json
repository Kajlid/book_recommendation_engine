  "title": "Storytellers at the Columbia River",
  "description": "Five newcomers arrive at the 1998 Settlers' Reunion at the mid-Columbia River: two anthropologists drawn by the storytelling, two on special missions from their elders, and a Siberian shaman intent on river healing. A Wanapum Indian bus driver angry over salmon losses takes them into the devastated area around the defunct Hanford atomic plant, the scene of the 1943 settler evictions. That view, and the growing threat of nuclear waste from the plant, spark new insights, friendships, and loves. Decades-old anger is swept into vows of action to save the salmon, the Columbia, and the world beyond.Editorial Review:\"Mendenhall tells a rich and complicated story--in reality many stories--cautionary tales of violence done to people and the environment: families evicted from their farms and orchards in order to build the Hanford, Washington nuclear facility; the construction of huge Columbia River dams that prevent salmon from reaching their spawning grounds; Indigenous people dispossessed of their ancestral land and food sources; the horror of Nagasaki; the threat of nuclear waste leaking from the Hanford plant and contaminating the river. These stories, told through the concerns of the novel's characters, join together in a narrative to raise ecological awareness of these enormous problems and to rally a spirit to actively respond to them.\"~ Dr. Gerald W. McFarland, author of The Buenaventura Trilogy, and A Scattered People: An American Family Moves West",
