  "description": "Falling in love is always in fashion.... With her trust fund and coveted job at Christian Dior, Fanny Moreau believes she has it all. But when her best friend finds a fulfilling new career abroad-and a dreamy relationship with a great guy, Fanny's fabulous life suddenly feels empty. Inspired to find her true purpose, she trades her cushy lifestyle in San Francisco for an adventure in the Alaskan wilderness. Everyone thinks Fanny has gone off the deep end. What's a girl with a Ph.D in Prada doing teaching in an Inuit village? Even Fanny is wondering, especially when she comes face to face with Calder MacFarlane. The Scottish search and rescue pilot is everything Fanny is not-selfless, heroic, and used to living on the edge. He's also the man who once loved her best friend. Yet something in Calder's sexy gaze has her believing that she's a woman capable of great things-a woman who might just find her own happily-ever-after, in a place where she least expects it.... \"Leah Marie Brown has a wily way of bringing her stories to life with sharp dialogue and drop-dead sexy characters.\" -Cindy Miles, National Bestselling Author \"When it comes to crafting clever, intelligent, wonderful escapist fiction with a heroine every woman wants to know, Leah Marie Brown is a new voice to watch. Prepare to fall in love!\" -Renee Ryan, Daphne du Maurier Award-Winning Author",
