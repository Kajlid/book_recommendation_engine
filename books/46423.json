  "title": "Women in Cuba: The Making of a Revolution within the Revolution",
  "description": "The social revolution that in 1959 brought down the bloody Batista dictatorship began in the streets of cities like Santiago de Cuba and the Rebel Army's liberated mountain zones of eastern Cuba. The unprecedented integration of women in the ranks and leadership of this struggle was a true measure of the revolutionary course it has followed to this day. Here, in firsthand accounts by women who helped make it, is the story of that revolution--and \"the revolution within.\" Introduction by Mary-Alice Waters. Photo sections, maps, glossary, index. Also Available Spanish",
