  "description": "“Just out of our sight, in the blind shadows of our own vision, lies the Fallen... and the worst game in biblical text is about to be fleshed!”Alexandra Beaumont, the daughter of a billionaire mayor of the city of Blackwater, had a pretty easy life until she and her younger sister were brutally murdered. After awakening in her grave three months later, Alex will discover that her death will be anything but easy.While she lay dead, the Fallen, a violent and malicious race of trans-dimensional demons, invaded Blackwater, spreading a plague of carnage and death. As part of the demonic ritual, which led to their being summoned, the Earth is allowed a guardian, who can compete in a deadly game for a chance to save the Earth from the Fallen’s destruction. Alex discovers she has been chosen and must defeat five Fallen Judges hidden throughout Blackwater, and she must do so before sunrise.As Alex fights her way through the derelict and plague-ravaged city, and the millions of undead that swarm the streets, she will discover that she may not be who she used to be, and she may have to become something else entirely if she is to win the game and defeat the Fallen.Official Sitehttp://amongthefallen.co.uk/GoodReadshttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...Black Books Revs\"Genesis has many strong points, its fast, fluid, and rolls seamlessly from one chapter to the next with each being a mini story of its own. Its very clever in that respect, we found that it does not matter what page you open at (or chapter) you can read it and get a decent sense of what is going on. The idea of Alex's super violent and often possessive living bio-suit gives the main character a haunting edge of schizophrenia, just what you need in the apocalypse. A very well crafted, and often sacrilegious title that delivers some great action, brilliantly constructed violence, and some hauntingly Gothic and frightening moments. Brilliantly original book, but definitely NOT for children and those with weak stomach.\"Book Zone - Zombie Collections\"Post Apocalyptic, zombie nightmares come in many forms and very rarely come with anything new. Among the fallen: Genesis rewrites the rules of zombie horror. This is an amazingly written masterpiece, with some frantic, shocking and some superbly written set pieces and events delivered to you with sadistic creativity. This will make a great movie one day, maybe even a game. Already, I am on tender hooks waiting for the next part, if zombies, ghosts and demons are your thing, then ATF GENESIS will prob put a smile on your face\"Recent Reviews“Is there a limit to the imagination? Genesis is a whole new take on the zombie apocalypse, dragging in hints from all genres. It has ghosts and hauntings, horrific descriptions and awesome story telling… paying homage to Hellraiser and the Resident Evil franchise, Genesis is the start of something truly horrific”",
