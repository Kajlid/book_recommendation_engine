  "description": "Alexa Green has come to Holly Oaks and taken a position at her alma mater. She’s finally ready to plant some roots before she becomes invisible in life, and there are two sexy vets in town that can’t wait to tie her in their ropes. But Alexa’s been a shadow since she was a little girl, and getting her to trust them may be harder than they thought. James Gainer and Ryan Stromfield are a committed D/s couple who have almost given up hope of finding a third, until Alexa moves to town. She’s everything they want, but gaining her trust and handling the problems a triad faces in a vanilla society may be more than any relationship can stand.Alexa must choose between her job and its security at the university, and her relationship. All while trying not to become a new victim from past sins.",
