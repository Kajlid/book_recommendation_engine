  "description": "Omnibus (n): When you wait ages for a Women on Top book and then two come along at once.In a utopian near future, women run the world, and they have finally sorted it out.Nurturing the earth back to health following centuries of male violence, and creating a pristine commercial paradise, women have separated men into those that are fertile, Studs, and those that are useless, Duds.It is one such Dud, he who is labelled Wimpole, who threatens this paradise. Mistakenly assigned as a Stud through a (male) clerical error, and assigned to impregnate the noble Commandress Roseanne, Dud Wimpole threatens the very fabric of our ideal future society.It is the account of Dud Wimpole that is presented here, A Dudâ€™s Tale , discovered by a present day Primary school teacher, highlighting the dangers of allowing men to read and write, and reminding us all why they should not be allowed anywhere near Primary schools.The text is collected for the first time with Women on Top 2: The Testicles , three testaments on the life of Dud Wimpole, by those who are said to have known him.",
