  "description": "The Ozzy Osbourne story—as told by Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, Tommy Aldridge, Bernie Torme, Brad Gillis, Steve Vai, Phil Soussan, Carmine Appice, and many, many more   Until 1978 the original and definitive heavy metal band Black Sabbath was fronted by the irrepressible Ozzy Osbourne. With Osbourne at the helm, Black Sabbath sold tens of millions of albums. When he finally broke away to fly solo Ozzy would achieve the unthinkable. Not only would he deliver one of the seminal Rock records ever crafted to mark his resurrection but he also used it as a career making catalyst that would see him trounce his former band mates and evolve into a cult icon. Along the way Ozzy displayed an enviable knack of choosing a series of groundbreaking guitarists such as Randy Rhoads, Jake E. Lee, and Zakk Wylde. There would also be the unsung heroes such as songwriter extraordinaire Bob Daisley and a series of world renowned bassists, drummers and keyboard players. This then is the story of the Ozzy Osbourne band—in their own words and detailed exclusively here for the first time. Chronicled with first-hand interviews, this is the real story of the first prototype Blizzard of Ozz band, how Ozzy met Randy Rhoads, the painful saga of Rhoads' replacement Bernie Torme and the torturous audition processes for successive guitarists and drummers told by both successful and unsuccessful candidates.",
