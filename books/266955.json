  "description": "A young woman commits suicide but comes back to miraculous recovery or something else? Two detectives become partners after Internal Affairs clears them. They investigate a string of mysterious deaths with the coroner. The cases are unrelated but the themes of redemption and justice link them. The scarce clues point to the Temple of the Oracle of Redemption and the coroner goes undercover to investigate. He finds an ancient entity who wields a mystical power called Greek fire. Is she benevolent or malevolent? He joins the temple to find out and gets pulled in but also finds love. One detective is hell bent on using her powers or taking her out in an epic clash.",
