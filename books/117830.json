  "description": "In this second short story collection from number one bestseller Peter James, some of our darkest dreams and deepest fears are brought chillingly to life. From a couple plagued by medieval spectres, a philandering cad caught with his trousers around his ankles, and the authorâ€™s own deeply personal experience of a haunted house, to the first ever case of his best-loved Detective, Roy Grace, James exposes the Achilles heels of each of his characters , and makes us question how well we can trust ourselves, and each other.",
