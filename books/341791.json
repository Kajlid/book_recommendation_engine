  "title": "The 351 Books of Irma Arcuri",
  "description": "Throughout mathematician Philip Masyrk's peripatetic life, there has been only one Irma Arcuri. Their ongoing love affair has endured his two marriages and her countless travels. But now Irma has vanished, leaving Philip her library of 351 books, including five written by Irma herself. Buried somewhere within her luxuriously rebound volumes of Cervantes and Turgenev, Borges and Fowles, lies the secret to her disappearance-and Philip soon realizes that he is trapped within their narratives as well. Who is Irma Arcuri? What is really hidden in the library? And most importantly, whose story is this? Unapologetically sexy and brazenly intellectual, The 351 Books of Irma Arcuri is the impressive debut of a daring new literary talent.",
