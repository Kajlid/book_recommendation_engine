  "description": "\"It gets easier…I know it hurts now, but one day, you'll wake up, and you'll just be okay. It'll happen sooner than you think.\"Have you ever had something happen that changed the way you looked at everything? Like someone pulled a string and unraveled the delicate threads of the sweater that made up your reality? For me, that moment was at a party I shouldn’t have been at on the day of my grandmother’s funeral. I went home and got into a car I shouldn’t have gotten into.  It was only supposed to be for the summer. One summer in Lost Hollow. Just a few weeks to clear my head.  And then, I met him.  And everything else fell apart, too.  Someone once told me that we leave pieces of ourselves with every person we meet and in every place we go. She said it was a good thing—the best thing, even. But what happens when they’re the pieces we can’t afford to lose? How do you get them back?Content & Trigger Warnings: explicit sexual content, profanity, mentions of rape (off page, not between MCs), bullying, violence, a MMC with a dirty mouth, dubcon, drug and alcohol use/abuse, and death of a loved one.",
