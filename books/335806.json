  "description": "Set in the early1970s. Daniela, young and beautiful, burns her bridges, travels far to find a place where she could belong, a future and a life of her own. A fast moving, character driven emotional story. It takes a long time to get over being left by the man you love. Daniela, bright but somewhat naïve, takes the drastic measure of leaving her country and traveling through Europe to make a new life in London. As she tries to find her way into English society, she observes it as only an outsider could. Faced with challenges, far harder than she anticipated, she perseveres, finds a new path to follow and learns to trust and love again. But just when she feels secure, a succession of tragedies befalls her. Daniela’s arduous journey with a colourful cast of characters, is played out against the rich tapestry of the seventies, with its music, fashion and drugs, sexual freedom and the liberating new way of life.",
