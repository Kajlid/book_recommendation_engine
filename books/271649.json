  "description": "Everyone loves Miss Wichelman's fifth-grade class - especially best friends Traci and Marilyn. That's where they learn that when life hands you lemons, make lemonade! They are having a great year until Traci begins to notice some changes in Marilyn. She's losing weight, and seems tired all the time. She has leukemia - and a tough road of chemotherapy ahead. It is not only Traci and Miss Wichelman who stand up for her, but in a surprising and unexpected turn, the whole fifth-grade class, who figures out a way to say we're with you. In true Polacco fashion, this book turns lemons into lemonade and celebrates amazing life itself.",
