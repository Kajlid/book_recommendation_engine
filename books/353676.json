  "description": "Sam Linnifer works part-time at a London university as a translator of obscure ancient texts. He's a quiet fellow with a few friends and an affection for cats. He's also immortal and the Son of Time. You might know him better as Lucifer, the Devourer of Souls, or the Devil. And with all the gods in Heaven about to go to war over the ownership of Earth, you're going to be extremely glad he's not exactly who legend makes him out to be.",
