  "description": "I Give My Eyes... is both spiritual autobiography and a story of healing and salvation. Author, artist, and museum curator Brian H. Peterson looks back on a creative life and reflects on his own search for the deeper layers, the substrata. In luminous, poetic prose, he ties together private and public, inward and outward journeys, struggling with the realities of advancing Parkinson s disease while discovering an affirmation of belief that embraces suffering and doubt.",
