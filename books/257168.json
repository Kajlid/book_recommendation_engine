  "title": "Three of Cups",
  "description": "“The three goddesses pictured on the Three of Cups tarot represent the virtues of Strength, Temperance and Justice and are pictured together raising their cups in a joint toast, connected almost to the point that they appear as one.”Three Mandy, a determined young mother, raises her son alone when husband Adam is drafted with the Army; Ginger, a lonely new bride waits for her husband Pete’s return from war; and Rachel, single and at the beginning her career, rallies for a new start when a high-pressured job gets the best of her.Against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, their stories begin in the early 1970s and converge almost thirty years later when a long-kept secret threatens to undo all their lives.Bridging their ties are the eccentric Millie, who mixes up vocabulary words and dabbles in the tarot; Mandy’s impersonal family that she strives to transcend; and Oodles and Poppy, Rachel’s grandparents, that provide the grounding she seeks.“Three of Cups” is the story of the unshakable bonds of female friendships. You’ll find yourself rooting for all three.",
