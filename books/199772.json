  "description": "It's my first day back at college and I've already screwed everything up...  Rule #16 â€“ A week isn't enough. It'll never be enough. Rule number one is null and void.  I know everyone says that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but to be completely honest, it just makes my heart hurt. I guess people say it because if you have too much of something, you'll end up growing sick of it, but...  That's not always true. Sometimes you love something so much that you want it all the time. You might have other options, but they aren't the same. Maybe they aren't good enough. Maybe nothing else will compare to the one thing you want beyond all else.  And that's how I feel about Ethan. Yes, he's just one person, but there's so much to him and I don't think it's even possible for me to grow tired of any of it.  We won't forget about each other, we're not going to stop talking to each other every day. We won't get too distracted or bogged down by everyday life, because he's important to me and I'm important to him, too.  Why does everything that can go wrong for us keep going so horribly horribly wrong, though? What the heck!  I didn't know having a boyfriend was this difficult. Considering my boyfriend is Ethan Colton, I probably should have realized it before now.  The weekend can't come soon enough...",
