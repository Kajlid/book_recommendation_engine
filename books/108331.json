When my brother and I -- plus our new dog -- end up in the story of Rapunzel, we can't resist climbing her hair. Oh no! Her smooth locks suddenly look like they've been attacked by a cheese grater. Maybe a trim will help...Snip, snip. SNIP. Oops. Now Rapunzel's hair is too short and we're trapped!So we have to:-Find the tower's secret door-Avoid getting swallowed by a giant spider-Locate Pickles (aka the prince)-Reunite Rapunzel with her parentsIf we don't untangle this knotty tale soon, we could be stuck in this mess for good!",
