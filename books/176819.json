  "description": "Rose wants to be a Country Music Singer more than anything in the world, but her career is moving way too slowly and she feels as though she'll never reach the top. She almost thinks of giving up her dream when she hears of a mysterious manager who has helped guide the careers of all the top female performers in the last decade. His methods are unconventional, however, and he introduces Rose to a new, dark world of sexuality she didn't realize even existed. Along the way, the two find themselves drawn to one another in ways much more than professional.  He pushes her limits and tests her inhibitions, but she is bound (literally) and determined to see this through. After all...  she'll do ANYTHING TO SING.  This is an erotic romance that is very explicit and for mature readers only. It contains Mf, FfM as well as MfM.",
