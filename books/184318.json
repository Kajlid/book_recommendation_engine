  "description": "Cass McKay has been called stubborn, temperamental, difficult, and that word that rhymes with “witch” more times than she cares to count. But that’s all about to pay off. She has finally landed the role she was born to play—Kate, in The Taming of the Shrew—in the summer apprentice program of a renowned Shakespeare theater company in the forests of Vermont.But Cass can barely lace up her corset before her troubles begin. The leading man, Drew, is a complete troll, and he’s going to ruin Cass’s summer. Even worse, Cass’s bunkmate Amy has somehow fallen head over heels for Drew. Eww! Cass can’t let Amy throw herself at a total jerk, though, so she comes up with a genius plan to give Drew the personality makeover he so desperately needs: she’ll tame Drew just as Petruchio tames Kate! But will her plan backfire as Shakespeare’s classic plays out offstage?",
