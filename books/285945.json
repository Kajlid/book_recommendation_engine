  "description": "When a silver fox veteran returns to his small town, he sets out to prove to one prickly farm owner, she has what he wants most: a second chance at her land and her heart. Beverly Townsen has pulled back from her mountain valley community, preferring the isolation of her farmhouse and her daily routine of viewing home improvement television programs. It's more than her frail body that prevents her from associating with others, but a fragile heart shattered more than once. When a personal renovation becomes mandatory, she's not so excited about the reality of life versus DIY cable shows. However, her new tenant isn't backing down from this extreme makeover. Jedd Flemming understands physical pain and personal loss, but it's never stopped him from bucking forward in life. A former military man and rodeo star, his life as a nomad comes to an end with false accusations and a family matter in his hometown. His absence has been long, but once returned, there's nothing he wants more than to reclaim what he's lost and maybe stake a claim on the elusive buzzing-bee female who holds a sliver of his heart.When faced with a challenge, sometimes deeds are louder than words, and Jedd's out to prove love is worth another go around the pasture for these forty-somethings.+ + +Love in Deed is the second of The Winters Sisters, romantic tales of silver foxes and feisty vixens in the Green Valley Public Library series, an imprint of Penny Reid's Smartypants Romance.",
