  "title": "Beyond Beliefs",
  "description": "Many people with a postmodern perspective are sincerely seeking their personal truth. In their search, they have rightly opened the door into personal, subjective experience as a legitimate way for humans to discover personal truth. For me, this means Our Present Time is a time to return to the experiences, beyond words, pointed to in the original writings of the first followers of Jesus. I describe in this book some personal, subjective experiences of my own. Those authors frequently describe their experiences of Jesus as just that, experiences beyond words. Ironically, they used words to point to experiences that are beyond words to describe. This book of words is for all of us who are seeking for more than just words.",
