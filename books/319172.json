  "description": "BluMy entire life is my music-and all the trappings that come with it. Sex, booze, and rock 'n' roll is all I ever wanted. Touring the world as the lead singer of Balefire, I have it all. Until on hiatus, I meet the girl next door.Ashleigh Baker is nothing like the groupies and celebrities who usually have all my attention. In her cute floppy hat with her knees stained with dirt, she spends her days creating a flowering show piece from her rented yard. She's the most gorgeous woman I've ever met, and she acts like she doesn't want a damn thing to do with me. But from the moment I laid eyes on her, she's all I can think about.AshleighGrowing up the only child of an Air Force Colonel, all I wanted was to stay in one place for more than a minute. When I score a pretty little house with a long-term lease, I just want to grow my flowers and my freelancing gig as a music reviewer. Then a loud Harley wakes me from a sound sleep and I discover my neighbor is Blu Connolly. Yeah, that Blu Connolly, lead singer for my favorite band Balefire. With his killer good looks and panty-melting voice, he's a walking temptation to sin. Though I do my best to avoid him, it seems Blu has other ideas. He's on a mission to wear me down, let him in, but what happens when he stops wanting to sing for me?",
