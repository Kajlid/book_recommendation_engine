  "description": "How do you make sense of a world in which right is wrong, evil is virtuous, and those you were taught were monsters are the ones truly worthy of saving? Jennifer's life was chaotic enough without having to leave home for college. Still reeling from her mother's untimely death, Jen resists the overwhelming urge to cling to life as she remembers and continues to press onward as she knows her mother would want. But as she hugs her dad goodbye, she has no idea that she will soon be thrust into a world she once thought existed only deep within her childhood imagination. When an ill-timed Samaritan mission goes awry, Jen finds herself stumbling through an unfamiliar land of quaint, friendly dwarves, a monstrous wolf, and blood-thirsty deceit. Is everything here as black and white as it seems, or must she simply look deeper to find the hidden shades of red?",
