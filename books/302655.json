His sexuality is confusing on a good day, and the one person he wants is the one person who can never know how he feels. Raphael is his uncle’s friend, he’s almost twenty years older, and he’s far too good for Dmitri to ever deserve him. Dmitri will suffer through his unrequited love, though, if it means keeping Raphael in his life. And yes, the pain of watching Raphael fall for someone else someday might just kill him, but knowing he’s happy will be worth it.Raphael Meyer’s entire life was lived in spite of many things.He walked in spite of the doctors telling his mother that he never would.
