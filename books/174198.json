But when his brother, laird of Foinaven Castle, leaves the family holdings dangerously unprotected, Hamish has no choice but to return and keep his clansmen safe.

And under his heated gaze, despite the danger swirling around them, Mairead finds herself tempted, taunted, and tantalizingly seduced . . . Contains mature themes.",
