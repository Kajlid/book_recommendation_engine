  "description": "Amy Candler is the perfect 12-year-old girl. She can do anything. She knows everything. But Amy doesn't have all the answers to the mystery of her past. All she knows is that her recurring nightmares seem so real. That her crescent-shaped birthmark wasn't there yesterday. That a strange man is taking photos of her. That her mother is acting weird. That someone is sending her anonymous warnings to keep her talents a secret. Slowly Amy is piecing together her identity, but she'd better hurry.",
