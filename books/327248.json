  "description": "There are two things you need to know about me. 1: I’m never late. And 2: I hate Christmas. Yes, I’m a girl who hates the holidays.My entire, enormous family is already enjoying their holiday vacation in Iceland, but thanks to my busy job and having to meet them there, I’m late. They could have chosen any holiday to fly across the world, but Christmas won, which sent me scrambling because the end of the year is my busiest time. It’s difficult to carve out moments to see the family at all.So, now, I’m forty thousand feet in the air, trying to get to Iceland before Christmas morning, all while also attempting to get some work done. If only the hot guy next to me would leave me be.Dylan says I should put the work away until after my holiday and relax a bit. And while his suggestion of spending some time together on the north Atlantic island seems preposterous, I can’t help but feel intrigued when he promises to show me how to enjoy the Yuletide season properly.After all, I can’t possibly spend every minute with my family.But how do I just shrug off my duty to my job and throw caution to the wind for a stranger...no matter how handsome he is? Because that’s something else about me: I never throw caution to the wind—even a beautiful, blustery Icelandic wind.Then again, Mama always said, “Never say never…”",
