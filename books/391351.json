  "description": "Our world is plagued by madness. With leaders bent on insane policies and too many citizens locked in crippling depression, normality seems elusive and questionable.Part travelogue, part indictment of mad medicine, 'Depresso' is Tom Freeman's hilarious journey through the vagaries of the system to emerge scathed but content with being 'bonkers'.The story unfolds over several years, in China and the UK, during which anti-depressants reduce Tom to a zombie and alternative therapies drive him to comic re-examinations of his life, his work and relationships.Throughout the adventure he is shadowed by the White Lizard, a familiar, a conscience, a pain in the arse who helps and hinders Tom's recovery, and is justly the butt of some wicked humour.'Depresso' is only semi-fictional.",
