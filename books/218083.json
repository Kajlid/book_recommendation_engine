  "title": "Magic and the Pagan",
  "description": "Enter into a world of magic, lust, love and betrayal. Evan Bartholomew lives life as a gay pagan with a deep interest in magic. Not wise choices in the small town he resides in. When he comes across a book of magic in an old bookstore, he fantasizes about the portrait of a man within its pages. The first time Evan attempts one of the spells in the book, he finds himself in a world he never knew existed, completely clueless. A world of demons, magic, a queen who wants to kill him, a king who lusts after him, and the man of his fantasies, Aidan Loriel. Warning, this title contains the explicit sex, graphic language, violence, hot gay men, a few elves, a demon, and a determined king. Oh, and magic thrown in for good measure.",
