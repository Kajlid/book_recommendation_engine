  "description": "All Leads Are Not Created Equal!Sales prospects are people who, with enough information, will be ready, willing, and able to buy your offering.There is a big difference between having a sales plan that generates \"junk leads\" and one that is designed to convert sales leads.The difference between “getting more business” and “getting more customers” is subtle, but will change your business completely when you grasp it. Getting more customers is very different than getting more business. It requires some very specific strategies to complete.This book will detail points of failure in many prospecting plans and give you concrete strategies that will “tighten up” your sales funnels and marketing materials, ensuring that you are not looking for business, but rather are attracting customers who can buy what you are selling.",
