  "title": "Tales of the Bodhisattva: The Khurran",
  "description": "Upon the wild planet Kaliya, a sloth-like race called the Khurran live peaceful lives in the trees and mountains. Many of the Khurran of Wild Mountain still worship the goddess Jesh, though few remember when she walked amongst the mortals. Another god is awakening, though not one that any living being would worship. Leaf, a young Khurran, is remembering the truth of who he truly is, for he is a bodhisattva; a being of light, reincarnated to counter the forces of darkness that emerge in the world. Reluctant to disrupt his peaceful and quiet life upon the mountain, he nonetheless must face his truth and look for other bodhisattvas in the world to teach him, for he has been chosen to stop the dark god, Rokkhu, and restore safety to the mortals and gods alike. In an epic journey, Leaf and his companions must unravel a spiral of dark deeds that began thousands of years ago, and that have only begun to come to their fruition.",
