  "title": "Heaven's Hunter",
  "description": "My brand new supernatural thriller, is an amazing tale of regret, guilt, betrayal, and redemption. Weaving myth with legend, and putting a biting twist on a little bit of history.  Our antagonist is discovered by an ancient order and pulled into service as a demon hunter. This ancient group through a pact made with heaven, works in the shadows to keep mankind from falling into utter darkness. Told through the eyes of our hero. We follow him along as he tries to atone for past sins.  In the name of goodness, he must do terrible things, in order to protect others, and to earn his own redemption. Will he be able to stop an evil so powerful it could throw open the very gates of hell? Or will the darkness of someone close to him be to much to over come?  Humans fear him, and heaven no longer knows him. His life is marred by sorrow and pain. But unless death claims him, he will spend eternity as Heavens Hunter.",
