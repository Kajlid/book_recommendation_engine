  "description": "Jill Danvers left Bluebonnet Falls ten years ago and never expected to go back. When Gabe Carter, the love of her life, married someone else she took the pieces of her shattered heart and ran as fast and as far as she could. But Gabe is chairing The Falls' bicentennial celebration and the magazine Jill writes for has assigned her to do a piece on it. The minute she walks into Gabe's office she discovers two things-she's as hot for him as she ever was, and Gabe isn't married. Their feelings for each other explode and they heat up the nights, the sex hotter and more erotic than either thought possible. But there are still a lot of obstacles in their path. The former Mrs. Carter comes home determined to reclaim Gabe for herself and a nasty scandal is brewing over a new development meant to put Bluebonnet Falls on the map. A scandal that could involve everyone.",
