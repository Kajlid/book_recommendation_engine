  "description": "With the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act a bridge of enforcement was developed transmitting National policy into local action—enforcement of Prohibition became the responsibility of Federal, County, and local police agencies. In towns, counties and states across the country individuals ignored these laws in the pursuit of profits, because of cultural imperatives, or out of the sheer desire to secure their liberty. Law enforcement faced an uphill battle—understaffed and underfunded, they tried to bring a largely unwilling population into compliance with national laws.BOOTLEGGERS, BOOZE, AND BUSTS explores the development, enforcement, resistance, and repeal of Prohibition in Kern County, California.
