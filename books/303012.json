Now, I’m two years sober, in a new country, and looking for a fresh start.But my noisy, upstairs neighbor is testing the limits of my sobriety. He’s either watching an adult film marathon, harboring a hooker, or performing an exorcism in his flat.Regardless, I don’t need beer goggles to see that Silas Graves is the finest bloke I’ve ever laid eyes on.Silas\nHello, my name is Silas, and I’m going blind.\nAs a struggling actor, I’ve taken a lot of crummy roles.

And oh, how I love pretending to be fully sighted.Honestly, I deserve an Emmy.But truth be told, all of this has left me feeling nothing but empty.Maybe it’s time to stop hiding and chase after what I want.And what I want is the girl downstairs.",
