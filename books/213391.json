  "description": "Crash n Carry is the astonishing true story of the rise and rise of the ramraider. In this startling investigation, top true crime writer Stephen Richards reveals the shocking truth. He shows that far from being just petty chancers, ramraiders are in fact part of highly organized gangs, masterminded by career criminals who systematically select and raid their targets. In these pages and in their own words, reformed ramraiders talk about how they pulled off some of the most audacious robberies in criminal history, what drove them to do it, and how they managed to evade the law for so long. Action-packed and told in Richards' inimitable style, this is the ultimate book about one of the most dangerous crime waves ever to sweep the country.",
