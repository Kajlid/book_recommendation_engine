  "title": "Niles Dreamer",
  "description": "Do we write our own stories or are they forced upon us by destiny? Do we choose or are we chosen? After fleeing his home and country, Niles is befriended by a wolf, falls in love with a witch, and is brutally whipped in a public square--- and this is only the start of his journey. Unexpected and unlikely events, the help and opposition of strangers, and his own erratic behavior pull Niles toward an unlikely fate he neither wants nor chooses, a fate he may be too flawed to fulfill.. Full of memorable characters and driven by powerful storytelling, Niles Dreamer is an ambitious, subversive, eminently readable take on the hero's journey.",
