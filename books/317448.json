  "description": "He has nothing to live for.Zak Hendricks has a reputation—a black-ops soldier willing to take on the hardest, dirtiest, most suicidal missions. But when his final mission goes sideways, he's discharged back to his hometown of Steam Valley, CA, with half a leg and a bad attitude.She has everything to fight for.Dog trainer Anna Rawlings has done her level best to avoid Zak since he crushed her teenage heart, but then he's court-ordered to enroll in her Paws for Vets program at Redwood Coast Rescue, and she has no choice but to help him. Because if she can't rehabilitate the town's most notorious bad boy, she'll lose everything she’s worked so hard to build.Can an unpredictable K9, marked for death, rescue them both?Zak doesn't want a service animal any more than Ranger, a former military working dog, wants to become one, but they both love Anna. When a missing persons case lands her in the crosshairs of an obsessive killer, the damaged soldier and unruly K9 have to learn to trust each other—and the entire Redwood Coast Rescue team—if they have any chance of rescuing her.Searching for Rescue is the first book in the Redwood Coast Rescue romantic suspense series, but it can be read as a standalone.
