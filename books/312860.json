  "description": "Lucy started at year 11 in a new country town school where she met a boy called Sam. They became really good friends. However, she was uncertain when she started to have feelings for him. After all, he was a teenage human, and she was an immortal werewolf who had already left her teenage years behind. She stopped aging at eighteen, so being attracted to a teenager was acceptable, right? Or was it?But that wasn’t her biggest problem. She eventually found out Sam’s parents were werewolf hunters. Her little dilemma had now become a life-threatening situation where staying in town may not be an option. Finding refuge with other werewolves would be her best option, but where would she find any, and could she really let go of Sam?",
