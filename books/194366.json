  "description": "You remember when you were a kid and on the first day of school the teacher made you stand up in front of the class and introduce yourself to everyone? I hated that teacher.  If this were to happen to me now, I´d still hate this. What can I say to sound even remotely interesting? Hello, my name is Hayley Allen. I'm twenty-eight years old, I live in California and I´m an ex-cop turned bounty hunter. I’m great with guns, a martial arts pro and I have a very weird obsession with Mexican food. Also, lately I have seem to develop a second, not so weird, obsession with a huge, muscled, gorgeous, ex-army, green eyed creature that is driving me up the wall with his overprotectiveness, making me melt with his kindness and shiver with his intensity.  I like my life simple. I work, I eat, I hang out with my friends, I have a beer here and there, and well, this complication right here is about to mess everything up either in a good way, or in a bad way. That part is still up for debate.",
