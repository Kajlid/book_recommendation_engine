  "title": "Heroes Mentors and Friends",
  "description": "People come and go in our lives. Over the years I have come to define those who touch our souls as heroes, mentors or friends, but in reality, I believe they are spiritual guides sent to us by a higher power. Once we recognize their inherent divinity and open to their influence, our spirits resonate at a higher level. Some call these special souls angels. This book gives the reader a profound insight into these beings and their miraculous influence on our lives. Heartwarming stories of courage, small acts of kindness and most of all, love, will bring a better understanding of the power they derive from our Source. Come share the miracle of synchronicity. Trust in the flow of God's love as shown by these messengers of hope. You may discover that you too are making a difference in someone's life as a Hero, Mentor or Friend.",
