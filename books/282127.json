  "description": "Adrian Clarke quickly discovered there were drawbacks to playing the hero from the bestselling romance trilogy of all time. It was difficult to have any privacy when everyone knew who you were.  Casey Smythe knew nothing about Hollywood heartthrobs or celebrity gossip. The beautiful college student had plenty of other things to keep her busy, including the dogs she was paid to play with in the park.  Little did she know, the handsome man she tried to get fired after he swore at one of her favorite dogs wasn’t a dog walker at all. He was Hollywood’s newest sensation and Duke’s owner.  And now his sights were set on the one woman who couldn’t care less about his fame.",
