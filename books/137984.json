  "description": "Distinguished British aristocrat Edmund Gurney steps into the Spiritualist circle of young Ava Godfrey, as she takes her first steps toward letting her psychic secret out. Gurney, cofounder of the Society for Psychical Research, lets Ava in on some important discoveries heâ€™s made in his research and helps Ava understand her gift. As her abilities grow, Ava learns more about her long-absent father than she ever wanted to know, but it is not enough to help heal the wounds in her fractured family. A man enshrouded in smoke and mystery lurks on the periphery, and a handsome acquaintance resurfaces, upheaving the life she's only just established in Boston. Surrounded only by new people and friends, Ava realizes she must depend on her abilities if she is ever to know who can be trusted.",
