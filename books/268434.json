Excerpt from Faith Lifting Prayers ï»¿Dear God Grant me the courage to face myself And to give myself the permission to use my voice For so many years My inadequacy has bound my tongue Inhibited my speech And the things that I have wanted to say Have been stuck in my throat Words that needed to be heard Lose their way on my tongue So I swallow the words that are lost And try to find new ones I feel anxiety As people try to complete my sentences Wanting a sentence to slip through my lips But somehow it clings to my teeth My words are drowned out By fear of being judged and laughed at But I have a voice that needs to be heard We all do As my voice finds its way From my heart to my lips And to the ears that are listening May it be nourished and shaped by self-acceptance I give thanks for my ability to speak my truth And even though it isn't as smooth as I would like it to be It is my voice and I own it My words belong to me And I will no longer judge how they leave my mouth But bless them because they belong to me Thank you Amen(Hardcover with dust jacket)",
