  "description": "Hilarious and surprising sequel to the 2017 Purple Dragonfly prize winning young adult novel Maya's Magical Adventures. Join Maya, her rather grumpy and unhelpful cat Mischief, dragon Blink and friends on another laugh-out-loud mystery as she comes face to face with magical and terrifying foes on an impossible quest to restore her friend's magic bone and with it her powers. To find and restore the lost magic bone and defeat her enemies, Maya and her friends must gather the ingredients for the impossible spell, each of which, naturally enough, it is impossible to find or does not exist. So if you want to find out how to find something that cannot be found, gather ingredients that do not exist and cast an impossible spell that can never be cast ... Stop! Don't read this. It's impossible!",
