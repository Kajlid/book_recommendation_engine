  "description": "Hee-So's stuck with Sae-Bom on cooking duty at the Scouts' joint volunteer outing at a local orphanage, ruining her chances of showing off in front of Won-Jun! And Sae-Bom's no help either, 'cos she's too busy making lunch for her dearest Whie-Young! Suddenly, it occurs to Hee-So that making lunch for Won-Jun might not be such a bad idea. But when the two girls go to make their special deliveries, a dangerous accident threatens both their lives. And in the heat of the moment, Won-Jun, who witnesses the accident, takes a most unexpected course of action. Has he gone and irreparably crushed Hee-So's dreams? Will Whie-Young be able to pick up the pieces?",
