(Recipe included) \n   Witness acts declared illegal in the state of Texas!  \n   Cheer as our heroes rise to the challenges of yesterday’s future…  With solar-powered rocket packs! \n Captain Hairdo Conquers the Cosmos is an oddball classic retro science fiction inspired comedy, where the wonders of yesteryear meets the unbridled raunchiness of '90s gross-out humor.",
