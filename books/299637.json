  "description": "I may look tough, but my heart lies in my bakery, and I’m old enough to know better than to get hung up on a twenty-year-old twink, but he’s just my type. Problem is, he’s scared of bigger guys. He needs guidance and protection, the kind I crave to give my subs. I’d never hurt him, and he needs to know that.Heath is as prickly as they come, and for some reason he can’t believe that I’d want him in my bed. When I find out he’s a virgin it makes me hotter than I’ve ever been. I want to teach him everything. I want him to be mine.He follows every instruction like he was a born submissive, and while most of me wants to watch him flourish under my instruction, I can’t help but remember how poorly relationship ended with my last sub. I know I won’t find Heath in another Dom’s bed. But am I ready to risk my heart again and trust that he’s in this just as deep as me?",
