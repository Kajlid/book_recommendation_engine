  "description": "The funny, sad, super-honest, all-true story of Chelsea Handler's year of self-discovery--featuring a nerdily brilliant psychiatrist, a shaman, four Chow Chows, some well-placed security cameras, various family members (living and departed), friends, assistants, and a lot of edibles.In a haze of vape smoke on a rare windy night in L.A. in the fall of 2016, Chelsea Handler daydreams about what life will be like with a woman in the White House. And then, Donald Trump happens. In a torpor of despair, she decides that she's had enough of the privileged bubble she's lived in--a bubble within a bubble--and that it's time to make some changes, both in her personal life and in the world at large.At home, she embarks on a year of self-sufficiency--learning how to work the remote, how to pick up dog shit, where to find the toaster. She meets her match in an earnest, brainy psychiatrist and enters into therapy, prepared to do the heavy lifting required to look within and make sense of a childhood marked by love and loss and to figure out why people are afraid of her. She becomes politically active--finding her voice as an advocate for change, having difficult conversations, and energizing her base. In the process, she develops a healthy fixation on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and, through unflinching self-reflection and psychological excavation, she unearths some glittering truths that light up the road ahead.Thrillingly honest, insightful, and deeply, darkly funny, Chelsea Handler has written a memoir that keeps readers laughing, even as it inspires us to look within and ask ourselves what really matters in our own lives.Advance praise for \nLife Will Be the Death of Me\n\"You thought you knew Chelsea Handler--and she thought she knew herself--but in her new book, she discovers that true progress lies in the direction we haven't been.\"--Gloria Steinem \"I always wondered what it would be like to watch Chelsea Handler in session with her therapist. Now I know.\"--Ellen DeGeneres\"I love this book not just because it made me laugh or because I learned that I feel the same way about certain people in politics as Chelsea does. I love this book because I feel like I finally really got to know Chelsea Handler after all these years. Thank you for sharing, Chelsea!\"--Tiffany Haddish",
