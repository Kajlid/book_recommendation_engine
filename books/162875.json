I attended a house-warming party three weeks ago, and bumped into a friend I had not seen in a few months.He looked incredibly fit - I asked what he has been doing to get into such great shape... He replied \"I've been on a Paleo diet - I feel better than I have in years...and I've lost 30 pounds.\" That certainly caught my attention.Beth Gabriel has a knack for releasing just the right book at just the right time, and \"Paleo Gluten Free Cooker Crock Pot Easy and Delicious...\" proves it once again.The \"Easy Crockpot Chicken Salsa\" is a FANTASTIC recipe! The \"Chorizo Stuffed Poblano Peppers\" is a HEALTHY and EASY solution for football fans on a lazy Sunday (or anytime). And the \"PIzza Lasagna\" is a welcome and much needed Gluten Free alternative for a nation obsessed with eating pizza (myself included).She even includes recipes for Gluten Free Appetizers (like \"Sesame Crisp Crackers\") and seasonal Deserts (like \"Crunchy Apple Cinnamon Flips\"). Two Thumbs Up - way up!\" Brock Allen",
