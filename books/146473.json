  "title": "Egg Heaven: Stories",
  "description": "Living the un-glamorous life in Southern California, diner waitresses and their customers collide, coexist, sometimes offer solace along with grilled cheese sandwiches or chorizo-scrambled eggs. These haunting, lyrical tales feature lost mothers, runaway mothers, mother-substitutes. Daughters fleeing their old lives and waiting to build new ones. Men and women worn down with disappointment who still manage to form connections with each other, share moments of joy. The author, who spent almost a decade working as a waitress, portrays her subjects with respect and compassion.",
