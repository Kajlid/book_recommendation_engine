  "description": "Bored with the monotony of her everyday life, Rachel Adams makes a reckless mistake that tumbles her into the middle of a Cattleman’s fantasy.A wild night of devilish pleasure with Killian Kregor and Adam Whitman may be enough to satisfy Rachel’s carnal fantasies, but it only whets the deputies' appetite for more.Not about to take no for an answer, Killian and Adam hold nothing back as they lure Rachel into giving in to their darkest desires. Being unable to resist the pleasure that the deputies offer doesn’t mean Rachel has trouble defying them whenever it suits her.That’s not something either Killian or Adam will tolerate. Rachel is theirs, which means she obeys. Losing this battle isn’t an option for the deputies. Winning against the hard-headed woman, though, seems impossible.Killian and Adam are going to need a whole lot more than ropes and toys if they truly want to seduce Rachel. They’re going to need a plan.This mega-length version has been extensively rewritten and is at 130,000 words. (The short version of Rachel's Seduction at 23,000 words is available in Tasty Treats, Volume 1 Anthology.)",
