  "description": "After escaping an abusive eight year relationship, Joey Harkin is rebuilding his life. He keeps a low profile, does his job, and each day things get a little better. Until the day he reports his team leader to the department manager and he finds himself summoned to the Managing Director's office.  Rick Southwell has a good life. He's a successful business man with a close circle of friends and when he needs something more ... stimulating... there's always the boys at the club. All of them willing to act out whatever scene Daddy Rick asks for. He has no interest in anything deep or permanent. Until the night he has to rescue Joey Harkin - the man Rick has just promoted - from being beaten up.  As Rick begins to unravel Joey's story, it doesn't take long for his natural instincts surface and he wants just one thing: to protect and care for Joey. Getting Joey to trust him turns out to be the easy part. Getting Joey to let go of his fear and embrace his new life is much more challenging.
