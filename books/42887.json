The other half, she thinks that’s crazy. Definitely shrink worthy. Certifiably insane. And yet...her list of perfectly timed songs continues to grow.  Michael Casey was her best friend until he disappeared eight years ago. Now he's back with a streetwise gleam in his eyes, a mysterious Archangel tattoo, and a fervent wish for a fresh start. But when Michael’s fresh start is cut short by his tragic death and his spirit becomes trapped in the woods in which he died, Catherine makes it her mission to free him. She thinks the only way to do that is by helping him face his past--a past Michael is desperate to keep hidden.  As Catherine digs deeper into Michael's past, her own world starts to fall apart and the demon fraught nightmares she had as a child return. She soon begins to wonder if her music-loving Angel has a counterpart. A much darker one.  Let the war within begin…",
