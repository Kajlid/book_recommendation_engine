  "description": "The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which had been growing for more than a generation before building toward the climactic witch trials. \"Salem Possessed explores the lives of the men and women who helped spin that web and who in the end found themselves entagled in it.",
