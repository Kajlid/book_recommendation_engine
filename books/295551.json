  "description": "I didn't want to move to this dumpy, cold rural town. Then again, I didn't want to lose my entire family either. We never get want we want.My aunt told me to stay away from those 'Academy Boys', that something was different about them; something wrong. I know she means well, but I'm not a baby. When Justin gets me accepted into that fancy school of his, I figured it could be a fresh start.I just have to ignore how everyone stares at me, almost as if they're waiting for something to happen. There's an order to things here; a hierarchy. I'm struggling to find where I fit in to all of this. And this old man keeps appearing in my dreams, calling out for help. He babbles about archangels and demons.None of that is real, though. It can't be. That would be utterly ridiculous.\"So, I couldn't put it down. I finished it yesterday evening. I should've been painting yesterday but I blew that off. It was the perfect book, perfect genre to get lose in right now. Is the sequel in the works?\"-Kelly L., MissouriI've just finished this book and absolutely loved it. I was engrossed in the story from start to finish. Would definitely recommend, even if you're not usually a fan of the genre like me. I'm looking forward to book 2! :)-Elizabeth H.",
