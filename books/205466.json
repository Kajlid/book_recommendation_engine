  "description": "Cousins Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, Jr. are collectively known by their media epithet “The Hillside Strangler”. These two men were responsible for the murders of at least nine females, ages 12 to 28, during the late 1970s in Los Angeles, California, and Bianchi killed two more in Washington. After their first three victims did not gain much attention because they were prostitutes, Bianchi and Buono decided to abduct and murder middle-class “nice” girls. Five victims were found on hillsides in the Glendale-Highland Park area during Thanksgiving weekend in 1977 and the resulting panic led to the coining of the moniker “Hillside Strangler”.",
