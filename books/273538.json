  "title": "Bob Logan: Gunman at large",
  "description": "You might say, the Civil War gave birth to Bob Logan. A teenage boy on the cusp of manhood, he’s already a manhunter exposed to the horrors of war. Working for a Scotsman named Allan Pinkerton, he’ll leave his past behind for an uncertain future in the west. As a Pinkerton man his identity must be adaptable to match the ever-changing circumstances. His introduction to life on the lawless frontier brings him into contact with James Butler Hickock and William F. Cody. Encounters with hostile Indians, men with lingering post war hatred, and the ever-present threat of sudden death, mold him in ways he couldn’t imagine. So do the charms of a blue eyed, blonde-haired maiden. In a time and place where a young man must grow up fast, he earns the nickname, ‘Bloody’ Bob Logan. With a job description to be one person one day and another the next, will anyone know who he really is? Does he know himself? Set in the days of American Reconstruction after the Civil War, Bob Logan is another thrilling novel for fans of Dan Arnold, Louis L’ Amour, Robert B. Parker or Elmore Leonard, with a touch of Larry McMurtry for good measure.",
