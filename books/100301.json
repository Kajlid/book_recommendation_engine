  "description": "Lucien Bryland distrusts women. Nevertheless, he has fallen in love with Clara Harkham, the woman he has been betrothed to since childhood. He knows her to be a flirtatious and thoughtless woman, though he first believed her to be genuine and true. At the tender age of 16 he gave her his heart, only to have it broken by her careless disregard for his feelings. Of course, Clara has been in love with Lucien since childhood, but Lucien has a maddening way of surprising her at the most indelicate moments--particularly when she is spurning the embrace of a would-be suitor who has come calling. Though the misunderstandings are thick, the two will marry; Clara is determined to find the kind, gentle person she once knew Lucien to be, and Lucien is determined to never let his heart be vulnerable again.",
