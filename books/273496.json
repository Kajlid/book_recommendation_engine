But three players have captured my focus—and now, my heart.Before them, the idea that I could care about anything more than football was inconceivable. And I never would’ve allowed one man to threaten my dreams, let alone three. Then again, I’d never met anyone like Xavier, Colt, and Tristan.They want me to call the plays both on and off the field. Now I’m forced to decide whether to chase the glass slipper or keep charging through the glass sideline.*Calling the Plays is the third, and final, book in The Rebels Series, a reverse harem romance.*",
