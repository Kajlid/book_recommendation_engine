  "description": "Fate is a fickle mistress. She gives as easily as she takes and she makes no apologies for it.When I’m on the precipice of an inconceivable loss, and a betrayal slices me wide open, I have a decision to make.I can stay the polite, subservient girl.Or I can shed my societal restraints and become the person I was destined to be. With my dark Italian kings by my side, we don’t just change the rules, we remake the whole game.Gone is the girl with stars in her eyes, and in her place is a woman with vengeance in her veins.It’s time I stop asking for permission and start claiming what’s mine.The conclusion to the Five Families series",
