  "description": "Raymond McClure is without a doubt a lucky man. But has he found himself with an abundance of good luck or bad luck? A power failure throws Ray into a tailspin that ultimately costs him his job. In the process he buys a lottery ticket on a whim. That evening Ray finds out he is the winner of a $216 Million jackpot. Unfortunately he has misplaced the ticket. A day at the grocery store, however, gives him new focusâ€”the chance to give rather than take. Ray volunteers at an elementary school and an eight-year-old Japanese girl helps to turn his life around. Join Raymond McClure on this roller coaster ride through joy and misfortune, incarceration and celebration, love and hate, loss and treasure.",
