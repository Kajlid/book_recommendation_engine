The cat eyeliner with exaggerated lashes and the red lipstick on my porcelain face make the forties inspired look reach perfection.I enjoy being a pin-up model…C. Michelle’s vibrant debut novel, Pinned Up is full of snappy dialogue, edgy humor, and a lot of heart. This fun look into the world of a modern-day pin-up model is one wild ride!Twenty-five-year-old Nina Moretti lives a double life of sorts. She’s a victim advocate during the day and as a side gig, lives out her 1940s fetish as a pin-up model in San Francisco, California. While she may not “do” serious relationships, she has fulfillment in her work and hanging out with her best friend, Kade—the greatest sidekick any woman could possibly want. All is well in Nina’s hectic, but satisfying life…That is, until she meets Josh, a stunningly handsome man who has a notorious reputation as a ladies’ man. For his part, Josh is reluctant to commit to any woman, largely due to his loving, yet overbearing mother. Nina, however, sparks his interest in a way that no other woman has before. As they navigate the pitfalls of romantic entanglement, both come to realize their pasts are intertwined in ways they could never imagine. Perhaps, they have more in common than just their fear of relationships. What are two people afraid of commitment supposed to do?",
