  "description": "On her birthday, as Kiki Kittie is making her wish, a pile of fashion magazines tumble on her head and voila! Fashion Kitty is born. As such, she helps other kittens with their wardrobe dilemmas and with their interactions with their peers. The story, though seemingly simplistic, touches upon a variety of themes including bullying, self-esteem, and family relationships. Fashion Kitty is a sassy, smart animal who, though concerned with haute couture, still has substance. Primarily illustrated through a variety of pinks and grays in a cartoon style, the pictures are artistically appealing and visually spectacular.",
