  "description": "Kedean's saddled with a deceptively simple task: deliver a bride-to-be to her fiancée across the sea. The complication? The \"bride\" is a nobleman, temporarily cursed with a woman's body, who's none too pleased with the arrangement—he does, however, take a quick liking to Kedean.Whatever Kedean expected when he signed up for this job, attending to the every whim of a moody, arrogant, and sometimes suicidal nobleman with a bad case of a witch's curse was not it — nevermind falling in love with him.\nStatus:\n Complete\nWord Count:\n approx. 204,292",
