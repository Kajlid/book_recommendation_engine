  "description": "Kenneth C. Davis's Don't Know Much About History transformed the line of a Simon & Garfunkel lyric first into a resilient bestseller and then into a hit series. In America's Hidden History, he ventures into America's much-mythologized colonial history with the same light touch that made his earlier episodic narratives so popular.",
