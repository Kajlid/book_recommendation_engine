  "description": "When stones fall from the sky . . . Old Herne is terrorising Forest Gate, and the London police are stumped. For three months his victims have been found dead at the church down Cernunnos Lane, their bodies brutalised beyond recognition. Leading the investigation is Oscar. He is yet to uncover one single clue that reveals the killer's identity or his motives. He does, however, have the prestigious honour of being the only person to have seen Old Herne and lived . . . trouble is, Oscar can't remember what he saw, and now he has been kicked off the case. However, Oscar isn't deterred. Dogged by nightmares and visions of shadowy monsters, he becomes obsessed in his pursuit of the killer and the truth behind his lost memories. But even he couldn't guess that Old Herne's origins hark back to the turn of the first millennium, and a legacy left by the man who dared to meddle with stones from the sky.",
