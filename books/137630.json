  "description": "Joe 'Tiny' Taylor is a big man with a big heart; he's also the hit man and enforcer for The Freaks MC. He's all about family, whether it's his brothers in the club or the women at home, Joe takes care of them all. But that's where it gets complicated. Between his crazy ex Maria, her younger sister Beth and his mother, there's more to negotiate than in the deepest workings of the outlaw life. But there's one shining light that always holds true for him, his North Star, the one that keeps the darkness at bay. Amy, Maria's young daughter. It's a delicate balancing act, and it's down to Joe to keep it all together, but someone threw away the manual.",
