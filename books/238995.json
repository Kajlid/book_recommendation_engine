  "description": "Since all of her hopes were dashed, Maya is struggling to adapt to her new life. Where dreams and wishes once kept her going now there is only the burning desire for revenge. She's changing, hardening into the person she needs to be to hold it together but sometimes the cracks still show. She wants nothing more than to go back and become the person she used to be but sometimes she can't even remember who that was. Nothing will be right again until she resets the balance. Blood will pay for blood and she won't give up until the final drop has been spilled. Some say she's taking it too far, others say it isn't far enough.",
