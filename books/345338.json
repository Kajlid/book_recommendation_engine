  "description": "Sylvio spent the past decade banished from Simare’s court, stripped of land, ancestral home and title – from Minister of National Security to back-country bowyer. But not any bowyer; Sylvio creates bows from laminations of wood and human bone, bows that are said to speak, bows known as the legendary arcossi. And now, after a decade, he is called back to the capitol, summoned by his Prince whom he suspects is a patricide and insane. His very life is in danger and with it the country he has served through all his days. From Mountains of Ice is a story of love, endurance and the meaning of honour. From Mountains of Ice is an entertaining and original fantasy from Lorina Stephens, highly recommended. -Midwest Book Review …a non-stop ride filled with surprises at every turn. -The Little Red Reviewer Among the best fantasy books I’ve read in quite some time. -Brian Rathbone The Dawning of Power",
