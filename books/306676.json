  "description": "The first three books of one of our best poets, including her National Book Award-winning volume Presentation Piece , plus Separations and Taking Notice . The wonder of Marilyn Hacker's poems...is that she insists upon the rawness of experience and the metamorphosis of form with equal fervor and makes them both speak with the same voice. The result, again and again, is a poem of intense intimacy, beauty and authority.\"â€•W. S. Merwin",
