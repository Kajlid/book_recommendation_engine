  "title": "Kerby: Funny tales from a 1990's Scottish childhood",
  "description": "WARNING: Contains explicit content and strong language. Not for the easily offended!  Ever stood on the opposite pavement from a friend and launched a ball at their kerb for points?  Still feel guilty about the Tamagotchi you starved to death?  Disappointed 2015 hasn’t brought hoverboards, self-drying jackets and flying Deloreans?  Remember swapping your doublers of McCoist and Leighton for that elusive Celtic badge shiny?  Then grab a copy of KERBY and relive the 1990s!  In his hilarious first book, Graeme Johnston looks back on what childhood in Scotland was like in the days when Neil Buchanan was everyone’s favourite artist, an empty Irn-Bru bottle was worth 20p and even the humble Nokia 3310 hadn’t been invented yet - with cringeworthy stories of classroom vomiting, diarrhea disasters and flagrant disregard for “NO BALL GAMES” signs, KERBY is sure to strike a chord with grown-up kids everywhere.",
