  "description": "Adam was infected at a very young age, and the one thing he's always known he must do, the one rule he's had since childhood is this: don't infect anyone else. No blood, no saliva, nothing.That also means Adam has also never had sex. It was sacrifice he was willing to make to keep the people around him safe. But Adam is, after all, only human, and humans make mistakes. And boy, as mistakes go, the hot cowboy who sauntered into the bar was definitely a big one. Now Adam is stuck with a dilemma - tell the man he's just infected, or run?",
