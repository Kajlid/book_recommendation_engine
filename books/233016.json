  "description": "ULTRA+VIOLENCENoun Random acts of violence with no justification. Unprovoked, usually brutal. Done simply for thrill and entertainment. A sick infatuation. A volatile obsession, And a rising body count.This isn't your typical love story. ***Warning*** This is a dark erotic thriller. It is strange, ugly, and dirty. These characters have a f**ked moral compass. You may hate one or both of them. I remained true to their personalities from start to finish. This book contains scenes of graphic violence, harsh language, and dirty kinky sex scenes.",
