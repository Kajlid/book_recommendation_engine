  "description": "Alternate cover for ASIN B00I56FLPKWith Blood Prize, Ken Grace has crafted a masterful, high-stakes story of absolute imagination. Thrilling action, gripping suspense and a devastating secret, ensure a breath-taking adventure that is impossible to put down. It’s 5am and Tom Fox is running, trying to save his life, but he can’t escape the images that revisit his mind; vivid pictures of a woman with her throat torn open and the mutilation of a young man in a back alley of London. Tom is on everyone’s most wanted list, yet he’s no felon. He flees, hunted like his father for what he knows. If Tom is to survive, he must locate an alien technology called the Prize, before it falls into the hands of the despots who are chasing him ... and leaves the world irretrievably altered. Author’s Warning: I have to caution you. If you open Blood Prize and begin to read, you will be in great danger and you won’t be able to turn back. Once it begins, your heart will start to race and your chest will tighten. Every rustle and alien noise will raise your anxiety. How could you ever relax knowing she’s out there? I can understand your skepticism. They’re just characters in a story you say. How could they possibly hurt me? Why? Because my dark ideas have come to fruition. Once the story of the Blood Prize is in your head, the characters are just as real as anything in your experience. You’ll feel what Tom feels … The fear, the hopelessness and eventually the power to fight back. Now that you’ve begun, I can only hope you’re brave enough to see the journey through to its conclusion. You’ve gained incredible new-found powers along the way, but can you handle it? You’ve become something unrecognisable … something not of this world. I can only hope that you win the Prize and save us all.",
