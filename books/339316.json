  "title": "Resurrection: Glen Canyon and a New Vision for the American West",
  "description": "Writer Annette McGivney explores the controversy and the history of water politics in the American Southwest through the lens of the re-emergence of Glen Canyon due to an ongoing drought. More than 125 large images by photographer James Kay capture the beauty of the legendary canyons of Glen Canyon as they emerge into the light of day for the first time in nearly 40 years. Each chapter opens with a journal excerpt that personalizes the Glen Canyon story, and the book concludes with a list of recommended hikes in the area that will draw outdoor enthusiasts to reemerging attractions.Throughout her account, McGivney stresses the need for a new model of living in the American West -- the U.S. Department of the Interior must shift its water policy to meet changing needs and Americans must live more sustainably, especially in the arid West.Resurrection eloquently demonstrates why Americans should stand behind the renewal of Glen Canyon and accord it protection as a national park-both to honor the area as a national treasure and to preserve it for future generations.* Published in partnership with Glen Canyon Institute, an NGO with a membership of 3,000 dedicated to making Glen Canyon a national park* Includes an appendix of recommended hikes",
