  "description": "It is the summer of 1943, and Rosie Ewing is leaving on her second mission to German-occupied France. She's a Special Operations Executive agent and a radio operator. Her brief is to set up a new network in Rouen, where the one agent still at large is suspected of having betrayed his colleagues. She's to be dropped off by a gunboat in a remote cove on the Brittany coast. She then has to get to Paris by train, carrying forged papers, a radio transceiver, and more than a million francs in cash. Terrifyingly vulnerable, she knows the dangers of a second's carelessness and the consequences of crumbling under the force of Gestapo torture.",
