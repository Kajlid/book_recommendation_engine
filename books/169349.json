The third demands power--and slaves. Maurice and Seth find themselves targets, and to outwit these monsters, they must learn the shocking and unwholesome lore of the supernatural.Of Love and Vampires is the first volume in the Wound of the Rose Trilogy, a gay romance and paranormal adventure series.",
