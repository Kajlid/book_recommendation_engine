  "description": "In a world where fairytales keep coming to life, there’s a bureau dedicated to helping the victims caught up in the Grimm Effect. But sometimes even those investigators fall prey to a happily ever after…The big, bad wolf is about to go down.Through sheer determination—and a whole lot of stubbornness—I, Blanche Hood, managed to evade the Red-Cap curse. Unlike my mom, I didn’t fall for the huntsman or get eaten by the wolf, but I did gain a purpose. I became an agent for the Fairytale Bureau. My job? Countering the ugly side of the Grimm Effect.My latest case involves a string of murders by a wolf, but I keep getting distracted by my neighbor. I will resist his growly voice. I will not notice the way his muscles bulge. I don’t have time for romance because I need to focus on my job, especially since the perpetrator is taunting me. The killer is asking for a showdown, and he’s going to get it. He won’t be able to resist when I don my red hood to act as bait.Things don’t quite go as planned. Turns out the wolf was under my nose this entire time. By the time I discover the truth, it’s too late. Too late to lament the fact I was played. Too late to regret what could have been, and when I foolishly walk into a trap, it will take a miracle to save me. But everyone knows the Brothers Grimm stories don’t always have happily-ever-afters.If only love truly could break the curse.",
