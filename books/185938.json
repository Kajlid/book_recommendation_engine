  "description": "Looks can be deceiving.I knew that most people took one look at the ink and the impossibly big and strong body it covered and decided I was a brawler…a bruiser…a beast. However, I was hardwired to be a thinker, not a fighter—my mind being my greatest weapon and my biggest weakness.I should have chosen to use my brain and talents to be one of the good guys, a hero, a man with dignity and worth.I turned my back on dignity and sold my soul to the highest bidder, deciding to dance with the devil, instead.I couldn’t figure out how to help myself, so there was zero chance I knew how to save someone else.That someone else was Noe Lee. She was the unkempt, unruly thief who was just as smart as I was and twice as street savvy. She was annoyingly adorable beneath the dirt and grime and she was in trouble. In way over her head, I told myself it wasn’t my job to keep her from drowning. In the Point, it was sink or swim and I wasn’t the designated lifeguard on duty.I had shut the door in her face, but now she’s gone…vanished…disappeared without a trace. It took less than a second for me to realize that I wanted her back.When a woman comes along that melts all the frozen, hard things you’re made of, you’ll do anything you have to, to bring her home.What you see is not always what you get…and with a man like me there is more than anyone ever bargained for.",
