As a wife and mother she was determined to get her life back.Over the course of one year, Nakazawa researches and tests a variety of therapies including meditation, yoga, and acupuncture to find out what works. But the discovery of a little-known branch of research into Adverse Childhood Experiences causes her to have an epiphany about her illness that not only stuns her—it turns her life around.Perfect for readers of Gretchen Rubin's The Happiness Project , Nakazawa shares her unexpected discoveries, amazing improvements, and shows readers how they too can find their own last best cure.",
