  "description": "Upon returning to Faerie, Drew learns the Dryads have captured Ian and plan to execute him as a spy. Joining forces with the Dryad peace delegation, Drew and Bi Ann race to Annwyn to rescue their cousin, but the Dryads place them on trial instead. Just as the tide turns in their favor, the Swansa issues a prophecy, which changes their lives forever. From dealing with arrogant Elves to defending against vicious enemies, Drew and Bi Ann's biggest challenge comes from the Faeries' character tests. One false move and their lives will end, but should they pass the tests, they earn the right to possess the most precious treasure in The Pangari. To save Faerie from destruction, Drew must defeat a fire-breathing dragon, recover the hidden Pangari, and save his friend from damnation in Uffern. The only enemies more dangerous than a fire-breathing dragon are the Barghests, Fachan, and Lamia; one will eat you alive, one will tear you to shreds, and one will claim your eternal soul.",
