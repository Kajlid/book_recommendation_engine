  "description": "The second exciting book in the bestselling 1797 Club series by USA TODAY Bestselling Author Jess Michaels.  Simon Greene, Duke of Crestwood has been obsessed with Margaret Rylon for years. There is only one thing standing between them: her fiancé, who also happens to be his best friend. He is desperate not to destroy everything in his life by giving in to his desires, but when Meg and Simon are trapped alone together overnight during a storm, the resulting scandal not only breaks Meg’s existing engagement, but forces Simon to offer for her instead.  Margaret is sorry to have hurt her family and her fiancé, but all she’s ever wanted was Simon. Her determination to make a happy life with him is only heightened when they submit to passions that have long dwelled beneath the surface. But while Simon may give her his body, he withholds his heart out of guilt and fear of what a connection to her may expose.   And if he doesn’t learn to fight for her soon, they both may lose a chance at happiness.  Length: Full length book  Heat Level: Yep. So much.  This is the second book in the 1797 Club series, but can be read as a standalone.",
