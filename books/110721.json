  "description": "You may know Alexis Parker as a top-notch investigator and security consultant, but before joining the private sector, she was a federal agent. At approximately 90 pages, this novella chronicles Agent Parker's beginning from her last few days at Quantico through her very first mission as an underling to S.S.A. Mark Jablonsky. As a probationary agent, Alex is learning the ins and outs of conducting a proper investigation, but all bets are off when she ends up undercover with her academy rival, Michael Carver. Suspicious shipments keep surfacing, and the Los Angeles FBI field office is forced to partner with the Office of International Operations to conduct their investigation. A restaurant employee, a wine collector, and the Russian mafia are all pieces of this daunting puzzle. Weapons are being smuggled into the country, and it's up to Alex and Michael to determine the source before things reach an unsettling end.",
