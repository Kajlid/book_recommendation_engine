  "description": "Singer/Song Writer Shannon \"Shann\" Delaney has struggled for years to make a life for herself and her ten year old son, Corey. Her career is just starting to take off when Shann's older sister, Liz, asks for help. Shann has been estranged from her family for over ten years due to an argument with her father. Now Liz begs Shann to return and help look after him while he undergoes surgery. With reservations, Shann agrees to help, hoping she can mend the breach with her family and introduce Corey to his grandfather. Shanns reservations of returning home are not completely concerned with her father, but with the object of her youthful angst. \"The girl next door\" who broke Shann's heart is now happily married and no longer a part of Shann's thoughts. But when Shann arrives home there is a new \"girl next door\" who turns Shann's world upside down",
