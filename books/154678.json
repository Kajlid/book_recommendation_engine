  "description": "***Book five of the Torn Series, but this novel can be read as a standalone*** Mistakes—my life has been full of them. Time and time again, I’ve tried to change, tried to make the right choices, but it doesn’t matter. I always screw up. I hoped that Adam would be different, that he wouldn’t be a mistake. Our relationship was supposed to be about sex and nothing more. Fun, easy, simple—that was what we wanted. But things are never simple, not for me. Adam changed me. He made me the person I am today. I hate who I am and what I’ve become. I'm not proud of the things I've done. I thought my greatest mistake would be falling in love with him. I was wrong. My greatest mistake is much, much worse. I’ve lost control. I have a secret I can’t hide. It’s going to destroy everything. My name is Amber, and this is my story.",
