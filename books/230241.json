  "description": "Young and innocent Raven Gables was strictly off limits, a fact Creed Lyons made sure to remind every surrounding male—including himself. Keeping her at arm's length Creed was content to watch the young beauty from afar, but cruel fate always found a way to laugh in his face.From the moment Creed arrived to rescue her, Raven knew the taciturn soldier covered in tattoos would change her life forever. Over the years he had become more than just a proxy “uncle” in her eyes, he was the dark-eyed man that haunted her dreams. The question was, would Creed ever see more than just a tragically orphaned schoolgirl?Like family, it was his job now to care and look after her, but God help him he wasn't prepared for this type of hell. There was only so much a man could take staring back at wide innocent eyes that begged the predator inside to devour her.***Stand alone novel.Graphic details",
