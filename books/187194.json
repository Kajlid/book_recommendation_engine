He teaches her about bondage and discipline, dominance and submission.Master Robert re-names her Rose and gives her hope, but she isn’t sure she is up to the task. She’ll have to get to know herself on a much deeper level than most people ever discover.Master Robert seldom shows emotion. Rose sparks something in him that he’s never realized before; a need to protect her, and not just in the games. While he’s learning about her, the depths of his feelings toward her surprise him. Robert’s never been in love and he resists, but he can’t resist his pride in her.",
