  "description": "Sex. Murder. More Sex. Another murder. And then the FBI arrives. A. J. Jackson is mild mannered, sensible, and always rational, so his friends and associates are naturally astounded when he shows up one day with a stripper for his fiancée. Jackie is just the opposite from A. J., outgoing and fun loving and spontaneous and somewhat of a slut. Sure she is beautiful and sexy, but trouble and dead bodies seems to follow her wherever she goes. A. J. has a problem when Jackie’s new job working undercover for the FBI gives her an excuse for sleeping with other men, and Jackie seems to enjoy doing just that. And then there’s Christina, Jackie’s best friend and the wife of a prominent business executive. Christina is every bit as much of a slut as Jackie. A.J. keeps asking himself whether he should dump Jackie or continue to be engaged to her as long as he’s getting his share of the action. But some decisions are out of his control. This book is intended for mature audiences. It contains graphic sexual content and explicit language.",
