  "description": "\"Ouroboros\" is a potent chapbook that touches upon the duality of light and dark. The everyday notions of life--people, love, memory, beliefs-- push the boundaries between positive and negative duality. \"European Pears\" Staring out an Astoria apartment window I see smokestacks from your city- façade clouds. They form into your face faking me fooling me, feelings once chained and sunk at sea now rusty, scraping my flakey fair skin cutting me. I never got that tetanus shot friends screamed I should get, so now your metal lives in my blood rotting me from the inside out like those European pears firm strong golden sweet just take a bite – juice drooling into bitter brown slush.",
