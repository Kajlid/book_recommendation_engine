  "description": "Here’s a new look at the Old Testament...but this time the women’s voice gets the prominence it deserved all along. Always witty, often funny, and definitely never boring, the women’s common sense outlook puts quite a different spin on the bible stories you think you remember. Finally, take a clear look at the outrages that have been swept under the carpet for centuries and laugh at some of the nonsense that’s been hiding there as well. The men who wrote the Bible have had the field to themselves for centuries. Let’s see that ancient world through a woman’s eyes. You may be surprised!",
