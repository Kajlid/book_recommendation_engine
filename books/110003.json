  "description": "High school stinks. One minute you're riding the express train to ultimate popularity and the next minute you plummet to the ranks of the school outcasts. Alicia wanted to start her first year of high school off by not bullying others, but pressure from friends and her own need to be the most popular girl in the new school overtakes her self-control. Just like the misconceptions that tore her friendships with Nia, Grace, and Lelia apart in middle school, her actions of flirting with the most popular girl's boyfriend and sending out a sexting picture turns her life from bully to bullied leaving Nia, her former friend and bane of her existence, to rise back up as the popular girl in school. Meanwhile, her other former friends Grace and Lelia head in two different directions. Grace retreats to her faith as Lelia dives deeper into depression and suicide. Is one girl's sacrifice enough to mend the relationships in time to save another?\"Both my school formal dress and JV cheer uniforms, neatly pressed, hang on the doors to the walk-in closet. I get goosebumps when I think about tomorrow and the first football game of the season on Thursday. Throughout summer vacation I’ve waited patiently for school to start. Dreams about my high school years danced in my head every night. From winning Prom queen to senior class president, I’ve planned every aspect of the next four years. This will be a new beginning. This year I will not step on others to remain popular. I’m letting the real Alicia Thayer out—the Alicia who cares. I want people to like me for who I am and not the person others want me to be. Without Nia Johnson at St. Aelred to ruin things, I may be able to reach the top.\" ~ Alicia",
