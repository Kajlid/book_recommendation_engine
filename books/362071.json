  "description": "The world's leading expert on vitamin D reveals the missing link to achieving optimal healthVitamin D deficiency is the most common medical condition in the world. In America alone, over 200 million people lack sufficient levels of vitamin D and may consequently suffer from chronic health conditions, ranging from daily annoyances like fatigue and pain to life-threatening illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. But few people know why vitamin D is so important and what they can do to avoid the myriad ailments associated with deficiency, including heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis.There is no better person to demystify this vitamin and showcase its place in human health than author Michael F. Holick, M.D., Ph.D.-the father of modern vitamin D research. With more than three decades spent studying the relationship between vitamin D, limited sun exposure, and human well-being, Dr. Holick shares his findings on how combining the natural curative properties of the sun along with small lifestyle changes can help everyone to live a substantially healthier life.Armed with a three-step plan incorporating safe amounts of sun exposure, the right supplementation, and eating foods rich in vitamin D, Dr. Holick provides prescriptive advice for anyone- from relatively healthy people to those suffering from chronic or even fatal diseases- on how to easily rebuild and maintain optimal levels of this essential hormone.Rich with anecdotes and entertaining case studies, The Vitamin D Solution also presents research from around the world to serve as a wake-up call on this potentially lifesaving hormone for health.",
