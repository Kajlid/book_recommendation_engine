But when it comes time to take out his latest target, he can't do it. Confused by his reaction to Psyche, he does the only thing he can think of to keep her safe: he marries her.

But as lines blur and loyalties shift, she realizes he might take her heart after all...and she's not sure she can survive the loss.",
