High school senior Holly Kent has everything she could ever want perched at the top of Eastside Country Day’s social structure. She's one of the most gorgeous girls in school. She wins every award.

Forbidden to reveal her situation to anyone,  Holly must adjust to a new life and find out if she has the strength to change her heart before it's too late. Carson Isaac lives on the fringe of Eastside's social scene. He never quite fit in, but an education at one of the city's best schools could help jumpstart his future. Then, one fateful winter day, he sees his secret crush—the real Holly Kent—for the first time. Nothing will ever be the same. As romance blossoms, can Holly and Carson navigate their new reality in time? Or will they be bound by the evil spell forever?",
