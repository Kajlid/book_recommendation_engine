  "description": "Rebecca's never met her French pen friend but they feel like sisters and tell each other their secrets. No wonder she keeps Emmanuelle's letters safe. Safe, that is, until her bedside locker's raided and the letters tampered with. Who could do such an unthinkable thing? Somehow, before she can face Emmanuelle in person in Paris, she must find out what's going on. But how? Because, as Tish says: \"Looks like Action Committee's weirdest one yet.\"As well as the Trebizon books, Straw Hat ebook collectables also publish Alan Davidson's classic schoolgirl comedies [A Friend Like Annabel, Just Like Annabel, etc.] and Anne Digby's Jill Robinson Adventure Series -- more fun, friendship and mystery titles for readers to collect and enjoy.REVIEW' The thirteenth book in Anne Digby's splendid series of stories about Trebizon School is as zestful and well constructed as all the earlier books about this famous fictional girls' boarding school. In this adventure the heroine, Rebecca Mason, is involved in taking her mock GCSE exams. She has convincingly matured and gone from junior to senior forms as the series has progressed. There are, as always, excitements and challenges - and a mystery which Rebecca and her friends tackle with their usual panache' - COLLECTORS' DIGEST",
