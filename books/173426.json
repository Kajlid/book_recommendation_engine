She’ll do whatever it takes to keep a roof over the head of herself and her one year old son. Including making nice with the twin she doesn’t remember and stealing baby food from a grocery store. \nAlways needed…\n Kane Dermott doesn’t want to bust the pierced and sexy woman stealing at the grocery store, but neither does he want to help her or believe her sob story. Being a cop and the oldest of six siblings with a single mom, he’s always the one doing the right thing. The one everyone depends on. The good guy. For once he just wants to have some fun with the hot girl, and Anya is more than willing to make him forget her petty theft in the most delicious way possible.  But it turns out the sob story is real and in the murky world of black market babies, Anya and her son are in danger, and Kane can’t walk away from the mysterious and broken woman he has come to love. But neither can he trust her. \nWhen lies are truth and truths are lies, sometimes only love is the answer…",
