  "description": "Make a deal with the devil, And you'll pay with your soul...  My first mistake was thinking I could go up against five bullies.  My second mistake was telling Dexter Booth I loved him.  He used it against me in the worst possible way, and now I'm on the run with more than myself to think of, with five monsters on my trail.  Lai - the brutal giant who won't stop before he's punished me for ruining his life.  Caspian - the twisted sadist who only sees me as a toy he wants to break.  Julian - the beautiful savage with cruel intentions, and a heart that's colder than ice.  Easton - the handsome liar I never should have trusted, because a friend's betrayal cuts the deepest.  And Dex. The boy I love. The boy I hate. The boy who won't stop until he's taken everything from me. There's no escaping Dexter Booth.  As I desperately try to run from my tormentors, I forget about the real monster on my trail... Who is my savior, and who is the devil? Which one should I trust?  After all, even the devil was an angel once...  ***  A HURT SO SWEET Volume Four is the fourth and final book in a series of full-length novels following Pandora Oakes and Dexter Booth. This book ends in a HEA and has dark themes throughout.",
