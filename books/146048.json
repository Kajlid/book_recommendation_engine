  "description": "Mrs. Pennywort's hen, Pauline, can't seem to lay eggs like the others. . . . Until she finds some inspiration, and a strange talent. When she nests outside to get away from the noise and teasing of the others, Pauline manages to lay a beautiful sky-blue egg. Watching a ladybug in the grass, she lays a bright red spotted egg. The hen is confused, but Mrs. Pennywort is thrilled—and she takes Pauline on an adventure! Soon Pauline is laying eggs of all colors and patterns, to the delight of everyone who sees them. It seems like the perfect way to celebrate Easter. . . . even when the eggs start hatching into brightly colored chicks. Mary Jane Auch's funny text and vibrant illustrations will make this an Easter favorite. . . . and a year-round reminder of the importance of being true to yourself.",
