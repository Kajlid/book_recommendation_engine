  "description": "Seamlessly blending feverish fantasies with photorealistic detail, Drew Posada creates portraits of deeply disturbing perfection. His use of color and lighting set him apart from most fantasy artists, and give his works a rich luster and depth. This new collection of his full color works is loaded with amazing imagery, and the reproduction is outstanding! Printed on a heavy weight coated stock, all the colors and details are there to study and enjoy. And the girls are pretty nice to look at too!",
