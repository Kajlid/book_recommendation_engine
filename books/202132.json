  "title": "Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War",
  "description": "What Michael Herr's Dispatches was to the Vietnam War, Love Thy Neighbor is to the Bosnian War--a brilliantly observed and deeply felt evocation of war by a writer who witnessed it. The work immediately calls to mind Heller's Catch-22 for its grasp of the absurdity of war, and, for its accurate presentation of the events, Neil Sheehan's A Bright, Shining Lie.",
