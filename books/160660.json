  "description": "Heaven is finally having Saxon Gray in my arms. Hell is knowing that I might lose him.  After I spent years loving him from a distance, the president of the Hellfire Riders MC is finally mine. Every day he’s at my side; every night he’s in my bed. It would be everything I’d ever wanted, except my dad is sick, and trouble is brewing now that Saxon’s club is taking over my father’s. Because bad blood between the two MCs still lingers, and an old rule requiring Saxon to share me with the other club members is being used as a weapon, forcing him to choose between me and the Hellfire Riders.  And I don’t know if he’ll choose me…or how far I might go to keep him.  TAKING IT ALL is a complete novella. No cliffhangers—only hot and sexy romance. The Motorcycle Clubs series is romance for readers who want all of the heat and emotion, but who don't have all of the time.  HIS WILD DESIRE - Out now! OFF LIMITS - Out now! WANTING IT ALL - Out now! HER SECRET PLEASURE - Out now! PACKING DOUBLE - Out now! TAKING IT ALL – Out now! THEIR SECRET NEED -- October 29!",
