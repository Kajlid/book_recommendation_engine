  "description": "Some people simply crave control. I more than crave it. I need it. I need control to be able to do what is necessary for my family's business. And I especially need control over him. Control that I use to remind both of us of the fact that, despite the actions of others, he always has been, and always will be, mine.  Mine to have. Mine to defile.  Mine to mold. Our future is now firmly in my control.",
