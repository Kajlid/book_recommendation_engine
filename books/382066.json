  "description": "After surviving the harrowing Dakota Sioux uprising of 1862, Genevieve La Croix marries Simon and moves with him to minister to the Indians held in prison camp. They follow the Sioux to the Crow Creek Reservation, a place where the Indians suffered greatly. Trying to make angry settlers understand that not all Indians are alike and that many Sioux risked their lives to save whites from the rebels, Genevieve searches for a way to bring reconciliation to the frontier. Though Genevieve believes Daniel Two Stars is dead, he has survived the battles and now fights his own private war as a scout for the military. What will happen when Genevieve and Daniel meet again? Edge of the Wilderness is a moving story of faith, forgiveness, and the courage to build a new life in spite of loss and sorrow.",
