  "description": "Volumes I and II of The Black Book take us inside the mind of outwardly unassuming Jonah Black. Faithfully reproduced in the manner of the original diary, they comprise a no-holds-barred, darkly comic tale of one teenager's inner life. Jonah chronicles his shrouded-in-mystery return from boarding school, his reentry into a life he'd left behind, and his struggle to separate fantasy from reality. His Proustian eye for detail and self-deprecating humor combined with the sexual appetite unique to the seventeen-year-old male make these books compulsively entertaining.Volume I details Jonah's crash-and-burn reentry into the high school society and family he left behind two years before.",
