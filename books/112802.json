  "description": "When Ben and Axel settled in Santa Cruz, they thought they’d finally get some peace. They were wrong. An old pack war is brewing, and two local werewolves need their help. Quinton Santos and Gage Varela are the only remaining wolves from the once great Westside pack. As a dangerous threat resurfaces, they need an alpha to lead their pack. But Gage and Quinton are only beta wolves. Even worse, they can hardly stand each other. Gage knows the rich and arrogant Quinton is his mate. While giving into his desire for the beautiful man is easy, Gage isn’t about to fall in love. Quinton used to be confident, but the fire that killed his family left scars deeper than those on his skin. He knows Gage is the stronger wolf, and he’s worked hard to prove he’s not weak. But no matter what Quinton does, Gage only sees him as rich and useless. When the leader of the rival Eastside pack, a destructive alpha hell-bent on killing them, attacks, they need Axel and Ben’s help to defeat him. Axel and Ben work to bring their new pack together, but it isn’t easy with two betas who are at each others throats. After years of hurt, can Gage and Quinton let go of the darkness in the past and forgive enough to fall in love? Contains graphic m/m sex scenes.",
