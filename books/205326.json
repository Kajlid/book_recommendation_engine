  "description": "Dana Green’s debut collection of stories, Sometimes the Air in the Room Goes Missing, explores how storytelling changes with each iteration, each explosion, each mutation. Told through multiple versions, these are stories of weapons testing, sheep that can herd themselves into watercolors, and a pregnant woman whose water breaks every day for nine months — stories told with an unexpected syntax and a sense of déjà vu: narrative as echo.",
