  "description": "For Franny, the end of everything is just the beginning of her adventure. The world as we know it is no more. Cities are mobile. Electricity is rare. Reading is a relic of the past. After an explosive encounter with a mysterious stranger, Franny, a 14-year-old orphan girl, embarks on an epic quest to find the mysterious pilots who steer the cities, hoping that if she finds them, she will get answers about her family's pastâ€”and the world's future. The Armies of Those I Love is a brilliant vision of the future from Hugo, Locus, and Nebula-winning author Ken Liu, author of such sci-fi classics as The Grace of Kings and The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, and translator of the global best seller The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu.",
