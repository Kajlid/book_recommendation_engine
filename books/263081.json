  "description": "Mike Turner is a good catch. He has a great job, money, good looks, and a sexy six pack. And he’s asked me to marry him! I’m in love. He’s perfect in every way…but one.  Amy is the love of my life. I’d planned everything perfectly…the ring, the romantic beach proposal. But then we’d gone back to the hotel, hungry for each other, and that’s when everything happened. Or rather, didn’t happen. She broke things off the same night. Now I’m determined to get her back, no matter what it takes. I will learn everything I can, from whoever will teach me, and when I’m ready, I will prove to her I’m the man who can give her what she wants. What she needs. I just hope it’s not too late for a second chance.",
