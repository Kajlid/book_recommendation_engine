  "description": "Told by sassy 18-year-old Rachel, this is a suspenseful, compassionate, yet laugh-out-loud funny story about looking after a woman with brain damage - and about tasting love, finding grace and getting a life. Rachel has just left school and she knows everything. Well, maybe not quite everything. Then she meets the mysterious Mr. Preston, who gives her a live-in job looking after Grace - Grace with the lovely house, the grasping sisters, the feral neighbours and the spooky box full of unfinished business; Grace who never speaks. Who is Grace? How do the pieces of her world fit together? And what will it all mean for Rachel? Told from Rachel's gloriously eccentric perspective, this is an intriguing, compassionate, unexpectedly funny story about tasting love, finding grace and getting a life.",
