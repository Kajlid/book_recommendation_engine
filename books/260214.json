  "description": "Upon completing \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" in 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald declared it \"the funniest story ever written\" and \"one of my two favorite stories.\" It's the strange tale of a man who is \"born\" 70 years old and mysteriously ages in reverse. This stunning graphic novel adaptation illustrates Benjamin Button's many adventures: He falls in love, starts a family, and runs a successful business. In his later years, he goes to war and attends Harvard University. As an old man, he resembles a newborn baby and returns to the care of a nurse.Complete with Fitzgerald's original text, dazzling watercolor illustrations, and an afterword describing the story's origins and critical reception, this edition offers a fresh look at a literary masterpiece.",
