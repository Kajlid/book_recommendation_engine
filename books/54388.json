  "title": "Under the Wild Ginger: A Simple Guide to the Wisdom of Wonder",
  "description": "Under the Wild Ginger is a collection of evocative reflections which gently, compellingly urge the reader to reclaim the wonder and wisdom of childhood. Part nature walk, part self-reflection, part spirit quest, it inspires uninhibited curiosity and enthusiasm for small things, those small, wonderful things so often hidden to first glances like the exquisite flower beneath the leaves of the wild ginger. Through his patient probing Jeffrey Willius shows us how, for each layer of our perceptual, emotional and spiritual inattentiveness weâ€™re willing to shed. Nature, in return, sheds one layer of her mystery.",
