  "description": "The lighter side of Navy SEAL romances--what happens when you strip them down and throw a woman they can't resist in their path... The first three stories in the SEALs Undone series by NYT and USA Today Bestselling Author Zoe York! Fall Out (Drew and Annie's story) Drew Castle is a Navy SEAL with a bad case of indifference. Until Annie Martin shows up on his doorstep, scared out of her mind, and all of a sudden, keeping her safe becomes the most important mission of his life. And this time, he’s on his own.  Fall Hard (Jared and Cassie's story) Jared Sutter has a simple rule when it comes to women: keep 'em happy and keep 'em at a distance. He's got his reasons, and they all make sense until he falls for his neighbor and Cassie Bronson makes him want things he's always kept off-limits.  Fall Away (Trick and Gaby's story) Navy SEAL Trick Novak knows he needs to find a better cure for his insomnia, but a warm body and a pretty smile worked just fine until he met Gaby Ellis—his latest conquest’s roommate. Now he’s not sleeping, and he’s definitely not getting laid, but that just means he’s got more time to plot ways to win over the beautiful and stubborn kindergarten teacher.  Keep reading!
