  "description": "--- The Strange Case of Dr. Proper and Mr. Slut ---Kyle promised himself that when he goes to college, things would change. He wouldn’t be the gay boy willing to hop into bed with any guy who wants to experiment. This was his life on the line after all. He would never find a proper boyfriend this way. So Kyle did everything in his power to be angelic. He became the poster boy for acceptable gayness and the president of the LGBT club. But the side of him that wants to fulfill all those dirty, kinky fantasies is about to rear its ugly head when the LGBT club gets a new member. Dan is the big, bad boyfriend-to-be Kyle always dreamed of, but will Dan still treat him seriously when he finds out about Kyle’s most secret fantasy? One that goes against everything Kyle stands for in real life. *‘Rainbow Bash’d’ is a standalone story in the XXX’d series, a prequel to ‘Clown’d’.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Themes: college, insta-lust, repressed fantasies, fitting in, Pride, preppiness, self-acceptance, self-image issues Genre: erotica, contemporaryErotic content: sizzling hot graphic language, mock-homophobic humiliation, rape fantasy role play, bondage, toys, spanking, dirty talk, boot licking, skinheadLength: ~16,000 wordsCOMING SOON! :)",
