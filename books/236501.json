  "title": "A Dessani Queen",
  "description": "A Queen does not bow to her King. She stands by his side and aids in the navigation of rough waters. When King Obi Diya names the Prince of the Nilotics, Ronan Oiaio, as his heir. Princess Makayla Diya has little choice. She or one of her seven sisters would marry him in order to solidify the terms of the treaty their father signed without their consent. Faced with the choice to marry or give up a throne she’d known belonged to her since birth, Makayla did the only thing she could do. She set about showing the Prince what a true Dessani Queen was made of. Thrust into the role of Prince of Nilo by the unexpected death of his grandfather, Ronan needed to find a new home for his people and King Obi needed to end the war on his shores. A truce gave them what the other needed. Faced with a court full of suspicious Nobles, anxious Nilotics and a growing attachment to a woman he wasn’t sure he should trust, Ronan and Makayla must unify two nations into one.",
