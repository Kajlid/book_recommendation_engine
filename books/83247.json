  "title": "Crossing the Line",
  "description": "Powerful, covert forces gently weave their way into the life of college sophomore, Chris Carter, whose successes are accelerated when he realizes that abandoning his stringent moral upbringing yields not only increased power but the attainment of what becomes most important to him. Hidden beneath his outgoing personality, athletic good looks, and natural leadership skills is a razor sharp mind that he uses to turn a small Louisiana campus into his personal fiefdom. His admittance into a clandestine fraternity inner council opens the door to much larger forces that secretly control the country's business and professional worlds and the politics that answer to them. Crossing The Line is the second novel in a trilogy, picking up where the widely aclaimed Drawing The Line stopped, leaving readers anxiously awaiting for what will happen next to the splendid cast of characters. Highly sensual and fast moving, Crossing The Line tracks the meteoric ascent of Chris Carter from the campus of Centenary College to Harvard Law School and back to Shreveport, where he joins the city's most prestigious law firm. His innate and developed skills, combined with his learned propensity for doing whatever is necessary to win, prove invaluable as he becomes embroiled in a medical malpractice lawsuit. Enhanced by the unknown forces he becomes a part of, it takes a combination of every skill in his possession to meet head-on the power of the medical establishments in north Louisiana and Atlanta as well as one of the richest corporations in the world.",
