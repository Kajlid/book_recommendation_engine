  "description": "Tony Burroughs was a young man living in Hawaii, when an older philosopher sage took him under his wing and became his mentor at an exotic fruit farm on the big island. Over a period of ten years, Tony learned how to farm as well as \"The Information,\" a series of oral lessons, comprising a body of deep teachings about the very meaning of life, the history of mankind, and how to not just exist but to evolve and live a meaningful life filled with love, peace and abundance. A core teaching was in regard to intention-setting and Tony and two friends started a weekly circle to try it out. This first humble circle of three people had dramatic and life-changing effects that have resulted in Tony Burrough's life-long mission to guide others in the art of manifesting the best in themselves, their lives, and for the highest good of all. The tenet of Get What You Want is simple, powerful and \"that which you are reaching toward is also reaching out toward you.\" And, for the first time, Tony has gathered many of the key teachings of \"The Information\" into one book.",
