  "description": "Charlie is a young boy who is able to speak to cats (and all felines) due to an accident involving a leopard cub's blood when he was a baby. He lives in London with his parents, Dr. Aneba Ashanti and Professor Magdalen Start, both of whom are scientists working on a cure for asthma and other allergies.His parents, as a result of their scientific discoveries, are kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company known mysteriously as the Corporacy. Charlie, closely avoiding being kidnapped himself, sets out to find them and ends up onboard a circus ship making its way to Paris. On board he befriends most of the circus performers as well as (using his gift) a pride of beautiful performing lions who seek the boy's help to escape their cruel trainer. Meanwhile, the vicious criminal Rafi Sadler, in the employ of the Corporacy, is hot on his heels, going to any lengths to get his hands on Charlie. The circus ship arrives in Paris and Charlie escapes with the lions. They make their way to Gare d'Austerlitz where they hide on a train destined for Venice, the place Charlie's parents are rumored to have been taken.",
