In a race against time, intelligence agencies are working as one to uncover the secrets behind the rogue operation before itâ€™s too late.

Is he a lone wolf or is someone else pulling his strings? Will the Prime Minister survive or will he leave behind a nation steeped in grief and chaos? As the armed forces on both sides of the border prepare for an offensive, will the agencies succeed at unravelling the truth or will it disappear forever?",
