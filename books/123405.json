  "description": "Chicago Racketeers book fourI don’t do casual hookups. Never have. Not even with the three supposed-to-be one-night stands I had six months ago.They all turned into the loves of my life.But now I know exactly what to do with the three hot guys I met at that serendipitous hockey game.Love them.Forever.At least that’s the plan.(Okay, yes, there’s still a lot of headboard-banging nights--and days--happening around here too. And days.)Our house is truly a home, the naked-times are better than any dirty romance I’ve ever read…or written…and our relationship is rock solid.At least, I’m pretty sure it is.As long as we can take our foursome to four plus a bundle of joy without any of my guys deciding that our unconventional approach to family is just a little more than he bargained for.\nDani, Nathan, Michael, and Crew are back for the fourth and final installment of their romance! These books should be read in order so definitely start with Puck One Night Stands to enjoy their full sexy, fun story and their happily ever after!",
