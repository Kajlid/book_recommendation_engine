  "title": "When God Is Gone, Everything Is Holy: The Making of a Religious Naturalist",
  "description": "In what he describes as a \"late-life credo,\" renowned science writer Chet Raymo narrates his half-century journey from the traditional Catholicism of his youth to his present perspective as a \"Catholic agnostic.\" As a scientist, Raymo holds to the skepticism that accepts only verifiable answers, but as a \"religious naturalist,\" he never ceases his pursuit of \"the beautiful and terrible mystery that soaks creation.\" Raymo assembles a stunning array of scientists, philosophers, mystics, and poets who help him discover \"glimmers of the Absolute in every particular.\" Whether exploring the connection of the human body to the stars or the meaning of prayer of the heart, these challenging reflections will cause believers and agnostics alike to pause and pay attention.",
