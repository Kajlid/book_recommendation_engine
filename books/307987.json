  "description": "I’m the head of one of the biggest crime families, but I’ve never even thought of starting a family for myself. Until her. Until now. But will she be accepting of my lifestyle, the violence, bribery, and all the things that seem bad on the surface that go along with it? Unlikely, which is why I need to change, to become a man, unlike the one I am today. To create a new identity. To stalk her. To become what she wants. I’ve reached all my goals in life and now it’s time to be the Daddy, she needs. There’s no way I can resist, no way I can stay away. Not since that first moment, I saw her.Yeah, maybe I am technically stalking her, but in the game of life, you play to win. And she’s the biggest prize for any man. And I will make her mine. But when she finds out just how obsessed I am will she want her own space to breathe? Or will she see that it’s my undying affection and need for her that is driving me? Will the truth cause all this to come to an end. I won’t allow it just like I won’t allow her to leave me. Never. She’s mine. Always. My little girl. This is a short, steamy daddy romance. No OM / OW drama and no cliffhangers. Always a sweet HEA.",
