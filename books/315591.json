Meet Adrian, a gorgeous man I'm magnetically attracted to, and if that wasn't enough, I managed to get abducted to another realm.I find out I'm not human—well–not entirely. It turns out I'm a demigod, half-human, half-god. If that reality check doesn't knock a girl on her ass, I don't know what would.To top it off, Adrian isn't just some hot one-night stand at the bar. He's one of the four gods tasked with ruling over the school this year. A school I'm now forced to attend if I want to control my powers. Powers that will be locked away until I prove I can handle them.Despite my anger towards Adrian for taking me from my life, I can't help but find myself drawn to him. The only problem is, he isn't the only god that makes me feel this way. Mateo, Kyros, and Maximus keep popping up into my life, confusing me with their penetrating stares and possessive attitudes.When a dark power emerges, I must rely on them to find the threat attacking the school and its students, especially when the malevolent force turns its attention towards me.If I could go back to that day, I—almost—definitely would've stayed in bed.*Ascension is a full-length 100K word novel recommended for readers 18+.",
