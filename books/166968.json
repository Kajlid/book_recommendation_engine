  "description": "As seen on TV! A new fast-paced fairy tale starring a feisty knight-in-training and the dragon friend she joins on daring adventures.What’s so funny about playing dung wars? What’s so side-splitting about armpit farts? Jane just doesn’t get it. But Dragon and Gunther, Jane’s fellow knight-in training, think it’s all hilarious and are fast becoming the best of friends. Maybe it’s time for Jane to ask Jester to give her a crash course on crass humor!",
