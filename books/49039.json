  "title": "Carthage",
  "description": "Zeno Mayfield's daughter has disappeared into the night, gone missing in the wilds of the Adirondacks. Her sister's ex-fiancee, a decorated Iraq War veteran struggling with his own demons, is the prime suspect. But there is more to Cressida Mayfield's vanishing than anyone could have imagined.Carthage plunges us deep into the psyche of a wounded young Corporal, haunted by unspeakable acts of wartime aggression, while unraveling the story of a disaffected young woman whose exile from her family may have come long before her disappearance.Dark and riveting, Carthage is a powerful addition to the Joyce Carol Oates canon, one that explores the human capacity for violence, love, and forgiveness, and asks if it's ever truly possible to come home again.",
