  "description": "How do you piece together your life when the world is falling apart at the seams?  It’s 1945. The New American Republic may have beaten their enemies overseas, but the dark echoes of the Great Depression still linger on.  Times are hard, but Amandine Stewart refuses to give up hope. With her father killed in action and her mother imprisoned in the faraway city of Nieuwestad, Amandine embarks on a dangerous journey to reunite what’s left of her family. Her sunny disposition and skills as a seamstress get her a job with a traveling band of performers who are on their way to put on a spectacular show that just might be their ticket out of poverty.  But beneath the stage lights lurks a shadow of Amandine’s past— the treacherous NAR agent who arrested her mother. He is as unpredictable as he is vain, but he makes two things perfectly clear: nothing but the occasional bloodstain shall sully his uniform and nothing will stop him from completing his mission.  Join Amandine as she travels through the war-torn remnants of an alternate past where struggle, adventure, and romance dance to electro-swing beneath the stars.",
