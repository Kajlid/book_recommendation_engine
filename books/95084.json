  "description": "Savage Love marks the long-awaited return of one of Canada’s most lauded and stylistically brilliant authors. Glover skewers every conventional notion we’ve ever held about that cultural-emotional institution of love we are instructed to hold dear.Peopled with forensic archaeologists, horoscope writers, dental hygienists, and even butchers, Glover’s stories are of our time yet timeless; spectacular fables that stand in any era, any civilization. Whether writing about sexually ambiguous librarians or desperadoes most despicable, Glover exposes the humanity lurking behind our masks, the perversities that underlie our actions.Savage Love heralds the return of a master, with laugh-out-loud stories of the best kind, often completely unexpected, rife with moments of tragedy or horror. This is Douglas Glover country, and we are all willing visitors.",
