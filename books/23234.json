But can it also lead to happily ever after?Allison Denman is supposed to get married in five days, but everything is all wrong. The huge wedding. The frothy dress. And the groom.Still, kissing the groom's brother, Daniel, in an unguarded moment is decidedly not the right thing to do. How could she have made such a mistake? It seems Allison's life is nothing but mistakes at this point. Daniel's adventures--chronicled through a collection of postcards--have always appealed to Allison's well-hidden desire for something more. But how can betraying her fianc√©'s trust lead to a true happily ever after?Can Allison find her way out of this mess? Recognizing she doesn't have all the answers won't be easy because she's used to being in control. To find her way again, she will have to believe that God has a plan for her--one outside her carefully defined comfort zone--and find the strength to let Him lead.",
