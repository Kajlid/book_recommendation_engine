  "description": "The Good Beasts of Avantia have been taken hostage by the Evil Wizard Malvel. Each is being guarded by a new evil Beast in the Dark Realm. In order to rescue Tartok, Tom must go against Kaymon the Gorgon Hound, a Beast unlike any he has faced so far on his Quest. Kaymon prowls the ruins of a forgotten castle. Will Tom be able to defeat this menace and come one step closer to stopping Malvel forever? \"What's happening?\" Elenna cried. \"She's changing!\" Tom shouted in horror. Instead of one hound, there were now three! Tom stared in disbelief, his heart almost stopping in his chest. Each of the Beasts was as huge and as savage as the first, and all three turned on Silver as he stood panting and snarling.",
