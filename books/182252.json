Love and marriage are impractical pursuits, and hold zero attraction for her—though she alleviates her loneliness through the guilty pleasure of an at-far fantasy of her temporary boss, Lucius Ransome.So when Lucius gives her the task of disproving a long-standing Ransome Family legend, it’s a tossup for her whether the main attraction is the financial bonus he’s promised or the chance to spend time in his company!Her investigation unravels more than family secrets. As she plunges into a steamy affair with Lucius, everything she holds true comes apart when he introduces her to a world where love actually might mean more than money.",
