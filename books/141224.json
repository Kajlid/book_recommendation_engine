  "description": "There's all the difference between forgive and forget.Nothing in Sky’s life looks the same since she met Bastian-exiled Ailuro, love of her life, and his own worst enemy. The revelations of the last few days, days that saw the end of Bastian’s ninth life, what should have been his last, have rendered her life unrecognizable-but survivable.Bastian can’t claim the same.He only lives with his sins in the hope of keeping Sky out of Maarjaaran hands. His hope lies in hers. And she’ll do anything to save him. Unfortunately, the only thing that might work demands far more from her than simply giving in to the Maarjaaran marks.NOTE: This is book 2 and won't make sense without first reading 9th Life, book 1 of The Naming of Legends.",
