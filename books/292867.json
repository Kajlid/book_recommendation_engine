The ship—and the men aboard—need to sink to a watery grave, and he's now within striking distance. He has no time to save a fool woman from a hoard of sailors at the docks. Of course, what he should do, and what he actually does, have always been very different things.A reckoning no one was prepared for.When Roe yanks Torrie from the frothing band of ruffians, he's faced with a reckoning he wasn't prepared to have. He served seven years in Newgate Prison for killing Torrie's family. A crime he didn't commit. Not that she'll believe him. Ever.But the attraction between them cannot be denied. And if she manages to crack her heart open to this hardened rouge, a love that will defy all odds could be theirs.",
