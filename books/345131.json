  "description": "Even the united remnants of Toronto's defeated underworld could not resist the city's masked protectors. But when they join with the murderous might of some of the masked man's deadliest foes, can even the Red Panda match the strength of... The Crime Cabal? Written in the breathless style of the classic \"Hero Pulps\" of the 1930s and 40s, Tales of the Red The Crime Cabal presents the masked protectors of Depression-Era Toronto in a pulse pounding conflict with gangsters, racketeers, corrupt officials and power-mad supervillains. The heroes from \"The Red Panda Adventures\"; a popular full-cast audio drama podcast in the style of the adventure programs of radio's golden age here make the leap into pulp prose in spectacular style. This story is a self-contained adventure; you needn't have heard a single episode of Decoder Ring Theatre's long-running audio drama series to enjoy the thrills, mystery and adventure... but fans of the series will take special delight, as the story fits neatly within the series continuity. If you love classic adventure stories, mystery men, pulp fiction and golden age superheroics, you won't want to miss Tales of the Red The Crime Cabal!",
