  "description": "The western Church has an unhealthy force in her midst, warns prophetic pastor Loren Sandford. It is a consuming focus on ''self'' and it is eroding ministry and blocking revival. Sandford speaks to the growing undercurrent of hunger for what is truly authentic. He explains the critical need for sacrifice and challenges the church to return to the cleansing power of Jesus' blood. Readers who long for a return to true faith and genuine prophecy will find their spirits refreshed by this message and see new power and life in ministry. Anyone with a heart for prophecy, intercession, and revival will answer this call to recover biblical focus and rediscover biblical levels of Holy Spirit manifestation.",
