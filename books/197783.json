They say he’s a hero, but he wishes he’d died along with those he lost from his platoon. It’ll take a special kind of woman to heal this wounded warrior.  Danielle McKesson understands survivor’s guilt. She's raising her nephew after he witnessed the death of his parents.  Beckett says he doesn’t want her love. All he can offer is a week together. What started as a passionate indulgence that neither wanted to deny, becomes something that changes them both.",
