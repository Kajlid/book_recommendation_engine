She makes him work for her. She makes him wait on her. She uses her stranger's body to torture him with his own desire.They are an ordinary couple in a private hell. A man and a woman in changed places; a man and a woman exploring all the cruelty and darkness and horror that was once hidden between a woman and a man.",
