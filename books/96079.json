  "description": "The year is 2038. U.S. President Martin Diaz contracts a deadly virus that leaves him coughing up blood as he delivers his State of the Union speech to Congress. From there the virus spreads like the Wrath of God all over the planet, leaving millions dead.Who's behind the deadly virus, the Chinese, Russians, a rogue terrorist group? Or has someone from the future sent the virus back in time? It's up to young-gun Congressman Jeff Madison and grizzled war veteran Vice-President Buddy Paulson to find out. Helping them is a radical team of scientists who head up the United States Time Travel Initiative (code named Project Chronos).But what can they do when the very air they breathe can kill them in under an hour? Time is running out, something is hunting them, and there is a traitor trying to undermine their efforts at every turn.",
