  "description": "Finally free to be together on the remote Irish isle of Innishmahon, campaigning journalist Marianne Coltrane and her movie star partner, Ryan O'Gorman are looking forward to life away from the bright lights of Hollywood and the constant pursuit of the paparazzi. However, when nature conspires to keep them apart and Ryan puts both his own and his son's life at risk, Marianne finally realises how determined he is they should be a family. She now needs to put aside her own, deep rooted fear of commitment and come to terms with the sinister secrets buried within her family history. Yet when Ryan's own devastating secret is revealed, and their world is turned upside down, Marianne has to call upon more than determination to see them through. She has to believe in love with every fibre of her being, because if she cannot, it could mean not only the end of their relationship, but even life itself.",
