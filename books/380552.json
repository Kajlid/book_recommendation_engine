Designed to encourage readers to give themselves permission to unleash their hearts' harmless desires, the book has only one directive: \"Don't be mean.\" It is this guiding principle that brings its reader on a self-validating journey, which forges wholly new paths toward a resounding decision to choose life.Tenderly intimate and unapologetically edgy, Kate Bornstein is the radical role model, the affectionate best friend, and the guiding mentor all in one.",
