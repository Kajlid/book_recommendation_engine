Together they must unlock the secrets of an ancient necklace in a race against time to save magic . . . and each other. Sera must deal with the hope of finally having a permanent home while being drawn into a web of magic, danger, legends, friendship, secrets, and conflict that will draw on every ounce of her courage and wits to survive.",
