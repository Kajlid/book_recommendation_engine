And I certainly didn’t ask for the world’s worst best man as an assistant.But my brother is marrying the love of his life, and I’ll stop at nothing to give him a perfect wedding day–and get our family’s Inn some much-needed publicity in the process.Which means playing nice with James Weston.My brother’s best friend and I have been feuding for as long as I can remember. We don’t like each other, plain and simple.Or is it?Is it possible that James isn’t the monster I’ve always thought him to be? And why does he keep showing up to save me right when I need him? (Not that I’d EVER admit it).Falling for James is not on my carefully color-coordinated agenda.Too bad nothing seems to go according to plan when James Weston is around…The Next Worst Thing is a sweet romcom with swoony kisses and chemistry, a hilarious cast of quirky small-town characters, and a heartwarming HEA that’s sure to give you all the feels.",
