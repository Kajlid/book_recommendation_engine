  "description": "France, June 6th, 1944 After finding themselves separated from their unit, six British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division encounter a band of gypsies. Two of the soldiers rape a girl and murder her boyfriend, before turning their weapons on the vengeful group. Madame Carmen Baptiste, the bandolier of the gypsies, places a curse on the six aggressors and their offspring for generations to come. Sixty years later, and Nina Corbett, a barrister and the granddaughter of one of the damned, attempts to contact the other five cursed ancestors. Each curse is unrelated, and all are subjected to horrific experiences, including terrifying spirits. A sequence of unusual events results in the group assembling for a harrowing and blood-curdling conclusion. This is a story of retribution and justice... A pulse-quickening and exhilarating thriller/horror. Enjoy.",
