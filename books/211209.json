  "description": "Things escalated. That's what I'm going to say happened with our stepbrother with benefits relationship. It escalated.  Rule #18 â€“ We have to be open with one another. We have to tell each other how we really feel.  I'm not sure you can fully grasp the gravity of the situation I'm in right now. I think I've unleashed a monster inside myself. I also think I kind of love it. I completely trust my ability to be responsible almost always, except when it comes to Ethan. When it comes to Ethan, well...  I don't think we really have to think about how irresponsible I can be when it comes to Ethan. I just ditched class for the day, bought a plane ticket randomly to fly out and see him, and now...  I don't want to talk about it. Things escalated. That's what I'm going to say happened. They escalated.  It was only for a week, except it's not anymore. Dating my stepbrother? Sure, let's just see how that goes. Completely ignoring all my responsibilities, doing the opposite of what I know I should be doing, and seeking vengeance against my ex-boyfriend because he can't stop being a complete jerk?  I'm the worst good girl ever, aren't I? I used to be so good at it, too.  Ugh.  I'm just kind of hoping for the best now.",
