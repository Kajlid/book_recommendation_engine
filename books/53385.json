  "description": "Learning new magic isnâ€™t as easy as Zoe expected, especially when the mages at Gorgon University seem dead set against teaching. Add in some necessary late-night sneaking about, and Zoe is almost certain to be kicked out. No one in their right mind would view going to Wendal as a good alternative, but that's where Zoe ends up after she accidentally gains the attention of both a dragon and a wolf shifter. To regain her freedom, all Zoe has to do is unravel one very large curse that has befallen Lindis, the dragon. And then there's the wolf, Derrick. He's more than happy to protect Zoe from the dragons, but what might he demand in return?",
