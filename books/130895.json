  "description": "I see her beautiful face whenever I close my eyes. I feel her soft lips press against mine as I’m falling asleep. Sometimes I have to turn around because I hear that smart mouth giggling behind me. But Maya isn’t here anymore. She doesn’t realize just how much danger she’s in now and I want to keep it that way. I will do what it takes to protect her, even if she hates me when she finds out. Maya’s psychotic boyfriend is the least of my worries. No one walks away from my world. No one gets away with what I’ve done. How could I have known that I’d survive long enough for the past to haunt me? I always thought I’d go out in a blaze of glory, but I have too much to live for now. Disappearing into my rage is not an option anymore. Each move must be calculated perfectly. There is no room for mistakes. She belongs to me. I want to wake up with my arms around her every morning. I need to feel her fingers slide over my flesh every night. I will do anything to have her. Anything. Part 2 of 3. The detailed description is too hot for Amazon's filters! Look Inside or download a sample to see if it's too intense for you.
