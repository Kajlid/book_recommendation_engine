  "description": "This authoritative Aâ€“Z constitutes an essential source of information for all who dare to venture into the imaginative hinterlands. It provides acute insights into such mysteries as how HORSES reproduce, the varying types of VIRGIN and the importance of CLOAKS to those wondering about going on a quest with a fellowship (of the Ring or otherwise).FeaturesA map (obviously)Lively background on those you will meet, BARBARIAN HORDES, lots and lots of wild-seeming people advancing under a cloud of dust in order to devastate the more civilised parts, and ELVES, who claim they did not evolve like humans...Certainly there seems to be no such thing as the Elvish ancestral ape.Full details on the catering BEER always foams and is invariably delivered in tankards. (What do you mean, 'it tastes awful'?)Useful hints on coping in ARMOUR is generally regarded as cheating, TORTURE is obligatory at some stage.",
