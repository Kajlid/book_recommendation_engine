When she left Iowa six years ago, she had no idea what life had in store for her but she had to get away. Everything changed once her college sweetheart left her high and dry to play some stupid game. He didnâ€™t even bother to say good bye. She had woken up and he had been gone, along with all of his belongings. The sad thing was, she never got to tell him her secret.Matt is tired of his life. He has devoted the past 10 years, (six of them as a professional athlete) to football. It has been all he ever wanted to do. But lately, he has discovered that he is tired of the travel, tired of the hits, and most definitely, tired of the loneliness. Now he wants to find someone and settle down. Only problem is, can he find the one before it is too late?",
