  "description": "'If anyone else were to kill them it would be murder, for Henry, it would be suicide.' Henry Madison is an apathetic young man with little to no ambition. When he loses his job and his girlfriend in one day, he is destitute and signs up for paid medical testing. Henry soon finds out that the medical tests are actually cloning experiments. The doctor creates clones of Henry but soon they escape and start causing havoc in Henry's life. He is hired in secret by the strange doctor and trained to hunt the clones down one by one and kill them. Henry soon finds out, however, that personality isn't genetic but made of the experiences you have, and as time progresses, his clones become less carbon copied than he was lead to believe, growing their own identities and challenging Henry's perception of what it means to be Henry Madison and of what it is right and what is wrong.",
