  "description": "Southbound is the story of Ryan McGuire, a horse racing announcer who is a recovering compulsive gambler. Once the racing season is done at his home track in Portland, Oregon, he finds himself with what he fears most, lots of time and money on his hands and nothing to distract him. After making that dangerous first bet and winning, he decides to empty his bank account and head south to Los Angeles to play the races and live the life he always used to dream of, the life of a professional gambler.\"A gritty fearless portrayal of a man in the midst of a gambling breakdown. A relapse to end all relapses. It's horrifying as it is intense and written with a lean, sharp eye.\"--Willy Vlautin, author of The Motel Life and The Free“There’s a line that runs alongside our ordinary lives, just beyond the grind of things. Jason Beem’s novel Southbound derails your ordinary life and shoots you into the thrill, rush, and dark brutal truths of gambling and racing. And he doesn’t flinch. A glorious and visceral book. I sweat reading it.”–Lidia Yuknavitch, author of The Chronology of Water and Dora: A Headcase.",
