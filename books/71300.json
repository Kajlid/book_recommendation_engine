  "description": "When workaholic Cecile Day realizes she isn’t living the life she wants, she uproots her life in Denver and moves to her family’s ramshackle cabin in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. Cecile wants to slow down, move to the country and live a life full of the things money doesn’t buy, but her motives for moving aren’t quite that simple. She knows running from an array of demons, leaving a wealthy fiancé and high-powered career won’t be easy, but what she hopes to gain by moving is peace of mind, sense of self and lasting happiness. Upon her move, Cecile meets her sexy neighbor, Ethan Morgan. Cecile quickly discovers Ethan can provide her with companionship and a simple, country life, that is, if she’ll let him. She feels haunted by her past mistakes and struggles to feel worthy of Ethan’s affections. Even though Cecile has worked hard to simplify her life, will she realize she can’t live without the most basic necessity of all: love.",
