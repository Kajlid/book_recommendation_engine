  "description": "In 1996, S. T. Joshi's H. P. Lovecraft: A Life was published to universal acclaim. Joyce Carol Oates called it the \"definitive\" biography, and it won the British Fantasy Award and the Horror Write Sers Association Award. But that 1996 edition was abridged from the manuscript that Joshi wrote in 1993-95; in all, more than 150,000 words were cut for space reasons.Hippocampus Press is proud to present the complete, uncut edition of Joshi's biography, I Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft. In addition to restoring every word of Joshi's original manuscript, the entire text has been thoroughly revised and updated in light of the new information on Lovecraft that has emerged since 1996. As such, this book can now truly be said to be the definitive biography of H. P. Lovecraft, written by the world's leading authority on Lovecraft. Readers will find countless details about Lovecraft's life and work not included in the earlier edition, along with important updates on new publications by and about Lovecraft in the last 15 years and on Lovecraft's increasing worldwide reputation. This book constitutes S. T. Joshi's final word on Lovecraft the man, the writer, and the thinker.",
