  "description": "Life’s tough when you didn’t expect to be living it.But now that Journey has a future, she apparently also has to figure out what that future’s supposed to look like.Some days the pain feels as fresh as that day. The one with the pills, the hospital, and the end that didn’t come. Her parents don’t know how to speak to her. Her best friend cracks all the wrong jokes. Her bipolar II disorder feels like it swallows her completely.But other days—they feel like revelations. Like meeting the beautiful Etta, a community college student who is a world unto herself. Or walking into the office of the volunteer hotline and discovering a community as simultaneously strong and broken as she is.Or uncovering the light within herself that she didn’t know existed.",
