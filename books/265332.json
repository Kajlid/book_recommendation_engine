  "title": "The Under-Butler's Ginger: Taking His Heat",
  "description": "If Lady Henrietta–Hattie to her friends–doesn't choose a husband soon, she knows that arrangements will most definitely be made for her. After all, she's nearing nineteen, practically a spinster. She has no objection to the basic concept of matrimony, but she craves a little excitement, some adventure and romance... perhaps even an illicit taste of scandal before she weds. Alas, it seems that that is not to be her fate... But when she accidentally catches the estate's under-butler disciplining her lady's maid in a most unconventional and intimate fashion, Hattie just can't get the sight out of her mind... or how much Clara seemed to enjoy the feel of his hand against her delicate posterior. It is unacceptable and unthinkable that a mere maid might revel such thrills when fate has denied them to a high-born lady like herself. But a wild gambit to sample her maid's dark delight will yield far more than Hattie bargains for. She's expecting the sting of his hand... but not the lash of his cane, nor the raging inferno of lust brought on by a carefully placed ginger root... Her reckless subterfuge may give Lady Henrietta a taste of the adventure she craves, but will she be changed forever by the diabolical heat of the under-butler's ginger?",
