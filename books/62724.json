Knowing the unsolved arson had been meant for her is the one thing she can't handle. Instead of dwelling, she stuffs her guilt soundly into her subconscious through diving into the teaching job she loves by day and the dirt of the landscaping business she owns by night. Her habit of remaining aloof to personal relationships is, well, working. Will her guilt be as easy to keep buried if the killer comes back to finish the job?In the midst of juggling a scorched yard, dead animals on her doorstep and her vandalized car, the one thing she didnâ€™t count on was the staggering Nathan Reed. A nationally renowned woodworking artist, Nathan and his two priceless nephews move into the run-down historical house behind her and over Black Creek. They have a canny way of maneuvering around her aloof demeanor and into her heart. Will they still want to be part of her life when they discover she is haunted by past memories and hunted by present dangers?",
