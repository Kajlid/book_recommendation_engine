  "description": "He Has a Month to Win Her Love. And They're Already Married.First comes love, then comes marriage - right? Not so for Carrie Allen. When her newly bankrupt father arranges a union with the wealthy but unappealing Justin Monroe - interrupting a nascent courtship with the one she loves - Carrie's understandably upset. But even after telling her new husband they're wrong for each other, he refuses to grant an immediate annulment. Instead, Justin offers a a month-long trial marriage. As she does everything she can to prove the marriage is doomed, he tries just as hard to win her affection. All of which makes for an uproarious romantic comedy set amid the manners and mores of the late-nineteenth century. Will Carrie melt under the heat of Justin's desire? Or will she always remain The Cold Wife?",
