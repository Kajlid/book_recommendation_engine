  "description": "A homicide detective must chase down a violent drug lord whose product is leaving a trail of bodies in its wake. Detective Brennan is aided by having a special power—he innately knows when someone is lying to him or telling the truth. There are others like him, though, and his dreams are haunted by deadly agents from his own shady past. Meanwhile, in the valley outside the city, a young boy comes into his own power of downloading other people’s memories on touch, and he uncovers old secrets that threaten to tear his whole family apart. His power also makes him a prime target for the aforementioned shadowy dream-stalking agents, since his brain lights up like a beacon at night with so many memories crammed inside.",
