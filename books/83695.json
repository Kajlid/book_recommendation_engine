  "description": "Ryan Kendrick, brother of Rafe Kendrick, from Baby Love (1999), takes center stage as the hero of Anderson's latest emotionally charged contemporary romance. Handsome, wealthy rancher Ryan has a reputation around Crystal Falls as a love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy, so when he starts flirting with wheelchair-bound paraplegic Bethany Coulter, the Coulter family immediately becomes concerned. Having no desire to risk going through the same intense emotional pain she suffered when her only boyfriend abandoned her after she was injured in a barrel-racing competition, Bethany declines all of Ryan's romantic overtures. Ryan, however, discovers Bethany is the woman he has been waiting for all of his life, and now he moves heaven and earth to convince her of that fact. Anderson comes up with another winner by deftly blending sweetness and sensuality in a poignantly written story that proves true love can overcome any boundary.
