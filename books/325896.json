  "description": "Fishing for Stars has, at its heart, two passionate, unforgettable - but very different women. One is exotic, damaged, and shrewd; the other beautiful, determined and zealous. Both are bitter rivals for the love of the same man.My story is set in Australia, the Pacific Islands, Japan and Indonesia during the latter half of the twentieth century. Nick Duncan is an ingenuous male with a great deal more female on his hands than he can possibly hope to understand.The contest he is called upon to referee is the clash between the two great loves of his life: the seductive Anna Til, and the older, equally fascinating Marg Hamilton. Nick struggles between their worlds: one exploiting the world's riches for profit, the other fighting to save the environment and its creatures, large and small.I hope you like Fishing for Stars - it is a story of ambition, destruction, love, tears and laughter, with a soup√ßon of hope thrown in.Bryce Courtenay",
