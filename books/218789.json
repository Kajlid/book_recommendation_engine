  "description": "Until I joined the Marching 300 at Sauvage State University, I was just too-tall, tuba-playing Lena Leblanc. But college changes everything. Suddenly I have friends, and they won't let me dodge the attraction I have for hulking, Viking-like football player Anders De Groot. He makes me feel; makes me believe that I'm more than a burden to others. That I'm more than just Lena. And for a girl whose mother checked out years ago, that's the scariest feeling of all.  Before I met Lena, all I had was school and football; study and stadiums full of spectators cheering for \"Root!\" Now, I can't get her out of my head. She's everything I could possibly want in a woman and I need to prove to her how good we'll be together. I need to show her that, no matter what, she's perfection. My perfection. And I'll stand my ground to make sure nothing ever hurts her. Not even her family.  See what I mean? How can he even be real? So impossibly sweet and hot? But with my stepfather threatening us, I'll have to learn how to step up and fight for what I want. Otherwise I'll lose the greatest thing to ever happen to me.",
