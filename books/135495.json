  "description": "A HUSBAND REMEMBEREDWhen Kelsey Reed awoke from her coma, the only person she wanted was her husband, Cooper. So why was everyone looking at her as if she'd lost her mind? And why was Cooper acting like a stranger? Once she was out of the hospital, Kelsey was sure everything would be normal again - and she and Coop could go back to trying for that baby they'd always wanted. A PAST FORGOTTENAmnesia! Not only had Cooper Reed's 'wife' forgotten they'd divorced two years ago, but she'd also forgotten that she'd left him! Then the doctors advised him that Kelsey couldn't handle the truth yet, and that left him playing house with a woman who was no longer his wife - a woman he's never stopped loving!",
