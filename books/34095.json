As she struggles to survive shipboard intrigue and entrapment, there's a bright spot when she befriends a fellow passenger, Michael Sanders - an enigmatic recluse with plenty of reasons to keep to himself. But, having felt the sting of heartbreak time and again, Maggie may not be ready to embark on another relationship. When Michael must leave the ship to assist in an emergency, she wonders if their friendship will endure the distance between them, particularly when she encounters a crisis of her own.",
