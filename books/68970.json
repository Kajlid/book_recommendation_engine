That night in Glass Lake nearly kills Alex and, near death, she leaves her body. Now she finds herself a witness to murder. But one that could never testify in court. For Alex has become the spectral witness.Finding out who was behind the killing will take Alex across the most dangerous terrain of all: her own soul.",
