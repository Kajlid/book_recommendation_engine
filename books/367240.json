  "description": "The poetry of the medieval Persian sage Rumi combines lyrical beauty with spiritual profundity, a sense of rapture, and acute awareness of human suffering in ways that speak directly to contemporary audiences. Trained in Sufismâ a mystic tradition within Islamâ Rumi founded the Sufi order known to us as the Whirling Dervishes, who use dance and music as part of their spiritual devotion. Many of Rumiâ s poems speak of a yearning for ecstatic union with the divine Beloved. But his images bring the sacred and the earthy together in startling ways, describing divine love in vividly human terms.  This volume draws on a wide variety of translationsâ from the early twentieth century to the presentâ of Rumiâ s deeply moving, sensually vibrant poetry.",
