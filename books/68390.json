  "title": "Positive Depression",
  "description": "This book, that I wished simple in style and accessible to all, is meant for the depressed patient so he may orient himself in time, may better understand where he comes from, where he is and in which directions he is very likely to go, a book to help him grasp the path he has followed as well as the road, often lengthy and difficult, still left for him to travel. \tIts purpose is simply as a little manual to allow the reader – at least in my hopes – to move forward. As much a tool for he who is not undergoing depression but is aware of living through a delicate situation, as for he who is experiencing difficulties but still refuses to admit them to himself, and finally for he, who – unfortunately – has just fallen into depression. May all such patients take the time to read this work.",
