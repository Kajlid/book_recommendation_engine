  "description": "The best Korean food is Korean home cooking. The cornerstones of every meal are kimchi and white rice, and once you unlock that perfect marriage of flavor, the universe of wholesome, vegetable-centric cooking will inspire healthy eating, every day. In this insightful and endearing cookbook, new flavors, techniques, and ways to enjoy one of the world’s greatest cuisines are revealed by chef and father Peter Serpico.Born in Seoul and raised in Maryland, Serpico’s route to Korean food came long after making a name for himself in New York City restaurants. His first bites of marinated short ribs and black bean noodles tasted like home, and a love affair with the flavors and techniques of his birthplace began. His debut cookbook draws from his decades of professional cooking experience to elevate the greatest hits of at-home Korean dishes. Serpico’s brilliant Instant Kimchi brings home the funk of fermented cabbage in record time, his hearty interpretation of gamjatang is a Spicy Pork Rib Stew to share, and his classic noodle and rice cake dishes borrow from grandma with clever spins for the modern, busy parent. BBQ fans will love a Korea-fied roast chicken and a sweet-and-spicy grilled cauliflower.Across 100 recipes, Serpico shares his philosophy of eating, his personal journey into food, and a connection to family that promises satisfaction and comfort for cooks of all backgrounds.
