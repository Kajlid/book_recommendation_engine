His best friend is Benji, a wise old shepherd, and Benj teaches Peter to care for the sprightly lamb that becomes his special pet, his cosset. As Biddy grows into her place as leader of the flock, Peter grows too, learning the skills and joys of the shepherd’s life. Mountain Born is a Newbery Honor Book.",
