  "description": "Rhyme follows rhyme as layer after layer of winter clothing (\"bunchy and hot, wrinkled a lot, stiff in the knee, and too big for me!\") is first put on and then taken off to the relief of the child bundled inside. Clever rebuses and jaunty illustrations make The Jacket I Wear in the Snow especially fun for prereaders and new readers.",
