  "description": "All Rob wants to do is take Alyson and Jason home. Sixty children have been freed from the vampire lair in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, and all the vampires in the caves have been killed. The hard part is finally over. All that's left for Robert Mackie to do is get his niece and nephew home safely to complete the rescue. After receiving assurances of safe passage from Lisa Kaes-the de facto head of the West Texas vampire family who ran the living blood bank in the Guadalupes-former DEA agent Mackie makes a detour to Lajitas, Carlos Santiago's hometown. He'll give the old man's family and the Guardians a full accounting of what happened in the mountains, and with a final farewell, he and the children will be on their way east-putting the vampires behind them for good. But when you're dealing with vampires, nothing is ever that easy. Unbeknownst to Rob, one of the vampires killed during the rescue was the father of a dysfunctional family from Detroit...and several members have traveled all the way to Texas to exact their revenge. This gripping sequel to Guardians is a genre-bender of exceptional quality-a paranormal thriller that will leave you wanting more.",
