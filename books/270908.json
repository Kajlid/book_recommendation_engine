  "description": "She’s a woman who has never done anything like this before… Disaster had her world uprooted, her plans for her life going in a direction she could have never seen coming. Shackled with a debt she has no way to pay off, she makes a decision she never could have seen herself making. One contract. Three months. Complete financial freedom. But at what cost? He’s a man who has never been in love… But there was no mistaking that love was exactly what he was feeling toward a woman who never should have stepped into his office to begin with. The kind of woman his filthy hands never should have touched in the first place. But there was no going back. And as feelings grow, he wonders how could he even begin to explain to her all his deceptions, or expect her to ever be able to trust him again enough to give something real a chance? * This book contains taboo/risque themes. Read at your own discretion.",
