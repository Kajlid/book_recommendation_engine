  "description": "He’s going to hell. Not that he’s any stranger to the place. For two years Richard Wolfe has lived in a self-imposed hell in order to prove his devotion to the woman he loves. When Dr. Fallon Enright asks for an early release from her contract with the Lothario, Richard knows his time has run out. Desperate to keep her onboard, he stoops to an all-time low, even for him.Fallon knew it wouldn’t be easy to walk away from the Lothario, and the man she loves, but she never dreamed Richard would stoop to blackmail to keep her onboard. Worse, instead of leveling charges of sexual harassment, she’d agreed to his asinine plan. For the next week, she would submit to Richard, in all things. The possibilities sent a shiver down her spine.",
