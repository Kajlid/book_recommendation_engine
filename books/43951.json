  "description": "After witnessing her parents’ brutal murders at the hands of red-eyed creatures, Meaghan narrowly escapes the same fate. Her best friend, Nick, tells her the creatures are Mardróch. They come from another world and so does she. Now that the Mardróch have found her, she must return to her homeland of Ærenden or face death. Left with little choice, she follows Nick into a strange world both similar to Earth and drastically different. Vines have the ability to attack. Monkeys freeze their victims with a glare. Men create bombs from thin air. Even Meaghan’s newly discovered empath power turns into a danger she can't control. But control becomes the least of her worries once the Mardróch begin targeting her. When Nick confesses he knows the reason they want her, she learns the truth behind the kingdom’s fifteen-year civil war—a long-buried secret that could cost Meaghan her life.",
