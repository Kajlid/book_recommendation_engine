Being stabbed in the back more times than he could possibly count has left his trust broken beyond repair. However, all of that threatens to change the moment he meets Avalon. She’s flawless, friendly, and incredibly talented at breaking through Shay’s defenses—which drives him absolutely insane. But there’s something alluring about her upbeat attitude and playful sense of humor, and before he can stop himself, he’s falling for her.  When things take a turn for the worst, Shay discovers more about his world than he could’ve imagined in his wildest dreams. There’s far more to his existence than meets the eye. He knows one thing for sure: he has to fight the evil that haunts him. It’s the only way to save Avalon and finally get the vengeance that was always his. But some things were meant to be set in stone. If the course of fate cannot be altered, can Shay be saved…  …from himself?",
