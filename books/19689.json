  "description": "Meg Embry has a closet full of dreams. Her problem is that all of the hangers are empty. A doting granddaughter, a submissive fianc√©e and a struggling business owner, she doesn't know if who she is, is who she wants to be. Will she end up like her kind-hearted but felonious grandfather, her eccentric, vodka-drinking grandmother or her moonstruck aunt? If she's honest, the best answer is \"none of the above.\" Armed with nothing more than the support of her two closest friends and the forbidden but growing interest in a handsome stranger, Meg learns that what she wants isn't necessarily what she needs, and that sometimes love, family and betrayal are bound together forever by lily white lies.",
