  "description": "Trace McKenzie is expecting to be bored out of his mind the night his little sister talks him into taking her to a lingerie fashion show. As a billionaire playboy he's sampled plenty of the runway beauties and was no longer interested. What he doesn't expect is the sultry hot number that's the night's entertainment. Her voice pulled him out of his ennui with its touch of old world style, but what trapped the breath in his lungs was his first look at her. A quick look at Google on his phone gives him the basics. She's Shiane, the worlds' hottest new sensation, and she's only twenty-three to his thirty-five; but this go getter isn't about to let something like that stand in his way. Before the night is over he's cornered the young beauty and lays down the law.",
