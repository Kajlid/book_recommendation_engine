  "description": "Annabel Lee Donovan may be a bootlegger's daughter, but she is also a lady. The slim, dark-haired young woman desperately wants her father to leave \"the business\" and settle down in one place. Instead, their latest move, done in the middle of the night with the help of henchmen Boone and Spinner, brings her to an ordinary house high on a hill above Henderson, Missouri. Yet this place, Annabel will soon discover, is different, for what is about to happen here will alter the course of her life.America, too, is facing a transformation. The Jazz Age began as a high-spirited decade of speakeasies and bathtub gin. But by 1925 whiskey running has become a deadly struggle between mobsters from St. Louis to Chicago. And the whole country, like Annabel, senses the change. Behind the wailing music beats a warning that the good times are coming to an end.Yet something wonderful seems about to unfold for Annabel, when she meets handsome Corbin Appleby, former sheriff of Fertile, Missouri. Despite fears that Corbin could be an undercover agent after her father, Annabel is falling deeply in love for the first time. Then a whiskey war explodes in Henderson, and just as gunshots shatter lives, betrayal threatens to shatter dreams and a woman's heart.",
