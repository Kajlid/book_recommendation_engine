  "description": "The OFFICIAL Charles Bronson guide to who’s who in the underworld and beyond. Haven’t heard of Bronson - you must be from Mars. Capable of bending steel bars with his hands, punching through bullet-proof glass and kicking his way out of steel doors. Bronson gives his utmost respect to most of the faces within. Legends that Bronson feels deserve space in this A-Z guide of criminals and those connected in some way to them. You will not be able to put this book down. Includes a guest spot given over to Manchester’s Paul Massey. Short succinct write-ups. Bronson goes overboard in this book with a universal appeal. USA serial killers and others from around the globe. Nicknames leave little to the imagination: The Mummy, The Wolf Man, The Human Slug, Semtex Man, The Pie Man, The Wizard, Cannon Ball, Quasimodo, Voodoo Man, The Promoter and hundreds more – all real people. Legendary Scottish Bank Robber, James Crosbie - guest contributor for Scotland. Foreword by Joe Pyle Snr. Ireland isn’t forgotten either. Look out for the mystery ‘Legend’ and some surprises are in store. Icons are few; Legends are many, look out for the ‘Icons’ section. Who makes it in to the top slot, find out? Who is the ‘Mystery Legend’? Truth about Lady Diana’s death, Al Fayed and the bodyguard’s story, too much to list.",
