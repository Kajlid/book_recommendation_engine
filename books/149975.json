It contains an appealing and universal message inspiring world-mindedness and soliciting the highest human motives and attributes for the establishment of a spiritual society. Written by Abdu'l-Baha in the late nineteenth century as a letter to the rulers and people of Persia, it is still profoundly relevant today as a guide to creating a peaceful and productive world.",
