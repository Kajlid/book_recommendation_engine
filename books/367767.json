  "description": "A plague has devastated the world's society and the government that's left realizes the necessity of rebuilding the population. The few women who survive are enslaved - sold and traded and bred. Owned by their male relatives, they are punished severely for any misdeed - real or perceived.Prima is such a woman, bought and paid for by Joseph, a man who intends to get full use of her, in every conceivable way.Prima is, technically, a post-nuclear (post-plague) genre story that contains extremely harsh, non-consensual scenes of BDSM, anal, and the occasional touch of ageplay. It is explicit and severe. It may not appeal to all readers.",
