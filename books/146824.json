  "description": "Lily. She was my gift. A reward for all the years of hard work I'd suffered through. Her fear excited me. Her fight...seduced me. From the beginning, I wanted to keep her. I knew there was no other woman for me. When she was taken, I vowed to get her back. There was nothing that would stop me. Nothing, but my father. The deal he had with the Governor stripped me of all entitlements over my slave. She was returned, and me, I was stuck back in the life I'd hated for so long. Until...she became a murderer. Her actions broke the deal and erased any agreement to keep me away. And I haven't been far. Even though years have gone by, I've refused to give up. Her guards are relaxing. She's all but forgotten her past. Forgotten ME. The time has come to remind her of who she really is. Of WHO she belongs to. LilyLILY is over 120k+ words!!! (Super novel length). Warning: This book contains VERY graphic violence, disturbing situations, dubious consent, and very strong language.",
