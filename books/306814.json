  "description": "The day you overhear your best friend say she’d like to have sex with you is a damn good day. But, hey, Cris always takes care of me at work. What’s wrong with me taking care of one of her needs? Besides, it’s only temporary.One breathless encounter later, I learn two things: 1) We are compatible in ways that exceed our working relationship and 2) She’s chosen me to be her first. Most guys might balk at the responsibility. Not me. Put me in, coach.But when it comes time to wrap up our sextra-curricular activities, my heart is doing its first ever free-fall. Now I’m scrambling to convince her she’s found her Prince Charming—spoiler alert: it’s me—and that forever isn’t a fairy tale.",
