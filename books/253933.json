  "title": "Love, Sugar & Cookie",
  "description": "This is a story about twin sisters. It is about their love for each other and their strong bond. It is also about how they are the same but very different. It is a true story. I used photographs taken over the years to illustrate each and every page.I hope this book brings to life what I enjoy every day. These two little fluff balls are the love of my life. I can not imagine my world without Sugar and Cookie in it. I knew right away that they were very special dogs. People would surround us in the park to take pictures. They are little celebrities already. Whether I am taking them for a ride in the car or in the stroller or in the lobby of my building, they are always photographed by people.The smiles that they put on every person that has the pleasure of meeting them, is what lets me know that these dogs are very special.Also available in Spanish",
