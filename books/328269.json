  "description": "WILL HE SNATCH DARREN TO HIS NEST... AND TEAR HIS HEART OUT?******************************************************************************************In this world… there were no rules that ruled this other world out there. There were no limits that should not be exceeded. Everything was vague, blurred in the darkness. Darren was wandering in this darkness, following that smell, voice, gaze… not knowing where it would lead him, but instinctively… wanting to know. Even if it caused him… deeper and stronger fear.Every glance from Varis, at meals, corridors, lessons, detentions… every single glance became worse and worse for him. Every moment the man approached him and stood so close that Darren could almost feel the brush of his black cloak and its intense aroma as the man bent over him, pouring his liquid voice and his dark gaze into him… When he was doing things like that… like reaching out for him, taking off his hood or covering, or when his fingers were tightening on Darren’s body, on his shoulder, on his chin, on his cheek… as if it was something natural… When he didn’t let Darren go and he was only looking at him, when his gaze was wandering over Darren’s face and body and he was doing it more and more boldly, more and more often, more and more insistently… When he was telling Darren what to do, where to go, how to dress, when to do the assignments, where to do it and for how long… when he was managing Darren’s free time, keeping him in the classroom long after the lessons ended, even though Darren had done absolutely nothing to deserve detention… When he was whipping Darren by his cruel words during the lesson and then when they were alone, he was saying all those weird things Darren didn’t understand…It all made Darren feel more and more dizzy and confused, unable to focus neither on the lessons, nor on what Joel was saying to him. He was still wandering in his mind, trying to get it all and find his way out, back to freedom, but it was so hard… Like he was locked in some cage that was tightening more and more around his flapping wings, trying to crush them and not let him fly away.******************************************************************************************If you enjoyed our book, positive rating and review from you will help our book to reach more people who could enjoy it as well.
