  "description": "Enter the Forsaken Isles, where gods and magic move through the world. Join the struggle of Good and Evil as seen through four stories of heroes standing against warp and evil. Which hero will capture your heart and pull you into this world of fiery imagination? The corrupted anti-paladin drowning in blood who at last attains a hope of redemption is the first story. Discovery of a hell lord's religion adorned in the symbols of heaven is another. Perhaps, the story of a young knight's attempt to defy the elder gods will capture you. Or, the angels of Heaven and their friendship with paladins will sway you into the sunlight. Each story shows the world through a noble god and another in opposition. Whether it is the light or the dark that stirs your soul, Creation I - Tales of Goodly Might is a fast-paced vignette of adventure, action, and mighty deeds!",
