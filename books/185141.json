  "description": "\"This is a scorchingly brilliant book and Dreyfus is an authentic and vital writer.\" - Morning Star\"In his tales of bored and jobless layabouts, internet superstars, corrupt politicians and weary observers of socio-economic collapse, Dreyfus manages an equally coy and poisonous dissertation on 20-something British life.\" - Pop MattersManiac world leaders; talentless boybands; Westminster politicians; social media idiots; zero-hour contracts. Rupert's first collection of short stories uses transgressive fiction, black comedy and satire as a weapon for shooting down all of these and more. Keeping the spirit of rebellion alive, The Rebel's Sketchbook is set to become one of the most controversial releases in a generation.",
