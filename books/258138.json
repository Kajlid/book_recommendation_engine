She thought she was in love with Damian Dawson, valedictorian and Nimrock’s shining star. She tells everyone they’re drifting apart because he’s about to go off to college. The truth is she’s turning into a dragon.As if fangs and creepy visions weren’t bad enough, a knight, James, has come to take her life. He’s everything Damian isn’t: rude, arrogant… and a dangerous kind of sexy. When she discovers his orders come from a deep family feud, she convinces him that he doesn’t have to kill fledgling dragons to protect humanity. She wouldn’t hurt anyone, and she’ll prove it, even if it’s just to herself.There’s an ominous threat on the horizon, one that smells of burnt flesh tinged with dragonfire. Lily has Seen it. Where she places her trust and her love will determine who will hold her heart, and who will have to die.",
