Whilst attending battle, he receives word that his own castle is under attack. Keir returns to Pendragon Castle to discover that his wife and daughter have been murdered, and his young son is missing. So begins Keir’s descent into hell and despair.Three years later, Keir is still searching for his son as he is called upon to rescue the family of an ally whose castle is under siege. Once Keir fights his way inside, the damsel he is supposed to rescue does not believe he is there to assist her and a great battle ensues. But somewhere during that battle, Keir finds a strange and uncontrollable fascination with the Lady Chloe-Louise de Geld. When she’s not trying to gouge his eyes out, he catches glimpses of a woman of magnificent red hair, porcelain skin, and delicate features. \nAnd so, the love story begins....\nChloe is a much sought after beauty, brilliant, sweet and feisty. She awakens within Keir long-dormant emotions, feelings he believed died when his family perished. He doesn't want to love Chloe but he cannot help himself. His attention should be on finding his missing son but he finds it diverted by a woman he is falling more deeply in love with by the day.A vindictive and evil neighbor, however, who has wanted Chloe for his own, discovers St. Hever’s interest and uses lies and manipulation to convince Keir that he has Keir’s long-lost son. He proposes a trade – Chloe for the boy. Before Keir can make a decision, Chloe takes matters in to her own hands and the situation goes horribly awry.Through death, battle, vengeful enemies and ghostly visitors, Keir and Chloe’s love remains strong and unbreakable, and in the end Keir must once again wield his sword to save the woman he loves. \nWith flashbacks of the family he was unable to save, will he be too late?",
