  "description": "The NFL’s hottest quarterback sets his sights on me, he’s the one guy I can’t have. \n  Hudson Baldwin is a player—in every sense of the term. The god of the gridiron has no lack of women throwing themselves at him. Football players have always been on my no-go list. Just because I have to cheer for him doesn’t mean I want anything to do with his advances. Yet, here he is...telling me he wants me. He wants us. I’m not here to score with the NFL star player. But the more time I spend with the king of the turf, the more hits my defenses take. Can the connection between us be real? Or is believing love can exist in this brutal sport nothing more than a Hail Mary?   Note: Intercepted Hearts is a standalone sports romance that will give you all the feels. It’s filled with scorching banter, sexy scenes, and several laugh-out-loud moments. No cheating. No cliffhangers. Guaranteed HEA.",
