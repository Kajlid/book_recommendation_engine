David Thompson shares his passion for the unique style of cooking that he believes to be one of the world's greatest cuisines. He provides over 300 mouthwatering recipes, from the simple, honest flavour of a classic pad thai or the refreshing tang of a Green Papaya Salad to such elaborate creations as Green Curry of Trout Dumplings with Apple Eggplants or Stir-fried Crispy Fish Cakes with Pork and Salted Eggs. A series of introductory chapters examine the role of food in Thai culture and society, offer guidance on ingredients, with notes on availability and subsitutions, and explain the essential techniques of Thai cookery. More than 50 menus provide ideas for combining Thai dishes. Beautifully written, and complimented by superb photography, this book captures all aspects of this diverse culinary culture.",
