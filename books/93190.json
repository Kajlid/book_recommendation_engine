  "description": "Written by the world’s greatest authority on 18th century warfare, this fast-paced, exciting narrative will completely revise popular opinion about “Bonnie Prince” Charlie, the Duke of Cumberland (“The Butcher”), and the other major players in the Scottish uprising of 1745. Christopher Duffy’s original research reveals evidence of a wider plot against the Hanoverians and more support for the risings in Scotland, than had been suspected before. Filled with maps and a guide to the key sites, it provides an eye-opening perspective.",
