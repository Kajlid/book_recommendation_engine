  "description": "A \"beautifully written, richly textured, and haunting story\" (Chaim Potok), BAUMGARTNER'S BOMBAY is Anita Desai's classic novel of the Holocaust era, a story of profound emotional wounds of war and its exiles. The novel follows Hugo Baumgartner as he flees Nazi Germany -- and his Jewish heritage -- for India, only to be imprisoned as a hostile alien and then released to Bombay at war's end. In this tale of a man who, \"like a figure in a Greek tragedy . . . seems to elude his destiny\" (NEW LEADER), Desai's \"capacious intelligence, her unsentimental compassion\" (NEW REPUBLIC) reach their full height.",
