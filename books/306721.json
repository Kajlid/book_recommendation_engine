  "description": "Like most fifteen-year-olds, Kier enjoys gravityball, starship simulators, and pranking his little sister. Unlike most fifteen-year-olds, he’s the crown prince of a small planet.Then Devcorp arrives. The intergalactic giant has a history of ravaging worlds and assassinating stubborn rulers like his parents.Kier’s initial plan—punching Devcorp’s ambassador in the face—might not do the trick. Perhaps the legendary rangers could help... if his dad hadn’t banished them to a dragon-infested jungle.Kier’s adventures soon lead him to a marooned space pirate and a scrappy slum girl, but not everyone is what they seem. He’ll have to stay alive—and decide who to trust—in the quest to save his homeworld from Devcorp’s jaws.",
