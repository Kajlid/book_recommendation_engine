  "title": "The Valentine Cat",
  "description": "A lonely painter has given up on his life's workâ€”until he takes in a half-starved kitten. Soon he decides that the heart-shaped mark on the kitten's face must be lucky. The little cat gives the painter new belief in his art, and his paintings get better and better. Then the cat is stolen, and the painter finds himself lonelier than ever. But where a Valentine cat in concerned, things have a way of ending happily after all. Especially once the little cat makes his way to the palace, where a kindhearted princess puts everything right again.This charming story pairs Clyde Robert Bulla's masterful storytelling with dramatic art from Caldecott Medalist Leonard Weisgard. In paperback for the first time, this classic has been meticulously reproduced using the original illustrations.",
