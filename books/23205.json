  "description": "\"Liz Lochhead’s stunning new version of Medea is the kind of interpretation—brave, visionary, risky—that blows a well-known text apart and reassembles it in a completely new light... What Lochhead does is to recast Medea as an episode—ancient but new, cosmic yet agonizingly familiar—in a sex war which is recognizable to every woman, and most of the men, in the theatre...\"—The Scotsman",
