  "title": "How To Stubbornly Refuse To Make Yourself Miserable About Anything – Yes, Anything!",
  "description": "Most emotional misery and psychological disturbances are unnecessary over-reactions and can be significantly reduced – that is the simple message of this book. Not only are anger, anxiety and depression unnecessary, they are unethical, for when you allow yourself to become emotionally disturbed you are being unfair and unjust – to yourself. Dr. Albert Ellis, the originator of Rational-Emotive Therapy (RET), contends that we ourselves create our own feelings and choose to think and feel in self-harming ways. The way to escape this trap we set for ourselves is by application of the principles of RET. Given the stress and strain of modern day-to-day living, the last things we need are the inhibiting, crippling problems we bring upon ourselves by the way we think and feel about the world and the people around us. The simple, logical method outlined in this book is the soundest approach yet devised to acquire true mental health and happiness. Dr. Albert Ellis is the founder of the Institute for Rational-Emotive Therapy, which now has branches throughout the United States and around the world. He is the author of more than forty-five books, including A New Guide to Rational Living (with Robert A. Harper, Ph.D.), Sex Without Guilt and Sex and the Liberated Man.",
