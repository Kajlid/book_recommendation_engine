  "title": "The Cardinals: Thirteen Centuries of the Men Behind the Papal Throne",
  "description": "Although cardinals have been a highly visible part of the Vatican for thirteen centuries, surprisingly little has been written about these \"papal princes\" of the Roman Catholic Church. They are the \"nearly men\" of Catholicism, who might have become pope, but in most cases didn't, and instead wielded their power behind the papal throne.In this informative and entertaining history, Catholic insider Michael Walsh traces the origins and growth of the cardinal office and tells the stories of more than sixty of the most notable men to wear the red cap. Here are kingmakers, scholars, pastors, soldiers, and statesmen; venial rogues and bona fide saints; brothers, sons, even husbands and fathers -- and those remembered simply for their faithful care of the souls entrusted to them.Read more about the book in a blog post by Walsh on",
