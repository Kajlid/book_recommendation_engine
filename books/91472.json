  "description": "Conversations with The Universe: How the World Speaks to Us reveals how repetitions, coincidence and synchronicity are part of a personal conversation from the Universe, intended to provide ease and guidance. We are not alone, nor have we been creating life experiences on our own. There is a co-creative Universal Intelligence who is very much involved and continually seeking a dialogue. The problem is not so much the life challenges, but our own individual lack of communication with our co-creator. A conversation is happening all of the time, but we must open our eyes and ears to it. When we do, an opportunity to reconnect with the lighter side of life ensues. We do not have to get wrapped up in the heaviness. Instead of becoming overwhelmed by the issues at hand, we can become aware of the answers and solutions constantly presenting themselves. The Universe wants us to be joyful, have fun, and let go. The synchronicities, symbols, and messages are always intended to guide us. They are there to make us smile, to stop to remember there is more to life than the current object of our perceptions. Instead of having to work things out, we can play them out, yielding more aligned outcomes and a greater experience. When we are able to remember the vast connection that exists, the illusions we live become more and more apparent. Greater awareness of the messages and engagement in the dialogue allows us to laugh with the heavens at ourselves at life and our seriousness.",
