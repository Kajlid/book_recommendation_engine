  "description": "William Anson is done with relationships, thanks. He's starting the second year of his medicine degree single, focused, and ready to mingle with purely platonic intentions. Meeting Daniel , a barely recovered drug addict ready to start living life on his own terms, might just change that. There are two problems. William isn't out. What's the point in telling your friends you're bisexual when you aren't going to date anyone? Daniel's abusive ex-boyfriend still roams the university campus, searching for cracks in Daniel's recovery. No matter how quickly William falls for Daniel, their friendship is too important to risk ruining over a crush. William is fine with being just friends for the rest of forever. Well, not quite. Content warning - This book includes references to abortion, PTSD, drug addiction, abusive relationships, and self-harm.",
