Just as the two of them began to warm up to each other, the unthinkable happened.  The Black Wings were attacked and Tara was right in the middle of it. Sensing her weakness, Shadow knew he had to protect her. Even though they had just met, he was already staking claim to her. He knew a good woman when he saw one.
