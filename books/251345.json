Merryn, a thieving street rat, and Cara, a simple village girl granted divine power to heal, join forces to increase their chance of survival. Unknown to either was how fate would play out - with love and with loss. Merryn's heart breaks as Cara slips away from her. As time passes, Merryn learns to live without Cara in her life and ends up ruling the greatest empire since the time of the Romans. But who can heal the shattered heart of a ruler?",
