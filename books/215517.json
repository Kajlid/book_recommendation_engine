  "description": "AUTHENTIC STORIES OF ALIEN CONTACT WITH URBAN AMERICAN INDIANS Following on her bestselling book, Encounters with Star People, which told the stories of those living on the reservation, Ardy Sixkiller Clarkeâ€™s new book details the UFO stories of American Indians who live off the reservation. One intriguing difference between the two there were more cases of physical evidence presented to back up the testimony of urban American Indians. As with her first book, this volume not only recounts their encounters, but the recounting itself becomes part of the story. A professor emeritus at Montana State University, the author reveals herself as part UFO investigator, part journalist, part therapist, and part friend. The result is a work of great authenticity.",
