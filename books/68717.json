  "description": "\"You're cured now,\" Susan Cummings's surgeon proclaimed to her a few weeks after her mastectomy. \"That's it?\" \"That's it,\" her surgeon repeated. But that wasn't it by a long shot for Cummings. Adventures of a One-Breasted Woman deals with her odyssey during her firt six years after treatment for early-stage breast cancer. A single woman \"progressing at lightning speed through her middle years\" when diagnosed, a struggling New York actress, the memoir takes us on her up, down and sideways adventures--sometimes poignant, often laugh-out-loud funny--as she wrangles with her fear of more cancer and shame of her altered body. With indefatigable determination--from scouring the North American continent for the perfect health regimen to conducting a \"beautiful breast survey\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art--she does reclaim her moxie.",
