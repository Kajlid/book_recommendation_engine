  "description": "The Government's dossier on Jemma 7729 flags her as \"independent thinking\" of a \"rebellious nature\" exhibiting inappropriate behaviour. On the day Jemma is to freely choose what she will be for the rest of her life, the state intervenes and choses for her -- committed to custody without parole! But Jemma escapes, crisscrossing the country, avoiding recapture, and destroying the chemical plants used to \"alter\" women the government can't control. Jemma knows she has made the best choice of all - freedom!",
