  "description": "In this psychological thriller, two vagrants subject a sleepy Pacific Northwestern town to their arrogance, insolence, and wry disillusionment. Meanwhile the town itself revels in newfound cultural fame as the setting of a vampire blockbuster. But reality, along with all its flesh-and-blood residents, proves peculiar enough to hold the duo's attention for one evening. An evening that can only culminate in heartbreak, chaos, and the explosion of an ever-swelling bubble of lies.",
