  "title": "Full Moon Saturday Night",
  "description": "Just out of medical school with a $200,000 college tuition loan looming, Ronny Campbell did not have a clue what to do. All he knew was that he had to do something, and fast. He chose to try out emergency medicine first, get his bearings, and move on to whatever would fall into his lap later. ER work required no commitments beyond a month's schedule and it paid enough to keep him afloat in a bachelor pad while he drove long distances to work in hospitals in the southeast. The work was just as advertised, hours and hours of boredom, then the inevitable terrors and gut-wrenching calamities. Little did Ronny know he was also destined to be one of the calamities, brought on from simply doing his job. A nurse, herself in a situation spinning out of control, turned out to be Ronny's saving grace. A fast-paced insight into a strange life few are fortunate to witness. Fewer jobs are more bizarre than the one Ronny picked. Constant reflections on his dad's equally bizarre life as a nuclear bomber pilot kept him focused when he needed it most to survive.",
