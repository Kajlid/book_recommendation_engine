The next woman he pleases will need to follow a few rules…When Vera and Marcus meet at a fund raising slave auction in New York City, sparks fly, and she corners her man. Vera is sure she’s found the Alpha Submissive she’s been looking for, but will Marcus agree to give her the key to his heart as well as his collar?****This romantic story is a fictional account of a couple who have chosen to have a Female Led Relationship or FLR.
