  "description": "THEY SAY WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW CAN’T HURT YOU,  BUT THEY WERE WRONG...  GRACE: My name is Grace. But I don’t know that. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know where I came from. The only thing I do know is that I woke up in the bed of an irresistible, leather-clad man with wild, savage eyes and a body that shakes me to my very core. Not only did he save my life, but he makes me feel like I’ve known him forever.   Maybe remembering isn’t so important after all.  RYDER: I should have known there’d be trouble when I saw that fucking owl again. But what was I supposed to do? Leave Grace there to die? And besides, I knew Doc would take good care of her. What I didn’t know was that she would threaten to shatter the foundation of chaos I had worked so hard to build. What I didn’t know was that she would cost me the one thing I had vowed to keep locked down - my heart.  What I didn’t know could really hurt me.
