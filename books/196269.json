  "description": "“I’m walking away from that dream.”A medical emergency sends pro hockey player Cameron Riley back to his hometown newly single, looking for work, and hiding his past. He’s supposed to avoid anything that makes his heart race… like his new beekeeping boss’s nephew. Noah’s exactly the kind of guy Cam needs after his hellish ex.Art curator Noah Clark is unapologetically himself, even if it means getting stood up for dates. He didn’t expect a sweet, smart hunk like Cam to rescue him. Noah works hard and he dreams of letting himself love just as hard. His busy life would be perfect with Cam… but what’s his new lover hiding?As their relationship blossoms, Cam is offered the chance of his life—and millions—to abandon his new priorities: life, love, and family. With the game of their lives on the line, will Cam make the right choice? And is it too late for Noah to forgive Cam for his partial truths?Buzz is the first book in The Riley Brothers, a low-angst series filled with brotherly banter and small-town smiles. This steamy, standalone gay romance novel can be enjoyed on its own, and promises a happily-ever-after ending.",
