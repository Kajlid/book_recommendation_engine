  "description": "Once, I thought I was meant to be a hero.I’ve got a tattered American flag and the scars to prove it.But I survived war just to live in hell.And it turns out what I really am is a drifter.A man born to ride through this world alone.A former nomad who now rides with the Satan’s Knights of Brooklyn.I'm drifting into a brand new kind of chaos.The kind with luscious lips and intoxicating eyes. A girl who doesn't need a hero.Until she does.Until her power and control are tragically stripped from her. But a broken man who dances with the devil isn't meant to save anyone.",
