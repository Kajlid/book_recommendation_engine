  "description": "\"James Claffey's debut spans the distance of continents and the gulf between memories. At times beautifully surreal then painfully stark, his stories reach into those parts of us that long to be gathered and made whole again.\"--Ronlyn Domingue, author of The Mapmaker's War and The Mercy of Thin AirClaffey is a collector of moments that throb to life, shapes appear out of the mist of memory as irreducible as the mystery of existence itself. Blood a Cold Blue is fueled by a masterful writer; powerful, unforgettable and mesmerizing. â€“Meg Tuite, author of Bound By Blue \"In Blood a Cold Blue James Claffey infuses every story with rhythm and rot, doing things with words that I've never seen before and don't expect to again.\"--Ben Tanzer, author of You Can Make Him Like You and My Father's House",
