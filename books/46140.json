For some inexplicable reason, the thought of her with another man makes Knightly insanely jealous.Will Dear Annabelle find her happy ending?But Knightly’s scandalous periodical has been targeted for destruction by a vengeful Lord Marsden, and the beleaguered editor now faces a devastating choice: either marry Marsden’s sister to save his beloved newspaper…or follow his heart and wed his Writing Girl.",
