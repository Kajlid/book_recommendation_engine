  "title": "Advantages of Poverty",
  "description": "Advantages of Poverty, by Andrew Carnegie, is a dynamic book that encapsulates the life and wisdom of the millionaire philanthropist with brief biographical information along with portions of his other essays. You will discover the attitude of selfless giving that motivated this innovative businessman who helped various communities, charities, and organizations to achieve greater success during his day. The wisdom of the steel tycoon who immigrated from Scotland will undoubtedly inspire you to recognize the advantages of an exceptional work ethic that overcomes poverty and lack. I have had to deal with great sums. Many millions of dollars have since passed through my hands. But the genuine satisfaction I had from that one dollar and twenty cents outweighs any subsequent pleasure in money-getting. It was the direct reward of honest, manual labor. --ANDREW CARNGIE",
