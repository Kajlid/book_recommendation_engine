  "title": "Three to Get Ready",
  "description": "The charm of the book lies in its old-fashioned, full-fashioned illustrations of a talking cat and her kittens supplied with clothes and toys and furniture. It is often attempted in picture books but seldom comes off so well. The secret lies in the illustrator's hands because she can make the kittens look realistically boneless, balmy, wise or angry as the four simple stories demand. The first concerns George, who had to be wooed back from a jealous snit. The second concerns Gigi, who bollixed up their three month old birthday party through a spasm of selfishness. The third follows Ginger who left to see the world when told to stay in the yard and the fourth shows a mother-guided trip through their world for all three kittens. Gently sermonizing, simply worded.",
