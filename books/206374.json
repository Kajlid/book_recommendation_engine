It can make you believe things that are not real. It can seduce your mind and lead it blindfolded to the cliff that will be its demise. What would you do if you could leave your life? Wake up one day and be someone else?I signed the contract. I left Candace Tapers and her slutty, strip club life behind, abandoned every part of that life with one hesitant swipe of my pen. The agreement was clear:1. Sex2. Photo ops3. No romance\"I need a wife. I am not signing up for romance, or affection, or a full time job. I will not love you. I will have no use for you other than sex and photo ops.\"Sex with Nathan was easy. More than easy. Panty-melting, can-never-get-enough HOT. I had begun to think that I could live this new life, showered in luxuries, orgasms, and diamonds. Then I started tripping over secrets.
