  "description": "Morgan Fae was perfectly normal until she met Dave, the chubby vampire. After the fat leech accidentally reveals his true nature to her, Morgan is dragged to the Magical Beings’ Rehabilitation Center, an organization that strives to integrate magical beings into human society.After becoming employed at the MBRC, Morgan discovers that real magical beings are not like the stories. Werewolves aren’t buff, Vampires aren’t always good looking, cyclopes are actually quite personable, and some elves have a questionable sense of fashion.As part of her MBRC experience Morgan is also kidnapped, rides a unicorn, has her memories erased, meets a Doodle (a dragon-poodle. Don’t ask.), is pranked by the shape shifting Pooka, and tries to deal with the center’s ancient computer technology.There’s also that bit with the Goblin Mob, but Morgan hates remembering that.In order to survive Morgan must balance her normal life with the supernatural all while hanging with her best friend and attempting to flirt with her high school crush.Yes, Morgan Fae was perfectly normal, but she probably never will be again.",
