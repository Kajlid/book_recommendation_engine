  "description": "McB is a compassionate carnival owner who understands and cares for his “special” people. When he stumbles upon an attraction known as Twitch—an innocent, stubbed limbed, white eye deformity that has been used, abused and unwanted his whole life—at a competitor, he feels an instant attraction and a compelling urge to acquire. He purchases him and includes him in his “oddities” attraction where, unknown to McB, Twitch absorbs abuse from various gawkers. However, Twitch may seem helpless, but this couldn’t be farther from the truth.This dark and tightly written tale offers horror and suspense that will leave you aghast, frightened, angry, and sad. It is a tale of deserving retribution and a warning for those who view and treat the unknown with ridicule and pain.",
