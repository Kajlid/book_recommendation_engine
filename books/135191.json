  "description": "Taryn Ingliss, paparazzi/yellow-journalist, journeys to the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in search of answers to the mysteries surrounding Lachlan Baird and her ancestor, Robert Ingliss. What she uncovers defies even the unbridled highways of her imagination. During a previous stay at Baird House in Crossmichael, Scotland, Taryn encounters a man she believes she can long last love, but Lachlan's heart belongs to someone else, and Taryn proves that a woman scorned is a woman out to fill her emptiness with whatever adventure she can. This time, though, Fate takes charge and routes her into the core of a subterranean world beneath the Callanish Standing Stones, into the clutches of an ancient creature, and into the heart of the only man destined for her. The one man she will forsake all to love, including her life, if necessary.",
