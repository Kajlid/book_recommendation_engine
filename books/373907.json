  "description": "Two classic novels of diverse terror that could only come from the master of modern horror and suspense. CarrieTo be invited to the Prom Night by Tommy Ross is a dream come true for Carrie White - the first step towards social acceptance by her high school colleagues. But events will take a decidedly macabre turn on that horrifying and endless night as she is forced to exercise her gift on the town that mocks and loathes her...The TommyknockersComing back to Haven, Maine, has been like walking into a nightmare for Jim. It all looked the same, the house, the furniture, the woods. But it was in the woods that his friend Bobbi had stumbled over the odd, nearly buried object, had felt a peculiar tingle as she knelt down and brushed the soft earth away. And looking back, that had been the start of a terrible, terrifying transformation of an unremarkable place into something alien and hideous. A place of unrest and insane powers.",
