  "description": "She's searching for justice. He's searching for peace. What they need is each other. They just don't know it yet...Dean \"Wolf\" Garner is the kind of guy who loves hard and leaves fast. From the moment he rescues reporter Haylee Jamison in the Guatemalan jungle, he can't stop thinking about the dark-haired beauty. His life is too complicated for romantic entanglements though--and not even a woman like Haylee can convince him otherwise.  Haylee wasn't supposed to be in the drug cartel's compound, but she was captured while on a mission of her own: find the trail of fake opioids entering the US and halt the operation. Back home in DC, Haylee can't stop thinking about the gorgeous military operator who rocked her world for one steamy night before leaving. But when she uncovers a conspiracy and finds herself in danger, there's only one man she trusts to keep her safe.It's easy for Wolf to risk his life to protect Haylee and give her the justice she desires. The hard part is taking a chance and admitting what's in his heart before it's too late. Before he loses the best thing that's ever happened to him.",
