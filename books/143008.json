  "description": "About the Series1st Set: Olivia, Daisy, Paige, Athena.2nd Set: Shannon's Hope, Ruby's Secret, Victoria's Promise, Ilana's Wish, and the reunion book: Tying the Knot.The Newport Ladies Book Club series is unique in that each Newport book is written from the point of view of a different woman in the book club. The first 4 books cover the same time period and the same book club meetings. But only with reading all 4 books, will you learn the whole story of each of the women and her full character journey. The 2nd set of 4 books covers the next 4 book club meetings. Think of it as a parallel series, not as a forward-moving series.The final and 9th book, Tying the Knot, is a thank-you to all of our readers who have asked \"What happens next?\"Please note that the first 8 books can be read in any order, but Tying the Knot wraps up all of the stories in a single volume.",
