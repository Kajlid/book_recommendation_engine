  "description": "We have been spending an increasing amount of time in Mačva (a geographical region in northwest Serbia). At first it was only the weekends, then whole weeks and then it became months. Each time, we would come back with thousands of new photos, completely blown away by the hidden beauties which we had begun to discover every single day. Mačva deserves to have a book written about it! It deserves so much more than this, but a book will do to start with. We have decided to try to explore everything that we haven’t been able to explore so far, and to visit all the scenery that we haven’t yet seen. Our journey through Mačva started a little more than five years ago... ·Marko Zamurović A reportage and fine art photographer, Marko’s images eloquently capture everyday life, and highlight intimate moments of relaxation, work and celebration.
