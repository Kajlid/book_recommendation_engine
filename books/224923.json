  "title": "Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf",
  "description": "The pioneering linguist Benjamin Whorf (1897â€“1941) grasped the relationship between human language and human thinking: how language can shape our innermost thoughts. His basic thesis is that our perception of the world and our ways of thinking about it are deeply influenced by the structure of the languages we speak. The writings collected in this volume include important papers on the Maya, Hopi, and Shawnee languages as well as more general reflections on language and meaning.",
