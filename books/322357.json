  "description": "The Billionaire Who Wins At All CostsTexan Alton Bouchard always gets what he wants. There’s not much money can’t buy, and for everything else, he bulldozes his way to victory. The moment he sees Noah Divine, the heir of the Divine Conglomerate, Alton knows he wants him. Alton digs up enough dirt to scare Noah’s father, and before Noah realizes what is happening, he’s contracted to be married to Alton for six months.The Artist Minted by MoneyNoah Divine wants nothing to do with his family’s business. His dream to be a painter has made him his father’s number one disappointment. When he’s asked to marry Alton to smooth over the dark splotches on his family’s reputation, Noah can’t see a solution to the problem except to comply, if only to keep life normal for his younger siblings.The Marriage PlotAlton has a plan—a short marriage to Noah, which will give him business as well as personal opportunities. The hitch is that he doesn’t expect Noah to be so pure and innocent, especially since he’d grown up in the moneyed world of Vert Island. Noah wants to hate Alton, but he discovers there’s more to the billionaire than he shows. As they navigate their arrangement, they find their feelings for each other grow deeper than they anticipated. Once six months is over, their lives will go back to the way they were before the wedding. But what if they don’t want to be alone again? Can a marriage started with a contract ever become more?At the beginning of Bound to Him, Alton has a complete lack of morals, but never fear, Noah wins him over, and there is a happily ever after.",
