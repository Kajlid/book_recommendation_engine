  "description": "This travel memoir gives a unique perspective on what it is like to live and work in an American hostel. From the daily operations of running a hostel, to the tales of the colorful guests who grace its walls, this is an inside look at the lives and personalities of the people who come together to create a truly remarkable tale. In need of cheap lodging while she looks for work, Luanne ‘Lu’ Lusic makes a reservation at a hostel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for a week and ends up staying there for eight months. At the hostel, she falls madly in love with a man from Belize who is a devout Christian, befriends the hostel manager who offers her a job, and rooms with university students from all over the world. Caught up in the excitement of her newly found love and job, she is on top of the world . . . or is she? Things may not be as they appear.",
