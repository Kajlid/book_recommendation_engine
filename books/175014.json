  "description": "After her mother’s death, Faith Hardwood’s father is determined to leave the memories behind. On the train to Denver, a rough-looking man captures Faith’s attention; the stranger compels her in a way she’s never known. When robbers beset the passengers, he comes to her aid. The damage is done however, as they are robbed of every penny—the money they needed to live on.  Owen Birch, the stranger, has gambled his way to success, owning several hotels and saloons, including the Inter-Ocean Hotel in Denver. Traveling on business, he encounters a young woman, Faith, who takes his breath away. He can feel the weight of her interest, as her dark, expressive eyes linger on him. After the robbery, he generously gives Faith and her pa money, because they have lost everything.  Two years later, life in the city isn’t what Faith had hoped it would be. Her pa’s rarely sober and a gambler, while she is a saloon girl, working for tips and hoping for a better life. At the faro table one evening, Faith sees the man she met on the train. He too recognizes her. Although fate has been unkind, Faith senses her luck is about to change. However, Owen isn’t the sort of man to settle down. He prefers to keep things simple. He offers to take care of Faith, to spoil her as his mistress, but this isn’t what she wants. She’s in love, and, if she can’t have all of him, then she wants nothing at all.",
