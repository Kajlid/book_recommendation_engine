  "description": "Kiara is an aerialist with a nasty habit of taking things that don’t belong to her. Chris is the heir to the city’s most profitable construction empire, but only if he settles down. He is entranced by her performance until he notices his precious family ring on her finger. Now, Chris is offering her a deal. She can either pretend to be his girlfriend for the holidays… or face the consequences of her theft.---Kiara sat at her small kitchen table literally bumping her head into the wood. Why the hell did she agree to spend four days in an island with loaded snobs she knew nothing about? Of course, she didn’t know exactly what she signed up for before she accepted his offer, but she knew it came from the guy who sent her to fucking jail and said yes anyway.And based on what? A hunch. Something so intangible and arbitrary she would be unable to explain even to her dad, who was always a firm believer in following your gut. But she saw it, right there hiding behind his impassive eyes. He was… desperate.",
