The close-knit Wilkinson family unit is blown apart when Harry leaves Barbara, deserting the family home to start a new life in Spain with Carla.When Harry dies in strange circumstances, Carla doesn't know what to tell his family. His children want to evict her from the family home and the only weapon she has against them is the fact that she has recently discovered that, throughout their marriage, Harry and Barbara were keeping secrets from one another. Now that Carla has discovered the truth from an unexpected source, she has to decide whether to use this knowledge to save her home, knowing the devastation it would cause, or whether to let the past lie.",
