  "description": "The lush and humid poems of Luisa Igloria s Trill & Mordent are a feast for the ear and the eye. Bursts of color and music punctuate Igloria s dense, crafted lines, inviting the reader into Filipina life, a world at once strange and yet familiar to an American reader, opening wider perspectives into the commonalities and differences between America and the country it has so deeply influenced over the past century, the Philippines.",
