  "description": "For the woman in the temple courtyard, He knelt close as Emmanuel; for David, He tenderly cared like a Shepherd; for Nathanael, He showed His strength as a King.Jesus is given over a hundred unique names in scripture. Each one of them tells a story—a story about who He is, what He does, and how He shows up in our individual lives.The name Redeemer comes from a Hebrew word that means someone who will rescue or save by any means. Some days that is as a sacrificing Lamb, and other days it is as a loyal Advocate.Who Jesus was in the past—the Good Shepherd, the Mighty Jehovah, the Unfailing Deliverer—is who He still is today. As we learn about how He came into the lives of those in the scriptures, we begin to anticipate and see how He comes into our own stories.",
