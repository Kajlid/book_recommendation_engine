Her skin is grey, her expression guarded, defensive, her eyes avoiding mine. I hesitate. We have been here before with her illness so many times. I sense this will have to be different. This may be her last chance. . .When Carol Lee’s cherished god-daughter Emma descends into a long and dangerous battle with anorexia, Carol is the only one she trusts enough to let into her tormented world.Interspersed with revealing and poignant entries from Emma’s diaries, To Die For shows intensely, and ultimately joyfully, how the power of trust and shared memories can confront even this most cruel of illnesses.",
