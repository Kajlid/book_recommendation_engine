  "title": "Pills-A-Go-Go: A Fiendish Investigation into Pill Marketing, Art, History & Consumption",
  "description": "Named after and based on Jim Hogshire's popular zine Pills-a-Go-Go, this book is both a celebration of the wonders of modern pharmacology and a study of our society's propensity to take a pill as an antidote for virtually all of life's problems. To Hogshire, pills are the quintessence of Western culture, embodying our desires, fears, ambivalence about life and death, health and freedom -- as well as our faith in the quick fix.Hogshire muses on pill naming and marketing, presents up-to-the-minute pill news, and discusses celebrities and their pills of choice. Along the way, he provides histories of drug manufacturers and examines how pills are the product of decades of scientific exploration and the result of billions of dollars in research.",
