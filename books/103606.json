  "title": "Four From Below",
  "description": "Four From Below tells the tales of ordinary people -or so they seem- thrust into extraordinary circumstances: Ray Deet lives a life of shame. His mother abandons him, and the school bullies single him out for abuse. A chance encounter with a denizen of a world below changes the timid young boy, but are these changes for the better? Charlie Vos has a scoop. Aging actress Victoria Manwell, his teen fantasy, is now a recluse. She has a tale to tell. But is Charlie ready to hear it? Alexi Zachas has inherited his grandfather's mansion, and the hidden lab below. Aided by an eager young assistant, this practitioner of the \"sideways sciences\" hopes to turn back the clock on the human body. Apri Saluzar has a problem. Several problems, in fact: a domineering mother, insomnia, an unsatisfying job. Oh, and the occasional body part appearing in her home.",
