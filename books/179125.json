  "description": "She saw in him what no one else could see. He found in her what he could never find.One moment changed everything but, even with a break in time, their connection could never be severed.In the beginning he may have been her salvation, but in the end she will be his redemption.***This is Book One in the Acts Of Honor series, the spin-off series to Men Of Honor. Itâ€™s told in dual POV, has an HEA with no cliffhanger and it can be read as a standalone. However, I highly recommend that you read the Men Of Honor series prior, as characters play recurring roles in both series.Warning: Due to mature subject matter, such as explicit sexual situations and coarse language, this story is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.",
