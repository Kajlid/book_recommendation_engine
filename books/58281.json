  "description": "In this beautifully illustrated and fun-filled picture book, a young koala competes for her mother's heart when a new sibling is on the way--only to discover that families come in all shapes and sizes, and that there is no second place when it comes to love. Perfect for growing families or as a baby shower gift. When Koala Lou’s mother becomes so busy that she forgets to tell her firstborn how much she loves her, Koala Lou enters the Bush Olympics, intending to win an event and her mother’s love all at one time. Filled with charming art and featuring a heartwarming story about family, read the classic that's been called, “a first-rate choice for bedtime, story hour, or reading aloud.”--The Horn Book.",
