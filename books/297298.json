  "description": "To care for a terminally ill loved one is to enter into an experience from which neither hope nor regret can free you. You must live through the dying, the duty and the devotion. You must survive the sorrow.In this poetry collection, Judy Croome seeks the spiritual heart within the tangible realities of caring for her dying husband. Sometimes brutal and frank, often tender and compassionate, both lamentation and praise song, these personal poemsrefuse to cut emotional corners and yet evoke a haunting sense of higher meaning.The poems in DROP BY DROP go beyond the particular to speak of the deepest longings and darkest fears of the care-giving experience, while remaining sharply aware of how love transcends loss.",
