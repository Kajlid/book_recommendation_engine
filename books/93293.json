  "title": "The Penny Falls",
  "description": "Description: The remarkable thing about the Lyne twins is that there are three of them. There’s Pablo – inspired, creative and damaged, carried on a wave of dumb luck towards a moment of fratricidal release. There’s Tom – a sceptic and a womaniser, stiff with hidden resentment and dismissive wit. And there is – or there was, or there may yet be – Perdito, the third twin, part ghost and part derangement, a threat and a promise. He wants a body to call his own, and he feels he has two to choose from.",
