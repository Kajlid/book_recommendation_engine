One phone call and a new job working for the Kingson Pride means she may have found it. Everything about Wild Junction calls to her and her inner animal. There's only one problem.  Also new to Wild Junction are Thomas, James, and Antonio-men who set Abigail's prey instincts on edge and drive her body wild with temptation. The wolves are just looking for a new start, having lost everything they once held dear. Abigail might be that new start.  *The Wolves of Wild Junction is a steamy Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance duology. The leading lady will not choose between her three love interests. Intended for mature audiences.* *Set in the Wild Junction Universe. It is not required to read the Kingson Pride before starting the Wolves of Wild Junction.*",
