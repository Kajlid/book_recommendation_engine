  "description": "One blindfold. One woman's deepest fantasy. Two men with an innocent scheme that changes all their lives. Forever. Playing by the rules has never gotten Jayne Simon anywhere but trapped in a dull, humdrum life with a string of boring boyfriends. The one and only time she throws caution to the wind, embracing her inner freak and her deepest fantasy, Jayne gets much more than she bargained for. On the first day at her new job, Jayne is mortified to discover that her sexy new boss, Blake Travers, is the same man with whom she let her freak flag fly. Or so she thinks. Something doesn't add up when Blake doesn't remember her, or their night of uninhibited pleasure. Irresistible CEO, Devin Kirk, was only doing Blake a favor by agreeing to spend one hot night with a woman he'd never see, fulfilling her blindfold fantasy. Since they were both wearing blindfolds, she’d never know the difference, right? What he didn't count on was having the best night of his life. When the blindfolds come off, and all the cards are on the table, Jayne, Blake and Devin find their hearts in a tangled knot they're not certain they want to untie. Is three a crowd, or can they give their unconventional affair a chance to become the kind of love they never dreamed possible?
