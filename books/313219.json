  "description": "What do you do when you thought it was all over, only to realize it's all just begun?I died.I looked into Rogan Kendrick’s eyes, told him I loved him…and then I died.So how the hell am I standing naked in the middle of a morgue, doing my best not to freak the fuck out?I’m a Bone Witch, or at least I was before Rogan bound us together. Blood magic now flows through my veins too, and I think somehow the man I shouldn’t love, the one who betrayed me, who couldn’t choose me…has saved me.If the High Council finds out they’ll hunt us, and they won’t be the only ones. A certain bastard demon did promise to see me soon.I don’t know exactly what the hell is going on, but I do know this: My name is Lennox Osseous and it’s time to show them why you don’t fuck with the Bone Witch.",
