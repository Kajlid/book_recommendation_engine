Get the entire story here, as published in October 2017.Talents: Born with physical and psychic abilities beyond human understanding, these flawed forces of nature burn desperate paths through their own shadowy world ruled by sex, power, and madness. In this first novella of the Hidden Talents series, meet Ken, Jin, Sky, Mark, Lip, and Dylan. Driven by powers and desires beyond their control, these strange and beautiful men live by their own definitions of survival... Sent on the run by his leader after a disastrous change of leadership at KGA, bad boy telepath Jin heads to Paris to seek asylum with a group of rogue Talents living under the radar. Thrown into tumult after a recent suicide by one of their own, the Talents are not what Jin expected, but there's one in particular who captures his attention: Ken, a mysterious, sullen boy with mismatched green eyes and a scarred, lovely face. When Jin finds an old acquaintance has also been taken in by the Talents, he doesn't think things can get any weirder -- Sky, the beautiful blonde empath and former yakuza concubine Jin loved to torment in and out of bed, is hilariously furious to see him. But it's not just their history putting Sky on edge: Ken is his younger brother!",
