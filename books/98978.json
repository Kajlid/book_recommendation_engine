  "description": "Where are all the time travelers? After all, if it is possible to move between past and future, shouldn't someone from somewhen in all the infinite reaches of the future have visited by now? The good news is, there are answers to those questions. But then, there's the bad news....In the meantime, here are some other questions to ponder. What if a man could go forward in time to learn about the future—and then backwards in time to correct a dreadful mistake? But what if going back in time was, in and of itself, the most terrible mistake possible?Could a life's journey that started off bending—and breaking—a few real estate laws really wind up ending life as we know it? That would have to be impossible. Or would it?Previously published as \"Time Out,\" this mind-bending story will keep readers guessing until the final page.Includes the bonus story \"Grandpa?\"—one of Edward M. Lerner's most popular tales.",
