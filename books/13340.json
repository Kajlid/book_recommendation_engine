  "description": "THE UNABRIDGED JACK LONDON is a comprehensive collection of Jack London's sprawling, timeless fiction. Included here, in addition to his classic novels and short story collections, is a group of \"uncollected\" short stories, some of which have never appeared in book form. We have sought, wherever possible, to use only first editions of London's work - the only way, we feel, to convey the truly original spirit of London's boundless imagination, his insight into humankind's passion for adventure, and his gripping life view.Three novels...and 54 short stories, some of them never available in book form, that exemplify two sides of Jack London (1876-1916): the quiet, contemplative writer of San Francisco and the bruising, lusty adventurer of the Yukon and the Pacific. - THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEWCover Illustration: Gill Cohen",
