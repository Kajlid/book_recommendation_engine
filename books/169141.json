In fact, he wasn’t imaginary at all, even though he was the stuff of legends.” School is finally out for the summer, and Ryan is looking forward to long sunny days on the beach with his best friend Cory, and his old friend, Willie. What Ryan hadn’t anticipated was how difficult keeping Willie’s secret would be. Torn between doing what’s best for his old friend, and being honest with this friends and family, Ryan has to think fast. The world isn’t ready to know about Willie, but it might already be too late.",
