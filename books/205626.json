  "title": "Through the Psyche of Ambrosia: Part I",
  "description": "Raised by his Mothers on the principles of the Goddess, but not one to believe, Ambrosia longs for the day when he can free himself of faith completely. Rituals of invocation, tales of reincarnation, dimensional coalescence, spirits and the astral plane... he never felt or saw anything during these teachings, and certainly nothing that he would consider proof of the lore, which brought him to the logical conclusion that there is truly nothing else out there--merely works of fiction.Yet all things change when Mona, a family friend he's never met before, offers to grant his wish and take him far away from there. It's only after arriving in the strange new place and leaving his one true home behind, that he is made to open his eyes.Either magic exists and the myths are real, or he's lost his mind completely.It all starts with a girl and a dream...Though not prevalent throughout this series, it does contain some content of an adult nature. Recommended for mature audiences. This book starts on chapter three.",
