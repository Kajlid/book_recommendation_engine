Set free to fend for herself in the wilds along the Platte River, survival is as fragile as a feather. Daniel O’Rorke never expects to find a woman caught in his animal trap. To make matters worse, she’s with child. Daniel came this far west to avoid people and their problems. A pregnant woman with no memory is trouble aplenty, but now he owes her.
