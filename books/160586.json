Alone in the world with no one to care for him, experiencing unfair punishment, outright rejection and the desperate need to be loved, Odysseas is determined to seek the truth to the imbalances of life.Into adulthood he would continue his struggle. It is a difficult task to get to know yourself; it hides sorrows, it needs pure motives, flaming inclination but, above all, love for humans. This love alone can ignite your willpower. Without it, the end is far and it awaits you like the horizon gazes at the ships that approach it but never reach it.For Odysseas, only persistence and trust in oneself will allow him to find what he ultimately craves for.",
