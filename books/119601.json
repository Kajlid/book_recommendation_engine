  "description": "It’s not every day you find a body on your doorstep! When it happens to Jake and Emma Rand, they are happy to leave it to the police. When a body turns up at historic Fort Caspar, Emma decides it’s time to take matters into her own hands. What follows is a sometimes funny, sometimes frightening but always entertaining chase to catch a killer before the killer catches them. First book in the Casper Crime Boss trilogy. This is not a cliffhanger. The central mystery is completely resolved, but there may be some detective work still to be done. Formerly released as Too Cute to Kill.",
