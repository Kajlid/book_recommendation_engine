  "title": "It's Always Christmastime In Cratchitville",
  "description": "It's Christmastime in Pleasant Hollow, a faraway place with horse drawn sleighs and gingerbread cottages with snow covered roofs. The kids jokingly like to call it Cratchitville, well, because old man Cratchit owns half the town. Whatever you choose to call Pleasant Hollow, the kids have bigger concerns. Like why does it always seem to be Christmastime around here and why donâ€™t any of the adults know what goes on over the next hill? This lovely little holiday story with a dark secret will charm your heart and keep you guessing until the very last page is turned.",
