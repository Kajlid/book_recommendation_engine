  "title": "The Contented Life: Spirituality and the Gift of Years",
  "description": "As a new bishop, Robert Atwell responded to a direct challenge from older church members, who usually make up the biggest majority in any congregation. Why, they asked, was there always so much for the young; what was there for them? This book grew out of his response. A series of talks he gave on the spirituality of growing older and the gifts that wait to be discovered generated an unprecedented response, not only throughout the diocese, but on blogs and websites around the world. 60 really is the new 40 for increasing numbers of people. The retired are a huge consumer category, increasingly recognised by marketing gurus. They may have disposable income, time on their hands, and the leisure of choice - but wisdom, humour and honesty are essential for these transitional decades too and this short book offers all three in plenty. The author's background in Benedictine life, with its profound understanding of what makes for a balanced and rich life, flavours a book of timeless value",
