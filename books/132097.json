  "description": "After arriving in New Orleans-escaping from a tragic past-the virginal beauty falls victim to a series of strange, unearthly attacks. And for the first time in her life, she aches with sexual desire. Now Natalie is confused, frightened, out of control-desperately struggling to understand a world that is transforming around her. But soon she will be powerful and magnificent in ways she could never have imagined . . . Detective Rene Broussard knows the hot young woman in despair is trouble. But something about Natalie intrigues and intoxicates the ruggedly handsome Cajun policeman who has come to her rescue in her time of greatest need. And when he inexplicably wakes in bed beside her-both burning with a lust impossible to deny-he doesn't care that a dark and vengeful enemy has brought them to this moment. All that matters is the irresistible curve of her body, the heat of her passion . . . and the forbidden pleasures the night promises. With one sharp, sensuous, biting kiss, he will be hers for life . . . and beyond.",
