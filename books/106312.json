  "description": "Drama 8m, 3f (to play var.roles)/ Unit set. This exciting, highly theatrical docu-drama is about the growing white supremacist movement in America, those dedicated to violent revolution and the expulsion from \"God's Country\" of non Aryans. The play covers all of the right wing lunatic fringe while focusing on three narrative spines: the trial in Seattle of a paramilitary group which calls itself The Order; the career and death of Denver's Allan Berg, the outspoken, controversial, Jewish talk radio personality \"assassinated\" by The Order; and, finally, the hate filled career and death of The Order's founder, Robert Matthews. These narratives are skillfully interwoven, sometimes non chronologically, with statistics and facts into a kaleidoscopic and highly theatrical vision. \"Dietz intends his play to disturb playgoers, to prod them into thinking seriously about the radical right as a continuing phenomenon and not just as the occasional headline or TV sound bite. It surely does that.\" - Seattle Times \"Fast paced and emotionally gripping.\" - Variety",
