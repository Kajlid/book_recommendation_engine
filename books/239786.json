  "description": "Not everything someone sees is real. Now, both sides of the story are tested by those who hide their reasons.\n For some, the reasons are good, for others not so much. \nMolly, Oz, Joel, Sean, Jack and the others are back in Action, supporting the Etheric Federation to stop a planet from being destroyed. At the same time, Molly is working on a personal project to implement teaching at a higher level.\n But who knew that politics ran institutions of learning? \nJoin our team as they go undercover, cloaked, to help save ... a world.\n \n--- PLEASE NOTE ---\n \nInside this book is cursing, amusing cursing, but cursing nonetheless. If bad language offends you, perhaps this book is not for you.​\n \n​Set on the foundation laid by the Kurtherian Gambit Series, The Ascension Myth tells an entirely new story in the Age of Expansion--when the Etheric Empire is fast becoming the Etheric Federation with all of the trials and tribulations that come with bringing together different peoples, systems, and ideals.",
