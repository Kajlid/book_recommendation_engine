  "description": "BlankaThroughout my entire life I’ve made choice after choice to land me where I am today. Nothing is perfect, and the same views can be said about life.We all struggle and wish things could be different but it simply isn’t the case. If you want anything, whether it be as simple as happiness, you must work for it.At the end of the day, that’s what landed me in this job, doing the things I do, one day hopeful it will bring me a better life.I can only hope that day comes soon.DavideI’m the type of man who adores women. Any chance I get, I choose to revel in their flesh against mine. Although, I’m not the type of man to ever settle down - even if the Clan demands it of me.Never have I envisioned life with a woman by my side and a baby on her hip. It’s simply never been in the cards. I prefer to go to the brothels around Europe, enjoying the company of the most exquisite, prestigious women. They may not be from prominent families, but these aren’t whores you find on the street. They’re smart, witty and gorgeous.I’d been seeing another woman at this Venice brothel, however, she went and got pregnant . . . so I’m about to meet a new woman. One of the Madame’s favorite girls, one who she tells me will change my life.I suppose we’ll see if she does.",
