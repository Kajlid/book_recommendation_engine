  "description": "Some people face their problems head-on, other people run . . .\nWhen my ex-boyfriend sends me his wedding invitation eight months after breaking up with me, and the bride expects me to be in the wedding party, it's time for my tried-and-tested party trick: disappearing.And nowhere is better to escape to than the cozy English Cotswolds in the middle of December.Everything goes according to plan until I arrive in the Cotswolds. Snow is more slippery than I expected, my room is nothing like the listing described, and my pub owner landlordâ€”well, he steps directly from my lumberjack fantasies and into my heart.The only problem? I can't fall for an Englishman who lives on the other side of the world from me. Not even one who has Dr Pepper on tap and kisses like it's an Olympic sport. It's much harder to run across the pond, and all good things must come to an end . . . but what if I can't say goodbye?",
