  "description": "The network of the future is always on...until THEY cut you off. In a world where losing your connection to the worldwide social network means becoming a Nameless one, privileged elite Adrien Faulk will find out all too quickly just what it means to be cut off. Faulk's journey to find a lost pair of binoculars will lead him from the mean streets of near-future New York City to an ancient Mayan pyramid in Guatemala. He'll come face-to-face with a global mystery, a cybernetic assassin and a crazed, technological cult. Along the way he'll find a prophecy about mankind's destiny among the stars and answers to what it means to be an individual, a hero....and maybe, what it means to be human. But will he find out what he needs to know in time to save us all?",
