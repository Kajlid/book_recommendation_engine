  "description": "A brutal murder is ignored by both police and press. Reporter Susan Clarke searches for answers, with only fellow journalist Rachel Jack to help. Set in Liverpool in the build up to the city's reign as European Capital of Culture, Cast-Iron Men looks at the murky side of the city which local politicians and business leaders would rather stay hidden. Two local reporters, Susan Clarke and Rachel Jack, are thrown together as they investigate their own stories: one, concerning the brutal murder of a prostitute; the other, allegations of police corruption made by one of Liverpool's most notorious gangsters. Increasingly isolated, obstructed at every turn, and faced with danger, Susan and Rachel come to realise they can rely only on each other in their pursuit of the facts. The city of Liverpool itself emerges as a major character in this tough, tense and punchy thriller.",
