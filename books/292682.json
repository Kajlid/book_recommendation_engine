  "description": "Rafe Torrey is a widower with only two passions; the South Sixty Ranch and ensuring that his daughter Jenna doesn't marry the city boy with his Tesla stuck in the mud. Jenna thinks her dad is the one stuck in the mud since he refuses to date. When the South Sixty is in danger of encroachment by housing developers, Rafe must attend a Christmas party where he comes face to face with a scrooge in a tight dress. Sydney Barrett reeks of New York City, expensive cologne and too much holiday rum. If Rafe wants to save the South Sixty, he might have to swap her stilettos for spurs and knock a little dust off the bedpost in this hot but heartwarming Christmas romance. *This is a romance for those of us approaching or over the age of 50. \"Just because there's snow on the roof, doesn't mean there's no fire in the chimney.\" ~ Every grandparent, retiree, mature adult everywhere. All I Want is a Cowboy for Christmas (c) 2019 Elle Marlow Be sure to follow Elle Marlow on Amazon or her blog at www.ElleMarlow.blogspot.com for a peek at all of her titles.",
