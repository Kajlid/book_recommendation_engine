  "description": "All Variants live by one rule - you run, you hide…or you die.  Ever since the disappearance of her father, Paige Adler has been hiding in the system. She spends her days packing ration boxes, and her nights on the hunt, secretly seeking justice against those who prey on her people.  Just like her father once did.  One night, when tracking a killer, Paige stumbles upon something far bigger than her own personal vendetta…  In the shadows of the city, the Resistance still lingers, all but destroyed fifteen years before. Her father once fought for them, and it cost him his life. Now, they want Paige to join them too.  Drawn in by a handsome but mysterious Variant, Paige soon discovers that the enemy is building a secret weapon, one that could destroy not only the Resistance, but all Variants, once and for all.  In order to survive, they have to fight. And Paige, her powers, and her past, might just be the key to the future…  Variant is a thrilling new sci fi adventure from bestselling dystopian author T.C. Edge. Fans of Bella Forrest, Suzanne Collins, and Veronica Roth will not want to miss out.",
