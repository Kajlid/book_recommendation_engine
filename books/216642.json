  "description": "To learn about kink, she had to learn the ropes. Yet she never expected to be so compromised she'd need rescuing. And by him. The first man she'd ever loved. The former navy SEAL who'd broken her heart.Clara's gone wild. Naked. Cuffed. Caged. Is this the sweet senator's daughter I left behind? I didn't know it was her when I rushed into that room filled with flames, but I'll never let her go again. She's proposed a unique way to thank me. It could bring us both to the edge of ecstasyâ€”or to the point of no return. Clara wants to submit. To me. Totally. Damn any limits. The very thought of it has brought me back from the dead. But a stranger is watching from the shadows. He's made us his fantasy. And he plays rougher than I do. Where he's taking us now is somewhere so dark, and so dangerous, that this time it could be inescapable.",
