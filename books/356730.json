  "title": "Journeys Home: Stories from Grandmother's Lap",
  "description": "Journeys Home is a collection of essays written from the perspectives of Arkansas ground and sky. Nancy flies like a bird over her home state, landing here and there for storytelling. Once grounded, she reminisces out of her grey matter, piecing color, theme, insight, and flow into a story-quilt. She explores the territories of infancy, little-girlhood, and early adolescence going into and through her body and her being to recollect her fragmented self. Points-of-view-now and then-sandwich the stories ending on notes of renewal through reunion.",
