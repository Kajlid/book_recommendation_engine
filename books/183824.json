  "description": "Young women are vanishing from Miami’s club scene, most disappearing without a trace, others found suffocated in plastic bags, their battered corpses filled with a deadly cocktail of narcotics. There are no suspects and few clues. When exotic dancer Rayne is taken, her sister Blaze calls the ladies of Shadowlands to find her. With only five days before Rayne is found dead or never found at all, Smoak and Ash dive into Miami’s underworld of drugs, prostitution and slavery, using every skill they have to find her before the clock runs out. Alone? Afraid? Lost? In trouble and have nowhere to turn? Call Shadowlands. We’re here to help.",
