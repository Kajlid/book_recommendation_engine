  "description": "Lily likes being a witch. Sure, aside from floating pencils and telepathically communicating with her three best friends, there aren’t many real perks. Until it brings two of the hottest guys she’s ever seen into her life. Of course, there are always strings, and this one comes in the form of a prophecy foretelling her saving, and eventually ruling, a realm she’s never heard about in this lifetime. With dark fey suddenly hunting them down, Lily and her friends are forced to make a decision, complete the prophecy or turn their backs. If that isn’t enough stress, Lily also has a choice to make of her own. Trust in their brooding dark haired guide, Larkin? Or the golden dream stalker Ronan? One claims he’s her soul mate. Both want her back in a realm she can’t recall. What’s a girl to do?",
