  "description": "Long ago, poets were Seers with access to powerful magic. Following a cataclysmic battle, the enchantments of Eivar were lostâ€“now a song is only words and music, and no more. But when a dark power threatens the land, poets who thought only to gain fame for their songs face a task much greater: to restore the lost enchantments to the world. And the road to the Otherworld, where the enchantments reside, will imperil their lives and test the deepest desires of their hearts.",
