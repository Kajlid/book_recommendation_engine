  "description": "Everyone in the small town of Bridge Haven, Missouri, knows that the not-so-dearly-departed Edna Bixley was a witch. Except her niece, Phoebe Cabot, who has never paid the gossips any mind. Since she was just let go from her job (“fired” sounds so harsh), Phoebe has agreed to get Edna’s house ready to put on the market. When a sweet, little stray dog shows up, Phoebe has no idea that it’s actually a demon. Or that she’s the one who inadvertently caused its appearance.But Noah Rossi knows, and he’s determined to stop Phoebe’s meddling in matters she doesn’t understand. The trouble is, Phoebe can’t seem to stop summoning demons. What can one extremely sexy but slightly in-over-his-head wizard do to keep her from accidentally destroying the universe?",
