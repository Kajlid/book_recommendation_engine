  "title": "Swimming Home",
  "description": "Swimming Home is a subversive page-turner, a merciless gaze at the insidious harm that depression can have on apparently stable, well-adjusted people. Set in a summer villa, the story is tautly structured, taking place over a week in which a group of beautiful, flawed tourists in the French Riviera comes loose at the seams. Shortlisted for the 2012 Man Booker Prize.",
