  "title": "Sun On Fire",
  "description": "When the gutted body of a businessman is discovered in the Icelandic embassy in Berlin, Iceland's best detectives are sent to Germany to investigate the crime. The stab wounds and the murder weapon?an elegant hunting knife?suggest a ritualistic killing. But the only suspects present in the sleek modern office building were some of the island nation's cultural elite, including J?n the Sun Poet and ceramics artist L?dv?k Bjarnason. The victim is someone few would miss, and investigators Birkir and Gunnar, joined by forensics expert Anna Th?rdard?ttir, wager they have an open-and-shut case on their hands. What they find is anything but: The crime reeks of premeditation and vengeance, and leads the team into a sordid tale of international child abuse, arson, and retribution.",
