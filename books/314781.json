With a leap of faith, she travels to another world, one where she hopes to discover the secret of her birth.But before she can do that she must find and save Leonidas, the king of the fada on earth prime. Even though she can never be his queen. Because some things are beyond either of their control.Real or not, a dream they once shared was all they can ever have.",
