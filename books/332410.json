  "description": "Hot guy moves in next door. Best friend claims him. Whatever.Kate Parker is a planner. Crossing things off her list? A total high. When her BFF calls dibs on the gorgeous new neighbor, Kate immediately friend zones him. Girl code is clear: you don’t date the guy your best friend is interested in. Not a problem. Mr. Tall, Blond, and Stunning won’t tempt her away from her perfectly planned senior year—or the boy she’s been secretly crushing on, well, since kindergarten. Moving from New York City to Dryden Bay, California isn’t exactly the senior year Kai Evans has in mind—until he meets the girl next door with the unforgettable blue eyes. Kate has no trouble rejecting him. There isn’t anything he wouldn’t do to make her smile. But that smile isn’t meant for him, and her best friend keeps getting in the way. In the game of love and friendship, staking your claim was never more tricky. Dibs is the first book in the hilariously fun Dryden High Sweet Series by Randi Rigby.",
