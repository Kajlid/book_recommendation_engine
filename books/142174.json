When the baby sickens, he must find a woman to nurse the boy. Unfortunately, the only woman in the county with milk is Hattie Stoddard, the town slut.

When Jackson arrives she has nothing left but her shredded pride and the determination not to lose the land. When Jackson tells her she is going with him, she refuses. Finally they strike a bargain, he will pay the taxes and save the ranch if she will nurse and care for his son until J.D. is weaned. But a lot can happen in the milk-year.",
