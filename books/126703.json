  "description": "In this gripping debut collection, men search for themselves, for each other, for the sources of sanity and sickness, power and grief. These stories speak frankly about desire and how we are bound―literally and figuratively―to each other. Inviting the reader to participate in narrative games and investigations, Misadventure buzzes with brainy energy. Full of disorientation, urgency, gallows humor, and, ultimately, hope.",
