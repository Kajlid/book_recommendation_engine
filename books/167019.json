  "description": "The Guild of Navigators has ruled the Aion Sea for centuries, using their fleet of mystical ships to collect trade for the Aurelian Empire.  Now the Emperor is dead.  For Calder Marten, Captain of The Testament, the Emperor’s death is not an end, but an opportunity. He and his crew seek the legendary Heart of Nakothi, an artifact that could raise a second Emperor…and earn Calder a fortune.  But they’re not the only ones who want the Heart.  The Consultant’s Guild, an ancient order of spies and assassins, will stop at nothing to keep the world in chaos. They seek to destroy the Heart, and prevent the world from uniting under a single Emperor ever again.  On the seas, a man works to restore the dying Empire.  In the shadows, a woman seeks to destroy it.  Will you explore the seas here with Calder? Or will you walk the shadows with Shera, in the parallel novel \"Of Shadow and Sea\"?",
