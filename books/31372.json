  "description": "The water flows to Quan, a mage in search of the most important thing a mage can find; his protector and life partner. Quan knows his mate is out there somewhere, even though he's beginning to despair ever finding that elusive person after all of his years of needing. Young tribesman Jael is Quan's other half, but he doesn't know it yet. Where Flows the Water explores the relationship between these two very different men as they meet and begin to build something lasting and necessary, aided by physical closeness that scorches with its intensity. Jael resists Quan for as long as he can, wanting a normal life with a wife and children. He can only fight the winds so long, though, and eventually he comes accept that Quan may just be his life, and his love. When the two finally get it right, they connect, and it's them against the world, which sometimes seems determined to tear them apart. Set in a fantasy world as complex as it is interesting, Where Flows the Water showcases a place where magic is a part of the everyday world in hundreds of small ways, and where love knows few boundaries, if only the stubborn can see",
