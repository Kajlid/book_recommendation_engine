But one night wasn’t enough with Jackson Radcliffe and when we met again, under different circumstances, all of it a farce, I wished that our one night together never happened. One night turned into two and then three and before I knew it I was lost in him so deeply it was hard to breathe. How would I get through one more night, let alone a month without falling completely?JacksonOne night. The woman I saw on the dance floor, with fiery hair and emerald eyes enraptured me so much that I broke all of my rules. But, it was supposed to be one night of rule breaking which morphed into weeks of pretending. I tried to keep my walls up while Liza Deveroux broke them all down. How could one night make me wish to be a better man while my past rolled in and threatened to destroy everything I didn’t know I wanted or needed?",
