  "description": "Candy's a happy guy. He's the star dancer at an all-male strip club. He's got a unique act that makes the audience wild, with his tight red leather outfit and the way he spanks himself. The tips are going to let him retire early, in the style he wants to be accustomed to. Jim's a cop; he's a good cop, a good man. He just has this one little obsession: Candy Pants. Lucky for him, Candy's into him, too, and more than happy to have Jim help keep his ass nice and red for his act.As their relationship progresses, though, Jim's having trouble accepting that Candy's hanging it all out there for everyone to see, and when a rich admirer comes along, showering Candy with expensive gifts, it has Jim seeing red. Jim and Candy seem perfect for each other, but can they work past Candy's job and Jim's obsession and make a go of it?",
