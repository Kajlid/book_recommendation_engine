For hundreds of years, the Picts have fought with the Irish across the sea and in Dal Riata, the Irish colony on the western coast. But now the Picts face a new and barbarous enemy--the Vikings. To save their society, they arrange a political marriage between their best warrior, Drosten mac Gormach, and Mhoire ni Colman, a beautiful Irish princess who has inherited her mother's fort in Dal Riata. But Mhoire, skilled with bow and arrow like the Irish warrior-queens of old, is determined to live alone. In a magical land of tall, glistening waterfalls and mystical standing stones, their story, and their love, unfolds.",
