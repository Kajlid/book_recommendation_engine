  "title": "Hairdresser on Fire: A Novel",
  "description": "This is not a hair book. It's a dark comedy of a spiritual misfit, a child with a dream born into the wrong town. Religious cults, corporate cults, insane clientsâ€”Francis can't catch a break. Francis has observed his own inability to fit in since birth, and his decision to be a professional cosmetologist only exacerbates his innate oddness.Daniel LeVesque accepted his cosmically assigned career of cosmetologist after attending Beauty School. He no longer participates in the world of salons. His writing appears in Punk Globe and numerous anthologies. He currently resides in Oakland, California. This is his first book.Advance praise for Hairdresser on Fire:\"Down, dirty, funny, and glorious. Levesque has an authentic eye forthe cracks all around us, but never misses the light shining throughthem. His voice is true punk spirit.\" - Beth Lisick, NY Times Bestselling author of \"Everybody into the Pool\" and the forthcoming \"Yokohama Threeway\" (City Lights/Sister Spit 2103)\"Levesque's tale mixes truth and absurdity until you don't know which wild way is up. Beating at the core of this disturbing, hilarious story is a great big clown's heart, suffusing the novel with sensitive realness. I love this story and this author.\" - Michelle Tea, author of Valencia, publisher at City Lights/Sister Spit",
