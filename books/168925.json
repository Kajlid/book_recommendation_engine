  "description": "Payton Vaughn’s trip to Puerto Vallarta for her friend's wedding was her big escape from her ridiculously overbearing mother–oh, and that little matter with her cheating fiancé. Now, her flight's been cancelled, and she's crammed into a tiny car with the gorgeous-but-irritating best man. Viva la road trip from hell...Cruz Sorensen doesn't have time to babysit some spoiled socialite, even if she is the future daughter-in-law of the man who could change the fortune of his family's company. He has no business getting to know her better—not even for all the tequila in Mexico...until they wake up with grande-sized hangovers as man and wife. Now Payton and Cruz must decide if they've reached the end of their journey...or the beginning of a new adventure.",
