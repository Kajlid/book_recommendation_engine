  "title": "The Raven",
  "description": "No poem has ever received the kind of immediate and overwhelming response that Poe's \"The Raven\" did when it first appeared in the New York Evening Mirror on January 29, 1845. It made Poe an overnight sensation (though his great fame never brought him much wealth) and the poem, a powerfully haunting elegy to lost love, remains one of the most beloved and recognizable verses in the English language. Edgar Allan Poe’s celebrated narrative poem now available as an ebook, including an extended excerpt from Mrs. Poe by Lynn Cullen, a vivid and compelling novel about a poet who becomes entangled in an affair with Edgar Allan Poe—at the same time that she becomes the unwilling confidante of his much-younger wife.",
