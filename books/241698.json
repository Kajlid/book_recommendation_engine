  "description": "President Donald Trump has reshaped American politics, with views that are biased, misinformed and disheartening. When President Donald Trump began his term as our President, month after month and week after week, there is a scandal or inconsistency out of his administration. He came right out of the gate with fabrications and prejudice views of Democrats and Barack Obama. The President says he is not racist, however, refraining from standing up against white supremacy, and his anti-immigrant platform is proof he needs to change. We as Americans need more out of our President. It should not be Donald Trump way or the highway. Is This kind of erratic behavior from President Trump......THE NEW TRUMP ORDER, OUR of government?",
