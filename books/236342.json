This popular national speaker and bestselling writer delivershis prosperity principles in fifty-two true stories of successfulpeople he has encountered, including celebrities, Midas-touchentrepreneurs, shuttle-bus drivers, wide-eyed children, and evena stripper. Then, in his unique way, Cohen highlights the lessonwithin each parable and expands upon it, enabling readers toapply the principle to their own lives.

Relax into Wealth makes use of personal (and sometimes quiteintimate) tales to capture the reader’s attention and impart thewisdom found in the experience. Each of its fifty-two anecdotesends with a personal affirmation to help readers remember thelesson and carry it into real life.

The book is about real people—in whom readers canrecognize themselves—featuring moneymakers who have beentrue to their passion and successful in their chosen domain.Every reader will see his own financial hopes—and how toachieve them—in the lives of the various characters.",
