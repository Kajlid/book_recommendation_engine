  "title": "What Does It Mean to be Born Again?",
  "description": "Summary\nWhen Jesus explained the necessity of the new birth, the Jewish leader Nicodemus asked in astonishment, “How can these things be?” Some two thousand years later, much confusion still surrounds the term “born again,” though more people than ever claim to have had the experience.In this Crucial Questions booklet, Dr. R.C. Sproul cuts through the confusion and carefully explains what it means, biblically and theologically, to be born again. He affirms, first of all, that Jesus wasn't kidding—new birth is essential—then goes on to show what the new birth is and how it occurs. His clear teaching will provide understanding for those who are unfamiliar with the new birth and deeper assurance for those who may not know where they stand with God.\nChapters\n \n   Must I Be Born Again? \n   Regeneration Is a Mystery \n   Regeneration Is the Beginning \n   Regeneration Is a Sovereign Work of God \n   Regeneration Is Immediate \n   Regeneration Is Permanent \n \nResources\n \n   Part of the Crucial Questions booklet series",
