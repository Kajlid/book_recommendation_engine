  "description": "Gina Wynbrandt’s debut graphic novel is a refreshing and wry look at sexual frustration, shot through with American pop-culture erudition. \"It’s impossible not to fall in love with this hilarious minx as she lunges across the page, nostrils flared, hurling herself into increasingly ridiculous romantic misadventures. Bow down to Gina as she explores what it means to be horny as hell!\" — Lisa Hanawalt , production designer/producer of BoJack Horseman, author of My Dirty Dumb Eyes \" Someone Please Have Sex With Me plays with conventions of style and color, featuring pleasingly feminine sherbet-y tones juxtaposed against a storyline about a woman looking for love in all the wrong places—in all the wrong ways.\" — The LA Times \"Smart, wickedly funny, and transgressive. More comics like this, please!\" — John Porcellino , author of The Hospital Suite Someone Please Have Sex With Me is a refreshing and wry look at sexual frustration from our young heroine and author. From failed erotic photoshoots and late-onset teen popstar obsessions to fairy Kardashians and Pokémon-inspired future-sex, Wynbrandt isn't one to hold back. SPHSWM finds its footing at the surreal and hilarious juncture between autobiography and fantasy. Gina Wynbrandt (b. 1990) writes comics about personal humiliations and insecurities, as well as topics like fashion, pop culture, and celebrities. A portion of Gina's work will also appear in Best American Comics 2015 .",
