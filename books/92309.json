  "description": "It all started with a Girls Getaway Weekend in Sedona, Arizona… It’s been a year since Jennifer Ellis’s ex-husband left her for a much younger woman and Jennifer still hasn’t dated. Now turning 40, Jennifer wonders if she’ll ever find love again. So Jennifer’s best-friend, Melanie Malone, books them on a Girl’s Getaway in picturesque Sedona, Arizona in hopes of inspiring Jennifer to have a vacation fling. Jennifer gets more than she bargained for when she meets the ruggedly handsome 29-year old tour Jeep guide, Cody Miller, and the two begin a passionate romance. What Jennifer doesn’t know is that Cody has a secret past that not only threatens to destroy their new love but also expose a tragic event from Jennifer’s past that she has tried desperately to forget.",
