The only time I ever saw King was in the dream where forced a kiss on me, sending me into labor. Yes, I learned I was strong enough to love Ryder, but with a new stranger in the woods, will he be strong enough to love me? Author, India R. Adams, blurs the lines between \"good\" and \"evil, between \"black\" and \"white\", and shows us the beautiful spectrum on the gray tones. She will make you fall for those darker shades of gray, as well as the lighter ones. She shows us the importance of the balance, and of nature. She shows us the complexity of \"human\" nature and humans in general... and well elves too. She shows us that every action has immeasurable consequences, and that sometimes certain outcomes are unavoidable. The spiritual undertone in this book is beautiful. —Blogger, The Reading Cat",
