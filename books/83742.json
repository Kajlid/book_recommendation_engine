  "description": "There’s always been something alluring about cars, and certain makes in particular. And while sex in a “bug” might not be easy, it’s often popular with those who happen to own one. P.M. White's latest novella Volksie explores the love of all things “bug” in sultry, vivid detail. This erotic tale of romance and the open road delves into the relationships of families, car enthusiasts, and those living on the deviant edge of societal norms.Volksie wants only to escape from the shadow of her gangster brother, Totti, who would do anything for his beautiful but free-spirited sister. Down-on-his-luck car thief Alston Bennington wants only to be with Volksie and can think of little else, to the despair of his sister, Samantha, a sexual freak and the backbone of the Bennington family.When Volksie goes on the run with Alston, Totti resolves to do whatever it takes to bring her back. A madcap race and chase across the US brings the characters together in a surprising – and sexy – conclusion.",
