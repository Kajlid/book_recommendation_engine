  "description": "1979. When Peter Somers fell in love with a girl named moonshadow on the Berkeley pier, little did he know that she was a member of a group of wannabe revolutionaries. After an undercover cop is killed and another friend is falsely charged with the murder, the cell disappears.2007. Somers ends up back in Berkeley after receiving a letter describing the arrest of his friend on murder charges. He joins forces with a lawyer and others in an attempt to clear his friend's name. The authorities have something else in mind. There's a place where love and mistrust are never at peace; where duplicity and deceit are the universal currency. The Co-Conspirator's Tale takes place within this nebulous firmament. There are crimes committed by the police in the name of the law. Excess in the name of revolution. The combination leaves death in its wake and the survivors struggling to find justice in a San Francisco Bay Area noir by the author of the underground classic The Way the Wind Blew:A History of the Weather Underground and the novel Short Order Frame Up.",
