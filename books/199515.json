  "description": "Robbie is a person like you and me, except that he murders bad mannered people.  He had always gone through life trying to do the right thing, respecting his elders and watching his manners. Then one day, a chance encounter made him snap. He developed an alter ego that unbeknownst to him, wreaked revenge on anyone crossing his path that had been disrespectful, ill-mannered or just plain rude.  Up and coming Detective Lentus has his world changed forever by the first of these vicious murders, and devotes his life to hunting down and bringing the mysterious killer to justice; whilst being haunted by the â€˜ghost' of his murdered sister. The paths of the characters intertwine throughout London, sometimes knowingly, and sometimes not; ending in a breath taking conclusion.  This is the first of a trilogy that will span the years 1996 to 2015, and it rampages its visceral course through the history, music, culture, sexual exploits and technological advances of the time.  Written in shockingly graphic detail, with dark humour and an adult erotic tinge; this series of books is for the open minded lovers of horror fiction, crime fiction and thrillers.",
