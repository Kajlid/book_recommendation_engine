  "description": "A case of mistaken identity takes Lark Sedassa from her family's estate and into the power of Kadar Arkalis, the ruler of North Eredor, who thinks he's captured a much greater prize. Although he soon realizes his error, he makes Lark his bride anyway, still hoping to capitalize on her family's connections. Escape is nearly impossible, and before long Lark is not sure whether she even wants to leave. As she struggles with her growing feelings for her captor, she must find the strength within herself to draw on powers she doesn't even realize she possesses. Without those powers, she cannot hope to face the evil rising within the kingdom...or save the man she now calls husband.",
