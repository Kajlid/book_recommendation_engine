  "description": "Faith Fairchild has a plan. Now, all she needs is the man. Hunter Vaughn was voted sexiest man alive four years running. He is mouthwatering in every way imaginable. A football legend – he’s about to be entered into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. My job is to keep him happy no matter what. He has charm, class, money, and experience… Everything I want in the man I’m going to convince to take my virginity. Faith Fairchild is my new assistant – half my age, with no concept of just how sexy she is. I would love nothing more than to bend her over my desk and show her who’s boss, but my golden rule is – don’t sleep with virgins. I want no strings sex with a woman who knows what she’s doing. Just because I don’t plan to score, doesn’t mean I can’t play the game… right? When challenged to a little bump-and-run, can the innocent virgin really play the ultimate player? FUMBLE is a sexy, lighthearted romance.STANDALONE",
