  "description": "Todd Benson almost died for the freedom to love Adam Soames. Now they face obstacles that once again place both of them in danger.Todd Benson had figured he’d be alone forever. He had the best friend any guy could want in Gabe Staley, and Gabe’s partner Mika was okay, too. But a personal life and any kind of true happiness was out of the question. With Todd’s bigoted and violent parents, and the Sheriff he worked for trying to torture animals and Gabe, Todd knew he’d do well just to survive his job as a deputy in the small town of Shasta, Texas.Adam Soames needed to get away from the big city. His best friend had found his perfect man and moved away, and Adam felt lost in the city. The opportunity to have his own veterinary practice in a small town sounded perfect. He didn’t know he’d soon be living a life he’d only dreamed of—or the cost he and the man he loved would have to pay.Together Todd and Adam face seemingly insurmountable odds, from Todd’s recovery from a vicious attack to the prejudices and trials many couples have. Then there’s the big shocker of finding out Gabe and Mika aren’t humans, exactly, but wolf shifters instead, and a whole new door is opened and trouble soon comes barrelling through it. Reader Advisory: This book is best read in sequence as part of a series and there is reference to past sexual assault and violence in this book.",
