  "description": "Over thirty years, in the course of conversations that take place across Europe, a man named Jacques Austerlitz tells a nameless companion of his ongoing struggle with the riddle of his identity. A small child when he immigrates alone to England in the summer of 1939, Austerlitz is told nothing of his real family by the Welsh couple who raise him, and he strains to orient himself in a world whose natural reference points have been obliterated. When he is a much older man, fleeting childhood memories return to him, and he obeys an instinct he only dimly understands and follows their trail back to the vanished world he left behind a half century before, the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe. With this work of devastating beauty and pathos, W. G. Sebald has found a way to give form and substance to the previously unimaginable. Austerlitz is the most magnificent expression to date of an uncanny literary vision whose newness seems less like an invention than like the miraculous return of a forgotten sense.
