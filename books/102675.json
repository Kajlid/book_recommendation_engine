  "description": "Victor Torino gazed at Adriane Rosenberg, inquisitively. \"Don’t you ever wonder if we know the whole story between my dad and your mom?\" he asked as they packed up her late father's house. Charlie “Gus” Rosenberg, Adriane’s father, was a top Chicago mobster and the only survivor of a turbulent love triangle that shook the very foundations of the Mafia’s Las Vegas Empire. Much to their surprise, among her father’s belongings Victor and Adriane discover her mother’s carefully preserved diary dating from the late 1970s and purposely left behind by her father for her to find. Thus begins a harrowing and heartwarming tale of undying love and devotion between Victor’s father, Tony Torino, the Mob Boss and King of Las Vegas and Evelyn Rosenberg, Gus’s wife, a hustler and onetime showgirl. Through the vivid and brilliant use of flashbacks, juxtaposed with current events, we witness Tony and Evelyn’s insatiable love pitted against the violent and unforgiving life and law of the Mafia. As Victor, a forest ranger who wants nothing to do with the Mafia and Adriane, an attorney being pressured to work for the Mafia, read through the diary, old hatreds and new alliances rise leaving us to wonder if history will repeat itself.",
