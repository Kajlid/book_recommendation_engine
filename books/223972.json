  "description": "Librarian Note: This is an older, out-of-print version of ASIN B01N7HV5A1 HE MEANT TO BREAK MY BODY. INSTEAD, HE BROKE MY HEART.   I knew from the moment I walked in that this place was not meant for me. I was clean; this place was filthy. I was fair; this place was dark. But maybe I was sick of living a safe life. Maybe I was sick of every little thing fitting together just so.  I was sick of being perfect and whole.  I wanted to be broken.  In this dark and pungent hell, I found the man to do the job. He took me into his arms and broke me – Over, and over, and over again.  When it was finished, I picked up the pieces of myself that remained, and I left. But things never end that easily. I didn’t know it then, but when I ran, I took something with me. Something I never wanted… Something I never asked for…  The baby of the man who’d owned me.  Now, my unborn child and I are helpless pawns in some sick and twisted game. People are being hurt, killed. I can’t stand to watch anymore.  All I can do is cry, and plead, and beg. All I can say are three little words:  Please, for the love of God… “Break me, Daddy.”   BREAK ME, DADDY is a full-length, standalone romance novel with steamy hot sex, strong language, a happily ever after ending, and NO CLIFFHANGERS. Contains dark and disturbing themes, and over-the-top sexiness that may be uncomfortable for some readers.  Perfect for fans of Alexa Riley, Chiah Wilder, L Wilder, Sabrina Paige, Lauren Landish, Vanessa Waltz, Jordan Marie, and Nicole Snow.  Contains a free bonus novel, HEARTS ON ICE by Heather West, plus a sneak peek at another bestselling romance, OVERDOSED by Zoey Parker.",
