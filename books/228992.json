  "description": "Good evening, and welcome to the Wayward Orphans Theatre. I am Maestro Von Haughty. Tonight I am proud to present three tales of terror and misfortune...A laugh-out-loud theatrical production thatputs Broadway to shame!Maestro Von Haughty directs a theater company that performs gloomy works of tragedy-or they're supposed to. Unfortunately for the Maestro, his actors are a group of ragtag orphans that would much rather be in a happy play with butterflies and kittens (and perhaps a fairy as well).When the spirited orphans take over the stage, the worst kind of mayhem ensues, and even the stern Maestro can't stop them from turning his dark and dreadful masterpiece into a hilarious romp in the Wild West!",
