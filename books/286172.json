RJ.The stars of Pluto Entertainment, kings of the music industry.Except they’re no ordinary pop stars.Their path to fame wasn’t pretty, and I’ve made it my mission to expose the skeletons in their closet.From the moment they lay their eyes on me, they know I don’t belong at Idol High School, where students are competing for fame and success in front of a hungry audience.In fact, they hate me for it.As my new teachers, they’re willing to do anything to make my life a living hell.But what they don’t know is that I’m nineteen, not seventeen.I have a fake name, complete with a fake ID and fake papers.Why?Because I need to blend in with the other students—girls aren’t allowed here.",
