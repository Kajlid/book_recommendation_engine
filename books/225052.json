  "description": "Bram Stoker Award ® Nominated AuthorOnly a rag-tag team of gargoyles stands between humanity and extinction.Hell has released its ravening horde of demons, leaving most of humanity a puke-spewing, head-spinning mess of possession.Humanity’s last hope? A team of misfit gargoyles—including a cigar chomping, hard-ass grotesque—come alive and ready for battle during the End of Days. They guard the last cathedral-turned-sanctuary atop a bald knoll in the North Carolina mountains.Gargoyle protection grudgingly extends to any human who can make it inside the Sanctuary, but the power of the stonecutter blood magic, which protects the sanctuary, may not be enough when a rogue grotesque and his badly-wounded ward arrive.All the hounds of hell are on their heels. The last Sanctuary is about to fall.",
