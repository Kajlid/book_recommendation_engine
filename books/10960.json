She wants to tell him where he can go, but her fledgling company desperately needs the cash flow. She once broke her own rules, only to watch his sexy self run for the door. Providing round-the-clock protection for him is out of the question . . . right?Nick needs Daisy around to keep the hired thugs who are out for his blood from actually getting it. If he can make amends for the way he screwed up nine years ago in the process, then so much the better. Except time has done nothing to dull the memory of how Daisy once rocked his world off its axis, and her cocky attitude and mouthwatering curves still have the power to turn his brain to mush.Now two people who once were friends and used to be lovers will discover whether love and trust can come from a passion that breaks every rule.",
