Ezra Boden, known as Butcher Boden to the criminals he's brought to justice, forged a name for himself as a bounty hunter to outrun a painful past. Now all he wants is peace and quiet. That is until he catches sight of Willow, a woman whose eyes told him she's also lived a life of pain. He's bent on showing her that he's one of the good guys. Men can't be trusted... Willow Donovan learned that lesson at a young age, and she isn't about to forget it, not even for a man who saved her from a hanging.
