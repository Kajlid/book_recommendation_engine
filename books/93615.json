  "description": "Darius Rourke has long desired the beautiful and mysterious Marianne, seizing the opportunity to claim her when her family falls on hard times. Darius intuitively understands Marianne's need for direction and is willing to do anything to be the one to give it to her. What he doesn't know is that submission is security for Marianne, helping her to cope with a sin from her past. The wedding night confirms his virgin bride is the passionate woman Darius always dreamed she would be, but the more entangled they become, the harder it is for Darius to play the role of 'master,' for ultimately it will never give him that which he wants most of allâ€”Marianne's love. A confrontation is due for Darius and Marianne who must both face the fears and painful secrets threatening to destroy their fragile love, their future together, and the perfect passion they both crave.",
