  "description": "Because Gabrielle, the daughter of a miller, is lovely to behold, she is given only a cat as her inheritance, and is told to marry. Immediately.When her cat reveals he can talk and insists he is magical, he invites Gabrielle to join him in a life of adventure in exchange for a pair of boots. She agrees. Puss soon has her facing bandits, rescuing the sharp-mouthed Prince Steffen, and fighting malicious creatures that encroach upon her country’s lands. While Gabrielle and Prince Steffen strike an unlikely friendship, Puss tells everyone they come across that Gabrielle is the long lost Marquise of Carabas—a dangerous claim as Carabas is guarded by a shape-shifting ogre that has defeated armies, killed mages, and quashed a number of heroes. Gabrielle might not have so easily agreed to Puss’s offer of partnership if she knew the cat’s true ambition: to take out the ogre.",
