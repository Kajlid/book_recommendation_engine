  "title": "Josephine's 'Magination",
  "description": "Josephine, a Haitian child, walks the dusty road to market each week with her mother, who makes and sells brooms to support them. One day, Josephine bumps into an old peddler with toy animals woven from straw dangling from his huge brimmed hat. He gives her a tiny straw pig andtells her to use her imagination to discover new delights in life. Following his advice, Josephine surprises herself and her mother with an intriguing new twist to the brooms and greater success in the market place. The illustrations are clear, some in vibrant colors, and reflect the hot sun, showy flowers, and blue sea of tropical Haiti. The simple story sustains the mood well, and the characters are vividly portrayed.",
