  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for B01N2SHGJ6 From Virginia's most famous university to the Scottish highlands to a dusty road in Iraq, not even Shakespeare could have predicted the secret that will keep you up tonight. When Brodie Macbeth meets Joe Birnam, he hardly seems like the man of her dreams.   Brodie is a University of Virginia professor and best-selling author; Joe is a Marine veteran who lost a leg in Iraq. Brodie's last boyfriend was a famous television commentator; Joe is a carpenter who doesn't even own a suit.   Differences aside, the timing couldn't be worse. Brodie is shattered by her father's suicide and the strange will that requires her to read his collection of British history books and use the license plates from his car before she can inherit a fortune.  No doubt that's why she's having terrifying nightmares. Every night in her sleep, a stalker with corroded eyes will kill her unless Brodie reveals her father's secret.  Of course, there is no secret . . .  Falling in love with Joe Birnam helps Brodie to heal. Slow to spark, the attraction between them becomes more than just a steamy romance. Joe is a strong man who understands the pain of losing someone important. Although his memories of combat mean Joe has his own demons to deal with, he won't accept anything less than Brodie's full commitment.  But once she gives her heart, Brodie discovers the stunning truth about her nightmares.  They're a real and deadly game. The prize is Joe Birnam's immortal soul.  But Brodie doesn't know how to play, let alone win . . .  Would you?",
