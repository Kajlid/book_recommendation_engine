  "description": "Quinton Jackson is bullied and teased relentlessly at school. At least today, his fifteenth birthday, is starting out on the right foot. His mom gives him a cool new digital camera and he gets a date with Ashley Foster, the most popular girl in school. See? It's all good! Once he gets home, however, Ashley cancels the date, he finds out his parents are getting a divorce, and his grandfather is sick in the hospital. Okay, maybe not all good. But when he decides to take a picture of himself with his new camera, his world changes-literally. Magically transported to the mysterious land of Ohanzee, he is quickly rescued and befriended by Esse Jenna, a member of the Divine Sisterhood Bloodline and future Dream Deity. Quinton has to get up to speed on the new world he is in-and quick-because there is a lot of evil happening and most of it is perpetrated by Boa-Bogg, the Soulless Viper. Embarking on a series of perilous adventures, our heroes learn to find the courage they didn't know they had and become the leaders the people of Ohanzee need. Dramatic, funny, and lighthearted, Dorsey delivers a phantasmagorical tale that pushes the limits of the imagination as it portrays the importance of building self-confidence and the role that camaraderie and friendship play in that. Never preachy and always kindhearted, Esse Jenna and the Soulless Viper is an exciting adventure to a far away land where a little bit of magic and the power inside us all can change the world.",
