  "description": "THE BEST ADVICE FOR THE MOTHER OF THE GROOM?KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND WEAR BEIGE!Darcy Van Aiken is doing just fine, thank you. She's an ICU nurse with an \"amicable\"divorce from her ex-husband, Mike, two great kids, and a prescription for Ritalin. Then her older son, Jeremy, gets engaged to Cami Zander-Brown -- the daughter of a wealthy New York family -- and her world gets turned upside down. The source of her trouble, much to Darcy's surprise, is not in the form of Rose Zander-Brown, Cami's elegant and accomplished mother. Nor is it in the form of Guy Zander-Brown, Cami's charismatic and wildly successful literary-agent father. Instead, lurking in the shadows of Mike's new life is the beautifully dressed Claudia, a self-described \"managed perfectionist.\"The Zander-Browns have money. Lots of money. The plans for their daughter's dream wedding grow more fabulous by the day, and loving every minute is Claudia. With her perfect taste, Claudia can't help thinking she would make a much better mother of the groom than Darcy. This wedding is her chance to entrench herself in Mike's life -- and take credit for the two sons Darcy has worked so hard to raise right.It's a battle of wills and wits. What Darcy learns about herself -- and about family and friendship --makes for a delicious, hilarious, touching read.",
