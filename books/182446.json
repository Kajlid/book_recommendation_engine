  "title": "The Wolves of Paris",
  "description": "Count Raoul de Villeneuve was only moderately fond of hunting so he maintained no more than six hundred dogs of various breeds in his castle. One of them, a huge Alaunt, mated with a wolf captured and kept by the count for the urine used as a bait to trap other wolves. Only one of their pups survives and grows into a wolf-dog demonstrating the characteristics of each parent ― huge and fearsome and capable of anything. When the castle is attacked and looted by roaming écorcheurs and the count murdered, the young wolf-dog escapes into the ravaged countryside where he joins a wolf pack and becomes a daunting and unflinching leader. Driven by starvation and tempted by human corpses in the war torn villages, the wolf-dog becomes a man-eater. Later, forced to roam through district after district locked in the jaws of a brutal winter, the now legendary Courtaud breaches the walls of Paris and leads his pack into the city. Just when it seems as if the ravenous wolves will scour the city unchecked, they are faced with a courageous opponent who vows to end the lives of the wolves or lose his own. Based on records of a wolf pack that killed forty people in Paris in the mid-15th century and set against the backdrop of a warring medieval society, The Wolves of Paris explores the circumstances under which man-eating animals evolve.'",
