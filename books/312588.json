Wait, what?Agent Lee Marshall is notoriously all work and no play. Letting a flirty, hot-as-sin playboy like Kamran wind him up is not an option. He has to protect him, not hook up with him. But pretending they’re an item for a week? That couldn’t hurt…Kamran swore he’d never love again, but Lee will do anything to keep him out of harm’s way. Maybe there’s a teddy bear heart under the hunky FBI agent’s gruff exterior, and Kamran is the only one who can tease it out. What started out fake becomes all too real, but when Kamran’s past catches up to him, Lee must risk everything to save him.Book Six of Pine Cove.
