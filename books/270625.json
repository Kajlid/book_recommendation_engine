  "description": "Harper Miller doesn’t want to handle what has happened to her over the past year. Her father left, her mother killed herself, and she still has to be the good girl, the one that doesn’t make waves, who is always nice. But one day, something changes. No, it’s not something. It’s them. Draven, Axel, Jett, and Buck. All of them are dangerous, scary, and most people avoid them at all costs. She knows they’re bad news, but Draven’s not willing to take no for an answer, not from her. For Draven, he and his friends had this idea of finding the one girl that would complete their circle. One girl for all of them. Harper is that one girl, but first she has to go through their initiation to become one of them, to be able to bear their names, and to stand proudly. All they ask is she remain loyal to them and them alone. No squealing to the cops. No backing down. And above all else, no running away. All she has to do is give herself, mind, heart, and body. She can keep her soul. It’s dark anyway, just like theirs.",
