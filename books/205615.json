All she knows is that the angel’s fall will bring glory to Hell and acclaim to any succubus who accomplishes it.Of course, it never occurs to Lorelei that Azaziel might try to tame her by possessing her with a mortal girl’s soul.Can the succubus find an exorcist before the fury of Hell is unleashed?",
