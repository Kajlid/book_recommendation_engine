  "description": "A powerful adversary is surfacing and Null’s covert battle is on the threshold of open war. Reunited with his father after twenty-two years, Kael must find the balance between protecting him and confronting the enemy who stands between them and their home world. The timelessness of the In-Between has stolen the years that separated Kael and Adair by age, leaving them as distant equals. Having glimpsed Kael’s destiny from the Eternal Realm, Adair struggles to find his role in the life of a son who no longer needs him. Through a global maze of counterintelligence and espionage, a multinational team of operatives has to survive long enough to turn the tide of war. And a father and son will discover how to rebuild what was taken from their lives. In book five of the bestselling Awakened series, Jason Tesar’s epic saga escapes the islands of Scandinavia for the dark forests and rugged mountains of Russia in a tense conflict of subterfuge that blurs the boundaries between sci-fantasy and military fiction.",
