A century later, Caroline is living a new life yet the memory has never lessened its hold on herâ€”tormenting her with mere glimpses as her body continually cries out for him in her dreams.  On the brink of madness, torn between the past and the present, Caroline is the only one that can decide her fate. When she returns to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains the lines between time and space come full circle. Will she find the courage to face the passion and pain that awaits her?
