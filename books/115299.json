  "description": "Lauren has come to the conclusion her 25 year marriage is over, she is no longer prepared to put up with her husbands violence and aggression toward her and would much prefer to face life alone but a chance encounter with the gorgeous serial shagger Gabriel Wilde on a girls night out sends her life in a completely different direction to the one she thought lay ahead. A life she never thought possible, a love she never dreamed she could feel and the kind of sex she had only ever read about in erotic novels, but would all of this be enough? Would the past be to much for her to overcome, would she ever feel worthy or would all of her past issues and self doubt send Gabe running for the hills. Was he man enough to be her saviour",
