  "description": "A swoon-worthy, second chance holiday romance from USA Today Bestselling Author J.H. Croix!  Dani Love is the girl who got away. Actually, she dumped me.  Not exactly a stroke to my ego.  When I move back home, Dani is just as much everything as she was before. Maybe even more. Snappy and smart with an attitude for days. I want her, even if it’s stupid.  Dani can’t decide if it’s better to ignore me, or fight with me. I’ll fight and win. She just doesn’t see it coming yet.  ***  Wade Ellis is back. In my small town. I had it all figured out. Leave my past with Wade exactly where it belonged. The past stays in the past.  But Wade isn’t getting my memo. He’s ignoring every excuse I make.  His kisses are enough to literally set me on fire. Just when my defenses are burned to ash, I fess up to why I dumped him in the first place.  That should send him running. But no. Wade stole my heart once before, and now he seems determined to prove he’s keeping it.  *This is a full-length standalone romance.",
