  "description": "In this YA contemporary novel from bestselling author Nancy Rue, the issues of abuse and its emotional effects are explored as Bryn O’Connor struggles to find her voice while many of her one-time friends doubt she’s telling the truth and her ex-boyfriend won’t let go of their past. Bryn has learned to keep her mouth shut. But when a trip to the hospital following a car accident reveals bruises and injuries inflicted by her boyfriend days and months before, her biggest secret is unwillingly unleashed. And though a restraining order is meant to keep her safe from Preston, it seems nothing can protect her from her supposed friends, who refuse to believe Preston is capable of such violence and look to punish her for what happened to him. Making Bryn wonder if finally telling the truth only made things worse. The stress and loneliness leaves Bryn feeling crazy—especially when it seems like the leather book she picked up at the hospital is reading her thoughts. It doesn’t help that her visiting grandma, Mim, is convinced surfing lessons and homemade Mexican food will somehow help Bryn regain control and focus away from the bullying messages pinging her phone. Though when Preston breaks the restraining order yet again, and a trial date looms, it’s clear the only way out of the tsunami that is her life is to charge in and take control of the waves around her.
