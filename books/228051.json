Now, she wants to become a man and is going to leave.He prays for divine intervention, and says he'll do anything, just please don't separate him from Elaine...and gets it.Now, he's in Elaine's body. And she's in his. They'll get a second chance at love.Why? Because once you find your soulmate, the universe will do almost anything to keep you together—even change your faces.",
