  "title": "Beauty Mark: A Verse Novel of Marilyn Monroe",
  "description": "In a novel in verse, an award-winning author offers an eye-opening look at the life of Marilyn Monroe.From the day she was born into a troubled home to her reigning days as a Hollywood icon, Marilyn Monroe (n√©e Norma Jeane Mortenson) lived a life that was often defined by others. Revisiting Marilyn's often traumatic early life--foster homes, loneliness, sexual abuse, teen marriage--through a hard-won, meteoric rise to stardom that brought with it exploitation, pill dependency, and depression, the narrative continues through Marilyn's famous performance at JFK's birthday party, three months before her death.",
