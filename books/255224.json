  "description": "Homicide Detective Amy Sadler is overjoyed: her wife, forensic pathologist Lira Ward, is pregnant with their first child. Life couldn't be better, although Amy soon finds that impending motherhood has made her a little more sensitive to cases involving children, such as the small girl found at the bottom of a pool. An investigation into the child's family and possibly not-so-accidental death leads Amy into the twisted world of an isolated country church with extreme ideas, a world of child abuse and subjugated women. Amy's gut tells her there are sinister things happening beneath the church's picture-perfect public image, but proving it is another matter. Then a man shows up claiming to be Lira's father, and everything Lira thought she knew about herself is turned on its head. Now as Amy struggles to prove her suspicions about the cult-like church before more children are hurt, she must also find a way to protect Lira from her own past.",
