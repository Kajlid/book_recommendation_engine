  "description": "Meet Dr. Ivan Rusilko: He’s a doctor at a world-class medical facility in Miami, he’s got a killer apartment on Miami Beach that overlooks Biscayne Bay and the Miami skyline, and he’s got a great group of friends and quite the social schedule. It’s a pretty damned charmed life, but something’s missing. He’d love a special someone to share it with—someone to laugh with, share his dreams with, and someone to just plain tickle his fancy. After a string of utterly forgettable blind dates and with no real prospects on the horizon, it’s time to take action. On the long drive from Miami Beach to Sarasota, Florida, for the annual Winemaker’s Dinner, Ivan makes a decision. He’s taking charge of his love life—and his fate. RSVP is a short-story prequel to the highly anticipated erotic romance The Winemaker’s Dinner: Appetizers by co-authors Dr. Ivan Rusilko and Everly Drummond. RSVP is an introduction to the romantic hero and real-life author Dr. Ivan Rusilko, and it marks the good doctor’s solo writing debut. \"Love is Beautiful\" ~ Dr. IvanThe Winemaker’s Dinner: Appetizers will be released July 31, 2012.",
