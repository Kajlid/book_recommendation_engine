  "description": "When a patient suffering from Alzheimer's escapes from a low-end nursing home, she is overwhelmed and confused by the stark world she encounters. Everything she sees and hears reminds her of an event from the past, but further confuses her understanding of the present. As night sets in, she becomes increasingly disoriented and afraid. The overworked staff of the facility she left and her family must overcome their own dysfunction to find her before it's too late.",
