  "title": "The Butterfly Route",
  "description": "This is the story of one woman's adventures while traveling by motorcycle from South Dakota to South America by motorcycle. After having had enough of the empty promises of her long-term employer, Michelle decided to make a fresh start, but first wanted to take some time to travel. Partly inspired by a handsome Englishman, she deconstructed her life - sold her home, put her belongings in storage and left a twenty-year career as an executive (and its six-figure-a-year salary) to live life on the road, packing just the basics on her motorcycle. What started out as an extended vacation and break between careers, turned into a two-year journey including random experiences, new friendships, rugged mountain roads to Andean villages, two broken bones, countless accidents (happy and otherwise), and a marriage proposal.",
