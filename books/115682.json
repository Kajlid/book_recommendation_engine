  "description": "For Sam Ryan, life began at the age of fourteen. She has no memory of her parents or her past. For the ten years that Sam's been with the State Police, she's searched for clues to her identity. But it's as if all mention of her family has been deliberately wiped off the system. Everything changes the night she agrees to meet her missing partner, Jack, and barely survives his attempt to kill her. Charged with his murder, Sam finds herself accepting help from Gabriel Stern-a shapeshifter with secrets of his own. As Sam delves into her partner's death, it soon becomes clear that the key to surviving the present lies in unravelling the threads of her past-and discovering not just who she is, but what she is . . .",
