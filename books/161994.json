  "description": "Zavis DaMavis is a happy young boy and a proud resident of a whimsical town called Tweeville. He’s off to school one morning when his mom—a very wise woman—gives him an important reminder. But what does it mean to treat others the way you’d like to be treated? While Zavis ponders his mother’s advice as he walks to school, he’s distracted by an elderly man who needs a hand getting across the street. When he’s done helping, he finds that he’s forgotten what she said. Zavis must remember his mother’s words if he’s ever going to understand what they mean. But how can he think when he’s so busy being kind to his friends? Teaching our children the golden rule is one of the most important and effective ways to empower kids to make kind, helpful decisions. In the spirit of Dr. Seuss, author certified counselor Shirin Zarqa-Lederman uses brightly colored images and simple, silly prose to challenge young readers while engaging them on the topic of morality. Inspire your children to treat others as they’d like to be treated with this fun, easy-to-read installment of The Trotters of Tweeville.",
