  "description": "\"If I'm going to be a prostitute, I refuse to be an ordinary one.\"Known to her clients as \"Bruna the Surfer Girl,\" Surfistinha is the beautiful 17-year-old Brazilian run-away from a middle class family who detailed online her three years working as a prostitute in a posh Brazilian suburb. Her candid and explicit entries on life as a high-class call girl caught the attention of millions and set off a vigorous national debate about sexual identity, values, and practices. As a result, Bruna became an immediate celebrity, the Paris Hilton of Brazil. Here, in The Scorpion's Sweet Venom, she draws back the sheets to reveal the whole story. Bruna writes passionately about her estranged family, her out-of-control drug use, her unbridled sexuality, and her unusual adventures in the world's oldest profession. \"I have seen and done everything,\" she confesses. \"There is nothing left that scares me.\"Part memoir, part cautionary tale, part sex guide, Bruna brings to life the raw, desperate and dangerous underbelly of the Brazilian sex trade, and shares outrageous advice for the bedroom, like what men really want but are too afraid to ask. Provocative, seductive and unforgettable, The Scorpion's Sweet Venom is the vivid account of a young girl's life on the street, and a fearless expression of human sexuality.",
