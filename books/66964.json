  "description": "How many years does it take for a war to end? Collateral Damage contains three linked novellas about the Vietnam War era from the perspectives of those who fought, those who resisted, and the family and friends caught between them.1968: GETTING OUT – At the height of the conflict, Toby Woodruff decides to risk suicide rather than be forced to fight in a war he doesn’t believe in.1982: IF I SHOULD STAY – The war is long over, but conflicts and memories stemming from those years still overshadow the Percy family’s Thanksgiving.1993: LEAVING VIETNAM – When Vietnam at last reopens to Westerners, Sarah Shepherd has a chance to see where her brother died – and try to move past her anger and grief to find peace.“In short, it’s brilliant. . . an amazing product of that unfortunate waste [Vietnam], on par with, yet completely different from, that Vietnam War masterpiece, The Things They Carried.” – Curtis Dawkins, author of The Graybar Hotel\"These are engrossing stories told with considerable artistry, full of recognition and sympathy.\" – Diane Johnson, author of Le Divorce",
