  "description": "An innocent discovery on the beach in Sea Haven leads Ceepak, the cop with an unshakable code of honor, and his rookie partner, the twentysomething wisecracker Boyle, into the hunt for a long-dormant serial killer who might be crawling out of his hiding hole to strike again. Like the relentless rodents in the Boardwalk arcade game, gruesome clues keep popping up all over the island as Ceepak (the former soldier who will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do) finds himself up against an adversary with an even more stringent code; a code he rigidly enforces, no matter what the outcome. When the killer targets his next victim, the consequences become dire for Ceepak and Boyle. This is a game they have to win.",
