  "title": "Second Thoughts: More Queer and Weird Stories",
  "description": "In acclaimed author Steve Berman's second collection of thirteen stories and essays, he again guides readers through the darker pathways of his imagination. These are stories of the scent of loneliness enticing odd children to eat away a fussy caretaker's historic house; a depressed accountant turns to monster hunting; and a young lover's temptation by handsome nursery rhyme. After each tale Berman provides a tangential author note that offers insight into his past trysts as well as his fears and dreams.",
