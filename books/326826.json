  "description": "Girls like me don't get fairy tale endings.My sister and I might be popular seamstresses for the fae, but that doesn't make life easy. Nothing about serving the fae is easy. Or safe.Still, I thought I could have one nice thing. The pendant I found when I was young is my good luck charm and my secret. Until I forget to hide it at a ball and instead of bringing me luck it lands me in hot water.The King and Queen of the Light fae tell me it's stolen and that I have to return it. Only when I try it won't come off. The fae don't grant second chances. What they call me next makes my blood run cold.Witch.I'm not a witch. I'm a seamstress, a human, a nobody. Now I'm banished from the land of the light fae, leaving only one place to go.The Dark Faeâ€™s Kingdom.Suddenly I find myself claimed by the dark fae prince. He's as handsome as he is deadly and I should be running from him. Only he and his kingdom awaken a side of me I never knew existed. I hunger for him, but every time he looks at me I can't be certain if it's me or the pendant he wants.This is the land of the dark fae, where every offer comes with a catch. Where trickery and cruelty are supposed to be celebrated. The grander the offer, the more wary you should be of the cost.The prince wants me to be his queen.But what will saying yes cost me?",
