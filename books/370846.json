  "description": "Rylan and his partner in crime, anthropologist Ursula Deiss, push deep into a dangerous rain forest in Madagascar with a group of scientists. In the jungle, they find a population of cryptic man-like primates. Their discovery quickly draws them into a vortex of an ancient conspiracy that is bound to change mankind's destiny. Enriched with extensive facts drawn from the fields of anthropology, swarm intelligence, and information science, Talus takes the readers from one vibrant location to another, zapping them from Madagascar's uncharted rain forests to Oxford's dark libraries and from Paris's melancholic back streets to Sicily's sunny vineyards.",
