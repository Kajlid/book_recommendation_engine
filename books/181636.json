  "description": "Someone was after her and it was my duty to stop them.Never cross the line. That had always been my rule. But that was before Race True.The moment I saw her, I wanted her. But there was a problem. She wasn’t just another pretty face — no, she was my first client at ALFA PI. My take-what-I-want attitude shouldn't include her, but how the hell can I be expected to keep my hands off?The danger that followed her had my protective instincts in overdrive. And as the clock ticked down, the choice was laid out before me: save her career or risk everything and have her in my bed. Could I put aside my wants for her needs? Or would my selfishness destroy everything in the process?Warning: If you can't handle a dirty-mouthed bad boy or a tough woman with an attitude, this might not be the book for you.",
