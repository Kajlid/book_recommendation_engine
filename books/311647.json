  "description": "JuneI’ve been a “good girl” all my life. As the only female in a long line of police officers, toeing the line is pretty much in my blood, even it’s meant giving up things I’ve always wanting. Specifically, one thing I’ve always wanted: Matthew Simms. Or, as he’s known in his motorcycle club, Knight. Because, yeah, that’s how off-limits he is. Even if he wasn’t off limits, he’d be out of my league. Former Army ranger, current tattoo artist, member of a MC, Knight has known me forever and sees me as nothing more than his former best friend’s kid sister. To him, I’m nothing more than a pest. A dorky goodie-two-shoes. But when I stumble upon information that could bring down a dirty cop, Knight is the only one I can turn to. I know he won’t turn his back on me when I need him. He can keep me safe, but will he break my heart?KnightEveryone thinks June is a the perfect cop’s daughter. They see her sweet nature, her ambition, and her determination to help others. I see all of that and more. I see her humor and sass and sexy curves. I’ve wanted to make her mine for years, but I know she deserves a better life than one I can provide. So I keep my distance, no matter what.When she puts herself in danger to help bring down a dirty cop and to protect my motorcycle club? All bets are off.Despite my nickname, I’m no knight in shining armor. I will do everything in my power to keep her safe, but when she kisses me, I’m not strong enough to resist her any longer.The only question is this once I know she’s safe, will I be strong enough to walk away?",
