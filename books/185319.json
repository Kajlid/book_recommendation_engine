  "title": "Nonviolence Now!: Living the 1963 Birmingham Campaign's Promise of Peace",
  "description": "Using the campaign’s “commitment card,” to nonviolence, Alycee Lane explores the deeper, wider, and more challenging commitment to nonviolence against self, others, and the planet as a whole, and to dedicate oneself to spiritual contemplation, mindfulness, lovingkindness, and generosity. Nonviolence Now thus offers a new pledge, one that includes the Birmingham commitments but goes beyond them to help us meet the different but no less critical challenges that the Obama-era presents.",
