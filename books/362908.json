  "title": "A Guided Meditation for Healing Trauma: Ptsd",
  "description": "Designed to renew a positive connection with the body and the emotions; reduce isolation, terror, shame and despair; restore a sense of inner goodness, hope, growth, purpose and meaning; replenish self-esteem and a sense of spiritual connection and protection -- not by reliving the trauma, but by metaphorically shifting it, incrementally over time, with repeated listening. Steve Kohn's closely scored, richly textured, exquisite music potentiates this powerfully evocative imagery. There are also 30 minutes of affirmations. (60 minutes).",
