  "description": "The path of a doppelganger is a simple one–target the victim, isolate them, consume them, and become them. This is what Scott Cane has become. He exists as a mythical being–a thing of nightmares.Except. Scott Cane is our hero. The real nightmare is not some creature of the night. It is those evil vile things who walk amongst us wearing normal faces and living normal lives.In the low country of South Carolina, a serial killer stalks his prey. Chloroform in hand, he waits just off the trail, for a cute little brunette to jog helplessly by.Unfortunately for him, the brunette is hoping he will strike.The pattern repeats itself for decades–target, isolate, consume, become.Scott Cane is not merely a shape-shifter. Nor is he technically a Doppelganger. Using one single drop of blood, he can replicate that person at that exact time. He inherits all of their strengths and weaknesses. Their memories exist as flashes of words and images but their carnal instincts remain.Instincts becoming harder to control.",
