  "description": "When her fate rests on an impossible choice, is she brave enough to make one?\n\nAs if lousy parents, a plethora of social inhibitions, and a complicated love triangle weren’t enough problems, Lexus Wren just discovered she’s a powerful Catalyst — capable of commanding Conduits to do her bidding. Pretty heady stuff for a 15-year-old who can’t control her own urge to bite her nails.  When another Catalyst invites Lexus and her twin would-be boyfriends to leave behind their new family and enroll in a school for “gifted” students — or risk permanent separation, Lexus is forced to make a choice, and she’s never been very good at that, either.  Suddenly surrounded by others of her kind, Lexus quickly learns that her abilities are greater than she ever imagined, and the twins are not the only people who crave her touch. When she’s caught in the middle of a battle for power, can the boys set aside the competition between them in time to protect her from herself?  If you like paranormal romance stories with supernatural magic, a love triangle hotter than Twilight, and John Green style teenage angst, you'll be captivated by Growing Wings!  \n FREE BOOK OFFER - details inside\n Scroll up and grab your copy now!
