  "description": "Jim Morrison, rock star, poet, and libertarian, one of the most talked-about and controversial singers of his era, escapes from Pere-Lachaise cemetery in Paris after his death and reunites with his friend Ray Manzarek, keyboardist of the Doors, before embarking upon a most extraordinary journey across America. The Endless Night is a mix of paranormal adventure, murder, and poetic mayhem. A romantic story by virtue of its subject, flamboyant and elegant because of the scenes in which it is set, where eventually Morrison meets his one true love.",
