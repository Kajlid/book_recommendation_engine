  "description": "Max, the stranded Earth pilot, and Rick, his tentacled partner in love, are forced to return to a universe that dismisses Rick as an asymmetrical, loud outcast. But Rick hasn't told Max the whole story. Max wants to live in a universe where his children and his lover are respected and given a chance to shine. He doesn't know the odds are stacked against them. Max is going to have to catch up fast if he wants to win a battle that is less about weapons than manipulating the rest of the universe into being fair. To protect his sweet, belchy partner in love and their three offspring, Max will change the universe, one stubborn alien at a time, and he might have to start with the one he loves.",
