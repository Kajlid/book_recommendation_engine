  "description": "Emily is on a crusade to advance the cause of women's rights. She writes a controversial and incendiary blog called The Radical Feminist where she challenges the male power structure that has oppressed generations of women, tackling issues of equal pay, reproductive rights, and the pervasive culture of rape. Every day she receives dozens of death and rape threats. She has learned to ignore them as little more than the impotent tantrums of weak men, terrified of losing their place of privilege and power...Until one night they show up on her doorstep. Boy's Night.",
