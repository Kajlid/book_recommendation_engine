  "title": "Fresh Slices: A Mystery Anthology",
  "description": "This edition of Fresh Slices is no longer in print. See Fresh Slices in its second edition. Enjoy 21 helpings of New York attitude in Fresh Slices, by local members of the New York / Tri-State chapter of Sisters in Crime. Second in the Murder New York series, the anthology features tales from the most ethnically diverse and densely populated city in America. By turns funny, tough, and somber, the authors reveal slices of life beyond the tourist's view, in rich and poor neighborhoods where old-timers desperately protect their secrets and brand-new arrivals indulge dangerous appetites. There is as much variety in the tones, settings, and approaches as in the city itself. And yet, each of these crime stories also reflects Gotham's most infectious and unifying principle, that special combination of adaptability and assertiveness dished out more often than any pizza or street meat.",
