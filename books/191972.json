  "description": "\"Why shouldn't truth be stranger than fiction? Fiction, after all, has to make sense.\" In Mark Twain's time, as in ours, we accept reality as plausible. In writing, however, readers must be coaxed into accepting plots and characters as real. Take Your Characters to Creating the Illusion of Reality in Fiction shows writers exactly how to do that. The book introduces the saucy, redheaded character Georgina, who is getting to know the characters in her novel. Along with Georgina, readers discover how to write compelling fiction. Each chapter of this book covers one aspect of fiction writing, using analysis, checklists, models, examples of humorous errors, and writing exercises. An extensive glossary is also provided.",
