  "description": "In the far distant future, man is no longer man—he is Elder, awash in life-long youth, health, and Gifts of the Mind. Serving celestial beings known as the Elders, man formed the League, a collection of Great Houses scattered on numerous worlds dedicated to defending life and serving the benevolent will of the Elders. For ages League mothers have told their children terrifying stories about the Black Hats: the enemy. A sect of Xaphan murderers eager to slay anyone who falls into their grasp, always searching for their next victim. Only the League’s ruling body, the Sisterhood of Light, has been able to counter their evil. When a Black Hat is taken prisoner aboard Captain Davage’s ship, the Sisters have every intention of executing her, to put her to a slow, painful death. That is what’s done to Black Hats, and no one dares challenge the Sisters’ authority. They are astounded when the Captain refuses to allow it. Using his Gift of Sight, Captain Davage, the Lord of the Great House of Blanchefort, has gotten a glimpse of the Black Hat’s face, and is shocked. Though no one but a Sister would ever willingly face a Black Hat and hope to survive, he enters her cell.",
