  "description": "Warning, not a stand alone! This is Volume 1-5 in a continuing series of SHORT STORIES. In a world ruled with military precision, a misspoken word has the power to generate enough rage to turn life upside down in the story of a post apocalyptic world on the brink. Steve Manos and his family live in Europe Town, a segregated area where people of European descent live in the Coalition; formerly the United States. The necessities of life are minimally met by the government and everyone works for the good of the leadership. Life for the people is almost intolerable, but that is when change happens. The stories are not stand alones. This series is available free on the author's website. Volume 6-10 is offered now for signing on her email list.",
