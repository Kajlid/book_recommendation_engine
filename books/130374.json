  "title": "4 Fashion Doll Gangbangers (Alexander McQueen, Martin Margiela, Gareth Pugh & Zac Posen) Decided: Books Or Bags Don't Fuck Shoes, Scarfs And Sexy Dressed Perfumes In Style Kingdom Oniomaniac Do",
  "description": "The genuine book. Literally. Imagine radical and charming fashion ideas of Alexander McQueen, Martin Margiela, Zac Posen and Gareth Pugh transplanted to the literature field. Can you do that? Honestly, I can't. But there's one man who can, the author of the book - Nigel Tomm. A true master of contemporary literature, Nigel Tomm has transcended generation, language, and culture to become one of the most astonishing writers. The book is a quintessential passage to the today's literature. You don't have to read the entire book - experience it, feel it, and taste it like wine, breathing it in and letting it sit and roll around your eyes. The book is written in the style of Nigel Tomm's novel \"The Blah Story\" and, actually, it's a foxy bit goodie.",
