  "description": "Kamil knows something sinister is going on in the woods. Deep amongst the trees the old Squawk Box poultry farm is stirring back to life, but it doesn't seem to be processing chickens, and the villagers are too scared to ask questions. Questions like... Why is Mister Petri, owner of the Squawk Box, supplying the enormous Cosmina Barbescu with extra rations? What has the local schoolmistress witnessed at the farm, and how does she keep losing her fingers? Why is that flock of chickens following Kamil everywhere he goes, and did that rabbit just explode? Together with Flori, the poacher's daughter, Kamil investigates a mystery smelling mankier by the moment.Shortlisted for the 2010 Carnegie Medal.",
