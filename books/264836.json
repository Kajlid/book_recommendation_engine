When she wakes the morning after her eighteenth birthday screaming her head off outside some stranger's house, she's inclined to believe her dad's side of the story. She can't control her shrieks - not when they happen or who dies - but things could always be worse. She could have a crazed madman determined to kill her, thanks to her newfound talents. Or, she could find out her long-time crush is the next to die.Ridley O'Neill isn't exactly unaware of Sara. As a long-time patron of her father's diner, he's watched her grow up. Now that she's eighteen, she's not the gap-toothed kid who used to serve him sweet tea.

She's convinced she's a banshee and he's on her hit list. Still, he can't stay away from her, protecting her from a dangerous legacy, even knowing that her life saved means his is forfeit.What can unbind the ancient banshee's curse? With time running out, Sara and Ridley must choose between chasing answers and chasing love.",
