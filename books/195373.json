  "title": "Poetry for Strangers",
  "description": "\"This book is made up of poems written for strangers. Every week, over the course of two years, I asked a stranger for a word to use in a poem. I had only two rules: The person had to be an actual stranger. The word had to appear in the poem. Aside from that, the poem could be about anything. And so each poem became about many things: the word itself, the stranger-encounter, and the world as I encountered it.”Since its inception, Elisabeth Sharp McKetta’s Poetry for Strangers has changed hundreds of people’s relationship with poetry, mobilizing poets and non-poets alike to share their writing on an eclectic array of weekly words. These poems are a testament to the small moments of beauty in every ordinary life.",
