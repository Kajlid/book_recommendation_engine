Neville Roscoe, notorious and enigmatic, lives resolutely outside society, bound only by his own code of honor-until challenged by his desire for the one woman he cannot have. Miranda Clifford is a lady imprisoned by rigid respectability-until tempted by a passion beyond her power to deny. Flung together in peril, through danger and intrigue, they discover a love that is impossible to ignore-or keep.",
