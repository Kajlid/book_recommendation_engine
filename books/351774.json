  "title": "Meatloaf: Recipes for Everyone's Favorite",
  "description": "Everyone loves meatloaf. It's the ultimate in homey comfort food, easy to make and, with a fluffy mound of mashed potatoes and some gravy, about as close to heaven as a meal can get. Maryana Vollstedt, author of such comforting favorites as Big Book of Casseroles and Big Book of Easy Suppers , presents her favorite recipes, including a classic loaf using a mixture of ground beef and sausage; a lively version with a horseradish-crumb topping; and an Asian-style meatloaf with a hoisin-soy sauce (and a spicy touch of wasabi for more adventurous folks). Others showcase poultry, lamb, or fish and there are also vegetarian selections. Recipes for the perfect side dish accompaniment round out this satisfying book.",
