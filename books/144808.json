  "description": "Winner of the 2012 Costa Poetry Award, the latest collection by Kathleen Jamie, “the leading Scottish poet of her generation” (The Sunday Times)See when it all unravels—the entire projectreduced to threads of moss fleeing a nor’wester;d’you ever imagine chasing just one strand, letting it lead youto an unsung cleft in a rock, a place you could take to,dig yourself in—but what are the chances of that?                                                                                    Of the birds,few remain all winter; half a dozen wadersmediate between sea and shore, that space confirmed—don’t laugh—by your own work.      —from “Materials”The Overhaul continues Kathleen Jamie’s lyric inquiry into the aspects of the world our rushing lives elide, and even threaten. Whether she is addressing birds or rivers, or the need to accept loss, or, sometimes, the desire to escape our own lives, her poetry is earthy and rigorous, her language at once elemental and tender. The Overhaul is a midlife book of repair, restitution, and ultimately hope—of the wisest and most worldly kind.",
