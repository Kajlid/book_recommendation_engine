  "description": "The symptoms have been studied; the diagnosis is confirmed; the prognosis is bleak. The universe will cease to exist in just 12 hours—12 hours during which all of the loose ends must be tied up, all of the Big Questions answered, and all of the Ultimate Truths revealed. It promises to be a somewhat hectic half-day—during which a Brentford shopkeeper will complete a sitting room for God, a Chiswick woman will uncover the Metaphenomena of the Multiverse, an aging super villain will put the finishing touches to his plans for transdimensional domination, serious trouble will break out at the New Messiah's Convention in Acton, and a Far-Fetched Fiction author will receive Divine Enlightenment. Will the universe end with a bang or a whimper—or something else entirely, possibly involving a time-traveling Elvis Presley with a sprout in his head?",
