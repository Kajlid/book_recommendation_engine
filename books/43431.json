  "description": "The story of the night Aiden was born has never been told, until now. Fleeing the Hunters, Kevan and Shannon O'Reilly find their way to Spruce Knoll Colorado, assuming they'll be safe in America. Their unborn son is special, even for a druid, or a channeler as the American's like to call their kind. But why the Hunters, people who are sworn to keep their kind safe, are after them is a mystery. All they know is that if they don't outrun them they'll be killed. Trouble has followed them to Spruce Knoll and just when it seems it may be too late, they discover the true reason why.",
