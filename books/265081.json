  "description": "Haven’t you wished that you could reverse your actions and words? Haven’t you wished you had reacted differently? Haven’t you wished to change something or erase something? In this short book, I have shared those events, incidents, memories etcetera that I have sort of regretted or want to undo. All of us have thought of pressing Ctrl Z in real life at least once. And that is precisely why I feel you should read it. It is a short book and doesn’t take much of your time anyway.",
