  "description": "I can see everyone’s future but my own. I’ve lived most of my life as a recluse because leaving my house means being bombarded with visions of the possible futures that exist with every step I take. If that person crosses the road here, they live, but if they go to the traffic lights at the corner, they’ll get hit by someone running the red. It’s a curse, and one I do my best to hide from until I’m dragged on a mission to rescue my sister. Not that my assassin sibling needs my help. What I don’t expect is to be hit by a wave of power that throws my ability into overdrive—and threatens my sanity. Rather than drag my sisters into my nightmare, I enlist the aid of a professor specializing in arcane history. A man I could easily love, but I already know how that ends—with him dying at my feet. There has to be a way to change the future, but what if my choices bring about the apocalypse?",
