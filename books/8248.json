  "title": "George's Turn",
  "description": "George has had enough of men and his old life. As a cowboy, he'd been run off enough ranches for being gay. In his new life as a diner cook, he's more than happy to play it straight. Ladies love his cowboy swagger, he loves his solitary job and his tiny apartment, and all seems to be going wellâ€”until his eyes land on a gorgeous man so unlike anyone he's ever seen. Tank loves all the little mates running around the estate, but the gentle giant longs for his own mate to hold at night. The moment he meets the new cook, he's smitten. But flowers and candlelight dinners don't seem to be enough to convince George that giving himself to Tank doesn't have to mean giving up his manhood. When vampires attack George, Tank must help care for him. Will George finally see that the strongest love just might be between two strong men? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
