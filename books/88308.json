  "description": "It can be hard beating your brain to dredge up something you've forgotten. But how would it be if you couldn't forget anything ever? Except, of course, the one thing you desperately want to know: why, at the age of eleven, you had been found alone in an isolated cottage, with a head injury and your mother gone? And why had the police investigation been so strangely low-key?Twenty years later, Keira, a victim of hyperkinaesia, is asking questions, hoping that the answers may break the loop that runs constantly in her mind of that last day before her life fell apart. And she's looking for a woman who was a young police officer then who might be able to tell her what she needs to know. If she will DI Marjory Fleming seems oddly reluctant. It's ironic that she should recommend forgetting about it, but as threatening shadows of the past begin to gather, Keira realises that it was sound advice. If there was any way she could take it.",
