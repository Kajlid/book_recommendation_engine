Her world was instantly turned upside down as she was viciously assaulted and left for dead in front of her young children. This story takes you from a broken, shattered life and details how she was able to rebuild her world, while dealing with nightmares and flashbacks, mind-numbing fear, pain, the burning, boiling anger and an intense hatred. This book portrays living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, attempted suicides, and finally, the steps taken and the therapy that saved an entire family. When Angels Die was originally written as a form of self-help therapy. And now, it is dedicated to those who need help and guidance in making the emotional transition from being a Crime Victim to being a Survivor. The time is now to let go of your fears and to regain control of your lives.",
