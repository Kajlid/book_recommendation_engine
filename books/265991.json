  "description": "3rd in \"A Civil War Mystery\" SeriesSet against the backdrop of 1860s richmond, the adventures of Narcissa Powers, a well-to-do young white widow-turned-war nurse, and Judah Daniel, a freed slave and conjure woman, start as the war escalates and troops move in for battle. But in Richmond, an even greater threat looms: smallpox. As Narcissa, Judah, and their friend, the british journalist Brit Wallace, soon suspect, this is more than microbial contagion. It is a deadly crime, a plague intentionally planted on \"tainted\" money, and they must race to halt a killer more lethal than the cannons on the blood-soaked fields of combat.\"Mcmillan manages another powerful portrait of women fighting the hardest battles of all.\" (Kirkus Reviews)",
