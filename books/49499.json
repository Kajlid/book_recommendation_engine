Ultra-rich businessman and wolf-shifter Maxwell Wallace gets what he wants regardless of the consequences, and that includes a mate outside his species. Claiming bear-shifter Quinn English violates not only the laws of nature, but those of their warring clans. Heedless of the danger, Maxwell refuses to have his lust denied. Quinn's life has revolved around academics and football, but suddenly, with one foolish bet, Quinn has placed himself at the mercy of a notorious Dom. All Quinn wanted was to explore his submissive side. He had no idea he was part of a greater legacy of animal shifters. By the time he finds out, it's too late to run. Will Quinn and Maxwell learn to work together, or will they forfeit their lives and destroy the very foundations of the Twin Pines Grizzlies? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
