  "description": "Author, Wes Deep is struggling to produce his next best seller. Brought about by the death of his father, he is suddenly thinking again about his mother. He agrees to meet up with his publicist and best friend Vikki Hart who, although very concerned about him, is getting very agitated by his lack of decent material. As a last resort he agrees to move out of the city to write his book. She devises a plan to kick-start Wes in the right direction with the discovery of a swapped USB memory stick. Fleeing London, before the owner came looking for it, seemed the best idea, but Vikki never knew how real her plan had become.What starts out as an innocent attempt to inspire Wes, turns into a London Gangland, nightmare race against time.",
