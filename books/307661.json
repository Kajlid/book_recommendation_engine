It would get me away from a Mother who didn’t love me, an alcoholic Step-Father I despised, and a life filled with no meaning. At the Academy, I could make something of myself. Become the person I’ve always wanted to be; the person I was destined to be. But I could never have imagined that things could be worse there. That The Sect and The Set ruled the school. Literally. They had a list of five rules that all must obey or face the dire consequences. Then there’s Him. He is the forbidden fruit. The Beast I’m warned away from. The boy I feel a connection to, yet knew that I shouldn’t.Hawthorn Academy isn’t anything like I expected. It's clear that I’m in danger. That somebody is out to harm me. I just needed to survive the next two years there. How hard could that be? Disorder is book one in the Hawthorn Academy Series. It is a dark high school bully new adult romance and contains themes that some readers might find uncomfortable. This book is part of a trilogy and is NOT a standalone.",
