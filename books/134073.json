They are irresistibly drawn to one another, but when her passion and spirit clash with his tangled conflict of duty and desire, not only their hearts will be in danger, but their very lives as well.Tender and touching, full of drama and detail, it brings all the emotion and adventure, suspense and romance readers have come to expect from author LORRIE FARRELLY.TERMS OF TEMPTATION continues the lives and loves of the Cantrell and Devlin families, following the best-selling TERMS OF SURRENDER and TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT.",
