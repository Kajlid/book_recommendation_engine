  "description": "Mario Scarfassi was a remarkable butcher who brought his work home. Literally.A woman can sell her body also for a noble cause.Giancarlo Vestali chose his tie colour carefully as he knew what shade he would end up.A flower in a pool can make the difference between freedom and jail.Chase Williams wants to live a normal life in Tursenia, Italy. But it's not as easy as it appears.The saga of unusual crimes on which ex Scotland Yard detective Chase Williams stumbles every day continues. It's all about Chase's snooping abilities and his exceptional perceptiveness from which nothing escapes.10 detective short stories of 1000 words each, where proud prostitutes alternate with young lovers, sloppy drug dealers, hunting dogs, elderly people tired of living, amazing chefs and, as usual, Chase's neighbors who are always gossipy, fanatically religious and very nosey.10 open, shiny windows overlooking the less dramatic crime stories of Tursenia, a Medieval town in the heart of Italy, where a former detective like Chase Williams - now dedicated to living his placid office lifestyle - can get a run for his money. Anyone and everyone could be a criminal. And Chase well knows it.DISCLAIMER: Although the first volume of the Cutting Right to the Chase series is suitable to children and young adults, Cutting Right to the Chase Vol.2 is suitable for an older audience due to the graphic nature of some stories.",
