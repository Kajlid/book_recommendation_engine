  "description": "Book jacket/back: When this triptich of new plays by Harold Pinter opened in London in October 1982 it was celebrated by critics and audiences alike as an electrifying theatrical event that confirmed once again the author's undisputed place in the forefront of today's dramatists. \"The first two plays in 'Other Places' are strange, comic, and fascinating, but you would know they were Pinter if you met them in yoru dreams. However, the third play, 'A Kind of Alaska,' (which strikes me on instant acquaintance as a masterpiece) moves one in a way no work of his has ever done before...Never before have I Known a Pinter play to leave one so emotionally wrung through.\" Michael Billington, The Guardian. \"Harold Pinter is writing at the top of his powers...It has taken some of us time to learn Pinter's language. He was never less obscure than here, or more profoundly eloquent about the fragile joy of being alive.\" --John Barber, The Daily TelegraphIn \"A Kind of Alaska,\" a middle-aged woman wakes up after nearly thirty years passed in a coma induced by sleeping sickness. \"Victoria Station\" is a hilarious nocturnal dialogue on a car radio between a lost taxi driver and his controller; \"Family Voices,\" originally broadcast as a radio play and subsequently presented in a \"platform performance,\" is a set of parallel monologues in the form of letters which a mother, son and father may have written to each other but never exchanged.",
