  "title": "Siege at Hawthorn Lake: Murder on the Mountain",
  "description": "Troy Turner is a writer living alone in a secluded cabin in the Rocky Mountains. He thought the small, peaceful valley miles away from the busy resort town of Hawthorn would be the perfect setting for his work. He invites two of his closest friends to stay a few weeks to do some hunting in the rugged and remote area. After their arrival, Troy gives them a tour around the property and plans are made to get an early start the next day. Morning arrives quickly and the eager hunters head out to their tree stands to settle in for a long hunt. Soon, an unexpected storm front moves in, and they are forced off the mountain. As they begin making their way down, they are suddenly and viciously attacked by a beast they can't believe is real. Separated from the others, badly injured and desperate to escape, Troy attempts to go for help. The winter storm makes the drive down the mountain road extremely treacherous and with his injuries making it more difficult, he loses control and wrecks his Jeep. He is found unconscious by a snow plow driver and wakes up days later in a hospital bed. Troy tells the unbelievable and horrifying story of the cryptid encounter on the mountain and desperately pleads for help for the friends he was forced to leave behind. Believing it to be a sensationalized story geared at publicity, the sheriff all but dismisses Troy's unbelievable claims, but when a search uncovers the body of one of the men and the other one missing, Troy becomes the prime suspect. How can he prove his innocence when the real killer isn't supposed to exist?",
