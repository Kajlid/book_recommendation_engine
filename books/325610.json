  "description": "It is England in the time of the Napoleonic Wars, and Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for the Department of War and the Colonies has been foully murdered during one of his wife’s ton parties. His death threatens to cast the country into a national crisis which may well bring down the government of the day, and risks the frustration of carefully laid plans for the eventual defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte.Against a backdrop of Regency high society, the Earl of Alspath - to all outward intents and purposes merely a minor functionary in the government bureaucracy, but in reality the head of the King’s Secret Police - must unravel a tangled web of intrigue and espionage to solve the Viscount’s murder. In his pursuit of this goal the Lord Alspath will be forced to call upon a surprising array of allies, not the least of them a young lady enjoying her first London Season who also just happens to be the possessor of an extraordinary magical talent not seen since the days of the great Sir Isaac Newton himself.",
