I’m an easy-going person, and I hate anything brainy, but the damn bottle made me travel back in time, back to 1956 when Abuela was only nineteen. Younger than me! I might need to use my brain to figure out how to get back to 2020, preferably before I alter my grandparents' history. Befriending them isn’t part of the plan, and falling for Celestina, my abuela's future best friend, is definitely not supposed to happen. CelestinaAll Celestina wanted was her mother's love, but because she’s a product of rape, she learned to accept that her dream would never come true. However, when Leonardo materialized out of her bottle in front of her, she thought that if magic was possible, her wishes may not be out of reach.In Another Time is a time travel romance set in Beniardà, a small sun-drenched village in Francoist Spain, where time seemed to be standing still.",
