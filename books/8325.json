  "description": "I'd like to give special thanks to Jason Merrick for the great cover. Alcorn Pet Food Corporation is working with an experimental cat food laced with hormones and appetite enhancers. The special food causes cats to add muscle, gain weight, and exhibit extremely aggressive behavior. When an employee threatens to expose the pet food as a threat to public safety, she finds herself out of work, her home ransacked, and all her carefully gathered proof missing. Meanwhile, animal rights activists release the cats involved in the testing because they are scheduled to be euthanized. These bigger, stronger, and more aggressive animals begin to prey on small game in the area. Then the ravenous cats turn their attention to people. Lovers, runners, hunters, dogs, deer, rabbits, normal cats, and even motorists begin to fall victim to the predations of these enhanced felines. An unemployed scientist, a small special ops team, a grieving father, a chief of security, and a homeless veteran join forces to try to prevent a catastrophe. When a murderer steals the secret formula that created the menace and sells it to eight foreign enemies of the United States, the stakes suddenly get a lot higher, because the most deadly biological weapon ever created has just been released. The genie is out of the bottle and the world will never be the same. To make matters worse, the scientist discovers that the first generation offspring will be even bigger and more aggressive, and then they learn that the food also affects dogs and rats. Disclaimer No animals or people were harmed during the writing of this book. The author does not hate cats, dogs, women and children, animal rights activists, homeless people, hunters, runners, truck drivers, maintenance men, chicken farmers, police officers, sheriff’s deputies, women who text while driving SUVs, or the elderly. However, the author is deathly afraid of anyone who texts while driving because of several near death experiences attributable to such individuals. The author is a cat lover, but he is also a writer. This book started with the basic premise of what if. What would happen if a pet food were tampered with in such a way as to make the animals abnormally large and aggressive? Writing this book was, at times, painful for the author who feeds and pets a feral cat on a regular basis. But as a writer, the author felt the storyline was too good not to write, just because it made him uncomfortable. The setting of this story is in Athens, Alabama, which is where the author resides. Athens was chosen because of his intimate knowledge of the city and the surrounding area. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there are currently no homeless people residing in Athens. The depiction in this book of such an individual is the product of the author’s imagination and is there for storyline purposes only. There is an animal feed manufacturing plant located where the author situated Alcorn Pet Food Corporation in the book. However, it is not configured as described in the book. The author went with that location because of the surrounding terrain, but the real facility is not named Alcorn. The feed produced at that location by the real company is safe. As far as the author knows, there is no real pet food company by the name Alcorn. That company is the product of his imagination. His research on the fictitious name found no connection to the pet food industry. The personalities, traits, and decisions made by government officials in portions of this book are not based on the actual individuals currently holding those offices, or any who have held them in the past. They are the product of the author’s imagination.The epic sequel, Claws 2. After the Apocalypse, is now available in the Kindle store.",
