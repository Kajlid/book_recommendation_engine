A murderer.I kill women who are guilty of nothing other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Women like Lyra.Her yellow raincoat flapped in the cool breeze when she walked by, that blonde hair making her look like a drowned rat as she stopped to taste the rain.She wasn’t like the others, but my demon wanted her.We followed her. Watched her. Obsessed over her.She is ours. Of that I’m certain.We will pull her into the depths of our darkness and keep her imprisoned there.Until we meet our end.LyraI am ordinary in every way.Average looks. Mundane job. Boring life.But when he looks at me, I become something else entirely.His gaze stalks and tracks me like a game of cat and mouse, his eyes licking fire over my skin every time they glance in my direction.My thoughts are consumed by him every moment he’s out of sight.He is my obsession. I can’t let him go.And once he shows me his true form, I know I’ve captured him forever.He is mine. Of that I’m certain.I will follow him to the depths of darkness and happily submit to his madness.Until we meet our end.",
