Throw in Dimitri's nightmares, the Concierge's disdain for Dimitri's new house guest and a few hundred people looking high and low for the both of them...and it makes for a very interesting read.Picking up at the end of the last chapter, this novel covers the time until the two leave Hong Kong, before the epilogue of the first bestselling novel in this series, The Beast.Book three is Little Dove and is coming soon!Two twisted and imperfect beings must adjust to their new lives together while avoiding detection from authorities and an international crime ring.***As with the first novel in this series, this story covers dark themes with graphic sex, murder and violence.",
