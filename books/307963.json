  "description": "Matilda Ashby has a pair of Ivy League degrees and a dream of unseating her brother as their billionaire father’s favorite. But just as she inches close to her goal, Matilda’s world is rocked by monsters roaming the Manhattan streets, and the elusive enemy at her father’s corporation who hired them to kill her. With assassins on the heels of her Manalos, and the family business’s reputation in danger of being destroyed, Matilda hires the mysterious Samson, a telepath with a shady past, to help her find out who wants her dead.  But when the would-be assassins can take the form of anyone in her life, Matilda doesn’t know who she should fear most—the monsters hiding inside her family business or the ones coming for her head.",
