  "title": "Nobody Loves a Bigfoot Like a Bigfoot Babe",
  "description": "A wonderfully amusing romp, this novel takes place in the Northern California town of Big Beaver, which has become a haven for Bigfoot, alien sightings, and the Phantom Bigfoot Bather. It is a town full of lovable misfits and crazies in search of the illusive Bigfoot, with a forest full of Bigfoot girls who just want to have fun. One particular weird Beaverite, Duane, has kept the Bigfoot a secret--until, to his dismay, a female Bigfoot abducts a teenager. He must use all his guile to stop his secret from getting out, especially with his close friend and crypto zoologist on the trail, along with the local sheriff and the FBI.",
