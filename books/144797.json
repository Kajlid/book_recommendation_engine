He is baffled by the mysterious beach fires and eerie singing he witnesses during the night. He is fascinated, too, by the weird and wonderful tales of the town: not only the legend of the pitiful Mary-Anne, said to row out nightly to the Blue Rock, but also of the peculiar 'cursed' gold plate locked in the guesthouse cabinet. Stranger still, why has a dead man been spotted in the town?With the help of intriguing local girl, Hattie, the secrets of Salt Guesthouse are unravelled... but not before the children find themselves in grave danger.
