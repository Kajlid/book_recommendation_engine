  "description": "Refinement is everything in the drawing rooms of the ton. But behind closed doors, a world of scandalous passion awaits. . .\nA Gentleman Without Scruples\nPatience Waverly has no time for uppity English aristocratsand no desire to become one. But when Patience and her twin, Prudence, arrive in London from Philadelphia to claim an inheritance, she discovers that she is now a Baroness. Prudence, meanwhile, is determined to marry into a title of her own. She sets her cap at Max Purefoy, the future Duke of Sunderlandand, to Patience's dismay, the most seductive scoundrel she has ever met. . .\nA Desire Without Limits\nMax has little interest in frivolous Prudence, but the outspoken, outrageously attractive Baroness intrigues him. When Prudence's plan to entrap Max almost ruins him, he seeks amends from Patience. She must become his wife. And he will settle for nothing less than making their union one of unrelenting, unending pleasure. . .",
