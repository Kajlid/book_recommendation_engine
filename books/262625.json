  "description": "James Never good enough. Not the real son. I will prove him wrong—prove everyone wrong. I am someone. I will succeed. I don’t need my brother to help me. I don't need anyone. My enemy holds my secret. He teases me. Taunts me. Follows me with his eyes. Our hot, angry kisses keep me up at night. I don’t want him. I hate him. But I can’t stop thinking about him. That there's more to him I want to discover him. The truth is unexpected. My enemy might not only be my friend but the love I never thought to have. Malcolm Live, love, laugh. Life is too short to worry when you don’t know how long you’ve got. I want every day to be my best. Like it’s my last. My friends see what I let them. Not the real me. Only one man has ever crawled beneath my skin. He drives me crazy. Makes me wild. Makes me care. A night of bad decisions changes the course of my life. Everything I've known no longer makes sense. My enemy now stands by my side. I’m no longer running. I want to stay. I want a future. Hate has changed to something new and wonderful. Something terrifying. Uncontrollable. Love.",
