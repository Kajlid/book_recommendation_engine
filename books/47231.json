  "description": "'Beautifully written and very funny, the perfect combination of Hanoi, sexual taboo and gender politics.' Emily Maguire (Bestselling Australian author) 'Original and quirky, a warm-hearted and very funny tale of noodles, sexual longing and cultural misunderstanding in the new Vietnam' Mark Dapin (Journalist, columnist and author) Sydney-based musician Carolyn Shine moves to Hanoi virtually on a whim, expecting to find romance and available culture. She's in for some big surprises. Funny, warm and engaging, her travel memoir introduces us to a cast of memorable Vietnamese characters as well as her fellow foreigners searching for love and adventure. From teaching English, sub-editing a propaganda news sheet, to forming a blues band, against the backdrop of a world seemingly alive with the promise of romance, this is a beguiling evocation of Hanoi and its pungent, earthy and sensual. ABOUT THE Carolyn Shine studied Fine Arts and Linguistics at the University of New South Wales and went on to become a musician, songwriter and music educator. As a freelance writer she has been published in various publications, including the Sydney Morning Herald. She moved to Hanoi on a whim in 2002, expecting available culture and romance. Her disappointment propelled her to seek satisfying answers to questions on culture that until then she'd never dared ask.",
