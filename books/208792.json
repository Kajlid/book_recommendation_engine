  "title": "Masaoka Shiki: His Life and Works",
  "description": "Now available to today s readers in an enhanced new edition with photographs, this acclaimed work offers a complete portrait of the life and the far-reaching influence of the man many Japanese critics refer to as \"the father of modern haiku.\" Beichman puts Shiki s brief, energetic life, his personality, and his fertile work--including haiku, tanka, and diaries--into fascinating context. As the earliest to write haiku that were modern in both theme and subject, Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902) is a prominent figure in modern Japanese literature. Born one year before the Meiji Restoration, he was in many ways a transitional figure, with his writings standing midway between the pre-modern and modern periods and his character and life shaped by both. Janine Beichman takes care in this elucidating work not to overemphasize Shiki s popular image as a haiku poet, and informs readers about other important yet little-known aspects of Shiki s work. Includes translations acclaimed for their sensitivity, as well as understandable literary analysis.",
