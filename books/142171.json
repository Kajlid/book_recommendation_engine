  "description": "An ancient, deadly magic is rising, and she’s the only one who can harness it… Kate Hamilton hates being treated like an outcast. Born a powerless Null to America's pre-eminent magical family, she escapes to a distant college and the life of a theater major. The last thing she wants is to be dragged into her family's war for global domination against the rival Makris clan. But when an innocent favor pulls Kate into a perilous contest with a legendary magical stone, she plunges into their dangerous world of spellcasting and scheming. A world Kate's sexy, devious boyfriend Kris is all too familiar with… Hardened magical operative Kristof \"Kris\" Makris chafes under the rule of his lunatic father, but he's found the perfect way to overthrow his leader and save his people. But the artifact he needs is in the hands of the Hamilton family, and each attempt to steal it from Kate brings him closer to blowing his cover. If he does, he'll do more than alert his father to his treachery. He'll lose Kate. And that possibility bothers him more than he cares to admit. As the ancient power inside the stone begins to transform Kate into a vessel of world-destroying magic, the line between friends and enemies blurs. Kristof must choose between his family and the girl he's grown to love. And Kate must either trust the man she thought she knew or lose herself to the stone’s deadly embrace.",
