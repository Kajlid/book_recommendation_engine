  "description": "John Preston brings it back to the basics: a hand on a neck, a boot that needs a spit shine, a trick who leaves with bruises and sweet memories. In books such as the S/M classic Mr. Benson, Preston explored power exchange in all its battered beauty. The sex stories in I Once Had a Master combine a hard-core sensibility with rare psychological insight.In \"Authenticity,\" a top turns down two fawning bottoms in full leather regalia in favor of the sweet-faced novice who offers genuine surrender. In \"Pedro,\" a college boy has a summer affair with a truck driver and finds himself flirting with other men just to provoke his loverâ€™s rage. The lonely bottom in \"Interludes\" develops his body to perfection, then seeks out the Daddy who will cherish this gift.",
