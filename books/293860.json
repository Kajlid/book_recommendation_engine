  "description": "Smart, cunning zombies against stupid, dumb people.Zombies are among us: strong, self-confident, decisive zombies-men, tantalizing, seductive cougars-women, and even little zombies-kids! To meet with one of these extraordinary creatures is always a deadlock for most people. But is there any chance to survive? Or all the characters of 18 stories are doomed to die?\"The author is a moron! Actually, I’m a zombie. And I didn’t like the book—abusive humor, intolerance and zombie rights violation. Moreover, besides domestic violence stories and suspenseful adventure stories, some tales are heartbreaking romantic love stories that are absolutely shocking. I couldn’t stop sobbing because I’m a very sensitive zombie. Endless mocks and scoffs remind me of Quentin Tarantino and Seth MacFarlane. I swear, I’ll find this author and gobble up his brain!\" Zombie Times.\"Having read this book, I broke up with my girlfriend. We worked together. During lunch breaks, we learned how to kiss. Our love became stronger and stronger, and I was about to ask her to marry me. Then my buddy recommended me this goddamn book. I had been reading these eighteen 20-minute stories during lunchtime, although my girlfriend was sitting in front of me. Do you think she left me? Hell, no! On the 19thday, having read these crazy zombie stories, I became obsessed with one idea. It was Friday evening, when I broke into her lovely house, and plunged my teeth into my girlfriend’s head. I ate her brain and escaped. And I don’t regret anything! This book transformed my life. Right now, I’m heading toward Mexico. Sitting on the train, I started rereading these incredible zombie stories. Don’t try to squeal on me to the police. Y’all be dead!\" Mike from Texas.\"For the last three years, I felt depressed. I just couldn’t break the deadlock. I used to read a lot of gripping, chilling, cliff-hanging thrillers, and most likely, they made me unhappy. One day I typed ‘How to overcome depression in life?’ and I found this book immediately. Three days later, I deleted all that mysterious, suspenseful, psychological thrillers. Actually, this book helped me find the way out of the stalemate.\"Read the most ridiculous and hilarious zombie stories of 2019!Look inside the book on Amazon:US:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YX5NYPWUK:https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07YX5NYPWKindle Unlimited is available.",
