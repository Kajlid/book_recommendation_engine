  "description": "The highly anticipated third book in the Amelia Maylock series. - They all started walking up the bank and used the tree trunks as cover, concealing themselves in the shadows when they moved, silently. It was a needed skill too as Maratlus had guards on patrol near the metal entrances to the caves. Some were creatures that Amelia recognised from her training with the old hag - when she created attackers for Amelia to overcome, safely - and others were large, muscular people. The creatures were called hybrids because Erryaz had used her evil magic to create many drones, for uses such as this. The creatures here looked like humans cross bred with dogs or wolves. They stood upright on two legs, yet were covered in fur and had a long snout and extremely sharp teeth. They were all heavily armed and simply stood on watch, turning their heads left and right in a monotonous rhythm.",
