  "description": "Heroes of the 21st Century is a satirical romp that begs a common question: \"What does it take to be a hero in these crazy modern times?\" Can the romantic, arch-schemer Charlie Leuven really be a candidate for civic sainthood after inadvertently unleashing the mythic Windigo to wreak havoc on the very fabric of civilization? Is the strong-willed brit, Samantha Hewitt, destined to ascend to the pantheon alongside Charlie, or perish miserably in a white desert?The cinematic melodrama ricochets with with and verve from LA to NYC with stops in-between. This novel is replete with an assorted cast of incisively-drawn characters from New York moneymen to escaped mental patients, comically out-of-touch academics, and good people like us. Greed, ambition, self-delusion, revenge, self-sacrifice and the profound longing for physical and spiritual union mingle and clash from Bel Air estates to isolated fishing shanties, making Heroes the rarest of literary pleasures.",
