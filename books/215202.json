  "description": "If running from a hit man wasn't scary enough, ATF agent Thayne Wolfe, has a new challenge in his life and this one may be even more dangerous than the last. He has to figure out how to work with his reckless new partner, a handsome former Marine who seems to have a death wish.  Jarrett Evans never stays in one place very long and being chained to a desk doing paperwork is not his idea of entertainment. His lover and new partner at the ATF seems to find ways to throw a monkey wrench into all his fun, especially when Thayne wants to curtail his need to jump off ten story buildings.  When their boss sends them to San Diego to investigate a fireworks accident, he figures Jarrett can’t hurt anyone playing with sparkers, not even himself. The fact is, danger, intrigue and Jarrett's dubious past seem to follow the men wherever they go.  From a Marine base at the Mexican border to an explosion in LA’s Chinatown, they aren't prepared for a seriously pissed off militia, a smoking hot ex-lover, and more guys who want them dead.  The sparks will fly in and out of the bedroom in Flash and Bang.  (Flash and Bang contains an exciting excerpt from book 3, Slip and Slide)",
