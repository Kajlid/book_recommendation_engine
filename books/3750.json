  "description": "Taking care of business…Barracudas in Prada. Stuffy board rooms. Raith Aldan is beyond tired of it all and ready to sell out and move on to something less stressful and much more…interesting. Something that suits his dominant male traits, like a BDSM club in Tahoe.He’s only spoken to his new realtor on the phone, but she isn’t the usual bend-over-backwards-to-please-him type. She’s a woman who can stand up for herself yet submit to his command—a heady combination.Alexandra Aimon is intrigued with the man who persists in calling her day after day in his quest for property. Something about him, his voice, the way he speaks as if he has very specific expectations, excites her.Meeting face to face does much more than ignite sparks for the two of them, but there’s a problem. She doesn’t mix business and pleasure, even if temptation comes with handcuffs, collars and floggers.Raith sees only one solution—wrap up the deal as soon as possible. Then wrap his former realtor in leather. Except he never expected to be the one falling fast and hard… This book contains a spanking good time of consensual S&M scenes in some taboo places, some of which may stimulate pleasure so intense you’ll feel the need to go to confession…",
