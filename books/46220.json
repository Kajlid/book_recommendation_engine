  "description": "Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, and Gene Siskel, film critic for the Chicago Tribune, started out as newspaper enemies, each one trying to bludgeon the other in print with pointed barbs or exclusive interviews with Hollywood royalty. The competition continued when someone had the bright idea to put the two of them together on television to critique the coming attractions. In the process of becoming legendary, they also came to know and love each other while continuing to put a stick in the eye. This is their funny and engaging story, as told by scores of people who were involved with them and their show over the years. In the end they stood tallest when they stood together.",
