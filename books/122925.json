One new thing a day should be enough to prove to others, and herself, that she isn’t “Moore the Bore.”Stepping out of her comfort zone isn’t easy, especially since her long-time nemesis, Tanner Woods, is also on the ship. His family and hers are friends, and Tanner knows her—and her true self—better than she’d like to admit.When he learns of her plan, Tanner offers to help Savannah be adventurous and encourages her to try absolutely everything—zip lining and dogsledding, hiking the bear-infested Alaskan wilderness, late-night karaoke, and a polar plunge. Savannah will win Caleb back by showing him just what he’s missing.Except after spending so much time with Tanner, soon she’s not sure Caleb is the one she wants anymore…",
