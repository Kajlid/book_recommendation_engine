  "description": "Jeremy Shipp is the master of the mind-bending tale. These stories bewitch and transport the reader. Though you may not know where Shipp will travel next, each story is an unforgettable thrill-ride and you'll be glad you took the trip.Shipp's novel Vacation established him as one of the foremost authors in the \"bizarro fiction\" movement. Now he turns his attention to short fiction and literary horror. The themes of alienation and cultural homogenization on a global scale are explored in closer detail. Shipp notes, \"This intimacy makes Sheep and Wolves much darker than its predecessor. Because now, the darkness is invading your homes, your dreams, your lives.\" The author's trademark quirky characters populate an otherwise bleak landscape, this time around facing horrors at home rather than evils abroad.",
