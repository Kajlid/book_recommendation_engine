  "description": "Deep within the New Zealand bush, lies a plateau with a clearing, covered over by many years of fallen leaves, leaving it damp and dark. Hidden just beneath the surface are the STONES - green and still polished smooth - placed long ago by the Guardians. Still pulsating with power, they are about to bear witness to a great battle between light and darkness.  Claire Drummond is in danger, her very life depends on the actions and help of her husband and family, as well as the man she thought had left her life for good, Tony Benning. Caught up once more in the heavy turmoil of good vs evil, Claire has much more to fight for than just a cluster of stones in the highlands of Scotland.  This time itâ€™s personal.  This time Marcus Ryder has her daughter.",
