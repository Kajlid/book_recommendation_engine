  "description": "Book Three of the bestselling Butch Karp legal thriller series: when a murder case and a child abuse case begin to merge into one, even Karp is shocked by the evil he uncovers.\n\nButch Karp’s career prosecuting New York’s worst criminals takes a chilling turn when a series of ghastly child murders opens a window into the city’s hellish underworld. Karp and love-interest Marlene Ciampi pursue a psychopath known to his young victims as the Bogeyman, but what they find is more threatening than a lone predator. To stop the evil they unearth will take more than just courage in the courtroom; the two will need to follow a sinister trail into New York City’s darkest corners, where the law is powerless to protect them. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Robert K. Tanenbaum including rare photos from the author’s personal collection.",
