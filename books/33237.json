  "description": "H. P. Lovecraft, the creator of Cthulhu Mythos, is the acknowledged modern master of the macabre, but he also worked with many younger pulp writers. Collected here are a dozen of their experiments in arcane terror, unearthly horror, and inhuman evil. Adding his inimitable touch, Lovecraft revised these tales of terror into frightful shadows of his own unique imagination. \"Lovecraft's fiction is one of the cornerstones of modern horror.\"—Clive Barker \"H. P. Lovecraft has yet to be surpassed as the 20th century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.\"—Stephen King",
