  "description": "The Government's dossier on Jemma 7729 flags her as \"independent thinking\" of a \"rebellious nature\" exhibiting inappropriate behavior. On the day Jemma is to freely choose what she will be for the rest of her life, the state intervens and choses for her -- committed to custody without parole! But Jemma escapes, criss-crossing the country, avoiding recapture, and destroying the chemical plants used to \"alter\" women the government can't control. Jemma knows she has made the best choice of all - freedom!",
