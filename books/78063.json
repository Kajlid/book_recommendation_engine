  "description": "Following on from the success of Out of Nowhere - A History of the Military Sniper, Martin Pegler has given us an in-depth study of not only the development of the rifle, but also the parallel emergence of the American rifleman, sharpshooter and sniper. His book examines the gradual evolution of the rifle in America from the earliest firearms introduced in the 15th century, to the most recent and highly accurate sniping rifles of the 21st century.He takes and in-depth look at the technological development of the weapons, sighting systems and ammunition as well as the unique part played by the U.S. firearms industry in pioneering mass-production. Considerable use has been made of contemporary accounts in describing how the use of the rifle during the Revolutionary War, Civil War and the more recent conflicts of the 20th and 21st centuries have impacted on American military history.This detailed account concludes with a study of the American sniper in modern warfare, including Afghanistan and the ongoing Operation Iraqi Freedom and it ultimately gives a fascinating overview of the relentless march of weapons technology, as well as an unusual insight into the lives and the motives of the men who used them.",
