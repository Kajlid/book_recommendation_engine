  "description": "An instant best-seller in Canada, the first volume of The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery recorded the growing power and imagination of one of the world's best-loved writers, the author of the classic novel for children, Anne of Green Gables . The London Free Press hailed it as \"pure gold,the deeply felt, finely evocative rendering of years both heartbreakingly sad and splendidly triumphant,\" and The Montreal Gazette termed it \"one of the most haunting documents in Canadian literary history.\"The second volume promises to be equally intriguing and powerful. Ranging from 1910 to 1921, Montgomery's revealing journal documents a time of great upheaval, both in her life and in the world around her. Here she records her thoughts about the death of her rigid, intolerant grandmother, who hadruled her life so strickly...her troubled marriage to the Reverend Ewan Macdonald...the move from her beloved Prince Edward Island to a small Ontario town...her shocked reaction to the First World War...and the rewards and difficulties of being a noted writer.Spontaneous and frank, these journals are unusual for their narrative Montgomery's gifts as a storyteller are as much in evidence here as in her novels. The autobiographical content will intrigue every dedicated fan of Anne of Green Gables and the other Anne books, but the Montgomeryjournals are also interesting because they provide a unique social history and the privilege of viewing closely the life of a remarkable woman.",
