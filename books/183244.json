To repay her debt, she has served as a Siren ever since, using her voice to lure countless strangers to their deaths.

And though she can’t talk to him, they soon forge a connection neither of them can deny…and Kahlen doesn’t want to.Falling in love with a human breaks all the Ocean’s rules, and if the Ocean discovers Kahlen’s feelings, she’ll be forced to leave Akinli for good.
