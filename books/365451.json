  "title": "Addie Pray",
  "description": "Set in the darkest days of the Great Depression, Paper Moon is the story of what happens when Addie's mother is killed in a car crash, leaving her daughter in the questionable hands of Long Boy, a con-man who may or may not be her biological father. Together they set out on a rollicking journey through the Deep South, proving time and time again that no matter how much money you make, it's no fun unless you're making it with somebody you love. Brimming with humor, pathos-and an irresistible narrative energy, Paper Moon stands with To Kill a Mockingbird as one of the finest works of fiction told from a young girls point of view.",
