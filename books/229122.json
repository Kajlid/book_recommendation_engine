  "description": "Alternative cover edition of ASIN B06XC1W26SSteve wakes up after a horrible couple of weeks in which he has lost his girlfriend, his job, his savings and the majority of his self-respect with a serious hangover. Dragging himself out of bed and meandering over to the window he looks out into a courtyard full of bodies and burning shrubbery. He opts to go back to sleep and see if it all goes away. When he wakes up the next time it turns out the view from his fourth floor apartment was not a nightmare but a new reality he has to face. Armed with a blunt samurai sword and some stolen steak knives he ventures out into the fray.   These aren't the standard Zombies of Movie lore but close enough for government work. He needs someone to talk to and track what is going on so he starts a Zournal to document and try to make sense of everything...",
