  "description": "Praise for Fabulous in Flatsâ A pleasure to read. Iâ m convinced Mary T. Wagner is the reincarnation of Erma Bombeck â ¦ in sexier shoes.â  â John DeDakis, CNN Senior Copy Editor, The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer Author of Fast Track and Bluffâ Mary Wagner is a brilliant essayist who combines wit with poignancy, bravado with humility, and can write her way out of the boxes in which most mere mortals place themselves. The hilarity of real life situations in court, at home and with shoes and power tools made me laugh out loud. Ms.Wagnerâ s work is like the best, most compelling sweet treatâ ¦ you just want to keep consuming until it is goneâ .  â Richard McGinnis, editor and publisher Mindful Metropolis Magazineâ Maryâ s writing is honest, which is the best thing I think writing can be. Her humor, sincerity and attention to detail make her a writer for anyone in need of a good story. Heartfelt and witty, her pieces move to the beat of a woman who- knows marching in stilettos. Brilliant!â  â Alyson Lyon, co-producer Chicagoâ s Essay Fiestaâ Mary Wagner has an artistâ s eye for detail, a keen sense of what is meaningful in life, and an unerring ability to capture it all in wonderfully readable prose. No woman who loves or works or dreams or simply lives in the world today will fail to find something with which to connect. Wagnerâ s slice-of-life essays offer both a mirror into our own lives and a connection with a remarkable woman who, after a few paragraphs, feels like an old friend.â  â Cynthia Clampitt, Author Waltzing Australia",
