  "description": "I set off on my journey in search of a new life, a life where I could be me without the constant scrutiny of my husband, or his cameras. Could changing my identity and erasing my entire existence protect me from the one man I was afraid of? Or was belonging to him my purpose in life? I didnâ€™t know how to be me without him. How could I move on when I still longed for the things he did? Would I ever be normal?",
