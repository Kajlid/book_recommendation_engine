  "title": "Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars",
  "description": "The expulsion of Native Americans from the eastern half of the continent to the Indian Territory beyond the Mississippi River is one of the most notorious events in U.S. history and the single most controversial aspect of Andrew Jackson's presidency. Preeminent Jacksonian scholar Robert Remini now provides a thoughtful analysis of the entire story of Jackson's wars against the Indians, from his first battles with the Cherokees and Creeks to his presidential years, when he helped establish the Indian Territory in Oklahoma and, as a result, the Trail of Tears. This is at once an exuberant work of American history and a sobering reminder of the violence and darkness at the heart of our nation's past.  \"Vividly written and often harrowing . . . Remini recounts Jackson's exploits . . . with riveting narrative prose.\" (Michael Holt, Chicago Tribune)  \"When it comes to Jackson . . . there are few who have such a masterly command of the sources as Mr. Remini [who] kept me up late at night reading and causing me to wonder why, with narrative history such as this, anyone bothers to read historical novels.\" (Roger D. McGrath, The Wall Street Journal)",
