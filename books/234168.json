  "description": "On prom night, Dylan Anderson caused the biggest humiliation of Sadie Post's life. Getting over her crush on him took a while, but now she's grown up and moved on. Until Dylan moves into her workplace, that is. Suddenly it's high school revisitedcomplete with her lustful thoughts about him. But she's his boss and finally has the upper handshe won't let her sexy fantasies change that. Too bad the tension spiking between them is so high, it's inevitable they hit the sheetsor the nearest desk. And once they do, Dylan is better than she'd ever imagined. She promised herself to leave him begging for morebut does she really want to?",
