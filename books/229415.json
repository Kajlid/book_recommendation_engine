  "title": "Revenger",
  "description": "From the celebrated author of the popular Yakima Henry novels, a new western adventure series...After the War Between the States, the former Confederate Mike Sartain came west and joined the frontier cavalry. Wounded by Apaches in Arizona, he was nursed back to health by an old desert rat and his beautiful granddaughter, Jewel. When the prospector and Jewel were viciously murdered by marauding Yankees, Sartain hunted the soldiers down and killed them in his own fierce Cajun style, for Jewel had been carrying Sartain’s unborn child. That’s how Mike Sartain’s lust for revenge got started. That’s how he became a wanted man, with a dead-or-alive price on his head. Now, with no choice but to keep on riding, The Revenger rides for anyone who has an ax to grind.",
