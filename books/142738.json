  "description": "Jeremy Stonehart is a cruel, vindictive man. He wants me to submit. He wants me to give in. I will never give in. I will never yield. No matter what he subjects me to, I will always fight. I will not forget my resolve. Let Stonehart think me broken. I am not so easily deterred as that. No matter what he puts me through, I will always remember my own strength. I will always remember that in the end, I have control of the one thing he really wants: My mind. I will never give him that. I will resist.",
