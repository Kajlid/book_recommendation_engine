  "description": "The archangel, Raphael, sacrificed everything he had and everything he was to save Lauren Sutton, but to what end? She won't even tolerate his kindness, let alone his love, but Raphael's heart is as lost to him as his rank of celestial authority. Reassigned as Lauren's new guardian, Raphael soon realizes Lauren needs to learn to love herself if she's ever going to accept his love and love him in return. Raphael's got nothing else to lose at this point, but with a woman as haunted by failure and loss as Lauren is, her new guardian begins to doubt he has power left for even that. Lauren Sutton has been given a second chance: at life and at true love, but the glorious path that's been suddenly placed before her seems too good to be true. After all, nothing ever goes right for her, especially love. She's not na√Øve. Not anymore, anyway, but it's hard to stay jaded when a man as fine as Drake Jacobson, Lauren's new, self-appointed life coach, keeps whispering, \"trust me\", in her ear. Soon, Lauren realizes she's going to live and she's going to fall in love...whether she wants to or not.",
