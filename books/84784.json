It is my hope that this book, like the bluebird's song of happiness, will bring cheer and joy to your life. --Vicky Howard, introduction* Vicky Howard's collection of antique bird art--nearly all pieces over 100 years old--is used here to adorn her lovely message about what is really important in our pursuit of happiness.Vicky Howard is a successful and recognizable name in the gift market.Using art from her private collection of vintage postcards, Howard presents avian images alongside positive-minded quotes from the early 1900s. While the creative elements of this book recall an early era, the art remains vivid and the words decidedly * You cannot always have happiness, but you can give happiness. --Proverb* The art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things. --Henry Ward Beecher",
