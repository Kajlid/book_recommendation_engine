  "description": "Jesse Monroe has lived a rough life, but he’s always enjoyed being his own man and making his own way in the world. His bar on the edge of Rue Pack territory is the perfect place for him, a living and a place of his own making. He’s an old wolf, he’s seen a few things in his years on this earth and he wonders when his mate will come. He may be a solitary man, but he would love to share his life with his forever mate. Checking the parking lot of his bar for any drunks who didn’t quite make it home, he finds a man beaten and unconscious. That man is his mate Andrei Toma. Andrei comes with his own set of baggage, but all Jesse can think about is protecting and healing his love. There may not be a lot of room in Jesse’s life, but he will gladly make some for his forever love.  Andrei Toma is a black cat with a few powers and not a lot of common sense. He’s gotten on the bad side of some rough people and needs to lay low for awhile until the heat wears off. He never thought he’d find his mate in the process. Jesse is everything Andrei has ever wanted in a man and he’s more than ready to be claimed by the rough wolf, but first he has to survive the ramifications of past mistakes. Can they outlast it all?",
