  "title": "Stick It Up Your Punter!: The Uncut Story of the Sun Newspaper",
  "description": "The SUN is more than a newspaper. It is, in its own words, a phenomenon - the biggest-selling daily paper in the English language, fascinating 12 million readers and making its owner, Rupert Murdoch, a profit of over 1 million a week. The SUN has unashamedly dragged journalistic standards into the gutter. This book takes you inside the machine to tell in graphic and often hilarious detail the story of how the paper has evolved from cashing in on the permissive society of the sixties, to helping Maggie win the election in 1979, to the world of foul-mouthed Kelvin MacKenzie to the present day.",
