Point is, I don’t discriminate.What do I get out of it? Knowledge. I want to be prepared, adept, and ready.I might find the perfect woman for me today or a few years from now, but I won’t stop until I do. Then when The One comes along, I’ll be ready to go the distance.Ready to go all the way.I’m Cord Taylor, and, lady of my dreams, I’m coming for you.",
