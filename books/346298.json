  "description": "Lou Reed led the revolution in rock music that would grow into such different forms as glam and punk rock, and introduced such taboo subjects as drugs and aberrant sexuality into the American pop song. This first full biography of the chameleon-like figure who has continually revised and reinvented himself probes beneath the myths and contradictions of Reed's life to set the record straight.",
