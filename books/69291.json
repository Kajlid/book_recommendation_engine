  "description": "*New edition expanded by 22k and re-released* Tucker might be a submissive lupe, but he’s far from capable of keeping his mouth shut. Combine that with the fact that his pheromones have gone crazy since he first began shifting at twenty, and the last six months have been hell for him. But Tucker’s alpha can’t handle the disruption anymore. On his own, Tucker heads south, trying to find the unclaimed territory Shane mentioned where he can just be himself. Except Shane was lying. The territory isn’t unclaimed. Worse, it’s the home of the Pricolici—the oldest haitas in the United States—and the Hunters. The boogie men of all lupes, the ancient wolves of the Pricolici enforce the peace and ensure their existence is kept a secret, and they won’t hesitate to kill if someone calls too much attention to themselves. Tucker immediately runs into Stelian, the alpha of the Pricolici. He doesn’t know what to expect, other than contempt for his submissive wolf nature, but the last thing he expects to hear is that he isn’t a wolf at all! But he has no idea what a hultan is, much less how to learn control of the magic Stelian insists he has. And finding a mate? No way.When the haitas that took him in comes under attack, Tucker must fight back with everything he can… and even that might not be enough.",
