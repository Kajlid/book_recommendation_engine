  "description": "Crow knows exactly where I am—but he hasn’t come for me.When I saw my chance to run, I took it and returned to New York City. I live in my old apartment, got my old job back, and do my best to pretend Crow Barsetti never existed. I looked him in the eye and told him I loved him—and he ignored me.I accept the relationship is over when he doesn’t call for several weeks, but when I walk into my apartment and spot the buttons sitting on the counter, I realize I’m wrong. Crow has come for me—and he wants me to know it.When we finally come face to face, I expect a groveling apology and a declaration of love, but I get neither. Crow wants me to return to Tuscany with him, and as much as I miss my old life, I refuse. Not unless he gives me everything I want. I want commitment instead of buttons. I want love instead of lust. I want a husband and children, someday.And I want it with him.Pick up this installment of this dark romance bestseller 2023 now by clicking the BUY NOW button at the top of this page.
