  "description": "I'm not a nice guy.  And so far, that's working out really f*cking well for me.  In hockey, the enforcer is a not an officially sanctioned position. But everyone knows what he does. And everyone knows what I do. I'm Ian Carter after all. I'm a big, bad bully both on and off the rink. My fans know it, and I know it too.  Until I meet her.  Candace Hunter. My sweet piece of Candy. She's the got the face of an angel and a body made for sin, but more than that, she sees something in me. Something that makes me wonder if I'm more than my reputation. She forces me to be a better man.  But there are other forces out there too. People who want to hurt us, people who want to drive us apart.  I'm not going to let them win.  Nice guys finish last. Ian Carter comes in first.  For a limited time, enjoy my complete Sons of Steel Motorcycle Club series as a special bonus! FOUR complete novels included!",
