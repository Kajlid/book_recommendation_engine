Finally settling down near the Smooth Rock Falls werewolf pack as a lone wolf, he feels he may actually have a chance at protecting the secret he’s been carrying with him.  Trevor Armstrong is still recovering from half a year of horror. The last thing he wants is to be under the influence of another alpha.
