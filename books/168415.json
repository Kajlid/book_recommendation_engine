  "title": "Thugness is a Virtue",
  "description": "Hannah Wehr presents a bleak, scorchingly funny, to-the-bone account of her first year working in a juvenile detention center. Ostensibly about her teaching experiences, the book is also a stinging indictment of the entire juvenile prison system that repeatedly fails young inmates. Hannah makes compelling arguments for stripping down, re-defining and re-organizing the system. Read these young studentsâ€™ stories. Hear their voices. Be prepared for your heart to be broken and filled and broken and filled again. Hannah Wehr writes from the hip: an unsentimental, direct, clear and essential voice.",
