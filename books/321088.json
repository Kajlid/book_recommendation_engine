  "title": "I, Judas",
  "description": "Judas, the myth, history's arch betrayer who sold his Lord for thirty pieces of silver and stands for all time as a figure to be rejected and reviled; Judas, the man, son of wealth and power, a young rebel, a disciple who fought to suppress the lusts of his flesh and hot-blooded pride to follow Jesus, and who became the victim of a monstrously diabilical lie when he committed the act that damned him in the eyes of the world; now the man and not the myth comes alive in the most startling and spellbinding retelling of the greatest story ever told: the ultimate triumph of the novelist who has thrilled countless millions with her magic.",
