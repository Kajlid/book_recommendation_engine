  "description": "The Secret Service task force must find out who the bad guys are and end their spree of murder and mayhem across the nation. The culprits are well funded and seem unstoppable. Surprises and twists to the story abound in this action adventure crime tome.Chapter 1     \"Now, what was that you were saying about why you're here in my town tonight,\" the bleary eyed youth asked, \"because you know I'm in a mood to hurt you...right.\" The youth pulled his long blade, folding knife from his hip pocket. He opened the knife as if he did so according to a practiced ritual. The opening seemed obscene in the method used by the youth, one-step from a display in erotic attraction.     The Agent stared at the glistening blade. He nodded and gave as much effort at pulling the bonds around his wrists as he could with his rapidly fading strength, \"Yeah,\" the agent nodded, \"So are you going to talk me to death or put me out of misery at having to listen to you...you asshole?\"     \"You're talking your life away, I'm warning you for the last time, and it doesn't have to be this way. Now tell me what I want to know and I will make it easy on you. I can make death come as if you were just falling asleep. Painless in death as painless can be. That is what anyone would say about how you died if anyone knew about it. Wouldn't that be a whole lot better than a lot of suffering I'll make you experience if you don't tell me what I want to know?\"",
