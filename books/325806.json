  "description": "This novel is unlike any love story you've ever read. Set in Japan and East Africa, it is based on real events. The people of Japan might be the most innocent and trusting in the world. Sadly, this makes them easy prey for sinister and unscrupulous con artists. All we need is love? Not quite. Without honest and basic decency in the mix, love can be very risky business.",
