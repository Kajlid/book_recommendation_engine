  "title": "The Day Immanuel Kant was Late: Philosophical Fables, Pious Tales, and Other Stories",
  "description": "A flower who prostitutes herself, a physicist who graphs his aspirations, a devil who goes to confession, a goat a bender, a bee, a woman who marries a man she barely notices -- the 14 stories in The Day Immanuel Kant was Late spread in all directions, from intimate family studies across generations to mysticism and philosophical fables on life and death. Alternately satirical and pious, hilarious and serious, J. Mulrooney covers heaven, hell, and everything in between.",
