A warm, comfortable place to sleep and people to flirt with and entertain was her life’s ambition, the occasional lie or thirty to achieve that wasn’t a problem.

Left at the mercy of the handsome bar owner Rustek, who is and has, everything she has ever wanted, makes hiding her identity even more important.
