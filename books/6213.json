  "description": "Drake Glauco and Vernon are about to embark on their biggest adventure yet. They must get the information they need to help complete a new super weapon, a Solar Sound Tunnel, and fast. A weapon that will hopefully tip the balance of power to their side, able to destroy the awesome and impenetrable Citadels of Justice without risking too many more lives. Unfortunately, four years have passed, and the war against the Herdsmen isn’t going well. What’s more, Priaxia has been destroyed…completely and utterly. The once great empire of the spiders now over. Humanity is their only hope. Something the Herdsmen know, stopping at nothing as they cast their gaze toward Earth and galaxy wide victory. Against the backdrop of a war that seems lost by the alliance of spiders and mammals a new hope will rise, and from an unexpected source, too. Will Drake and Vernon be able to complete their latest mission to get the information they need for the weapon before the Herdsmen catch wind of their plans? Or will the hatchlings, now ready to be born, put things into a spin? It all becomes a race against time as the final chapter of the Borders of Worlds Saga comes to a close. Will humanity and Prixia endure? Or will the Herdsmen wipe out all in their path?",
