  "description": "**Strong Language**Explicit Sex**Intense situations *This is Shea's POV. CANNOT BE READ AS A STAND-ALONE! I waited my entire life for one singular moment. Everything I had endured—all the pain and suffering—I would go through it all again, if I knew she was waiting for me.  Ryan Chase was the only woman I ever loved. My obsession. My desire.  When she came home . . . loving her hadn't been easy. The road to our particular happiness was paved with boulders. I became who she needed me to be. Who she wanted. Marriage and children— they were a dream we both shared. Until a nightmare threatened to take it all away.  Is love supposed to be this hard? How long before the person I'm pretending to be begins to crack? I'm a liar. A fraud. He is surfacing.  She's the only reason I survived. I lived. She is the reason I breathe. Now, when she needs me the most—I'm transforming into the person I thought I'd buried years before.  I can't be without her. She gives me purpose and makes me whole. Nevertheless, the universe chose a different route. God had a different plan. And right now, I'm pissed at them both",
