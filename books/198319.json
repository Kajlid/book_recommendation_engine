  "description": "Sun Ra, a.k.a. Herman Poole \"Sonny\" Blount (1914â€“1993), has been hailed as \"one of the great big-band leaders, pianists, and surrealists of jazz\" (New York Times) and as \"the missing link between Duke Ellington and Public Enemy\" (Rolling Stone). Composer, keyboardist, bandleader, philosopher, poet, and self-proclaimed extraterrestrial from Saturn, Sun Ra led his \"Intergalactic Arkestra\" of thirty-plus musicians in a career that ranged from boogie-woogie and swing to be-bop, free jazz, fusion, and New Age music. This definitive biography reveals the life, philosophy, and musical growth of one of the twentieth century's greatest avant-garde musicians.",
