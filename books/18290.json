  "description": "If you've ever gotten wrapped up in the arcana of “E.R.” or “House,” or been absorbed by a piece in The New Yorker by Gawande, Groopman, or Nuland, or sat on that exam table wondering what's really going on in your doctor's head, then this book is for you.Expertise versus commonsense practice; moral judgments on young patients or their parents; asking tough questions; death and physician-assisted suicide; daily life with a doctor's job (yours or a family member's); doctors as patients-Klass addresses the primary issues in the life of any doctor and, by extension, the lives of those forwhom they care. Perri Klass, M.D., is a writer, teacher, pediatrician, and mentor. In her frequent contributions to the New York Times , she takes on a host of issues particular to the life of a doctor-secrecy, ethics, fear, grief, and competition-with a warmth and wit her readers have come to love. Now, in the newest addition to Basic's ART OF MENTORING SERIES, she offers her guidance, and her stories, to a new generation of doctors and readers.",
