  "description": "When Dr. Chloe Maddox leaves her life in LA to join the Boston Police Department, she wants nothing more than a fresh start, even if she does rebuff the friendly advances of her colleagues and spends her nights alone. She seems to be succeeding until the man who murdered her fianceé and left her for dead turns up at the precinct in connection with another case, and she must face the past she can’t outrun. Detective Dana Blake uncovers Chloe’s secret and convinces her to testify against the dangerous psychopath. When he is released on bail, Dana and Chloe take temporary refuge in a safe house where Chloe tries to keep her distance despite their undeniable attraction. Forced to flee, they soon find themselves running from a serial killer intent on recapturing his prey. Except this time, he has his eye on Dana, too.Cover Artist: Tammy SedickGenres: Intrigue & Thriller / Romance",
