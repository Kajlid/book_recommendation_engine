  "description": "A soul bleeds when it's put through pain. Like sap from a broken tree limb... Tears and suffering form, charring to Ash hidden deep within. It spreads out inside with nowhere to go. My past is a nightmare I can't run from. It follows me, touches me inside the darkness of the long cold lonely nights when the neon sign turns off and the music dies. I'm left with nothing but chaotic thoughts bound tight around my ribcage, taking the air inside my lungs. Deadly obsessions become a violent game of cat and mouse hide and seek. A story so familiar but yet so unique. His eyes hurt me. His touch can freeze my soul. I can't seem to escape. Until him… The owner of the club I work at. The Mafia Boss of the underworld. A man that's so dangerous chaos follows. I fall unexpectedly into his arms on that dark, gray, rainy night. He takes me as his wife. Now it's my new husband who is the villain in my new life… with love being the deadliest lie of all.Trigger Warning:This Story is for readers 18 years and upwards due to Sex Violence and Dark Themes. It also deals with issues that some may find difficult to read and may cause distress. There is also coarse language throughout.",
