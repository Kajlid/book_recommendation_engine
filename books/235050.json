He reminds us that the common interests of the U.S. and China far outweigh the differences.” 2) Ross Rojek, San Francisco Book Review, “Our civilization's future depends on finding shared common values between the great nations, especially China and the U.S. This book provides a framework for how that can be achieved.”. 3) Susan Keefe, Midwest Book Review, “Dr. Westman shows how the U.S. and China hold the keys to the future of the condition of mankind and the health of the planet.
