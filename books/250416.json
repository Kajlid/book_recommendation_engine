  "description": "In the world of Tokyo Ghoul, sometimes the only way to fight monsters is to become one…The Commission of Counter Ghoul is the only organization fighting the Ghoul menace, and they will use every tool at their disposal to protect humanity from its ultimate predator. Their newest weapon in this hidden war is an experimental procedure that implants human investigators with a Ghoul’s Kagune, giving them Ghoul powers and abilities. But both the procedure and the newly formed Qs Squad are untested. Will they become heroes…or monsters?!Sen Takatsuki’s newest novel has hit the stands and a video of her admitting to being a Ghoul has gone viral! And if that news hasn’t done enough to shake things up, the contents of her book are sowing civilian distrust of the CCG. How can investigators effectively take on the Ghoul threat if the public has lost faith in them? And what if Sen Takatsuki’s veiled accusations about the CCG brass are true…?",
