  "description": "From New York Times bestseller Lexi Ryan comes a sexy new standalone romance in the bestselling Boys of Jackson Harbor series. Meet single dad Easton Connor as he leaves the NFL and returns to Jackson Harbor to fight for another chance with the love of his life.***I don’t regret much. Not my decision to enter the NFL draft before finishing college. Not fighting custody of my daughter—even if, biologically speaking, it turns out she’s not mine. And certainly not seducing my buddy’s little sister ten years ago. But when it comes to Shayleigh Jackson, my no-regrets attitude stops there. I screwed up royally where she’s concerned. Then I made another mistake when I let her shut me out of her life. Now after more than a decade living in different time zones, I’m coming home to Jackson Harbor. My first priority is getting my daughter away from the media circus in LA, but the moment I see Shay, I know I’ll stop at nothing to win her back.So what if she won’t speak to me? So what if she’s changed? So what if she’s fallen for some douchebag professor? I’ve never gotten over her and I know she feels the same about me. I’ve let her go twice. I won’t make that mistake again.If It's Only Love and all other books in this series can be read as standalones, but you'll enjoy reading them together.The Boys of Jackson Harbor1 - The Wrong Kind of Love (Ethan’s story)2 - Straight Up Love (Jake’s story)3 - Dirty, Reckless Love (Levi’s story)4 - Wrapped in Love (Brayden’s story)5 - Crazy for Your Love (Carter’s story)6 - If It’s Only Love (Shay’s story)",
