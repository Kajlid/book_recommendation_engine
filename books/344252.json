  "description": "Jillian Perry has been found dead in the woods, leaving behind a husband of three weeks and a young daughter. Her body shows no visible marks, and the autopsy reveals no sign of foul play. Apparently it was a suicide—Jillian purposely wandered into the forest and succumbed to the freezing weather. But something doesn't feel right to forensic investigator Theresa MacLean, and she can't let it go.Still emotionally shattered by a devastating loss months ago, Theresa focuses all her attention on the case—one that gets stranger with the appearance of the dead woman's ex-boyfriend seeking custody of Jillian's little girl. Every twist the investigation takes raises the stakes lethally higher. And unless Theresa can find evidence of murder—evidence that doesn't seem to exist—someone may soon share Jillian's ghastly fate.",
