  "description": "Things are so bad, I feel like I'm going to explode if I don't do something...\nEveryone has to keep a journal in Mrs. Dunphrey's English class, but the teacher has promised she won't read any entry marked \"Do not read this.\" It's the kind of assignment Tish Bonner, one of the girls with big hair who sit in the back row, usually wouldn't take very seriously. But right now, Tish desperately needs someone to talk to, even if it's only a notebook she doesn't dare let anyone read.As Tish's life spins out of control, the entries in her journal become more and more private...and dangerous. Is she risking everything that matters to her by putting the truth on paper? And is she risking more by keeping silent?",
