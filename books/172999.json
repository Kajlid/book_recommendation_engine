For the full list of planned tropes, visit Lola's blog.  Trope for Georgia Heat: the sexy police officer and/or mechanic with a heart of gold.  Word count: 50,000  Steve Mitchell wants one thing in life—a fresh start. After years spent as an NYPD cop, in a marriage with a woman whose mental health tore their family to pieces, he takes his son back home to Fairfield, Georgia. There he plans to put in a good performance as a Fairfield police officer, settle into a stress-free life, and do right by his son.  What he doesn't count on is Daniel Jackson, the local car mechanic, a man with startling blue eyes and the kind of southern charm that melts Steve's heart. He falls for Daniel quicker than he ever thought possible, and being with him reignites a part of Steve he thought had died the day he left his wife. But it also brings up past nightmares—the kind he moved out of New York to protect his son from.",
