  "description": "Walk (A Gentry Boys Story)*COMING MAY 24*“I wanted him to know that I really saw who he was; not just some tortured ex-con trying to beat back his demons and figure out his place in the world. Stone Gentry was beautiful. He was a man I could fall for …if he let me.” 1513 ….The number of single lines you carefully scratched on a piece of college ruled notebook paper at each sunrise. 1513…The number of days you passed in a locked cage, surrounded by fierce men who did things even worse than what you did. 1513…The number of nights spent staring at the ceiling praying for just five minutes of freedom to talk to your brother. The brother you love more than anyone on earth. The brother who hates you even more than he hates himself.  1…The number of moments it took for a tragedy to unfold and change lives, end lives, destroy lives.1…The number that represents isolation, a loneliness worse than any prison sentence. 1…The number of girls who show up in your life and try to crack through the iron shield you’ve built around your heart these past four years. One girl and her name is Evie. Beautiful. Stubborn. Passionate. You know that if you had any honor you wouldn’t take her. But honor might be something you lost a long time ago.",
