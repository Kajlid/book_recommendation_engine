She wants to take it slow. He needs her now, in his life and in his bed.  Nick’s enemies threaten her career, her friendships, even her sanity, but not Shae’s heart - the one thing Nick holds precious. He proves his love is real, and she stops running. Until everything around them falls apart, including him. He swore he would never hurt her. Instead, he almost destroys them both. Shae makes a dangerous choice, sacrificing her happiness for his, just like he always does for her.  Now that she’s found her own voice, can Shae survive the challenges of living in Nick’s world?",
