  "description": "SQUEEZE PLAY is the first in a steamy new series of romances featuring a hunky baseball team and the sirens who challenge the players in the game of love.Risk Kincaid was finding out that the life of a pro baseball player wasn't all it was cracked up to be. The fame, the fortune, the fans--what good were they when he kept striking out with the one woman who really mattered to him? Jacy Grayson was sassy and spirited, but she only saw him as her rebound lover--the man who picked up the pieces when her heart was broken. Yet Risk had never stepped down from the plate before, and he certainly wasn't going to start now. The bases were loaded --all Risk needed to do was show her that the diamond he had in mind wasn't found on a baseball field.",
