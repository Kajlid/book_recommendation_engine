  "description": "Running across the rooftops, his brown flak jacket pulled and buttoned tight to keep the extra ‎trauma plates in place, Daniel grit his teeth as his cheeks seemed to stretch and harden against the ‎New York evening’s winter chill while the pops of sparks and the cuts of the ricocheting bullets ‎pelted his legs and face. This is how Sol War veteran Daniel Rooke began his work shift… ‎ It has been eight years since the end of the first intergalactic war and the tensions between the ‎normal human population and a growing breed of superhuman veterans from the war called ‎Specials is growing. Detective Daniel Rooke has carved out a fast track career in the New York ‎Police Department using his training from the war to catapult himself into ever-higher ranks when ‎he is tapped on the shoulder to lead a Federal Task Force comprised of Specials who do not ‎know him, and do not trust him. Their mission is to track other Specials breaking Local and ‎Federal laws and to make arrests with the world watching. The question what will the team ‎become? Will it rise to the calling, or fail and disband before Daniel can see his vision come to ‎fruition? ‎",
