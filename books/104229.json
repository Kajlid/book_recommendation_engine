When a deadly new virus emerges in the Congo river basin of central Africa, Dr. Peter Barry must lead an elite military recon team deep into the heart of the rain forest in a desperate race against time to discover the source of the virus. Each step closer to their goal brings new revelations about the virus, themselves, and the unimaginable fact that zombies are real.",
