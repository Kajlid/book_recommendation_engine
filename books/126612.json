  "description": "A lively story about dying, a mind-bending thriller and a pitch-black comedy. \"The message is why you keep the gun under your pillow. Everyday you become more accustomed to the lump. You are glad when you survive your sneezes. But one time, a cough destroys the lamp on the nightstand.\" You are a nobody, just another somebody. So why does an odd stranger approach you one day with a peculiar and ominous message? Is it a misunderstanding? A warning? A dire threat? The world seems as normal as ever, so why can you not shake the feeling that you are now locked in a dark countdown to your own horrific doom?",
