  "title": "Achieving for Nothing",
  "description": "The life story of a university lecturer, PhD, officer, and black belt who keeps achieving goal after goal and still feels as lost and empty of deep vital meaning as when he was a child. An honest reflection and description of my life as a human being, and the things I have lived and learned so far. If you keep overcoming challenges but don't feel any real victory after that, we are in the same scenario you and I. I hope my experiences help you realize you are not alone in this.",
