  "description": "Bridget O'Shea had sworn she'd never fall in love again. She had a hotel, The Black Swan, to operate alone, since her sisters--Catherine and Alice--had both married the previous year. And then there was Ella, her lovely baby daughter. The hotel and Ella took up all her time and energy. Wyatt Ferguson had planned on staying in Huttig, Arkansas, just long enough to wait for the next train going south. But a red-haired lady who thought he was another out-of-work soldier just home from the war insisted on hiring him to kill a rat for her. The Black Swan seemed a good place to stay for a while. After all it was only for six weeks and what could happen in that time?",
