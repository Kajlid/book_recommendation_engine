The young vampire hunter was taught to hate his enemy with a passion, and hating them is easy since they killed his entire family. His attraction to Bane, a gorgeous, mysterious vampire, contradicts everything Tinder believes in, but the heat between them is undeniable. As the vampires rise up and hunters become the hunted, Bane may also be Tinder’s only chance for survival. Maybe the world’s not so black and white after all.
