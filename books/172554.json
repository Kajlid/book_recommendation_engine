Christopher, raised from the dead and promoted to a moderate rank, takes command of the army regiment he trained and equipped.

Guns and fortifications turn back the horde, but Christopher has other problems that cannot be solved with mere a wicked assassin; hostile clergymen; dubious allies including a bard, Lalania, with a connection to a mysterious group of scholars; and worst of all his own impolitic tongue. But all of these pale into mere distractions once he discovers the true an invisible, mind-eating horror who plays the kingdom like a puppet-masterâ€™s stage. Lalania claims she can help--but will it be enough?",
