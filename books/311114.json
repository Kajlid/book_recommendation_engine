  "description": "All theater romances are tragedies. Ella Blythe knows this. Still, she cannot help but hope her own story may turn out different than most--and certainly different than the tragic story of the Ghost of Craven Street Theater. Yet as she struggles to maintain her tenuous place in the ever-shrinking ballet company, win the attentions of principal dancer Philippe, and avoid company flirt Jack, Ella cannot deny the uncanny feeling that her life is mirroring that of the dead ballerina.Is she dancing ever closer to the edge of her own tragic end? Or will the secrets that are about to come to light offer release from the past?Mystery and romance make the perfect dance partners in this evocative story from fan-favorite Joanna Davidson Politano.",
