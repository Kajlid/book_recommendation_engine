But he's never seemed to notice Reena exists until one day, impossibly, he does. The two fall in messy, complicated love—but then Sawyer disappears from their humid Florida town without a word, leaving a devastated—and pregnant—Reena behind.Three years later there's a new love in Reena's life: her daughter, Hannah. Reena's gotten used to being without Sawyer, and she's finally getting the hang of this strange, unexpected life. But just as suddenly as he disappeared Sawyer returns. Reena doesn't want anything to do with him, though she'd be lying if she said his being back wasn't stirring something in her. After everything that's happened, can Reena let herself love Sawyer LeGrande again?",
