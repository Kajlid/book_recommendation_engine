More trouble.\nThe secrets swirling around Carrefour are deepening, and the lies are more tangled than ever as Eveny discovers the truth about her past.It’s only been a couple of months since Eveny Cheval discovered that she’s a powerful queen of zandara, the voodoo-like form of magic that has controlled the town of Carrefour for generations.

Now, she’s torn between two magical traditions – and two guys: mysterious Caleb, who’s pushing her away, and charismatic Bram, who seems too good to be true.With Main de Lumière closing in and Carrefour’s defenses crumbling, Eveny, her sister queens, and the townspeople she’s supposed to protect are in danger. And as the revelations about her past continue pouring in, Eveny begins to realize that she might just be the only one who can save them all. Now, she has to fight for the people and the town she loves – and for her own life.Welcome to Carrefour, where long-buried secrets simmer like heat over the bayou and whatever you desire most can be yours—for a price.",
