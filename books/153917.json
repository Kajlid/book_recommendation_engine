  "description": "If his hangover doesn't kill him the undead just might. At 20,000 words this is the first novella in the Metropolitan Zombie Survivors series. The ending completes the story of Boston but there is always a tomorrow...Pat-O is unemployed and out of shape with a face that makes even his mother wonder what happened to him. At least according to the girl he spent last night with. He feels bad about not remembering her name, but when he tries to turn her anger and the future of his lucky T-shirt into a meet cute on the sidewalk of Beacon Street things start to get ugly. Zombies have besieged the city of Boston and in order to survive Pat-O has to put his fate in the hands of his friend Tucker who may be insane, and the information Tucker’s gathered through the less than reliable network of contacts he has as a follower of a local sports blog. Pat-O needs to get across town before the government will allegedly drop nuclear weapons to stem the tide of undead. Protecting himself with armor made from drained wine boxes and duct tape while using a broken souvenir hockey stick as a weapon Pat-O walks, jogs and sweats his way to Tucker in Cleveland Circle. Their buddy ‘Cupcake’ has stolen a Humvee from the National Guard and will pick them up there before getting out of town - ASAP. Metropolitan Zombie Survivors are courageous, creative and lucky. Pat-O and his friends are not trained for survival and have little to no experience with guns. They survive by banding together and balancing their instincts with scrappiness and a hint of intellect.",
