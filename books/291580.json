Gabriel Legend is unlike any other man I’ve ever met.  He came into my life like a hurricane, shattering all my assumptions and preconceived notions.  I wasn’t prepared for him. I wasn’t prepared for any of it.  But life doesn’t wait until you’re ready. Whatever happens next, I know one thing for certain.  I will never be the same Scarlett I was before I met him.  House of Scarlett is the second book in the Legend Trilogy and should be read after The Fall of Legend, book one in the utterly addictive Legend Trilogy.",
