  "description": "Maggie McCoy, best selling author of romance, went to the Florida Keys for a much needed getaway to break the writer's block that was threatening her success. Her plans to be alone died the moment she met Jake Hatfield. He wound up to be too much of a distraction for serious minded Maggie.She had never let her hair down before, but when she finally decides to, it leads her on a motorcycle ride through the land of paradise, an adventure at a full moon party and other trials as well. All she wanted to do was to create a best seller, not live it. There were never any plans to fall for a hot, sexy man in the middle of nowhere.What Tomorrow Brings is a lighthearted, clean romance with a little spice set in a tropical paradise like no other, the Florida Keys.",
