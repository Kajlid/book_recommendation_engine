Only Serena is not just his undead best friend’s girl—Steven has had a secret crush on Serena for almost as long as he’s known her, doing everything in his power to hide it from his buddy while he was alive.And now, at the horrible price of losing his best friend, he has a chance to be with her. But would Serena ever give him a chance, given their circumstances?NB - The Expanded Edition includes a prologue, additional Part One scenes, and a whole new section (Part Two).",
