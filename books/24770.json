  "description": "Will Billie Jean find true love and happiness? All her life, Billie Jean Sloane, a charismatic, exquisite, small-town beauty, has been desired and spoiled by men. At sixteen, following a tragedy involving her first husband--\"the love of her life\"--she is heartbroken. Unable to forgive or forget, her parents take drastic measures to keep them apart. The vain, yet innocent, Billie Jean--one of seven siblings--is swept from her humble beginnings at 1106 Grand Boulevard in the Midwestern town of Hamilton, Ohio to a luxurious life-style in Phoenix, Arizona and other fascinating locales... through a World War II marriage and a Mafia scare in Sacramento, California... to vicious seduction at Lake Tahoe... to the fabulous wealth of the \"San Francisco Sinclairs,\" real estate and jewelry tycoons. Then back to her hometown to search for her first husband. This story takes you through Billie Jean's seven marriages and sixty-four years--1933 to 1997--of happiness and tragedy. Always searching for her first love and her childhood, the enchanting child/woman captivates many men along the way, each wealthier than the one before ... each sending her scurrying back to 1106 Grand Boulevard, a trail of broken hearts in her wake. 1106 Grand Boulevard is the story of passions that last a lifetime; of family love and betrayal; of spousal abuse and sadistic child abuse; a story of Billie Jean's desperate search for happiness, self-worth, and maturity ... a story of people needing people and people using people.",
