  "description": "This account of London in the medieval period considers the city as the centre of politics, finance, trade and government in England. It describes up-to-date archaeological discoveries that throw new light onto the history of the medieval capital. Excavation has revealed much about the layout, architecture and fabric of the city, and it has provided intimate evidence of the daily lives of ordinary Londoners. The text is a summary of the mass of archaeological evidence that has been discovered since the 1970s. It offers an introduction to the fabric and structure of the ancient city, and it gives us an insight into the lives of medieval Londoners.",
