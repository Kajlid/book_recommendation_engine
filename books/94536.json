  "description": "This is not the story of how America fell apart; it is the story of how it pulled back from the brink at a heavy cost. Randall Quinn saved the people by killing democracy, and while everyone else is enjoying the booming economy and free rides to college, 16-year-old Lacan Branford is stolen from her family and tossed into a secret prison. She becomes part of Quinnâ€™s nanotechnology experiments designed to create Nanotechs, the ultimate weapons of national security. But she is not alone.Lacan meets Chloe, a girl who has been locked up longer than most and lost a little of her sanity along the way. She also finds Alex, a classmate she did not really know aside from her flirty reputation. And then there are the other girls they just try to avoid. They are three against a hundred.Their families think they are dead and they have no chance of escape. Their only choice is to serve Quinn and preserve the new order he has created. Fortunately for Lacan, she met someone who says he will help her do just that. All she has to do is survive his training.Sooner or later, they all have to prove their worth.",
