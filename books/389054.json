  "description": "Momoko is a Lolita, devoted to French Rococo, 18th century fashion, Vivienne Westwood shoes and embroidery. Ichigo is a Yanki whose loyalty to her moped—and her all-girl biker gang—borders on the fanatic. What could possibly bring these two outsiders with incredibly different personalities together amongst the rice paddies of rural Japan? Is it possible for a Yanki and a Lolita to coexist without copious amounts of bloodshed? Or are Ichigo and Momoko fated to form a bond that will transcend the boundaries of fashion and logic?A cult classic in Japan, Novala Takemoto's wildly entertaining Kamikaze Girls is also the inspiration for an internationally acclaimed film of the same name.",
