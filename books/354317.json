  "description": "The Battle of Britain pilots of World War II are revered and eulogized for their courage and heroic defense of their nation. It is one thing to do battle with the enemy on equal terms, with a well equipped fighting machine, quite another to face that same enemy on a hostile ocean with little or no means to defend against an enemy attack. The unsung heroes of the Fourth Service, the Merchant Navy, have received scant recognition for their Battle of Britain --- the contribution they made to keeping Britain's ocean life-lines open. THIS IS THEIR STORY.",
