  "description": "Inspiring and stimulating discussions on the interplay between scientific and religious inquiry, featuring some of today's greatest thinkers  Drawn from American Public Media's Peabody Award-winning program \"Speaking of Faith,\" the conversations in this profoundly illuminating book reach for a place too rarely explored in our ongoing exchange of ideas-the nexus of science and spirituality. In fascinating interviews with such luminaries as Freeman Dyson, Paul Davies, V. V. Raman, Sherwin Nuland, and Mehmet Oz, Tippett revels in the connections between the two, showing how even those most wedded to hard truths find spiritual enlightenment. The result is a theologically evocative dialogue on the changing way we think about science, medicine, and the expansive realm of belief.",
