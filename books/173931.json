But she can’t deny that her carnal desires are still there, simmering inside of her. And now she’s ready to dip her toe back into the wicked waters of temptation. When she meets Xavier King, she feels like she’s been thrown into the deep end. A goliath of a man, he provokes feelings inside of her that she isn't quite sure how to handle.
