  "title": "The Trans Partner Handbook: A Guide for Partners of Trans People",
  "description": "Individuals who transition from one gender to another are often in some degree of a relationship, and over 55% of these relationships endure through the transition process.While more resources are emerging for trans people themselves, there is very little information available for their partners. Through first-hand accounts and vignettes of successful partnerships, this book presents detailed descriptions of everything involved in the transition process, with specific guidance for those supporting a partner in transition. Topics include disclosure, mental health, coming out, loss and grief, sex and sexuality and the legal, medical and social practicalities of transitioning. In this essential guide, people whose partners are across the transgender spectrum speak out on their own experiences with personal advice and support for others.",
