My strength. My pain. My life. My love.The big bad wolf has teeth and claws as sharp as iron, and the danger before my eyes is blinding. So blinding that I didn’t see the true danger lurking in the dark.But now my eyes are wide open and I see it all.Alone and afraid and running out of time, I’m not afraid of monsters anymore.I’m counting on them to come for me.Because if they don’t, this foolish girl might be lost forever in the dark.",
