  "title": "Political Common Sense for America: The Creation of The Franklin Party",
  "description": "Are you tired of hearing about the complexities of the economy, unemployment, foreign policy, etc? Are you frustrated by politicians telling you the challenges America faces are too difficult for you to understand? I was too! So, I decided to dive headlong into each issue and find the real truth behind the 'so called' complexities, and what I found may surprise you. The issues of today aren't mind boggling. They aren't huge algorithms. What they are is straightforward challenges, which we can solve with good old fashioned common sense solutions. The problem is most politicians can't balance a check book, let alone the national budget. They're also too busy running for re-election instead of working for their constituents. In order to make this topic easy to understand and to bring it closer to home, we'll follow Harold Barnes and his son Joshua as they go on an unexpected journey that starts with the writing of a Civics paper for school. The innocent and straightforward questions of a sixteen year old boy ignite their neighborhood, and then their state, into a political firestorm that eventually becomes The Franklin Party. If you want to recapture your pride in America and the spirit it was founded on, read this book.",
