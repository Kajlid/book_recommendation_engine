  "description": "Tommy Kennedy’s family has more money than they’ll ever be able to spend. That money can’t give Tommy back that which he’s lost, though, and that’s made him a very angry young man. Eli Avery has watched Tommy grow up. He knows a lot about the grim young man, but he’s managed to fall in love with him anyway. However, Eli has found Tommy’s name on a mysterious list and knows that if he doesn’t do something soon, Tommy will be lost to him forever--and that’s something he just can’t allow. He sets out to get Tommy off the list and, maybe, win his heart in the process.",
