At the Citadel, Jess trains relentlessly but struggles with control, hurting anyone who gets close and forcing her to question her purpose.All their plans seem in vain when Omni returns with a vengeance. His insatiable thirst for blood and pain leaves the world in tatters, and even the return of old friends can’t outweigh the climbing casualties. As the death toll mounts, will there be anyone left to save the world? And how much—and who—is Aubree willing to sacrifice for victory?",
