  "description": "Whether cursed by fate, stupidity, or genetics, THE BIG BOOK OF LOSERS tells the tales of real people who were forced to endure a damned existence. Exploring the unfortunate adventures of those who could not catch a break, this amazing reference book documents the stories of people who have lost in life, sports, business, and politics. From President Garfield, who died after several incompetent doctors turned a small bullet wound into a huge, festering malady to the woman who burned her husband's life savings in the oven, this tome shows that some people are just destined to come out on the bottom. Also included in this book are the most legendary loser products such as New Coke, the female urinal, and the paper dress.",
