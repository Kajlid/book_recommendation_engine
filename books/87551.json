  "title": "Awakening the Other Way: Nonduality and Existential Reason",
  "description": "A down-to-earth guide to nondual awareness.Unacademic but strictly rational, this friendly philosophical guide shows the way to the present. Discover why truly understanding nondualistic metaphysics brings spiritual awakening. Nondualism connects the dots between the subjective and the sensible. It is an antidote to secular dualism, which leaves the Western mind guilty and anxious.The dualistic illusion of mind independence fools the most intelligent minds. Without reality or religion, where should the secular West turn for guidance? Here’s a philosophical solution: decoding Eastern philosophy with the four classical principles of rational thought. The resulting East-West amalgam is existential reason, rooted in nondual awareness.•\tIt is a reliable path to inner peace.•\tIt helps spot false spiritual promises.•\tIt justifies a new brand of Western assertiveness, currently so sorely missing in the public arena.Find out why nonduality is logically inevitable even though our minds tend to reject it instinctively. Moving from the personal to the universal, Awakening the Other Way is lightness with substance for thinkers and seekers ready to explore our nondual existence in plain terms and with common sense.",
