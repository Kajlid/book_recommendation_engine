After their divorce is finished, and I’ve finally gotten her out of both of our lives, I get a call from him telling me he’s married yet again.My father’s latest mistake has given me a stepmother and a stepsister. I have zero doubt that both of them are after my family fortune. So, I have to fly home to fix the mess.But when I get there, I meet her.Molly Reynolds. My stepsister. A girl who somehow manages to capture my soul in the space of a few moments. I know I can’t let her go, not even if her mother is up to no good, which I still suspect.Keeping Molly by my side will require some scheming on my part, but that’s what I’m good at. I am Asher Score after all. I’m cold and calculated and always get my way in the end.I make a deal with her of sorts, one that will keep her close. So close, in fact, that I get to know my stepsister in every way.",
