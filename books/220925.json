  "description": "Spilled Coffee is about life, experiences and topics often ignored or frowned upon.It is a combination of what happens when you live life when the cup falls over and shatters on the floor. It provides a unique take on subjects like autism, mental disorders and addiction to name but a few. It provides within each story a lesson and hope for the future. It doesn't sugar coat, it doesn't hide behind fairy tales because in the end its all real, real to me and real to so many others. It's one cup of coffee you won't forget.",
