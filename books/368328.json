  "description": "Don't get me wrong, waking up to discover my ex-husband finally killed me wasn't fun. Finding out I had to get a job and pay Afterlife taxes about ten minutes later?Let's just say, this wasn't exactly the eternal reward I was hoping for. But beggars can't be choosers, and being a demon sure as hell beats my last occupation.I’m well on my way to retirement behind the pearly gates when the impossible happens. The Risk Witches have a vision.A savage shifter that can't control his wolf.An ancient fae lord that's forgotten what it means to feel.A playboy vampire king with a secret.Three alpha's will inherit unspeakable power. Each of them scarred. Too broken to be tamed . . .Upper Management sent their best to 'fix' them. Angels. Poltergeists. Nothing worked.So now it's my turn, whether I like it or not.But unfortunately for me, failure is not an option with these guys.Combined, they have enough power to end the world—and they will.Unless I find a way to stop them first.Breaking people is my job. But this time...my job might break me.",
