Plucked from my home from Las Vegas, NV, and placed into an University on an arts scholarship, suddenly I am the girl the four hottest and most popular boys have decided to \"initiate\".  This is no ordinary \"hazing\" ritual, and these boys are no ordinary boys.  This mysterious University looks like any ivy league campus, but it isn't. Step in and you are transported beyond your wildest imagination. I should be ecstatic being here. Except surviving \"Initiation\" is going to take everything I've got.  Don't let the beauty of the four fae boys fool you. They are as dangerous as they are beautiful. And underneath everything, runs a deep secret. One I need to find out before Initiation kills me.  They think a human is weak. They think I shouldn't be at this university. I'm about to prove them wrong.  **Initiation Year 1 is the first book of six books in the Fallen Fae Academy Series. It is a Reverse Harem Why Choose New Adult/YA paranormal enemies-to-lovers bully romance which means there are more than three love interests for the FMC.
