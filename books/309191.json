  "description": "What do you do when a weekend family trip leads to everyone you hold near and dear being buried six feet under? And when you wake up to five handsome men glued to your side, each of them haunted by their own demons, yet determined to support you as you try to uncover all the secrets others have kept about who and what you truly are?If you have the answers, then please tell me…Spy movies have always been cool for a Sunday Netflix and chill session with my best friend Gem, but I used to think they were far-fetched. Now, though, it seems that I’ve somehow been thrown into the middle of one—co-starring five protective men as my sidekicks, the psycho who murdered my family and calls me ‘his Little Phoenix’ as the antagonist…and me as the clueless main character.But I don’t plan on staying clueless for long. After everyone I loved was taken from me, and my future was stolen, all that remains now is the need for revenge.Someone destroyed my entire life…and I shall pay them in kind. For I shall be the Phoenix that rises from the ashes to set the world on fire.Little Phoenix, he calls me.Phoenix I shall be known by.And the Phoenix always gets what she wants.Join Mila’s journey as her life is upended, leaving her in the care of five broken, but wholesome men. Will they be able to protect her from the hidden threats that lurk in the shadows or will the darkness consume them all?",
