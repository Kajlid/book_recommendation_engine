  "description": "You never know what secrets you’ll find buried inside an old computer\n\nOn a whim, twenty-something cyber-security expert Alex Fife engages in a bit of voyeuristic digital snooping while cleaning up an old PC for a charity. To his surprise, Alex learns that the computer’s deceased owner, a shady antiquities smuggler, had been trying to unload a priceless object known as the Florentine on the black market. But with the dealer’s death, the Florentine is unaccounted for and potentially ripe for the taking. \nHooked by the prospect of solving a mystery, Alex embarks upon a quest through subterranean grottos, freezing morgues, and hidden cellars in search of the Florentine. But what starts out as a seemingly innocuous pursuit quickly turns into a nightmare, as Alex discovers that the Florentine may not be a lost treasure after all, but something far more insidious. A weapon that, in the wrong hands, could bring the developed world to its knees—one that Alex’s adversaries will do anything to acquire.\nWill Alex unlock the secrets of the Florentine in time to prevent a catastrophic attack? Read The Florentine Deception to find out!",
