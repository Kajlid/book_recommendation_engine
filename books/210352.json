  "description": "A savage struggle against evil and otherworldly enemies, bestselling Author R WK Clark presents the third volume in the brilliant DeSai Trilogy, a compelling whirlpool of a story that draws you into its center.The culmination of Cyril DeSai and Rasia Engres in their son, the only offspring spawned between a black witch and a vampire. His name is to be Lucien.Lucien is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into evil.Author CommentaryThe third and final book in my DeSai Trilogy is entitled ‘Lucien’s Reign,’ and it tells the story of the culmination of Cyril DeSai and Rasia Engres in their son, Lucien. At the very beginning of the book, Rasia is in the throes of labor. Now, to readers who are familiar with her character from reading the first two, she is a hard, dark woman with nothing but evil intent in her heart. The birth of Lucien Cerebus DeSai is nothing but a threat to Rasia, and this interferes with her affection. I had to play up her mothering instincts, and I had to make Cyril’s family dream become her dream as well. Only in this way would she raise Lucien with the iron fist necessary for him to become a capable family head.Writing ‘Lucien’s Reign’ was a good time; I was able to cut loose in a lot of areas regarding the true enormity of Lucien’s character. For those who have read this book, or the entire series, I do hope you had as much fun with these sick characters as I have.",
