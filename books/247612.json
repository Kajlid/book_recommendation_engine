  "description": "\"This is a writer to watch. A superb novel, wonderful prose.\" -Sandra Scoppettone, author of the Lauren Laurano seriesElegant, intellectual Mercedes Medina is nearing 60 and preparing for the imminent death of her husband, Patrick. Twenty years her senior, and a former concert cellist, Patrick approaches the end of his life with lucidity and confidence, but for Mercedes, the journey is not so simple. Finding herself drawn to a woman nearly half her age, she struggles for balance as passion collides with responsibility, recklessness with loyalty, lust with love, and the present with the future. When Patrick dies and the woman, Lenny, disappears, Mercedes is left alone, and facing a life that will not allow her to continue living in the way she has. Light, Coming Back is a haunting story of change, passion, and the search for an authentic and personal life, rendered in an exquisitely heartrending manner by first-time novelist Ann Wadsworth. Mercedes Medina's struggle for equilibrium as her life simultaneously unravels and weaves itself into a new pattern is both unforgettable and universally recognizable.Marketing Plans:National advertising: The Advocate, Out, Lambda Book ReportAdvance Reader Copies.Regional author appearances.Media targets: The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post Book World, Los Angeles Times Book Review, The Boston Review, The Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Boston Phoenix, WGBH.",
