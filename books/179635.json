  "description": "Since discovering she is descended from an ancient Fire elemental, Sera Hadyn has struggled with her talent, unintentionally burning the guy she loves and narrowly escaping death on several occasions. Now with her Fire talent bound, her archrival Bree—an Air talent determined to steal Adam from her—has found a way to do just that. As if that wasn’t bad enough, someone has been working very hard behind the scenes to eliminate the Fire line once and for all. Can Sera cheat Death yet again by keeping those around her alive, or will casualties mount when the elements collide? ~Book two in the elemental dark fantasy series~",
