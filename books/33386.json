  "description": "Grace Shields keeps her hectic life in order with lists. Lots of lists. She keeps track of her boyfriend's Pros and Cons, her favorite Jackie Chan movies, the best places to get a pizza, and even a list of her phobias, of which there are many. Now, as Grace struggles to deal with a career that's getting away from her and the frustration of living with her brother George, the lists are all she can do to cope. When she meets Colin Kilbourne, a free-spirited musician with a knack for ruffling Grace's feathers, she's immediately attracted to his carefree attitude. Grace knows they'd be a mismatch in every possible way, but his mischievous charm is hard to resist. What's a girl to do when the lists tell you one thing and your heart tells you another?",
