Sometimes that search led to blindingly clear answers. Slowly the path became clear; she knew what she must do.Her journey is one of emerging self-awareness and awakening.It is a fascinating and extremely readable story. It may lead you to question events in your life, it may change your view, it WILL have you wanting more!",
