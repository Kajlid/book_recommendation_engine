  "description": "April 26th 2014, The Choragus Parasite released itself on humanity. It has been estimated that over seventy percent of the worlds population was already infected before the parasite became active. Very little is known about its origins, or how it spread so quickly. All that is known is that the parasite thrived in hostile environment, and that it was triggered by aggression. In three weeks over ninety percent of the worlds population was wiped out. It is estimated that less than one hundred thousand people remain. The following Journal was recovered on a small island off the coast of Canada. This is the only written account of the events that unfolded sixty years ago, and has become a lesson to the surviving members of humanity.",
