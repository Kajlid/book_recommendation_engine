  "description": "~18+~Any author can tell you that strong emotion breeds new characters… and once born, they must tell their story. So what if I want to drink myself into oblivion? They don’t care, and it’s like my fingers have a mind of their own. Jesse and Brooklyn are soulmates, bound by fate to be together. They know it. They can feel it, can see it in each other’s eyes. They may have missed their first shot together, but it doesn’t matter now. They’ll find their happily ever after… as long as their pasts and futures don’t collide in horrible and unpredictable ways. Fate brought them together, and it made them cross paths once again. It’s futile to resist. That is… if fate is even real.Do you believe in fate?",
