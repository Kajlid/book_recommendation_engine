  "description": "\"Heath's debut novel is gripping from the get-go.\" -Kirkus Reviews \"Alaska is almost a character all on its beautiful, unpredictable, violent, and unforgiving. Broken Angels is a compelling debut by a talented new writer.\" -Elaine Ford, winner of the Michigan Literary Award. \"This book was amazing, just as Burke brings New Orleans to life Heath puts Alaska into your soul.\" -Judy Smrdel \"Heath has tapped his intimate knowledge of Alaska, its people, its coastal communities and its interior uniqueness and crafted a character-rich, page-turning, murder mystery.\" -An Alaskan  She stares at her mother's clumsy lettering on the envelope. Nine years. Nine years since she stepped over her mother's drunken body and into a cold Alaska night running south, leaving her mother forever. How did she find me? She hesitates, knowing the letter inside will drag her home; back into the bleakness of a life with no exit. Kris Gabriel, Alaska Native, and fierce like a wolverine, returns to Alaska--to find her mother murdered. Guilty she abandoned her in life, Kris only knows to fight. Relentlessly, she tracks a trail of pain, of lost love, of lives ripped apart by the frozen north's unyielding laws, never suspecting that she has far more at stake than just finding her mother's killer. Broken Angels is a fast-paced Alaskan noir filled with richly drawn characters struggling to survive in a hostile country where there are no second chances.",
