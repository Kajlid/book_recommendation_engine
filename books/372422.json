  "title": "The Genius Factory: Unravelling the Mystery of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank",
  "description": "In 1980 an eccentric American millionaire launched a 'Nobel Prize sperm bank', intended to create a new generation of superkids. Stocked with the seed of gifted scientists, inventors, businessmen and thinkers, including several Nobel laureates, the 'genius factory' produced more than 200 children before it quietly closed its doors in 1999. What happened to them? Were they the brilliant progeny its founder expected? In this stunning, eye-opening and hugely entertaining book, David Plotz tracks down many of the donors, children and mothers involved, and sheds new light on the fascinating battle between nature and nurture.",
