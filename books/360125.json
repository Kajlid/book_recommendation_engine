  "title": "Love's Work: A Reckoning with Life",
  "description": "A devastating confrontation with mortality leads Gillian Rose, one of England's most distinguished thinkers, to illuminate the deepest issues of our lives: love, friendship, sex, illness, and death. Rose's crisis gives her search the force of immediacy and intimacy; her willingness to face life unsentimentally propels her toward the unexplored border between life and death. As she confronts the dilemma faced by all humankind - how to teach the mind what the heart knows, and the heart what the mind understands - Rose finds that attention to loss becomes the silence of grace, and that the personal becomes the universal. Extraordinarily candid and elegant, Love's Work is radiant as both memoir and philosophy; it provides a new model for introspection.",
