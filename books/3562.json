  "description": "\"This book was very fun to write and is a very fun read. It is an action-adventure story that happens in the near future, but while it is sci-fi, the book doesn't have any technology that isn't already around, or at least will be in the next dozen years. It doesn't have a lot of techno-babble, or wild leaps like time and space travel.The story follows Morgan Wickers, a guy who skims by in life by keeping his expenses low and doing occasional work beta-testing new products for a high-tech company. He spends most of his free time immersed in the world of a virtual reality video game called Real War. Morgan is thrilled when the company he works for finally develops the technology to directly link the human brain to computers and he gets to be the first person to try it out. At first he thinks it is just a great new way to play video games, but before long he has to start questioning whether he is controlling the computer or the other way around.Before long Morgan finds himself in a fight to save humanity itself, and the only way he is going to keep himself and his friends alive is if he can use the skills he has honed fighting in a virtual world to save them all from very real enemies.A fun read for anyone, whether a science fiction fan or not. You'll love it.\"-The Author",
