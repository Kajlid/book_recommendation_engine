  "description": "Living in a dank one room apartment and working as a waitress in a shabby bar, Nora didn’t think her life could get any worse. But that’s before sexy-as-hell Adrian Black moves into the apartment across from her bedroom window and she’s caught spying on him having sex. Now he has set his eyes on her. Not falling prey to his panty-dropping smiles proves to be a challenge Nora isn’t sure she’s ready for – especially since the most action she ever had are the butt slaps from leery customers at work. An encounter with Adrian involving a healthy dose of pent-up tension and too much alcohol leads to an awkward night that none of them will likely forget. But it’s only the beginning...“Every night I take out my binoculars, point them at the window of my neighbor Adrian Black and watch him banging a new girl, and every night I wish the girl was me. Where the hell is a shooting star when you need one?“",
