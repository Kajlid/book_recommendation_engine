  "description": "Everyone has magic but sometimes you have to search to find out what it is. That’s what Maxwell Mouse had to do. And he discovered that what he thought was something very bad was actually something very good, indeed.The Magic of Maxwell and His Tail is more than just a charming, wonderfully illustrated story. With childlike innocence, it presents an inspiring motivational model for youngsters—especially gifted kids and those with special needs—to take another look at themselves and recognize their unique gifts. It shows them how to see beyond what appear to be limitations and appreciate them as positive attributes that will help them to soar.Written by an educator with over 30 years in the trenches and based on sound educational principles acknowledging the various ways children learn (multiple intelligences), The Magic of Maxwell and His Tail is a micro-guide to life. It will delight children as they celebrate Maxwell’s triumphs, and warm the hearts of parents as they watch their kids discover how perfectly special they are.The Magic of Maxwell and His Tail is the first in a series of books to entertain, educate, and encourage children to be their better selves.",
