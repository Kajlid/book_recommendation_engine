  "description": "They say that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. I hold onto it anyway, letting it consume me, as it slowly devours everything I am. I fight to hide my ugliness from the world.Until I meet her.She’s a soothing balm to what ails me, softening the anger that roars within. Unknowingly, she’s healing what’s broken and I’m determined to keep her - to make her mine.But what happens when she sees the monster that lies beneath? Will she stand by me? And what about the whispers that taunt my mind, telling me that she’s hiding secrets of her own? Can love be built on lies, or will the embers of our secrets burst into flames, consuming us both in the end?",
