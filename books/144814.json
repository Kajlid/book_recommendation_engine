  "description": "What do a cynical, non-conformist dry-goods salesman, a disgruntled blacksmith, and a musing mendicant all have in common? Down deep, they all seek for something better; and eventually, they all find the childlike humility and faith required for true fulfillment. The non-conformist, Manaheem, Herod's foster brother, helps Herod foment an insurrection against Pilate, using the blacksmith, Barabbas as leader, to the dismay of the latter's Godly but fearful wife. The Mendicant, a young man named Timotheus, joins with an older beggar completely unsympathetic to his musings. Meanwhile, Pilate's wife pushes him to take over Herod's territory. When the insurrection fails, Manaheem turns to blackmail, and Barabbas turns to robbery, enlisting the aid of our two beggars. Manaheem almost loses his one true love, his former wife, Claressa, with whom he is trying to re-unite. The robbery goes bad, and Barabbas and the beggars get caught and are sentenced to death.",
