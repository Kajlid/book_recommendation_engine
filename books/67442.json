  "description": "Can the Devil of the NFL keep his hands off his coach’s sister-in-law?The only way to win is to score…With a reputation for fast moves on the gridiron and even faster moves off the field, Shane Devlin is a player in every sense of the word. Unfortunately, his bad boy persona has made him a risky prospect as a quarterback—and only the Baltimore Blaze are willing to give him a chance. But he’s about to take a hit he never expected.Working for the Blaze, Carly March knows too well how jocks think—and what they think with—so she’s always made a point of keeping ballplayers at arm’s length. But when she shares a kiss with the devilishly handsome Shane, she finds it hard to play by her own rules—and even harder to resist him. Can a football hero and a business-minded beauty try to take it all the way? Or will their mutual attraction cost them the big game?Game On is the first book in the Out of Bounds series featuring the Baltimore Blaze professional football team. This novel features a sexy alpha hero, a forbidden romance, lots of sexy fun and a satisfying HEA without cliffhangers. Each book can be read as a standalone or as part of the series in order.",
