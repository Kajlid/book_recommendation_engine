  "description": "The Sign of the Cross... In the darkest parts of Russia.  Boris is following the trail to locate the last of the NVG's secret bases. As they look, they run across an old legend, one which speaks to the Archangel Michael defeating a beast...  Could that have actually have been Michael, the Patriarch of Vampires?  And if it was, what beast had he condemned to the caves near Archangelsk, Russia?  This time, Boris is going after more than just the NVG - he is searching for the answer to his own past.
