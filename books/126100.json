  "description": "Seven generations ago, the human world fell to the Fae. Every forgotten monster, every imagined nightmare, became humanity’s reality.Twenty years ago I fled my mother’s court and the constant assassination attempts. I’ve been in hiding ever since, moving in secret between the different Factions. Disguised as a human, treated like a slave, I watched the injustices build, felt the pain of being less.So I created my own world, one where I can be free, where the ideals of my childhood are upheld. Unfortunately, I can’t stay where my very nature puts the Scàthanna at risk. I’m forced to leave, to try and find a solution to the ever growing hunger of the Hollow.When I find Conall and Mateo, males who lift me up, who make me burn and tempt me to form my Circle, it’s only the first step.Now, I am through with hiding. Through with being afraid. It’s my turn to rain Justice on those who have forgotten what it means to be honorable; my turn to feed the Hollow with their screams.It’s my turn.*Hollow Justice is a fantasy why choose romance between a Fae female and her males. It is suitable for 18+ due to sexual content and also deals with attempted filicide, off-page abuse of a child while in shifted wolf form, threats of SA against the MC and on page depictions of violence, gore and death. If you think you might be sensitive or be made uncomfortable by any of these elements, this book might not be for you.*",
