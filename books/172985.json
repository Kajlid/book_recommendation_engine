  "description": "Rainn Wilson’s memoir about growing up geeky and finally finding his place in comedy, faith, and life. For nine seasons Rainn Wilson played Dwight Schrute, The Office’s resident nemesis/ beet farmer. Viewers grew to love the scheming, socially awkward character, and to love the actor who played him even more. While the show was running, Rainn founded a website and media company, SoulPancake, that challenged users to “chew on life’s big questions” and eventually inspired a bestselling book of the same name. He also started a hilarious Twitter feed (sample Tweet: “@Amazon I would like to order my own drone but have it delivered by UPS. Possible?”) that today has nearly four million followers.With this book, Rainn is ready to tell his own story, to explain how he developed his unique, off-kilter sense of humor and perspective on life. He chronicles his journey from childhood nerd to bassoon-playing band geek (“the highest rung on the vast, pimply ladder of high school losers”), his years of mild debauchery as a young actor in New York, his audition for The Office, and the inside scoop on the hit that followed. Finally Rainn discusses his achievement of success and satisfaction, both in his career and spiritually, after re-connecting with the artistic and creative values of the faith he grew up in.",
