  "title": "Choosing Against War: A Christian View",
  "description": "By a leading writer and thinker. How might Christians look on the world differently if they actually believed that God's love is indeed stronger than our fears? In fresh, confessional language, Roth shares his convictions about Christian pacifism, inviting others to consider this approach, all the while humbly admitting the difficulties.           In the face of violence, are there any options open to the Christian believer other than the \"default\" impulse toward patriotic unity and a steely determination to exact \"an eye for an eye\"? A must-read for anyone concerned about the endless cycles of wars and violence, and the possibility that God's love is stronger than our society's current answers.",
