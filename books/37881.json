Thirty seven years later, high school freshman Michael Gurick’s father is killed combating cyborg supervillains. With a little help from his friends, Michael takes up his father’s super-identity to seek justice against the cyborgs who killed his father-or will it be revenge?“Taking a page from Robert Heinlein’s classic juvenile novels, Dispensing Justice is a story set in a science fiction/superhero universe and features a clique of smart and likeable teenagers grappling with complex (adult) issues.” — Eric SearlemanAfter witnessing his superhero father death at the hands of four cyborg supervillains, Michael has sworn to bring his father’s killers to justice. If fitting into his father’s battlesuit isn’t problem enough, Michael must survive one friend’s wanna-be ninja younger siblings and another friend’s developing telekinetic powers. Then there’s his mother’s obsession with cleaning the house over and over, a shape-shifting government agent, and, oh yeah, his high school grades. They keep threatening to move into A+ territory, bringing unwanted attention when he just wants to assemble enough weapons to take down four killer cyborgs.
