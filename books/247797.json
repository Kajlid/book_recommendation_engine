  "description": "Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1999.Born on the day after the moon landing to a father with his head in the stars, Neil \"Apollo\" Armstrong has never felt that he could reach as high as his father's dreams. He got as far as Tulsa, and there, with the Brazen Bulls MC, he found a way to fly on wheels. But he's worried now that the club has lost its way.The Bulls are reeling from a bloody, blazing street war that tore through the heart of the club. Their brotherhood has been badly damaged, and the trust among them is fragile.Jacinda Durham doesn't have a lot of trust to give. With a painful past still weighing on her present, she keeps people at a distance, preferring inconsequential encounters, to guard against the chance of being hurt. The career she's chosen is another piece of her armor; she makes a living of suspicion.After a blistering-hot night together, Apollo and Jacinda go their separate ways, despite a mutual sense that their attraction is deeper than skin. Then a fateful coincidence throws them violently back together, and Apollo finds himself standing between his club and a woman he barely knows, each a possible threat to the other. Where his loyalty lies should be clear, but his trust in the Bulls is shaken, and he can't allow another innocent to be hurt.It's more than a question of loyalty. It's love as well, a deeply rooted love for his club, and a powerful new love growing between him and this tough, beautiful woman who's offered him her precious trust.To save all he loves, Apollo must put everything on the line-his honor, his love, his life. He will have to pay the price that settles all their debts.Note: explicit sex and violence.",
