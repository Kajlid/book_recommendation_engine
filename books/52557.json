  "description": "Black versus white. Yin versus yang. Good versus...wait, theyâ€™re both evil. Or are they both good? Discuss. Everyone knows and loves Spy vs. Spy, the two MAD magazine spies locked in eternal, existential battle. In the rich tradition of Spy vs. Spy oneupsmanship, Spy vs. Spy 2: The Joke and Dagger Files is the follow-up to Spy vs. Spy: The Complete Casebook. This full-color sequel (only the spies are still black and white) takes up where the first volume left off and includes a foreword by J.J. Abrams, 230 Spy strips by Spy artist Peter Kuper, 56 Spy strips by Bob Clarke, 85 Spy strips and Sunday newspaper strips by Dave Manak, and material from the popular Spy Mountain Dew commercials, MAD TV spots, and MAD Kids Spy vs. Spy Jr. More colorful than the Casebook, evenmore packed with international intrigue, this is the one spy book to buy when you've already got the first one on your bookshelf.",
