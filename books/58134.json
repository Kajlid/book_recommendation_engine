  "description": "In 1995, Neil Gordon's Sacrifice of Isaac was one of the most acclaimed novels of the year. Newsday said it \"immediately vaults Gordon into the company of John le Carr√© and Graham Greene.\" The Washington Post called it \"one of those rare works of fiction that are both edifying and almost sinfully pleasurable.\" The San Francisco Chronicle described it as \"the best kind of page-turner.\"------Now Neil Gordon returns with The Gun Runner's Daughter, an equally compelling tale of moral and psychological suspense, the story of two lawyers who fall in love while they are on opposite sides of an arms-dealing scandal.------For twenty-seven years, Allison Rosenthal has lived the life of the liberal elite, from summers in Martha's Vineyard to her studies at Yale. But when her father is indicted on federal charges and his profession--arms dealing--is exposed to public scrutiny, her placid life changes radically. And when her secret childhood lover is named as her father's prosecuting attorney, she must decide where her loyalties lie in a trial that is rocking the presidential administration.------Does family come before politics? Love before law? Truth before loyalty? These are the questions the gun runner's daughter must face as she tries to negotiate the dangerous and murky world of her father's profession and the ambiguous morality of power politics in America and Israel. In this audaciously entertaining intellectual thriller, Neil Gordon brings the personal and political together with the mastery of a great storyteller.",
