  "description": "Some skeletons just won't stay hidden. No one knows that better than University of Georgia archaeologist Lindsay Chamberlain. Still, she is shocked when a skeleton dressed in its Sunday best falls out of a packing crate that had been stored in a kudzu-covered shed on her grandfather's farm for more than sixty years. When other crates are discovered, each containing a stash of valuable artifacts, Lindsay begins to wonder. Could her beloved grandfather, a prominent archaeologist, have been a thief, a looter - even a murderer? As Lindsay struggles with these troubling questions, she helps a local private investigator locate the wooded grave of Shirley Foster, a missing faculty member. Lindsay is sucked into the investigation, which leads to more questions than answers. Why did Shirley Foster lie to the world about her life? Who wanted her dead?",
