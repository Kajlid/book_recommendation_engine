  "description": "THE STORIES: A collection of six short, creepy, pulpy plays, THE WEIRD is narrated by horror host M.T. Grave, who introduces each of the evening's ghoulish, funny delights. In BLOODY MARY, two oversexed teenagers play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse while driving along a deserted highway late at night. In INSECT LOVE, a scientist and his lab assistant fall in love...while the sci-fi classic The Fly plays in movie theatres across the country. In THE TEN-MINUTE PLAY ABOUT ROSEMARY'S BABY, a young couple moves into an apartment building with nosey neighbors - as well as a demonic presence. In SWAMP GOTHIC, a handsome college student risks man-eating alligators, voodoo and zombies to find his equally handsome missing best friend. In MORNING BECOMES OLESTRA, a conniving femme fatale plans her obese husband's murder - with the help of a vampire. And in DINNER WITH THE SUPERFRIENDS, two gal pals get together for some reminiscing and crime-fighting. \n   Short Play Collection \n   One Acts \n   3 men, 2 women (doubling): 5 total \n   Flexible Set",
