Genevieve Ellison is not a woman Chasin can forget, even if she was only his for the weekend. But now that she’s back in his life, the last thing she wants is a reconciliation. And with her comes a deadly secret, one that blindsides the former SEAL.

The country music star hadn’t planned on meeting the one person on earth who has no idea who she is. She also hadn’t planned on falling in love only to have her heart shattered. When new and repulsive evidence comes to light, Genevieve can no longer deny how much danger she’s in. Luckily for her, Gemini Group is willing to protect her. What’s not so lucky—the man who did the heart breaking is back in her life. While Genevieve and Chasin are busy playing games of the heart, the stalker makes a deadly move. The two lovers may have won their battle, but someone is determined to win the war—permanently.",
