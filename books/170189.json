  "title": "The Adventures of Manny Lark: A Sip From The Bloodwell",
  "description": "Follow the young(ish) half-dragon, Manny Lark, along on his mishaps and adventures in this novella length book. A fast paced, action packed, story of magic, aliens, dragons, and family skeletons (sometimes literally). Travel along with our supernatural protagonist as he tries to make it through one day at a time. Manny just wants to know how he wound up in a metal box, but a collection of cosmic powers known as the council of the ancients keeps him from this baffling mystery, and uses Manny's father, the Dragon Lord Braxus, to push him towards the undesired task of magical policing. It sounded like a case of unlicensed arcane business, and It should have been a straightforward job, but nothing is straightforward when dragons are involved..",
