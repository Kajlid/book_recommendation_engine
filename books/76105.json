  "description": "\"Winston Churchill is one of the twentieth century's greatest statesmen, yet as Britain's colonial secretary in the 1920s, he made a mistake with calamitous consequences and unseen repercussions in the twenty-first century. Scholar and adviser to Tony Blair's government, Christopher Catherwood chronicles and analyzes Churchill's creation of the artificial monarchy of Iraq after World War I, forcing together unfriendly peoples - Sunni Muslim Kurds, Sunni Muslim Arabs, and Shiite Muslims - under a single ruler.\" \"Indeed the map of the Middle East that Churchill created in 1921 led ultimately to the rise of the Ba'ath Party and Saddam Hussein and the wars in which American troops fought in 1991 and 2003.\" Churchill's Folly is an essential book for readers eager to learn the history behind Iraq's formation and see how one man's decisions can threaten world peace decades later.",
