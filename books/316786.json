  "title": "Vultures in the living room",
  "description": "This is the first translation of Lula Falcão's dystopian, absurdist and sometimes darkly humorous collection of short stories on contemporary Brazilian life.Falcão--the author of critically acclaimed books including one being adapted to screen―writes from the port city of Recife. His writing is unmistakably original, his use of the absurdist method succeeds in explaining Brazil's political, existential conundrums, its current religious schizophrenia, and it provides an entertaining gateway to universal truths.Vultures in the Living Room, like Ionesco's post -war Rhinoceros, is an important reflection on human vulnerability during times of political and social uncertainty.According to editor and author Matt \"While some aspects of his work speak specifically to the Brazilian context, the scenarios and characters in Vultures in the Living Room should also resonate with readers in other parts of our increasingly networked and alienated 21st Century global society.\"",
