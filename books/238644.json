  "description": "An erotic tail of love, trust, dominance, forgiveness, and courage.  Maddox-  It had been a year that Maddox hadn't thought about having another submissive. Well, that was until he saw Reagan. The moment he laid eyes on her in a conference meeting, he wanted her. He was there only for information and maybe to purchase a plane from her father's company, a company he had heard great things about. He ended up buying a plane and committing to two more. At first sight, he fell for the beautiful Reagan, hook, line, and sinker. She was untamed, mouthy, and somewhat unpredictable. Deadly combination. He was what she needed. Someone to teach her. A Dom, looking for his next Sub. Then he fell for her. Hard.  Reagan-  She had her priories straight, her life all put together- or she thought. Reagan was out of college and returned home to help in the family business, selling private planes. Little did she know her life would soon be turned around when a handsome hazel-eyed man captured her attention. Now would she become what he wanted? He was overbearing, persistent, and extremely handsome. That's what she noticed when she saw him. From that first flirty touch, she was his and didn't know it. Her virtue would soon be tested.",
