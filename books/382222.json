  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Zoe is many things, but confident is not one of them. Perhaps thatâ€™s why she prefers the company of animals. A self-professed advocate for their rights, Zoe is not above taking matters into her own hands. But the stakes are raised when she finds herself at the centre of a dangerous conspiracy involving the disappearance of animals from a shelter. She turns to street-savvy Alex Fisher, her troubled Social Studies partner, to help unravel the mystery. Zoe soon learns that nothing is as it appears, as she is confronted by angry parents, a dangerous sociopath, and an ill-advised romance.",
