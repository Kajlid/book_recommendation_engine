  "description": "Knopf Canada welcomes one of China’s most acclaimed and bestselling writers–author of Raise the Red Lantern –to the list with a fascinating retelling of a magical story–already an international bestseller in China and Europe. Through Binu’s extraordinary story, Su Tong illuminates one of China’s most magical myths. In Peach village, crying is forbidden. But as a child, Binu never learnt to hide her tears. Shunned by the villagers, she faces a bleak future until she meets the man she will marry, Qiliang. A few years after their marriage, Qiliang disappears. Binu learns that he has been transported hundreds of miles and forced to labour on a project of terrifying ambition and scale–the building of the Great Wall. Inspired by her love for her husband, Binu sets out on an extraordinary journey across Great Swallow Mountain, with only a blind frog for company. What follows is an unforgettable story of passion, hardship and magical adventure.",
