  "description": "Waking up next to a beautiful golden-haired stranger isn?t the worst thing that has ever happened to Brodie Harper, but staying in a fake marriage in order to gain a new construction contract could very well be. Savanna Morgan just wanted a way out of an engagement to a man she didn?t love. Marrying Brodie seemed liked the perfect answer at the time. Less perfect the next morning when she finds herself disowned by her father and flat broke. Now she must make it through the weekend. Monday they can get it all annulled and forget it ever happened. The real problem may be keeping their hands off each other until then.",
