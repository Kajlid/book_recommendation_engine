  "title": "The Violent Stepfather: A True Story Of Child Abuse",
  "description": "“What had I done this time?” A heart wrenching true story about an eight year old boy who is violently abused, mistreated and unloved by his cruel stepfather. He'd lay on his bedroom floor, locked in his room listening to the horror unfolding below. Waiting until the boots came up the stairs and it would be his turn. He couldn’t even begin to understand what he’d done wrong. Why he wasn’t allowed to see his brother, why he was always brutally punished and his mother was horribly beaten. Bullied at school and brushed away by his teachers, this fragile boy's only companion was teddy; a dusty, battered and torn teddy bear that meant everything to this young boy. A sad story unfolds shedding light on some of the horrific events that occurred behind closed doors and a seemingly normal house. A harrowing childhood nightmare. A broken and traumatic childhood. \"Heart-breaking, I felt every blow to that poor boy who went through so much pain, but I smiled at the happy ending even through my tears, an excellent read\" - Joan Johns (Author) This book is based upon a true story of child abuse, and as such contains passages that some readers may find disturbing.",
