  "title": "Johnny the Clockmaker",
  "description": "Johnny loves to make things. Whenever he has spare time, he can be found hammering and banging and sawing up pieces of wood. But his parents don't think much of his hobby — to them, it’s just a noisy, nonsensical, and very dusty activity. So it comes as no surprise that when Johnny decides to make a grandfather clock, they advise him to do something “useful” instead. Only two people believe Johnny can do it — Susannah and Joe the Blacksmith. And of course, Johnny himself. This beautifully illustrated story is an engaging reminder that even difficult tasks can be achieved.",
