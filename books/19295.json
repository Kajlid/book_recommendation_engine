  "description": "From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Martin Dressler—a collection of stories in the tradition of Nabokov, Calvino, and Borges that explores the magnificent obsessions of the unfettered imagination, as well as the darker, subterranean currents that fuel them. • \"Tantalizing new stories.... Millhauser's ingenuity is delicious.\" —A. S. Byatt, The Washington Post Book WorldWith the panache of an old-fashioned magician, Steven Millhauser conducts his readers from the dark corners beneath the sunlit world to a balloonist's tour of the heavens. He transforms department stores and amusement parks into alternate universes of infinite plentitude and menace. He unveils the secrets of a maker of automatons and a coven of teenage girls. And on every page of The Knife Thrower and Other Stories, Millhauser confirms his stature as a narrative enchanter.",
