  "title": "Meditations on an Empty Stomach",
  "description": "“What is hunger?” is the central question of this evocative collection. From bombs and colic to baby talk and stranger danger, Bross explores the deepest musings of fatherhood, intimate relationships, and our human responsibilities. Whether brooding or rejoicing, these poems encourage an awareness of internal conflicts by not only stimulating our sense of taste, but by questioning whether we truly know when our stomachs are empty and how much they can hold. With both tenderness and rage, this collection contemplates our darkest fears and our carnal desires with a vivid honesty about whether these Meditations on an Empty Stomach are “about me, or the lack of me.” - Lynne McEniry",
