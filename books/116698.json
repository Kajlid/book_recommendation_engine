Itâ€™s important to research this before getting a rabbit, so you have the best experience possible.It also includes detailed instructions for building your own rabbit hutch if that is the route you want to take.In short, rabbits are amazing animals that make great pets. Some are raised for their wool for spinning, 4H projects and other reasons. Whatever they may be, rabbits need proper care for a healthy, happy animal.The one topic it doesn't cover is the aspect of breeding rabbits, this is more of a book for pet owners than those getting into breeding programs.",
