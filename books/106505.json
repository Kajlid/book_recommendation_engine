  "description": "Encompassing interlocking stories of personal loss, hopelessness, and, ultimately, overcoming our demons to examine what exists beyond our own consciousness, Perie Wolford's PHANTASMAGORIA is a haunting novel in three parts. In Part I, Julie, a successful businesswoman, finds herself at the center of a devastating tragedy. Left alone to cope with the unrelenting pain of loss and guilt, she attempts to discover why the world around her has changed beyond recognition. But that world is not what it seems. In Part II, Andy is a hapless pizza delivery guy by day, dealing with romantic rejection and bickering parents. By night, he finds himself trapped in a never-ending nightmare that is too real, too frightening to accept, but from which he cannot escape until he confronts the evil of his past. In Part III, an eighteenth-century translator wishes to become part of the book he is reading. When his wish comes true, he finds himself awakened from a 500-year coma, trapped inside a secluded city run by mysterious inorganic beings. Although it appears to be the garden of Eden, complete with his own personal Eve, he desperately struggles for freedom.",
