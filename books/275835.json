His green gaze upon me prickled my skin with uncustomary warmth while my peek beneath his cuff - of a riot of color on his wrist - sparked my insatiable curiosity. Tall and mysterious, Kader was a man whose secrets I longed to know. Little did I realize that the night we met was only the beginning - the beginning to the end of the existence I knew. What will happen as his assignment becomes our obsession?

You do not need to read the Web of Sin trilogy to get caught in this new and intriguing saga, Tangled Web. Obsessed is book two of the Tangled Web trilogy which began with Twisted and will conclude with Bound. Have you been Aleatha'd?",
