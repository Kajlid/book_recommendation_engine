  "description": "In 1964, Barthelme collected his early stories in Come Back, Dr. Caligari, for which he received considerable critical acclaim as an innovator of the short story form. His style (fictional and popular figures in absurd situations, e.g., the Batman-inspired \"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\"), spawned a number of imitators and would help to define the next several decades of short fiction.",
