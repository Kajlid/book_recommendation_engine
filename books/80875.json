  "description": "Clifford Andrews is the luckiest guy in the world, or is he? He’s got a gay best friend who would do anything for him, and he has seemingly been blessed with amazing luck that looks out for him constantly, but Clifford is often forced to ponder the steep price it may extract from him one day. He takes us through three years of prison called middle school; the only difference he says is that parole comes each day with the 3:00 dismissal bell. An orphan at the age of fourteen, he has no choice but to live with his overbearing aunt and somewhat detached uncle. His friend Joseph is beat up in school because he like boys instead of girls, but Clifford is determined to protect him, and they stand by each other for more than half a century. Clifford’s story is one of luck, tragedy, redemption, and friendship beyond what most of us can ever know.",
