  "description": "A devil’s war. A family’s faith. A journey’s end. Winter’s Legacy: Future Days is the 6th book and last installment of the Winter’s Saga series. Tensions run high as the Winter family has been forced out of the country and into hiding without Meg. Evan has pushed himself away from everyone—tormented by a choice he made that could bring the whole family to its knees. Left alone in the hands of the enemies, Meg struggles to fend for herself, desperately trying to stand in the way of Arkdone’s political schemes. Though her memories are gone, she’s determined to navigate right and wrong under the watchful eyes of those who want either her blood or her gifts—or both. There will be no peaceful resolution. War between the Winter Clan, Williams’ Metahumans and Arkdone’s Metamonarchs has been preordained. There will be bloodshed, and those left standing won’t necessarily be the victors. Brace yourself for the gripping conclusion of Winter's Saga!",
