  "description": "Everyone has their first love. Mine was Aubrey O'Day.  We were high school sweethearts with our futures planned, together every step of the way.  Then one day, he disappeared.  I was shattered, left with questions and doubts.  I've worked hard to rebuild my future, to create a different life. And I have. Good job, good friends . . . but something's missing.  A decade later, he's back in my life. But he's changed. Gone is the happy-go-lucky boy I knew, replaced by a brooding, mysterious beast of a man. Gone are the boyish good looks and innocent laughter. His broad chest, rippling arms, and chiseled abs have all exploded until he's literally a mountain of pure muscle.  Still, some things haven't changed. One look from him, and the fire he lit in my belly flares back to life. But where has he been? Why did he leave me?  And can we still have that future we dreamed of so long ago?  Untamed is a full-length Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger. You do not need to read the previous books beforehand.",
