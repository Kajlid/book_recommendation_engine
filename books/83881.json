  "title": "One-Dish Vegan: More than 150 Soul-Satisfying Recipes for Easy and Delicious One-Bowl and One-Plate Dinners",
  "description": "Vegan books have risen to a dominant sales position in the vegetarian category. One-dish meals are perennially popular on American tables, and books devoted to one-dish cooking perform well. Robin Robertson's One-Dish Vegan is the first book at the intersection of these two powerful cookbook categories. Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of very successful titles in the vegetarian category. She is known for her creativity in the kitchen, for the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works, and for her expertise in vegetarian nutrition - with a special focus lately on how vegans still can get enough protein in their diets. Typically, it takes two or three courses or dishes to make a well-rounded vegan meal. To meet this criterion in one dish takes the kind of ingenuity and expert knowledge that Robertson possesses. One-Dish Vegan contains more than 150 recipes. They range from the most popular categories of one-dish dining like stews, chilis, and casseroles (and other baked dishes) to a host of stovetop sautÃ©s and stir-fries as well as substantial salads and dishes that feature pasta as well as other noodles, such as Asian noodles. The recipes are at once homey and adventuresome, comforting and surprising. Above all, they demonstrate that it really is possible to get a complete vegan meal into one dish, full of good-for-you nutrients and bright, satisfying flavors.",
