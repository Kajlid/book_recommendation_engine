  "description": "My name is Louise and I’m a serial-monogamist marine biologist.Try saying that five times fast.Fresh out of an awful relationship and tired of always doing the right thing, this girl is finally saying “screw it” and having herself a meaningless fling.Here’s the thing about flings though: they only work if you keep feelings out of the equation.Well, that won’t be a problem for a sensible scientist like me… that is, until a one night stand with a hot single dad rocks my world and blows my plans completely out of the water.If I’ve learned anything from the ocean world, it’s that those with the hardest shells have the most to fear. And something tells me this guy is going to crack mine wide the hell open.",
