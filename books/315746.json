A man who’s totally off limits and is hiding a secret.As my feelings for him deepen, strange, frightening sounds start coming from the room next to mine. My most intimate possessions go missing. And someone’s leaving me notes, threatening my life. Should I trust the mysterious, mercurial Mr. Rochester? My heart tells me yes. But my brain tells me run.The problem, reader, is I have no place to go. And I cannot resist him. Will I get the happily ever after I’ve always longed for?
