  "description": "August 1835... Wolferain awoke atop a tree house he had built ages ago. He stood, overseeing the rainforest he protected and called home. Something was different today. He understood his five senses. Today another sense seemed to be crawling out from centuries long ago. Something was not right in the jungle. He could not have known that Daemon Drago, a seven hundred year old vampire, had found a new place to live nor that Daemon was a kind of foe that he had never faced before, more powerful, possessing centuries of knowledge and filled with an unquenchable thirst. Nor, as Wolferain began racing through the treetops, could he suspect the effect a vampire bite would have upon his friends, the gorillas of Congo.",
