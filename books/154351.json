  "description": "Sometimes you have to lose everything to make room for what really matters.Ten years ago, Cooper Holbrook was a player when it came to women, and he knew it. Well enough that he took one look at the hero worship in Hannah Anderson's eyes, and nipped it in the bud. She was no buckle bunny, and he wasn't the man for her or her young son.The years have caught up with the former champion bull rider. At forty, he's got nothing left but a broken-down ranch to go with the friendless, near penniless, broken man he's become.Hannah has carried a flame for Cooper since the moment the stubborn cowboy took her son on as a bull riding student. Way back then, she saw the good man beneath the bad-boy exterior.Now she's finally going to do something about her feelings. Cooper might think his life is over, but Hannah sees more for him-for them, together. And she's not giving up until he sees it too.Warning: Contains a decade's worth of pent-up sexual tension that'll be smoking up when it comes charging out of the chute!",
