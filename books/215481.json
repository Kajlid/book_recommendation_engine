As the nation's aristocrats are paraded to the guillotine, their children are handed over to revolutionary citizens for reeducation. Once a courtier at Versailles, Madeleine Lannoy now dances in the street, clinging to life so that she may one day visit revenge on Jean Paul Marat, the tyrant who stole her son. Her cause is hopeless until she meets a dashing Englishman named Sir Percy Blakeney, better known by his secret identity--the Scarlet Pimpernel. In this electrifying installment in the world-famous historical suspense series, Sir Percy outwits bloodthirsty agents of the Terror time and time again. When the rest of Europe has turned its back on the French nobility, the Scarlet Pimpernel does not hesitate to risk his life for what is just.",
