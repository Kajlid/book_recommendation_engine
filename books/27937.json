  "title": "At the Mountains of Madness",
  "description": "I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. H.P. Lovecraft's terrifying horror story gets an illustrated interpretation by one of today's finest graphic novel artists. Geologist William Dyer--the narrator of this novella--is desperate to stop a research team planning a journey to Antarctica. He himself led a disastrous mission there, only to discover evidence of blood-chilling evil from beyond Earth. Will the new expedition continue its plans? And what will happen if they go? Once again, as he did in The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Hound of the Baskervilles, Ian N. J. Culbard has created an unforgettably powerful retelling of a classic tale.",
