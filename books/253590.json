  "description": "Kylie likes burgers... and men. Basically, she loves meat, both kinds. She's a real meatgan. (The opposite of a vegan, no veggies for this girl!)  When she meets four sexy fry cooks, she counts herself lucky. But when they find themselves tumbling into darkness, she starts to question her newfound “luck.”  Brought to you by 8 fantastic authors, hot meat is a story that will have you laughing all the way to the nearest burger restaurant.  Expect meat puns, shirtless guys, and maybe even some space travel in this hilarious parody novella.  If Kylie wasn't already there, she'd be knocked flat on her ass from all the laughter.",
