  "description": "A busboy with the power to kill with a glance, and a vendetta against the President. The guy in the next cubicle has launched The Revolution, and his first target - the marketing department Joan of Arc is back, and she's blogging Edgar Allan Poe, another poor sap dead thanks to Election Day. A girl with the power to destroy the universe...once she gets out of rehab. Three weeks after the Singularity, it's up to the planet's last psychotherapist to solve the mystery of the first posthuman murder. And, of course, Joey Ramone saves the world. You might sleep, but after reading these stories you'll never dream in quite the same way again.",
