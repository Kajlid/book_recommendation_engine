  "description": "I didn’t expect to spend my annual company party sobbing in a photo booth, wearing nothing but a homemade grass skirt and a pair of coconuts. I also didn’t expect to lose my apartment, my job, and my boyfriend in a rapid series of embarrassing events. Events that, unfortunately, also landed me in a bit of hot water, and left me with a secret that only money can fix.  So when the opportunity arose to enter my book club buddies into a contest for a chance to win $50,000, I took it...I just forgot to tell them about it. And guess what? We won. Which poses a problem, since I didn’t bother to read the fine print.  Now, I need to find a way to convince Alex and Gigi, two gems I’ve never even met outside of a computer screen, to recreate a girls’ trip with me – photos and all – by the end of the week.  What could possibly go wrong?   ** **  \nGirl Tripping is a full-length, standalone chick-lit/romantic comedy novel. It features a strong set of girlfriends, a sweet romantic interest, and some sassy heroines on the adventure of a lifetime. \n  Note: It is rated PG-13 for sarcasm and some strong language. No graphic gore or sex.",
