  "description": "In 1565, the dwarf singer who came to Florida with Pedro Menendez and his conquistadors sired a daughter with a Native American witchy-woman. Four centuries later, ancestral ghosts unleashed by a genetic memory drug possess Alice, a dwarf member of a fertility cult. The ghosts wreak havoc on Alice’s personality, but the ghosts also help Al machine gun her way through rival cult factions and succeed her mother as the cult leader to a group of sexual mercenaries who know the art of war requires attractive bait. You might be surprised by what genes a dwarf has, but you can’t be more surprised than the ghost of Commodus, the Emperor/Gladiator, or more bewildered than Tycho Brahe, the eccentric astronomer. The prostitute from the old Rollestown colony might consider the situation easy on the knees, but she doesn’t arrive until the third book of the series.",
