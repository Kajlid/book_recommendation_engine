  "description": "One of the most riveting and powerful new voices in crime fiction, Peter Leonard delivers a razor-sharp debut thriller.Kate McCall’s husband has been killed by her son, Luke, in a tragic bow-hunting accident. While Kate struggles with her son’s surly guilt, her first love, Jack, an ex-con, reappears, along with a crew of his former “colleagues.” While Jack must convince his partners in crime that he really did lose the heist money, his appearance sets into motion a series of events culminating in a life-and-death confrontation with a gang of killers.Leonard displays remarkable maturity for a first-time novelist in both the plotting of the story and the language of his protagonists. The twists and turns of a love affair, an unrequited crush, and a kidnapping/extortion plot compliment a tightly drawn, intimate cast of memorably quick and dim-witted characters.Quiver marks the breakthrough of a new force in thriller writing---an explosive and unforgettable debut.",
