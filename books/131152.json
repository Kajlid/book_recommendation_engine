While Finn is finally ready to admit to himself that he is drawn to Kate, trying to save Max from himself dredges up long-buried anger and frustration that threaten to overwhelm him.Three years ago, a single bullet ricocheted through all of them. But instead of time easing the pain, it has created a new set of problems. How do you leave the past behind when it's right in front of you?",
