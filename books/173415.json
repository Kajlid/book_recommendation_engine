  "description": "TEACHER: A Hollywood Rock n’ Romance Trilogy Everyone deserves a second chance in life. After receiving yet another pink slip, teacher Jesse Martin is desperate for a way to make ends meet. When her principal offers her a Home Instructor position for the summer, she finds herself giving a second chance to an angry, reclusive, rock god living in the Hollywood Hills. Danny Black should have it all. But an unbalanced ex-wife, a troubled daughter, and a threat to his livelihood have him ready to make some major changes. Never one to back down from a challenge, he'll take on this stubborn, beautiful teacher who seems immune to his “gimme” smile, and attempt to win her heart in the process. Can Jesse accept that this time, offering someone a second chance will change her life as well? Will she embrace the life Danny is offering her and discover that when it comes to life’s lessons, sometimes love is the best teacher? This novel is for readers 18+ due to the hijinks of some hairy and perverted neighbors, a no-nonsense personal assistant with a foul mouth, a fragile pre-teen going through some real drama, and plenty of good, good lovin’. Add these together and you’ve got all the makings of a crazy, real-life Rock n’ Romance!",
