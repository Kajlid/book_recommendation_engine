  "title": "Madam President",
  "description": "It's the year 2020 and history has been made by Devlyn Marlowe--the first woman to win the U.S. Presidency. When it comes time to select a biographer to chronicle her historic term in office, Devlyn breaks with tradition and chooses a writer based on very personal reasons. She wants Lauren Strayer, a young author whose writing has always captivated her. There's only one problem--Lauren isn't interested in the job. Despite Lauren's reservations, the persuasive Commander-in-Chief is able to sway the author's opinion with the promise of true editorial freedom--a biographer's dream come true. Realizing that the opportunity of a lifetime awaits her, Lauren reluctantly accepts the position and soon finds herself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue alongside the First Family. Caught up in the frenzy of life at the White House, Lauren begins to unravel the complex woman that is the President and finds herself more intrigued by Devlyn with each passing day. Painfully realistic at times, funny, romantic, and endearing, Madam President is a drama set against one of the most dynamic backdrops imaginable and follows two lives destined to be entwined.",
