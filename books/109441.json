  "description": "What would you do if you thought your life got off to the wrong start? Leah Holden thinks she can erase her past when she packs up her two girls and flies six thousand miles to be with her husband Mike at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Even though she realizes this move means four more years in a loveless marriage, inside the pull for adventure is strong. She needs to find what's missing in her life. Shortly after her arrival, she meets a young enlisted man who talks of poetry, dreams, and Jungian philosophy. And before long she finds herself in the center of a storm she created. Can you change your destiny with only one decision, or can you change it at all?",
