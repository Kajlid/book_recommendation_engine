  "description": "Mateo Morelli.The mere mention of his name is enough to strike fear into the hearts of grown men. The most ruthless crime lord in Chicago isn’t a man you dare cross. But when the second most feared crime lord shows up on my doorstep the night of my husband’s wake, he doesn’t give me much of a choice. My late husband owed Antonio Castellanos a lot of money, but the magnanimous boss is gonna do me a solid—I get to pay my debt, and keep my daughter alive. All I have to do is one little favor.That favor?Seduce and kill Mateo Morelli.**PLEASE NOTE: These are not standalones. Mateo’s story starts in Accidental Witness (and continues in Once Burned). If you don’t read Accidental Witness first, you will not have the background you need on his character and you won’t follow his story very easily. ***",
