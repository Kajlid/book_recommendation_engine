  "description": "In the distant future, climate change and pole shifts have nearly destroyed life on earth. Time travel scientists thoroughly scan history, hoping to discover an event that could alter the distant past, thereby saving the future-and their present. When they discover that event-the death of a boy in the 1800s-a powerful military leader travels back in time. Can that leader save the boy-and lead the earth into a better future? Inspired by current events as well as elements of American history, Gabriel F.W. Koch has written a page-turning science-fiction novel.",
