  "description": "Cultures clash, sparks fly, love blooms, people die, and two kids, one a little bit punk and the other way too country, see their lives changed forever. Stormy Jones has to spend summers with her father, an Everglades park ranger. Thinking it might build character, he drags her along to fight an Everglades fire and promptly loses her when it gets out of control. Stormy is helpless in the Natural World until Nokosee stumbles upon her. Raised deep in the Everglades, Nokosee has never seen a white person before, much less one with \"sky eyes and flamingo hair.\" Built like a bronze Adonis, 17-year-old Nokosee and Stormy begin a series of amazing adventures as a modern day \"Tarzan and Jane\" and it's only a matter of time before they fall into a libido fueled mixed-up kinda love. Too bad for them. Nokosee's father is certifiably deranged. Nokosee is the first of the \"New Seminole\" whom he is grooming to take back the \"Outside.\" The last thing he wants is for his son to fall for an \"Outsider.\" You can learn more",
