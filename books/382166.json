  "description": "It is the first day of school in Chad, Africa. Children are filling the road. \"Will they give us a notebook?\" Thomas asks. \"Will they give us a pencil? Will I learn to read?\" But when he and the other children arrive at the schoolyard, they find no classroom, no desks. Just a teacher. \"We will build our school,\" she says. \"This is our first lesson.\" James Rumford, who lived in Chad as a Peace Corps volunteer, fills these pages with vibrant ink-and-pastel colors of Africa and the spare words of a poet to show how important learning is in a country where only a few children are able to go to school.",
