  "description": "The feminist revolution was supposed to make us feel better about ourselves, bringing us greater fulfillment and freedom. Yet many of us are feeling anything but fulfilled and free. Across generational lines, inside the church and out, we are understanding that we have lost the beauty and wonder of our distinctive makeup and calling as women. We are realizing that what was supposed to lift us up has been tearing down society, churches, and most importantly, our own families. There is now a new movement spreading its seeds--seeds of hope, humility, obedience, and prayer. It is a call to return to godly womanhood, and it is resonating in the hearts of women everywhere. Let its truth ring in your heart through the powerful messages of these seven beloved teachers: Nancy Leigh DeMoss, Susan Hunt, Mary A. Kassian, Carolyn Mahaney, Barbara Hughes, P. Bunny Wilson, and Dorothy Patterson. They approach the subject of womanhood from different angles and teaching styles, but throughout there runs a thread. One that will instill itself in your spirit. A thread of joy and delight with the greatness of God's created order and the part He wants you to play in His grand redemptive plan.",
