  "description": "\"Why is it we do the things we do?\"Dalgaz Tav is a professional slaver, entrusted for many years now with acquiring the most beautiful young women and training them for the erotic appetites of Taj Rad, the ruler of Xhagia and all the worlds of its wide, interstellar empire. Among Dalgaz's latest captives is Christine Beringer, a young American woman with an ethereal beauty that, if properly cultivated, will be certain to satisfy his imperial majesty's deepest lusts.And so Christine is subjected to all the manipulation Dalgaz Tav can muster, and all the perverse violations known to his profession, in an effort to transform her into the most wanton of slave girls, making real many of the deep, submissive fantasies she has kept hidden for so long. To her horror she discovers that he has ways, this slaver does, to make her submit, to make her beg, and soon she finds herself hungering for his touch and more, her sense of shame discarded as she is brought into an erotic world of power and desire where her small, lovely body is merely a plaything for those who own her.But as he trains her, Dalgaz Tav realizes that she is awakening emotions in him that he had never suspected were there, a growing passion and desire for the emperor's new slave girl that he dares not admit could be, and made all the more frightening because he senses that she feels the same for him....Includes m√©nage/orgy, questionable consent, and wet, graphic sex and bondage.Book 1 of 4.",
