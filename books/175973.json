  "description": "On the 50th Anniversary of the start of America's commitment of major combat units to Vietnam, Youth In Asia is a new novella of young Americans trapped in the jungles of Vietnam's Central Highlands in a war they did not understand.  \n  Youth In Asia relives the friendships, loyalties and betrayals of young men in combat.\nWritten by an infantryman who served as both an enlisted man and an officer after the war, Youth In Asia presents a realistic account of five men of the 173rd Airborne Brigade separated from their unit in the darkness of a jungle night. After the furious fight for Hill 875 and the battles around Dak To, this story is set near the border with Cambodia as North Vietnamese Army units and Viet Cong irregulars are massing for the brutal Tet Offensive of 1968 that broke the back of America's war effort.It is a story of determination, triumph and loss. It is a story of furious, close combat in lethal firefights, and it is a story of confusion both on the battlefield and in the minds of young men a million miles from their homes. Those that survive will have changed. Forever.",
