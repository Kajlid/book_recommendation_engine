  "description": "Everything I ever thought I knew about him, everything I thought he wanted was a lie.  Imagine one day calling your boyfriend, the love of your life, the man you planned to marry and have kids with only to find out his phone has been disconnected, and he’s joined the military.  How could someone love you if they ran away?  That was four years ago when he shattered my heart into a million pieces and today I find that same man on my doorstep… pleading for forgiveness and my hand in marriage.  Our relationship isn’t what I dreamt it would be. The only way to see it through is to keep the past pain buried and protecting my heart. It shouldn’t be hard when he’s half a world away, but when tragedy strikes causing Holden to come back to me half the man he was when he left...  I must decide if he’s worth giving a second chance. With a past as checkered as ours, I’m not sure love will ever exist again.  Unsteady in Love is a stand-alone in the Fairlane series. The series has crossover characters from each novel.
