  "description": "As fictional characters go, few embody such striking contradictions as cardsharp Elias Jewish by birth, he joins the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Indeed, the question of duality runs deep through this novel â€” not only is Elias a Jew defending the right to oppress a people, but after he helps to commit a horrific crime, he finds himself unexpectedly overtaken by the power of love. Exploring themes of literature, redemption, atonement, and love, this novel delivers a startling dose of moral ambiguity, keen insights into the human condition, and unexpected moments that devastate with their casual simplicity.",
