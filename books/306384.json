  "description": "On a war-torn planet orbiting a dying sun, Noor Malatesta roams the desert, hunting after the killers who gunned her down and left her for dead. But to finally settle old scores, she must also atone for her past by destroying a creature hell-bent on devouring the stars. Time’s running out. As the Black Dawn shadows the horizon, Noor soon realizes that to get revenge, she’ll have to face the woman she loves—the enemy Noor fears most. Only death pays for justice in this tomb world. \"Grimly riveting, Black Dawn recounts one heroine's journey of revenge in a world forged in blood and fire. This is excellent storytelling, fast-paced and action-packed.\" — Christopher Clancy, author of We Take Care of Our Own James W.
