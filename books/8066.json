  "description": "A New Twist On One of The World s Oldest Stories For years, Bret and Sara Vreeland have encountered various obstacles in their family s finances and health. They always seem one step away from a breakthrough. When an unexpected $7,000,000 lands in their laps, they believe God has answered their prayers--but not all is as it seems. In fact, Satan is conducting an experiment. In the Book of Job, Satan received permission from God to test Job by putting him through various trials. Ultimately, this worked in God s favor. Now Satan seeks God s permission to bless the Vreeland family and to see if their good fortune will cause them to forget God, no longer dependent on His daily presence. One Step Away is a modern tale of believable characters given an unbelievable blessing. Only time will tell if it will draw them one step closer to God? Or one step away?",
