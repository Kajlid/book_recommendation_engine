  "description": "Born into a wealthy New York City family, Kate Tyler never fit in with high society...and became a nurse to tend to the desperate poor of the Depression. Offered the chance to work in a large California hospital, Kate departs for the West-and is kidnapped right off the cross-country train and held for ransom in the most lawless part of Texas. Her only hope lies with Tate Castle, a struggling rancher who will rescue this city woman to repay a favor from a friend. With a young daughter to raise and heartbreak in his own past, this ex-tracker is not about to take any more risks than necessary. But the pretty blonde shows she has more grit than he thought, sparking an attraction he never saw coming. All the while a relentless villain vows to derail Kate for good.",
