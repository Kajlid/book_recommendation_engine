  "description": "The author of Fat Girls and Lawn Chairs is back with a funny and poignant new collection of personal stories about growing up a misfit.A collection of stories for anyone who shuddered at the idea of senior prom, Revenge of the Paste Eaters is about the way the experiences of childhood stay with us and shape us into adults.Cheryl Peck applies her signature wit to more personal stories and reflections-about hurting people and getting hurt, about discovering who you are and who you want to be, about feeling \"not good enough,\" and about being bigger-physically and mentally-than many of the people surrounding you.This is a wickedly funny view of what it's like to be a middle-aged woman in middle-America, and what really happened to the kids who were different.",
