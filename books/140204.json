Kennedy celebrated his victory in the California Democratic primary with a rousing victory speech anticipating a successful run for the presidency. Moments later, gunshots shattered that like his brother before him, Bobby Kennedy lay mortally wounded at the hand of an assassin. The police quickly apprehended Sirhan Sirhan, who the world believed had single-handedly masterminded the shooting.

Based on research he undertook for a documentary that will debut this year, O’'Sullivan poses such key questions The recent release of the film Bobby , the 40th anniversary of the shooting, and O’'Sullivan’s upcoming documentary have created renewed interest in the subject, and readers who accepted the conventional wisdom will have their beliefs shaken.",
