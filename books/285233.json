  "description": "These adorable service puppiesare matchmakers in the making...Dawn Vasquez never takes life too seriously. But when she rescues a golden retriever named Gigi, Dawn begins to imagine what it'd be like to settle down and let someone rely on her for a change. Unfortunately, Adam Dearborn--a handsome, hopelessly buttoned-up cattle rancher in need of a guide dog--has also fallen in love with the little ball of fluff and stubbornly insists that no other animal will do.Adam isn't sure what drives him to fight to keep Gigi for himself, but he suspects it has something to do with his growing--and unfortunate--attachment to Dawn. Her whirlwind spirit and sunny disposition might make her a delight to be around, but they also make her unsuited for the difficult life of a rancher. He should be able to put her out of his head. But what's a love-struck cowboy to do when what he wants and what he needs have never seemed so far apart? And can he allow himself to take a chance on everything Dawn has to offer: puppy kisses, puppy love...and her.Service Puppies Series: Puppy Love (Book 1)Puppy Christmas (Book 2)Puppy Kisses (Book 3)",
