  "title": "Assume A Position: Considerations and Interviews",
  "description": "This is a collection of reviews of fiction and non-fiction by such authors as Anne Finger, Lance Olsen, Rosa Liksom, Hilton Obenzinger, and Thomas Glavinic, as well as interviews with Sam Savage, Michelle Butler Hallett, and S.D. Chrostowska. “[The] breadth of [Bursey’s] reading is impressive... lending credibility and authority to his reviews, both individual reviews of books he has clearly carefully considered (both text and context) and the assembled reviews as a whole, which collectively leave the impression that their author reads comprehensively across formal and linguistic boundaries, and against the grain of entrenched assumptions about what books are worthy of our attention.” Daniel Green, The Reading Experience",
