  "description": "Everything has a reflection...And there's another side to every storyWhen offering to drive her brother to Byron Bay to escape the bitter Blue Mountain's winter, Sidney neglects to mention her planned detour to the small seaside town of Watercolour Cove.Thirty-five years earlier, Watercolour Cove is a very different place. Two brothers are working the steep, snake-infested slopes of a Coffs Coast banana plantation. Seventeen-year-old David does his share, but the budding artist spends too much time daydreaming about becoming the next Pro Hart and skiving off with the teasing and tantalisingly pretty Tilly from the neighbouring property. His older brother, Matthew, has no time for such infatuations. His future is on the land and he plans to take over the Greenhill plantation from his father.Life is simple on top of the mountain for David, Matthew and Tilly until the winter of 1979 when tragedy strikes, starting a chain reaction that will ruin lives for years to come. Those who can, escape the Greenhill plantation. One stays - trapped on the mountain and haunted by memories and lost dreams. That is, until the arrival of a curious young woman, named Sidney, whose love of family shows everyone the truth can heal, what's wrong can be righted, the lost can be found, and ...there's another side to every story.Get it as an ebook now https://books2read.com/ap/RWKlqv/Jenn...
