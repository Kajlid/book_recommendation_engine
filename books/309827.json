  "description": "I sent her a basket of cheese. But in my defense, it was gourmet cheese… you know, the expensive stuff.How did I, Wesley Morgan, hotel billionaire and recovering alcoholic, end up sending a woman a basket of cheese?Well, it was only one of two morsels of information I knew about Shayla Mitchel that I thought would get her attention.The bartender across the dimly lit club took me by surprise the moment I saw her, but then I ran into her twice more upon my return to Santa Barbara, California, and that’s when I knew I didn’t stand a chance.You see, I never expected Shayla. I was on a mission to correct my mistakes and make amends for the choices I made over six years ago, and then we crossed paths and turned down a road we both never saw coming.And of course, I couldn’t fall head-over-heels for an easy woman.No.I had to be drawn to the sass and poise of a girl who doesn’t believe in love, at least the kind that comes from a man like me.Now she’s all I can think about. All I never knew I needed. But she’s putting up a fight and testing us both.Can I convince her to let me in? Can I convince myself that we both deserve happiness?But most importantly, can I convince her that sometimes good people can cause irreparable harm before they can cultivate good?",
