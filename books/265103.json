  "title": "Hunted by Shadows",
  "description": "They say not to jump at shadows. That’s all well and good, but what if you are being hunted by one?  Trying to escape her past, Ari is working to atone for her actions and have a normal human life. The only problem with that? She isn’t human. Unlike most werewolves, she avoids as much contact with the supernatural world as possible, building a life for herself in the human world.  Until one day her past catches up with her, and she is forced to immerse herself in the supernatural world. Offered protection from the local wolf pack, she is forced to accept it, but nothing in the supernatural world comes for free.  For highly independent lone wolf Ari, this is her worst nightmare, especially as several Alpha males start vying for her affections. Ari will have to decide whether her independence is more important to her than her life.  *Please note this is an 18+ reverse harem novel and may include triggers for some readers*",
