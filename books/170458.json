  "title": "Forever Between",
  "description": "Four year ago the world was destroyed by medical nanites gone awry, leaving humanity divided into three groups: the living, deaders, and the horrific in-betweeners. Two years ago, Emily braved that dangerous world to try and save a group of children trapped downtown. Now, it’s Veronica’s turn to try and save Emily in return. Their only hope lies eighty miles away at a military hospital where nanite treatments were once given. Between Veronica and that hospital is a world of deaders, in-betweeners and possibly something even worse…humans.Forever Between is book two in the exciting post-apocalyptic trilogy, Between Life and Death. With mild language and occasional violence, (and some very gross undead), this series is suitable for ages 16 and up.",
