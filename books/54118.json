  "description": "A cartoon character is ruining my love life! Yes, it's true. I'm the voice of Maggy Hoot, the wisecracking owl from the hit animated series \"Arborville.\" And as soon as any cute or eligible or even \"breathing\" guy realizes what I do for a living, the relationship is over before it's started.I'm actually Lindy Edwards, a smart, educated woman who would really like to get past the third date with a nice Christian man without having to give a hoot-owl impersonation. Is that too much to ask?",
