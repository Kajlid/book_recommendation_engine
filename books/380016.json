Property, wealth, and only those things that will further the avarice of the townspeople are all that matters—and anyone who sees that which could bring joy back to the world is deemed a halfwit...or worse. As the immortal wanderer Indigo and her wolf companion Grimya struggle against the sadness that seems to surround these dour folk, one fact becomes crystal clear.There is happiness to be found in Joyful Travail...but will Indigo have to destroy all who live in the village to truly set them free?",
