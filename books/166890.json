  "description": "This is the story of Pani Dewicka and her descendants. In many regards she is but a symbol of those who have struggled under cruel regimes that have invaded other countries. For it is written that we were all once strangers in a strange land. This is a multigenerational story detailing the struggles of a ethnic family that eventually immigrates to the United States. The saga references actual places, people and events. It is none-the-less a work of fiction. Certain real incidents have been altered or re-imagined in the telling of this tale.",
