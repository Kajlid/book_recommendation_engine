  "description": "COMING 01.11.16When it was good, it was great.When it was bad, it was worse.My life turned into a whirlwind of destruction before I even got the chance to love her.She could have been my angel, my saving grace; I never gave her the chance.I gave myself a taste of her angelic kiss, convincing her to love with everything she had. Then I destroyed her. I destroyed both of us and I felt nothing as I did it.I didn't feel anything in my sorry state.We both had secrets and both of them would have destroyed us in one way or another. Hers could have possibly been bigger than mine, but I doubted it from the start.I knew I had the quality of devastation within me the entire time.After all,I'm the king of lies. I'm the king of addiction. I'm the king of turmoil. I'm the king of motherfucking heartbreak.",
