  "description": "In the rubble of the world lies Hydra, an integration of all previous nations of Earth. Many years ago, The Catastrophe devastated the planet, and from the ashes rose the Hexad, a ruthless dictatorship. Now citizens of Hydra live in fenced cities, called The White, and are forbidden to cross the barriers into The Black. Eighteen-year-old Alexis Cybria, about to be forced into an arranged marriage, wins a seat on one of the rare flights leaving her city. What she thinks will be her final week of freedom becomes a fight for the survival of the human race alongside Captain Sevan Hunter of The Seventh Column, the Rebel resistance. Amidst a rebellion and rumors of an alien invasion, Alexis learns the truth about the world, and discovers the paranormal abilities that make her the most valuable person alive. The Fractures will be continued in the sequel, Seizure.",
