  "description": "*On KindleUnlimited*My client is in jail for a crime she didn't commit and the prosecutor is driving me crazy.Â The first, and last, thing I need right now is a distraction, and this stunning angel to my right might be the answer to my prayers.Â \nLittle did I know just how right I was...\nðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤A Tempting Motion is an 8,000 word enemies-to-lovers romance about aÂ prosecutor and a defense attorney who refuse to back down in the courtroom and in the bedroom. Donâ€™t worry, despite their love/hate relationship these two somehow find an HEA. This short storyÂ is a standalone, but since fictional Ashland County is full of legal intrigue, some characters may appear in other stories written in the same universe.Â \n**A Tempting Motion is a steamy readÂ intended for a mature audience only (18+). It contains scenes that may be triggering for some, including, but not limited to, explicit descriptions of sex, drug trafficking, strong language, and physical violence. Reader discretion is advised.**",
