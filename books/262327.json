But it’s not what keeps me awake anymore. \n\nIt’s her. \n\nShe calls me, desperate and pleading. Like a shining star I can’t quite find. I feel those men from my nightmares coming for her. Only she can’t sense them—she can’t see. \n\nNot the past. \n\n\n\nOr the future…unlike me.\n\nUntil one day as I stood in a doorway in the barren wasteland in Afghanistan with my squad at my back…my star dimmed, and sputtered out. I have two holes in my chest now. One which bears her name. \n\nI have to find her. I pray I’m not too late. First I have to find the others, two more guys like me. \n\nTogether we seek a North Star.  One we were born half in love with.Leading us back home. Without ever knowing we were lost at all.
