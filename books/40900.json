Eventually she escapes Sebastianus as she discovers how diabolical he truly is, however, life on her own is seldom easy.Much to her chagrin, she finds herself being cleverly seduced by a high school boy in 1980, the handsome John Diedermayer. As she becomes more entranced with John, her new “friend” Michelle begins to pry into her past. Michelle becomes more of a stalker than a supporter as the book builds to its climax.",
