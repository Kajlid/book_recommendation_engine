  "description": "an alternate cover edition can be found hereCheating boyfriend. Check. Broken down car. Check. Crappy motel. Check. Hot guys that want me to go on a road trip with them. Quadruple check.  I’ve never had much in my life, always been at the bottom of the barrel. I’m used to it. I get by with my looks and bubbly personality. I thought my life was going good, until I caught my boyfriend in bed with another girl. It was like a damn train wreck, ya know? I wanted to look away but I couldn’t stop watching.  Gross.   Things only start to look up when I decide- probably against better judgement- to join four random guys on a road trip. But not just any guys…hot guys. Like, really hot guys. Their annual vacation, my getaway from reality. Couldn’t be worse than what I’ve already been through…could it? I mean, what could go wrong on a road trip with four hot men?  The guys- Maddox, Lenny, Callan & Alec. They’ve spent countless years searching, falling apart to almost nothing. None of them have much left to give, until they hit one lucky town. Friday is who they've been looking for, but how do they tell her? How do they tell her what they are…what she is?   **This is Book 1 in The Road to Truth Series**  ---DISCLOSURE--- This is a paranormal reverse harem story. There is adult content. There is m/m action. If any of this offends you, do not buy this book.",
