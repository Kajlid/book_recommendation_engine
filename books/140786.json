  "description": "The summer of her twenty-first birthday, Mary is thrilled to be taking the trip of her dreams, to Scotland to walk in the land of her ancestors. However, when she makes the mistake of taking a jaunt though the wood alone, she finds out just what happens to a girl alone in the pitch dark of the wood. She is wracked with fear as she hears footsteps nearing her. Suddenly, Mary is apprehended and taken somewhere against her will. But when she discovers it is only a group of pagan women intent on showering her with pleasure, she relaxes and gives herself over to them. Little does she know she is only being lavishly prepared for her rare purity to be claimed by Cernunnos, the Horned God of the Forest. When she is faced with this great horned God, Mary is terrified, even as the newfound ache in her body is mounting with his very presence.",
