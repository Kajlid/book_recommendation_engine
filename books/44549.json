  "title": "Shepherd Girl: A Dog Story",
  "description": "In the style of James Thurber's \"The Dog Department\" meets \"Marley and Me\", \"Shepherd A Dog Story\" chronicles the exploits of Athena, a silly long-coated German shepherd. Athena is goofy, clumsy, and vain, and although she successfully foils a strangerâ€™s abduction of the author in a dark parking lot, she also finds time to chase lawn gnomes, strip the author topless at the Dog Park, and play-bow to stuffed toys at an age when she should know better. Athena is at times exasperating and certainly no perfect replica of Rin Tin Tin, but the underlying love and devotion between dog and author are undeniable. For all who have loved a dog, Shepherd A Dog Story will remind them why. \"If you've ever considered bringing home the spunky little German shepherd puppy that caught your eye, you might think again after reading Cat Needham's hilarious recount of one frenzied moment after another with Athena.\" - Bob Tarte, Author of \"Enslaved by Ducks\" and \"Fowl Weather\"",
