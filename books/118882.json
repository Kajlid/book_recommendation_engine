  "title": "After Hours",
  "description": "This bestselling book was the basis for the thrilling film \"Carlito's Way\" starring Academy Award winners Al Pacino and Sean Penn, directed by Brian De Palma. Carlito Brigante, often described as the Puerto Rican Godfather, was just released early from a thirty year prison stretch due to a technicality discovered by his lawyer and longtime friend, David Kleinfeld. Older and wiser, Carlito has been cured and has given up the gangster lifestyle. The only problem is Kleinfeld is up to his neck with the mafia and needs a favor, but as Carlito says, \"A favor can kill you faster than a bullet.\" Can Carlito save up the money he needs to get out for good or will the D.A., the mafia, and the street catch up to him?",
