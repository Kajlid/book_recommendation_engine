  "description": "No cliffhanger, Dark Romance, HEATalia: Only a fool would agree to parlay with dark elves on false pretenses. Still, my father's men had struck first, and now Adan, the dark elf captain, had me on my knees after the short and regrettable battle with my father's soldiers. Adan glared at me with such rage that, at first, I feared he would strike me. Yet, he only clasped my chin and stroked my lips with his thick thumb. My mouth parted of its own accord. As much as I feared his power, I also knew that I wanted him and would do anything to prove it.Adan: The treachery of Talia's father fills me with fury. Still, Talia smells so ripe and ready that I know she'll make a fine thrall. Still, an imprudent elf is a dead elf. Before I can fully claim her, she needs discipline. Ah, I can barely wait to return to Stone City to begin her training. Of course, I will certainly allow my two bond brothers to share in the responsibility and the fun.Trigger warning: Captive of the Dark Elves is a steamy dark romance with reverse harem, bondage, spanking, and domination themes. Only read it if you enjoy that type of thing.",
