  "description": "Molly Lou Melon is short, clumsy, has buck teeth, and a voice that sounds like a bull-frog being squeezed by a boa constrictor... But she doesn't mind.Her grandmother has always told her to walk proud, smile big, and sing loud, and she takes that to heart.But then Molly Lou has to start in a new school. A horrible bully picks on her on the very first day, but Molly Lou Melon knows just what to do about that...\nPatty Lovell\n has gotten the best advice from her mother since she was a little girl. The most important thing she ever told her was: be true to yourself. Patty has taught elementary school in Virginia, London, Harlem, and on Long Island. As of writing this book, she teaches kindergarten in Great Neck, New York, and lives in Sea Cliff. This is her first picture book.\nDavid Catrow\n is the illustrator of many picture books, including \nHow Murray Saved Christmas (2000)\n and two New York Times best illustrated books: \nShe's wearing a Dead Bird on Her Head (1995)\n and The Cataract of Lodor (1991). He was drawn to this story because of Molly Lou's positive attitude, and the image he created was inspired by a tiny, premature baby girl named Emily Anne. Her energy and zest for life have made sure her size hasn't gotten in her way. David lives with his family in Springfield, Ohio, right next door to Emily.",
