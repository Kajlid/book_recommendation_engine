Hockey fans adore him. Girls everywhere want to worship at his skates. He’s living the dream. If the dream involved everyone expecting you to be nothing but a jock. These two rich kids could be the perfect couple. If he didn't think she was a spoiled princess, and she didn't think he was a dumb puck, they might be. But hating someone doesn’t mean you can’t want them.",
