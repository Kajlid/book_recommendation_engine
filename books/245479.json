  "description": "A Billionaire Holiday RomanceThis Christmas, Willow has only one thing on her list—Con Romero, but it will take more than a bough of holly and a sprig of mistletoe to capture him.  Billionaire Con Romero has hated Christmas for three years. Every whiff of evergreen and every jingle bell reminds him of how much he wants something he can never have.  At age eighteen, Willow Kaplan might be legal, but she's still forbidden.   Although a virgin, Willow has always been more naughty than nice. And more than anything, she wants to belong to Con. Now she just has to convince the stubborn billionaire that she's the best Christmas present he will ever receive.",
