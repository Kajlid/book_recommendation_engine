  "description": "Mind her own business? Leave it to the experts? Not a chance. …especially when asked to spy on her friend's strangely behaving husband, Eugene, at one of San Francisco's hottest nightclubs. When Sophie shows up in a short red cocktail dress and the potentially two-timing hubby shows up dead, the would-be sleuth launches a full investigation. Without warning, Sophie plunges into a world of political mudslinging and campaign cover-ups. She uncovers some pretty dirty secrets, including a certain conservative congressional hopeful's involvement in the \"Furry\" community—a group with a fetish for mascot-sized animal costumes. Sex and politics, wouldn't you know? Sophie knows she needs help, and turns to P.I. (and ex-boyfriend) Anatoly Darinsky. Together they set out to discover who killed Eugene and why. Their professional relationship may be repaired, but what will this very unusual case do for their personal one?",
