  "description": "How far would you go to climb the corporate ladder? How far could you fall?Frank Donnelly and Jim Collins are newcomers at Ilium Electric, where dreams are made and shattered in equal measure. It’s the late 60s, and Ilium is in a position to shape the future of the American Dream. Where do Donnelly—a former fire marshal—and Collins—an ex-cop—fit in?Naturally, at the bottom of the barrel.While chasing an assignment that could only be handed down to the lowest of the low on Ilium’s totem pole, these two men come across a project that could work wonders for their new company, and their place within it. Sure, a mobile electric chair—an “Electrified Comfort Chair”—might seem dangerous, with an extremely limited clientele at first, but that’s where Donnelly and Collins come in.Their job is sell the product. To their bosses, and to the public.When tragedy strikes at the first public unveiling of this new luxurious piece of new-age comfort, however, things get more complicated. How can you sell a product that can kill so easily? Especially when no one knows how it happened, or whom to blame?This is the job that Donnelly and Collins didn’t know they signed up for. This is corporate America.This is ILIUM.",
