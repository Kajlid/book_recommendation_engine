  "description": "* New edition of one of the greatest works on shooting * A classic, perennial bestseller A Shooting Man's Creed, the field memoirs of Sir Joseph Nickerson, is now widely appreciated as a classic sourcebook in the literature of shooting. This new edition includes a revised introduction by his daughter, Rosie Whitaker. A Shooting Man's Creed was first published in 1989 shortly before Sir Joseph Nickerson's death. He had finally put down his knowledge and expertise about shooting and all that it entails for countryside conservation so that others could benefit from the lessons he had learned. With a foreword by the Duke of Westminster, this book makes use of Sir Joseph Nickerson's unique collection of personal records covering more than 60 years and provides advice on every aspect of the increasingly popular sport of wing shooting.",
