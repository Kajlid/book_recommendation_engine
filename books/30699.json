  "title": "The Friar's Map of Ancient America 1360 AD: The Story of Nicholas of Lynn and the Franciscan Map of America",
  "description": "English Franciscans mapped North America 1330-1360. The result was the first scientific map of the New World. Roger Bacon conceived the project; Pope Clement endorsed it in 1265; Oxford deans trained friars in surveying; and King Edward III launched the effort in 1360. Thus, Edward's great-grandson, Prince Henry of Portugal, knew the location of Florida in 1420. Contains hundreds of illustrations including the \"Friar's Map\" which the author found in 1995.",
