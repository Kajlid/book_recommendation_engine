  "description": "The Game Series, Book 3.5\n\n“In that moment, I stopped caring about right and wrong.”\n\n\nThe only thing that stood between us were the boundaries set by others, by society, by our parents. But together we could knock them down. Together, we could find freedom and live life on our own terms. Screw the rest of the world. He was all that mattered. He was the air that I breathed.\n\nIt’s recommended that you read Breathless, book three in the standalone series The Game Series, before you sink your teeth into River and Reese’s prequel.Available on Smashwords and Cara Dee's website only.",
