  "description": "Bonds of friendship exist eternally within the confines of children's hearts. Neither a move to a new town nor an unthinkable expiry can remove the bond that joins true friends together. Not even when one becomes a zombie. Matt doesn't allow the death and reawakening of his best bud Tate to dissuade him from adventures of youth. In the ABC's of Zombie Friendship the lads remain close and the alphabet expresses their bond one letter at a time.",
