  "description": "Horace is a loner, a mountain man with a claim to a tiny stream of gold and a lonely cabin in the woods. When he finds young Walker wandering lost in his mountains just before the snow flies, he decides he's found exactly the kind of companionship he craves. Walker is young, naive, and totally unprepared for the kinds of amusements Horace has in store for him. Good thing he's willing to try new things, because Horace has a stern hand and a fine sense of adventure, showing Walker things he'd never dreamed of. But what will come when the spring thaw melts all that snow?",
