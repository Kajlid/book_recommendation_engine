  "title": "Versunkene Städte - Die 50 bedeutensten archäologischen Entdeckungen der Welt",
  "description": "Spectacular photographs are reinforced with rediscovered sketches and sprightly text in this magnificent exploration of 50 great archaeological discoveries in every part of the world. What separates this from previous collections is attention not only to architecture and artifacts but also to history, lifestyles, and how these cities functioned. Fourteen contributors lend their expertise to the narrations, photographs, and maps, re-creating not just the archaeological record, but the spirits of these cities and towns where flesh-and-blood people once lived and loved, worked and worshiped, staved off intruders and raised their families. Many cities are shown as they originally flourished, along with contemporary photographs. This is a lavish book covering a fascinating subject...a perfect gift, sure to be appreciated. 9\" x 11\". Color & b&w illus.",
