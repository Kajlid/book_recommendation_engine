  "description": "The music industry held nothing but sparkling promise when I was sixteen. But now I’m twenty-one and know better. In its darkest corners hides an evil I couldn’t imagine. When my pain becomes too much, I take control the only way I know how—a handful of pills. That plan backfires, and now my reputation is in tatters. My band quit, and my label is forcing me to make up the shows I missed—with interest. Now, the only band willing to work with me includes my ex-best friend, who's hell-bent on making my life miserable. He twists the lyrics that leave my lips until they burn. Then there’s his three bandmates. They somehow see my inner turmoil when nobody else does, and are determined to ease it in their own unique ways. The pills didn't end me, but I think this industry might. Can I take control of my life, or will everything finally consume me?",
