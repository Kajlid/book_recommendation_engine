  "description": "She was mine before I even knew her name... FelixWhen I first saw Maggie, I knew we'd be the best of friends. I wanted that desperately, wanted her in my life, and I'd do anything to make sure that happened.Until Maggie came in my life I didn't know what love was.She'll be my first and last.I'll be her only. MaggieI didn't know I could have a friendship like the one I have with Felix. But the friend-zone wall has always been in place. Being too afraid to cross it, I'd rather be in Felix's life than tarnish the relationship we have.Too much time has passed. I'm done being afraid of the what-ifs. I'm ready to admit how I feel for him, consequences or not. FelixMaggie doesn't know the lengths I'll go to keep her in my life, but she will, because the very idea of her with someone else is not something I'll even entertain. She's always been mine, and it's time I step up and show her how much I love her.My devotion for her goes to the very depths of my soul, and staying back as she lives her life without me by her side is absolutely not an option.I know once I finally have her in all ways it'll be the most explosive experience of my life.Warning: This story is so sweet (and of course dirty) it might give you a stomachache, but it will be worth it. It's short, with detailed first-time sexiness, and features a virgin hero and heroine that know exactly what they are doing between the sheets.**And for a very limited time Virgin, an equally sugary story about falling in love and saving yourself for that one person, is included at the end of Say You're Mine (due to Virgin being included at the back of this book, Say You're Mine ends at 52%.)**",
