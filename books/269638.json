By day, she was confident, businesslike and somewhat starchy. But off the clock, she shed the business suit, put on her Wellies, picked up a spade and dug in the dirt. Not that anybody knew this. Drawing a firm line between work and her personal life was Jen’s mantra for success. One of Jen’s work priorities was coaching her socially awkward CEO boss through his daily interactions. John Lloyd relied on her to smooth his rough edges – especially with the pretty, single mom receptionist he can’t stop thinking about. Enter John’s brother - Ryan Lloyd.

Jenna Carlton and her prissy attitude annoy the snot out of him. Things between the two heat up when Ryan unexpectedly settles in the city while Jenna was matchmaking for her hot mess boss and the single mom. Jenna thinks Ryan is a jerk.Ryan thinks Jenna is an uptight you-know-what. John doesn’t know what to think. With more than one happily ever after in the cards Cupid In Heels has something for everyone!Cupid in Heels is a standalone romance.",
