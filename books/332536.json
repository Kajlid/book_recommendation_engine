  "description": "Apparently, I’m not a dragon.\nWhat I am is indestructible, capable of healing mortal wounds, and Alastair can never hurt me again. From what I’m understanding, he can’t even use his old tricks if he could manage to force them down my throat. I don’t know where he is, but I’m coming for him. He killed me and hurt Oisin.I’m home in the Unseelie Court. It’s beautiful but so different than everything I ever knew. I barely have time to see everything before I have to leave again. Shortly after Alastair’s attack, my mother’s ambassador in the Seelie Court went dark with her communications.It’s not just my job as a princess to make sure Nova is freed. I know how Finnan feels about snitches, but I want to look his parents in the eye when I tell them what he did to me. I might be new to everything regarding the Fae, but I knew what Alastair had done to me was reprehensible in both courts.\nAnd from what I was understanding, if the Seelie still didn’t want to deal with it, it was perfectly acceptable for an Unseelie woman to choose her revenge.",
