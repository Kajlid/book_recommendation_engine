  "title": "Mother God: The Feminine Principle to Our Creator",
  "description": "Sylvia Browne, in her own indomitable style, again defies convention in this uniquely informative compilation of diligently researched facts and personal accounts about the premise of a female divinity—namely, the Mother God (also known as the feminine principle). Spanning time from the earliest beginnings of humankind, when the time of the “Goddess” was at its peak, to the current era, with its myriad beliefs and religions, Sylvia takes us on a journey of discovery, where she discusses the suppression of the “Mother Goddess” by the male-dominated politics of modern-day religious dogma. Using a combination of historical data and poignant and heartwarming stories revealing the power and miracles attributed to the Mother God, Sylvia leads us from the question of “Does She exist” to the logical, fact-based conclusion that She does . . . and then shows us how to call upon Her to help us in our everyday lives.",
