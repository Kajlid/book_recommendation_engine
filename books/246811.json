  "title": "The Discovery of Genesis: How the Truths of Genesis Were Found Hidden in the Chinese Language",
  "description": "In this linguistic analysis, the two distinguished authors dissect Chinese characters to reveal that, according to their research, the ancient Chinese were aware of the God of Abraham and the Chinese were, possibly, a remnant of the Tower of Babel dispersion. The authors break down Chinese characters to provide a visual for learning how the story of the world's creation by the One True God is evident in the Chinese language.",
