  "description": "The interoperative code of our lives is secretive to us. Open-minded people cannot even see the lines of speech that drive us. We may analyze the \"demon\" and his placement, hidden, in our lives but only through the recourse of conversation will we be delivered. Paul Harris and M. J. Hewitt both exercised their talent in revealing an emotive, natural display of understanding while they created this book. The ultimate collection in perfect, synchronistic order, you may view a speechless beauty somewhere in the ebook.",
