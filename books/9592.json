  "title": "Following the Yellow Arrow: Younger Pilgrims on the Camino",
  "description": "The Camino de Santiago, famous for a thousand years, has drawn pilgrims from all over the world. They have come to celebrate their religious faith, to cleanse their souls, to resolve tensions in their personal lives, and to connect body and spirit. In this fresh contribution twenty-one writers share their adventures on the Camino, each looking for the revelation that has enriched their lives. As they hiked, they discovered answers to why they'd walked, what they'd learned, and how they'd changed. In this remarkable new book, the contributors - all of whom were pilgrims in their teens and twenties - reflect on the way the Camino allowed them to meet challenges, heal personal fractures, and connect with others. The essays they have written capture the spirit of the Camino with amazing fidelity.",
