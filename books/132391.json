  "description": "\"You said you didn't know me,\" I said, my voice coming out a lot gruffer than I'd intended. \"Lucas Goodspeed,\" I stuck out my hand and, after a moment's hesitation, she took it, her hand small and soft against my rough palm. \"23 years old, Full Forward for the Coastal Crocs, and your new one true love.\" I tried to inject a bit of humour into the last bit, but to be honest, I think it just came out sounding morose. She smiled slightly nevertheless and didn't pull away from me, instead choosing to follow my lead. \"Isobel Saunders, 21 years old, waitress at Crumbs Café, although since I didn't turn up this morning, I've probably been fired.\" She took a deep breath, glanced at Gary as if to convince herself there really was no other way, and finished all in a rush, \"and your new one true love.\" It's not easy to pretend you're in love for the sake of teenagers and housewives across the country, but top footballer Lucas Goodspeed and shy, romantic Isobel Saunders soon discover that convincing themselves that they're not in love might be even harder… Please note this story contains some mature language and content.",
