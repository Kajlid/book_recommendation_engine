  "title": "The House at Spaniard's Bay",
  "description": "When Kate and Lynn come to stay with Amabel at the lonely house at Spaniard's Bay they find more excitement than they expected. Who were the people who prowled about outside at night? What was the secret of the well house? How old was the coin from the sea? There were so many mysteries for them to solve, and all the time they had to keep a secret from their parents, and Amabel had to prove to Aunt Cassie and Nial, the sculptor, that she could earn her living as a painter. Judith the wandering tinker provides a link with old traditions, telling the girls the story of the Spaniard after whom the house and the bay were named and taking them to the cave in the mountain where they have the strangest experience of all.",
