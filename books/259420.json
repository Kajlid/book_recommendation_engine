Or solving quandaries of the heart?\nA wolf in the rain, an unexpected encounter, and the weirdest houseguest arrangement of my life all lead me back down the rabbit hole—or rather into the wolf’s den. I’m here for one purpose: saving the lives of my pack. My intentions are unshakable. My resolve to keep all my focus on this single agenda may, however, be another matter.\nThis is Book 4 in The Witch and the Wolf Pack series.",
