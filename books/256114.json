  "description": "When you’re looking for love in the wrong places, you miss what’s right under your nose.ClementineWhen my twin sister died, Mother Nature transferred her dove creature into me. I carry messages for Arthur, my new dragon master. Clare was devoted to her task. Me? I’m totally unfit for this gig. For one, flying doesn’t exactly come naturally. For another, it doesn’t pay wages. I don’t know about you, but a girl’s gotta eat. So, after delivering Arthur’s latest retort to Knight, a sexy, arrogant air dragon, no way am I following His Lordship’s order to stay at his house. I have bills to pay.KnightI can smell a lie a mile away. I know Arthur’s grand plan is to infiltrate the cyborgs’ highest circles, but his messenger bird is hiding something. I presume Arthur’s reasons for risking his life by refusing to leave my territory are, one, he’s not exactly stable, and two, his spirit lives nearby. Maybe he’s afraid I’ll steal her. He’s right. Because I can smell traces of her. Come hell or high winds, once I find her, I will make her mine.",
