  "description": "Nobody ever cares for second place.Talented public relations associate, Annie Scott, knows second place well. She has never been anyone’s priority and is sick of wallowing in self pity, sick of being an option. In a snap decision, she flees her hometown of Nashville for the unknown shores of Sydney, Australia. There she can be whoever she wants to be. Perhaps, the enforced solitude will give her back her identity and kickstart a new path in life.Professional surfer, Cam Hart, is home on leave from the Pro Tour, and in desperate need of some rest, relaxation and maybe, a little female company. All extremely achievable at his home in Bronte, Sydney. There will be women willing and waiting for him, of that he has no doubt. He’s never been a relationship kind of guy, and after his embarrassing defeat for the recent World Title, the idea of losing himself in between the sheets for some no-strings fun, definitely has appeal.Fate throws Cam and Annie in each other’s path. Their attraction to each other is immediate. Cam believes he has found the perfect girl to distract him for a few weeks, while Annie is ready to throw caution to the wind and dive into a holiday romance. The two drifting souls soon realise that their chemistry and passion is more than they bargained for.Cam has never wanted to entrust his heart to anyone again. But, with Annie, he sees that he may indeed want a future, a change from his impulsive and wild ways. Could Cam actually be capable of such change? Should Annie consider Cam to be more than a summer fling, or will she be bound by her insecurities and not believe him worth the risk? Will she return to her hometown, the same as she left it: alone.",
