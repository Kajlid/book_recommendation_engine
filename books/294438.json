He knew the sexy lady lawyer was trouble. He just had no idea how much.  Taken. Again. Lacy Carmichael on the other hand, was not new to the “Kidnap and Ransom” game. After all, when your father was one of the largest arms dealers in the world, danger comes with the territory, and she’d learned how to talk or fight her way out of almost anything. But this time Logan was grabbed with her, so she’ll have to reveal all her secrets in order to save both of their asses.  Searching for a way out of the mess, and fighting their mutual attraction, will take all of Logan’s and Lacy’s collective skills. Unfortunately, deception and betrayal by those they trust the most changes the rules of the game, and they find themselves battling for both their lives and their love.",
