  "description": "The nightmare is just beginning…Ricky Desmond doesn’t belong in the Brookline asylum. His parents sent him here because they think he’s a deviant—and that he can be cured—but Ricky knows there’s no cure for what he has.Soon after he arrives, Ricky learns that being locked up against his will is only the beginning of his problems. Rumor has it that the Brookline warden authorizes treatments that aren’t entirely…humane. That he’s a butcher, a monster. And if the screams Ricky hears coming from the basement are any indication, the rumors are an understatement. Now, with the help of a nurse who feels just as trapped in Brookline as he does, Ricky must escape before the asylum claims his sanity—or his life.",
