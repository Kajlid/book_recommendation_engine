  "description": "\"Poeltl's ability to weave romance, mystery, and pure science fiction-based subplots into one riveting adventure is what makes Cleo McCarthy: Time Travel And Other Impossible Things a one-of-a-kind reading experience.\" - Readers' Favorite 5-star reviewThe first time Cleo feared for her life was when she was diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s at 23. The second time is when she discovered she could travel back in time at 24. While she is offered guidance from fellow time traveler Franklin, she is plagued by a fragmented message transmitted through white noise. Cleo’s best friend Bobby, a physicist, is recruited to help her and Franklin make sense of what’s happening, but despite their successes, Cleo’s constant jumping backward in time delays their progress. Once the message is received in its entirety – and more than one harsh realization is discovered - the three friends race against time to right the wrongs disclosed in the cryptic message. But one of these friends is not like the others, offering an additional obstacle to an already impossible situation.Burdened with an unlimited number of do-overs, Cleo McCarthy finds herself asking, how much time is enough?",
