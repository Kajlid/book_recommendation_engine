Unfortunately, the horn doesn't come with her, and she doesn't know any other way back home, but that's not her biggest problem. That would be her brand new husband, and he's kind of scary. Her only hope is a crazy witch who knows something about catching unicorns. Which would be fine and dandy except, it's the crazy witch who introduced her to her husband. And then RAN OFF. She's going to get her for that.Unicorn Bait is a fun romp through a magical world filled with adventure, humor, and a little naughtiness.",
