Is my luck about to run out? Am I no longer a Shamrock? I also have huge bombs dropped on me, and yes you're right, it's totally Say Shamrock What? So if you're preparing to read my next diary, I'm warning you right now. It's full of sex, drama, hot men, bitchy best friends, secrets, ex's, and lot's of damn cursing. Oh the campus life!Jade the 'Not So Lucky Shamrock Out'",
