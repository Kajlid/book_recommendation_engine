  "description": "Poet Yvonne de la Vega's body of work is compiled in her first book. The book's Foreword is a wonderful contribution by Ray Manzarek of The Doors. An author himself, the forward is a beautifully written piece of prose that is an ode to Jim Morrison's \"City of Night\", as well as a promise that all who read Yvonne are in for \"a hell of a good time. \"Ray's apparent love for LA. is that common thread that runs through every LA Poet from Bukowski to Morrison, and he honors De la Vega's work from that familiarity of the city they've both shared a lifetime in. Ray muses that, \"Yvonne is the lucky little lady in the lights.\"",
