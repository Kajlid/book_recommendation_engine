  "description": "Be the Sun Again is the story of what happens when real love is absent in life and something else masquerades in its place. Told in a painful but resilient voice, Cicely's story will leave you wincing for understanding and wondering why love can sometimes be elusive where it is needed most. Brazenly and truthfully told, Teryn writes an emotionally vivid story of obsessions and addictions that girl children live but takes the soul of women years to try and forget. From prologue to the last sentence Be the Sun Again will leave you with an array of feelings to sort, characters to despise, and a hope for real love for those who need to know its embrace. Author- Tanis KwanetteBe the Sun Again delves deep inside the shadows of a psychotic race to the Utopian unfamiliar, jump-started by the seeds of pain. Author Teryn's hard-hitting foreword is a powerful statement of her unapologetic attitude regarding love, life, and personal responsibility. This daring story has the power to shred one's superficial and oppressive ideas about love and also challenges truth-seekers to contemplate the source.SJW Publishing Group",
