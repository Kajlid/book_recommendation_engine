  "description": "It's a fact: 27 percent of the Bible is devoted to prophecy. But most of us don't focus 27 percent of our personal Bible study on prophecy. Why? We're confused. Or intimidated. Or both. This book takes away a lot of the mystery—and \"all\" of the intimidation. From the creators of the Left Behind series—Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins—comes a truly astonishing book. User-friendly for the layperson. Remarkably complete for the scholar.",
