  "description": "He says I’m his fated mate.  I say I’m his fated enemy.  I was stripped of my royal title because of him. I was banished to a deserted island and left to die because of him.  Only when I’m his last option does he remember I exist at all. Now this cruel king is taking me captive to be his bride, join his people, and save his kingdom from a spreading plague.  The witch claims this is our destiny written in the magic of the flames and the waves of the sea. I choose my own destiny though. And I’ll drown in those cold waters than ever be bound to him.  Because he doesn’t need a fated fae mate. He needs a savior.  And I’d rather die than be either of those things for the Cruel King.  NOTE: The Cruel Fae King is a fiery, panty melting enemies to lovers tale intended for readers 18 and over.
