  "description": "When Spaulding agreed to go all the way, he thought it would quench Ender’s desire, not inflame it. But he couldn’t have fathomed just how insatiable Ender's lust might be, or how fiercely he too might fall into erotic obsession. As spring blooms on the Napier campus, Spaulding is consumed by games of sex and power—and haunted by the question of what it could mean to love another man. By gaining a place in Ender’s inner circle, he also begins to uncover a clandestine underbelly to Napier elite societies, private screenings, wild parties. But has his relationship with Ender become too conspicuous?Amid growing tension, the school year hurtles to a dramatic end, leaving Spaulding’s future—and Ender’s—in the balance.",
