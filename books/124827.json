  "title": "Confessions of a Self-Help Writer: The Journal of Michael Enzo",
  "description": "A ghost, a philanthropist, a con man, a devout Catholic, a gigolo, a savior, an heir, a common man, and an addict are just some of the words used to describe Michael Enzo, who some sources credit with ghost-writing more than 108 self-help books on behalf of celebrities, politicians and business leaders. After failing to make what he considered to be a positive impact on society he began to destroy those closest to him including Benjamin DeHaven, the author of this book, and former collaborator. Defrauding an industry for almost 20 years by exploiting people’s insecurities and profiting from them, more than likely these friends contributed more to the field of self-help, while profiting from it, than they will ever know. Believing they could only understand people’s problems by suffering along with them, they lived on the razor’s edge. If you've ever picked up a tell-all biography of a celebrity or a title from the self-help section at the bookstore, certainly you would question the source. Will Enzo ever come out of the Darkness?This is an inside look at the mind of Michael Enzo and it is the author’s hope that people will start helping themselves again after reading it.",
