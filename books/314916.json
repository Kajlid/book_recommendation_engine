Again. She’s tired of feeling like a failure, and she refuses to blame her ADHD the way her parents do every time she hits one of life’s speed bumps. This time, she’s going to let that speed bump actually slow her down, and jumps at the chance to visit her best friend―and Instagram influencer―Quincy in California. And she wouldn’t mind if that invitation also involved getting closer with Quincy’s brother, Pete.Millie’s best friends Kate and Bree send her to Peacock Bay with the little black dress they share, giving her the confidence she needs to make the move. But Peacock Bay is full of mega influencers who have perfected the look of the surf lifestyle, and a minor misunderstanding has Millie joining their ranks. Can Millie and her magical dress convince Pete to face the Bay with her, or will Millie’s time in California be another misstep on her way to figuring out exactly who she is?\n“Millie’s voice bursts off the page in this sparkling debut… You won’t want to put it down.” —Suzanne Park, author of So We Meet Again\n\n“A smartly written story of friendship and self-discovery paired with a hefty dose of wit and charm.
