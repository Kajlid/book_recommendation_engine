  "description": "On the surface, Thambi is a dutiful son and brother, but internally he questions the expectations of both his family and culture. He's met someone at work who just burns herself into his flesh and brain; the problem is that she's Canadian and white. Complicating everything is the fact that his father, after a 20 year absence, is finally coming over to join them from Sri Lanka. A Tamil version of Goodbye, Columbus, the story simultaneously tickles the funny bone and pulls on the heart strings.",
