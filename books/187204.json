His only hope is to find his soul mirror, or he’ll have to end his life. Once he touches the blood of gorgeous, smart and powerful Carla, she becomes a dangerous temptation he can’t resist. Is she his salvation or his destruction? A terrible triangle… Brilliant psychologist and witch Carla Fisk must work with Sutton to free her murdered sister’s soul trapped and tormented in a knife. As Carla and Sutton race to find the formidable psychic who has the knife, an irresistible desire binds them in a bond of passion. But their growing love is threatened when Carla is forced into an impossible choice between her beloved twin sister, and the man who owns her heart. How does she choose? Is Love Really Enough? When sinister forces unite to kill Carla, and cast her and her sister’s soul into a dark void, Sutton is driven to savage extremes to save the witch he loves more than his own life and soul. But will his actions destroy their bond forever?",
