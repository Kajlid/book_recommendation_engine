  "description": "History is supposed to be dull. Who knew it could also be dangerous? Time-travel should be a fun adventure... right? And yet Kristen and Brad find that being stuck in the past is anything but. The Everhearts are taking part in a battle re-enactment of the American Revolution when they inexplicably find themselves back in 1777—for real. They have no way of knowing how or why they’re there; all they can do is try to get through the day. The siblings meet Rebecca, who needs to deliver a message of vital importance to General Washington. They also team up with a tavern-owner's son in order to escort Rebecca back to Philadelphia. Along the way, they deal with a spymaster, colonial deserters, and British soldiers who keep getting in the way.And they still have to figure out how to get back to their own time.... Based on review feedback, dialogue in this book has been edited for 'questionable' language. As of November, 2017.",
