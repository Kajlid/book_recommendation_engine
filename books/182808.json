  "description": "Jack Kirby’s most beloved creation is now an extraordinary Artist’s Edition, collecting six complete issues of Kamandi (#1, 2, 5, 6, 7 & 9) as well as covers and extras. There is no better way to view the magic of Jack \"the King\" Kirby than in the one and only Artist’s Edition format!What is an Artist’s Edition?AN ARTIST’S EDITION PRESENTS COMPLETE STORIES WITH EACH PAGE SCANNED FROM THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL ART.While appearing to be in black & white, each page has been scanned in COLOR to mimic as closely as possible the experience of viewing the actual original art—for example, you are able to clearly see paste-overs, blue pencils in the art, editorial notes, art corrections. Each page is printed the same size as drawn, and the paper selected is as close as possible to the original art board.",
