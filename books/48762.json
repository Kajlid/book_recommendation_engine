So when her hormones point due south to her sexy—but not so charming—new landlord, she can't help the sparks that fly.

And that definitely includes his gorgeous new tenant. But when they're thrown together in the wedding party from hell, both will stop at nothing to fight the heat building between them. Giving in is not an option for either of them.May the best man—or woman—win.",
