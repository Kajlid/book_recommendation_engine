  "description": "All those years of adolescent fantasies and this was how Bowie Bodine first touched my boobs. And he apologized. Real life was stupid and unfair.Small town deputy Cassidy Tucker's dating life is a train wreck on repeat. All she ever wanted was a solid partner. A man to share pajamas with. The handsome, big-hearted Bowie Bodine. Wait. Scratch that. Mr. You're-Like-a-Sister-to-Me is not welcome in her fantasies.She and Bowie aren't going to happen—that's been clear for a long time—and as for the rest of mankind? Cassidy's officially giving up on love and adopting cats. Good thing the cold case disappearance of Callie Kendall is heating up to keep her distracted. Except the investigation is testing her friendship with all the Bodines—Bowie in particular.Bowie knows he can't have his little sister's best friend. He made a promise and he's determined to keep it. But putting distance between them isn't easy—not when she lives right next door.Having her poke around trying to prove his father's guilt isn't helping either. All Bowie has ever wanted is to shed the No-Good Bodine reputation. It's looking like he'll never be free of that shadow.But one nocturnal animal, a feverish against-the-wall kiss, and absolutely zero pajamas has a way of changing everything.",
