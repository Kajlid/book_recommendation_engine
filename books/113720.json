Her parents died when she was nine and she has been left to her godforsaken pack ever since. Being beaten and forced into being their slave. One day, she decides to run away. On her sixteenth birthday, she shifts into the last pure white wolf in the world, but she doesn't know that or understand how special she really is. She just thinks she's different. So what happens when she meets a certain white haired beauty...? * * * Axel Night is not the everyday wolf. He's strong. He's powerful. He's demanding. He's possessive. He's also the only pitch black wolf left in the world... and he knows why. He runs the most famous and strongest pack in the world and is yet to find his mate. He doesn't have the happiest past either, but his best mate, Callum, helps him by. What happens, when the last white and black wolf meet? What happens, when fate takes its course? What happens, when you add a war...?",
