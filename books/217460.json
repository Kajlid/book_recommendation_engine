  "description": "Billie Wisher's daddy isn't a no-good bank robber . . . is he? Billie's daddy is on the run. If the police catch him, it's off to Pendleton Penitentiary for sure. And she just got him back, after he spent years away in California. She had big plans for the summer—plans that won't be any fun without Daddy. It must all be a mistake. Daddy didn't mean to rob that bank. If Billie finds him before the cops do, she can help him put everything right. She has an idea where he might be holed up. But Mama keeps asking what she's up to, and Billie's new stepfather, Daddy Joe, is always around, poking his nose in her business. With her family at stake, Billie's determined to track Daddy down at all costs—but will anything turn out the way she expects?",
