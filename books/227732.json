  "title": "My Dirty Crown",
  "description": "They told me to go shopping with them. They were simply making a few quick stops to pick up a birthday present for a friend. No big deal, right? I should have known better. Nothing with this group ever goes quite as planned. One minute I’m minding my own business, thinking I’m about to have a quiet date night with my boyfriend, but the next thing you know I’m shooting a crossbow and getting involved in the most bizarre beauty pageant I’ve ever seen.NOTE: This 14,000 word short story tells the tale of one night of adventure when a quirky woman joins her ex-mafia friends for a very memorable experience. This story is set in the “My Dirty Detour” world, however it is not necessary to have read that book in order to understand this story. Please be advised, there is vulgar language. This is a stand-alone story with plenty of humor, crazy characters, and NO cliffhanger.",
