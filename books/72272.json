  "description": "Ten years ago, he saved her life.  She’s never forgiven him for it.  When Della Chambers left her hometown, she promised herself two things. Number one - once she left Bourland, Texas, she wasn’t going back. Number two - she never wanted to see Camden Hill again. But now things have changed, and she’s about to break both promises.  When a series of suspicious fires strikes the town, as one of the country’s top arson investigators, Della reluctantly returns to help.  Camden Hill’s plans for his future had little to do with Bourland and nothing to do with fires. But sometimes fate has a funny sense of humor. He never asked to be the fire chief, but it’s the family business. Whether he likes it or not, he has a duty to his town and his family.  As the arsonist becomes more dangerous, Camden is forced to ask for help. He never expects Della to be the one sent his way.  Now the pair is forced to work side by side, and they’re reminded the heat between them has nothing to do with fire. **Re-edited and re-released 1/14/15.**",
