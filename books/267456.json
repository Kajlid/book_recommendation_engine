  "title": "BUILDING YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE FROM THE PRESENT",
  "description": "Retirement is a term that has been in usage for a long time and all it means is that you are no longer producing income. Usually it was used to refer to a person more than 55 year of age, but times have changed, and we are now facing a new age where we can balance lifestyles, manage time to our favor, and be more efficient by investing on what is important – as I always say, keep the main thing (THE MAIN THING), connect more with your purpose in life, with what you want to experience and live. For great experiences, and usually for a creative bucket list, it is important to have control of your finances, and create a plan for learning instruments already in existence, with which you can make the most of every dollar you earn. The intention of this book is to start with a guide to the different names that have been given to plans, to understand their differences, and guide you into making the best decisions. Here we go…..Enjoy the ride",
