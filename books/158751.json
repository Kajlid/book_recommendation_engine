  "description": "Pelly D thinks her whole glorious life stretches ahead of her; but young building worker Toni V has just found her diary, buried in a water can, in rubble, in a construction site. There's a note: Dig, Dig Everywhere. It's forbidden, Toni V knows, but curiosity drives him on - he hides the diary, and begins reading. Pelly D seems like any ordinary girl talking about clothes, parties, boys - but below her words, Toni V senses something very different, sinister and scary unfolding. Set far in the future, on a distant planet, Pelly D's diary bears witness, through her unsuspecting young eyes, to the terrifying impact of genetic classification of people. A story inspired by The Diary of Anne Frank.",
