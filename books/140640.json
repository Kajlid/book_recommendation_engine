  "description": "Diana always knew that Minotaurs were real, but she never wanted to meet one. Their lust for human women is legendary. And the aftermath tends to be…messy. Lake Eerie campus is supposed to be safe, but now there’s nowhere for Diana to run. Lucky for her, while the Minotaur may have the head of a bull, he also has the heart of a man…  If he caught me... The stories about what happened when a human woman met a Minotaur were exacting in their detail. I held my breath and sunk down in the water so that only the top of my head protruded from the lake. Maybe he didn’t know I was here. Maybe he hadn’t heard me. Maybe if I just stayed very quiet… The Minotaur’s nose lifted to scent the air, his huge nostrils flaring. My heart sank. He may not have seen me, but he had my scent. His huge black eyes scanned the beach, then the water—I tried to sink down further, but I didn’t dare lose sight of him—and then his eyes caught on me. This 5000 word short story is intended for mature audiences only.",
