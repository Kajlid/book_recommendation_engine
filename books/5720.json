  "description": "One act play.The play takes place in the office and dining room of a small French flat. The Professor, an elderly man of about 50 to 60, is expecting a new Pupil (aged 18). The third character is the Professor's Maid, a stout, red-faced woman of about 40 to 50, who is always worrying about the Professor's health. As the lesson progresses, the Professor grows more and more angry with (what he perceives as) the Pupil's ignorance and the Pupil becomes more and more quiet and meek. At the climax of the play, the Pupil is murdered by the Professor, after a long bout of non sequiturs (which are frequently used in Ionesco's plays). The play ends as a new Pupil is greeted by the Maid.",
