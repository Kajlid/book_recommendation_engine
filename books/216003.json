  "description": "Sustained by a deep religious faith, Jason Harrow has built a stable family and become a pillar of principle and patriotism in the Midwest. Then the phone rings, and his past is on the other end of the line. A woman with whom he once shared a life of violence and desire claims her daughter is missing and Jason is the one man who can find her.Returning to New York City, Jason finds himself entangled in a murderous conspiracy only he can see and only he can stop a plot that bizarrely links his private passions to the turmoil of a world at war. Hunted by terrorists and by the police, Jason has only hours to unravel an ex-lover s lies and face the unbearable truth: In order to prevent a savage attack on his country, he s going to have to risk his decency, his sanity, and his life.Praise for ANDREW KLAVANThe most original American novelist of crime and suspense since Cornell Woolrich. Stephen KingKlavan does tough-guy heroes and sexual tension better than anyone writing today. Janet EvanovichKlavan, who has a perfect sense of timing, delivers all the cliffhangers and hairpin turns that you want from a beat-the-clock suspense thriller. \"The New York Times Book Review\"Klavan writes with an artisan s eye, a pro s assurance, and a poet s touch. [He] is one of my drop-everything-and-read authors. Gregg HurwitzKlavan winds his tale tighter and tighter until the reader is hopelessly spellbound. Clive CusslerKlavan s confidently wry style keeps things punched up throughout. \"The Atlantic Monthly\"\"",
