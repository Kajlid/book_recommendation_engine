  "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Jessica Clare comes a Christmas Western filled with holiday cheer.Caleb Watson has been crushing on elementary school teacher Amy Mckinney ever since he saw her. She's oblivious to his feelings--probably because he's never said a word to her. But when he learns Amy's going to be Mrs. Claus in the local Christmas celebration, he volunteers to be Santa so he'll finally have the chance to introduce himself. Even more than that, he'll use this opportunity to shower her with presents.Amy's been receiving all kinds of Secret Santa gifts at work -- and she has no idea who her secret admirer is. She wishes he'd make himself known so they can go on a date, though, because being a newcomer in close-knit Painted Barrel, Wyoming, is pretty lonely. When her flaky landlord claims he's the gift giver...it's not quite the bachelor Amy had in mind. However, she's doubly shocked when gruff newcomer Caleb Watson crashes her date and insists he's really the one leaving her presents.Amy's not sure what to think. Caleb's never indicated that he likes her, much less wants to date. Can he prove to Amy he's not just the perfect Santa to her Mrs. Claus, but the man of her dreams?",
