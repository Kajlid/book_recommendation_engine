  "description": "What would you do if you found out the son you loved wasn't yours? Nobody wakes up one morning and decides that this is the day they are going to cheat on their spouse, but when the opportunity presents itself - it ultimately becomes a choice - and that choice, whether good or bad, can have irrevocable consequences.Thirty-four-year-old Ethan Harrington is a brilliant doctor, devoted husband, eager father to be - and borderline alcoholic. He has spent the better part of a year trying to forgive his wife, Jessica, for her infidelity, but her betrayal with a colleague of his has left him hurt beyond words. That hurt slowly begins to heal with the birth of his son, but it isn't long before he finds out the devastating secret that Jessica has been so desperately trying to keep from him. Ethan's life steadily begins to crumble, and his drinking - fueled by this discovery - slowly engulfs him, leaving him without the ability to control his temper. With his marriage now in pieces and his sanity questionable, Ethan struggles to come to terms with his alcoholism and face a past that he has spent his lifetime trying to forget.",
