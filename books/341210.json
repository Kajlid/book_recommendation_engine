  "description": "Dazzling Diggers (Amazing Machines) by Tony Mitton and Ant ParkerDiggers are noisy, strong, and big. Diggers can carry and push and dig. Diggers have shovels to scoop and lift, blades that bulldoze, shunt, and shift. Sloshing and squelching, and smashing and bashing, the construction machinery does its work - manned by a friendly animal gang - in this lively picture book. Young children will adore it as will the adults who get to read aloud these irresistible rhymes!",
