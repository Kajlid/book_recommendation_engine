He’s returned to his duties while his brother, Terrin, leads a team of scientists studying the lost technology of the fallen empire. But the Starkad Supremacy knows their secrets, and they aren’t going to allow their rivals the military advantage of the Imperial technology. They’re coming for it and for Terrin. His only option is to run for his life through outlaw space stations to a backwoods colony world called Revelation.
