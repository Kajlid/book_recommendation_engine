  "title": "Hospital: An Oral History of Cook County Hospital",
  "description": "The future of medical care is now high on the US political agenda, but few understand what it is really like to deal with the nation's health in the very battle trenches of American medicine. In this study, Lewis uses Chicago's Cook County Hospital as a microcosm of both the human and the social problems faced by America. She interviewed a wide range of people involved in the running of the hospital, from a former director to an elevator operator, and from a security guard to the head of the trauma unit.",
