  "description": "When Adina Carr is stranded in London by her ungrateful, not to mention philandering ex-boyfriend, she is about to call it quits and head back home to New York City with her tail between her legs, but through a bout of serendipity things are about to get a whole lot more interesting—and dangerous. On the very day she loses her job, she happens upon someone in trouble—and not just any someone. This someone is expected to become the high prince of all vampires, a centuries-old dispute notwithstanding. Jin, the vampire in question, has spent a lifetime being groomed to rule; yet, there is a tribe of rebel undead who will do anything to make sure he does not assume the throne. It is Adina who unwittingly gives him a second chance and finds herself in the middle of a bloody battle—and falling hopelessly in love.",
