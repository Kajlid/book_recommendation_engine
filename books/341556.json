  "description": "While cleaning an old lantern, Kira Franklin releases a genie. But this gender-morphing, appearance-bending creature doesn't do \"big\" wishes. So forget stopping world hunger or ending war. And still heartbroken from the jerk who dumped her, Kira doesn't believe in the perfect man.So she wishes for her dream job. Stage manager at the hottest theater in town, the Landmark. And she's running Romeo and Juliet . Except, like everything else these days, this is one crazy production. And now Teel, the genie, insists she finish her wishes so \"he\" can move on.Her second wish is about her appearance, which isn't exactly catching her third wish's eye. And there's the rub.Because that old saying about being careful what you wish for is so spot-on. And Kira is about to discover that moxie , not magic, is what can make all your dreams come true.",
