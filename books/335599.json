  "description": "KeirThe governor’s daughter has gotten herself into a mess.If I protect her, her father will owe me, bigtime.But the best way to keep her safe is to marry her.Claim her as one of our own. The catch? She’s got a boyfriend she’s not ready to part with.Good thing an unwilling bride isn’t an issue for a guy like me. RowanHow is it that years of toeing the line could unravel so damn quickly? I’ve done my best to make my parents happy in every way.But when a six-foot tatted Irish gangster showed up at our house, my entire life began to crumble. Now, I’ve woken with a ring tattooed on my finger, and I’m starting to worry there’s no going back.*Corrupted Union is the second book in The Byrne Brothers series. Each book in the series features a different couple and can be read as a standalone with a happily ever after, but for maximum enjoyment, follow the recommended reading order. A dark romance with adult themes, Corrupted Union may not be suitable for sensitive audiences. For a more detailed content warning, you can visit the books tab on my website.A Note from the Author: Keir is my Tommy Shelby, and I am so utterly in love with him. A savage ruthlessness hides beneath his calm exterior, which is shattered when Rowan comes crashing into his world. They may not see it at first, but these two are PERFECT for one another!For those of you who are new to me, I write what I'd call \"mafia lite.\" My heroes are hardened criminals with soft spots for their heroines. There may be violence and cruelty in my books, but never between the main characters. Enjoy!",
