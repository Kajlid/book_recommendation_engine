  "description": "He wanted my complete surrender, I wanted his everything...Dark. Raging. All-consuming. Sebastian Black was guaranteed to leave destruction in his wake. From the moment our eyes met, he had a hold on me. I knew what he was proposing would destroy me. What I hadn't planned on was his ability to make me crave destruction. I wanted, craved, and needed him like nothing I had ever desired before. Running from the shadows of my past, I lost myself in him. I knew my darkness could ruin us, but I didn't understand the power of his to do the same.My dark, brooding, impeccably-sexual, alpha-male had his own crosses to bear. I wasn't sure I was strong enough to handle them, or the woman who helped chain him there.",
