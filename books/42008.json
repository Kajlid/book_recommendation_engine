  "description": "Teenage years are difficult ones.… Trying to find yourself and the self-discovery of who you want to be can be time consuming. Throw in searching for acceptance and happiness missing from your home, not to mention dating, feelings of inadequacy and possibly thoughts of suicide, and you’re looking at a complicated set of years. These poems run the gamut of the teenage years.",
