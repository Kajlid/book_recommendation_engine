  "description": "Spencer’s content with his life.  Sure, he might be a little confused and a bit awkward, but his life isn’t bad. He has a steady job and a wonderful friend in his goldfish Frank. He just has a feeling it could be better if he could clear up a few things, like why the lingerie at Leashes & Lace is so interesting and why dating isn’t really working out.  Devin’s happy with his life.  His work at the LGBT youth center and his growing friendship with the guys at Leashes & Lace keep him busy and his life fulfilling. But when he bumps into a familiar face at a photoshoot, he starts to see what he’s been missing—awkward perfection. The calm, professional UPS driver who stops by the center is nothing like the nervous, uncoordinated man who can’t seem to admit how curious he is about the lingerie…and Devin can’t wait to find out what else the sweet man is longing for.  With Spencer’s fear standing in their way, it will take the love of well-meaning friends and a little timely misfortune to bring them together.   54k words Story Contains: M/m sexual content, BDSM elements, gender-fluid dressing, edging, spanking, and a very uncoordinated UPS man.",
