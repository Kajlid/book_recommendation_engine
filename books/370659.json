  "description": "All Joy wants is to live right like her Mama taught her growing up. She works hard to provide for her three-year-old son. But when she loses her job and her baby's father has no legal solution, Joy thinks the next step for her is the thing that terrifies her more than anything--that she'll lose her son. Desperation leads her to break the law on her own, but when the upper scale store owner catches her, his proposition is not what Joy expected. Keane Kavanagh wants Joy for his mistress, and he won't take no for an answer. Suddenly Joy finds herself on beautiful Cooper Island living every woman's dream. All the clothes she could want, no bills to worry about and a sexy man who knows how to please a woman in bed. But Joy wants more. She wants love, and she'll do whatever it takes to remain the woman she was raised to be.",
