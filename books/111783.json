After being dumped five hours before spending Christmas with her dysfunctional family, she needs a plan to avoid their judgmental eyes. Enter: Kayden Reece.Kayden is the black sheep of his family, being the one actor drowning in a world of doctors and lawyers.

When Kayden gets a chance to meet and sign with a big name agent at Walter and Jacks Talent Agency, he’s ready to prove everyone wrong. Jules stumbles into the building in shambles, ugly crying, and begging to pay an actor a big sum of money to be her made-up boyfriend for five days, Kayden jumps at the opportunity—finally able to say he landed a role. When secrets start to unravel, Kayden and Jules must learn that all families have their baggage, sometimes co-stars fall in lust, and it’s important to always have invisible mistletoe hanging around.
