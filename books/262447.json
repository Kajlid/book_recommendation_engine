  "description": "Wings of Dawn \"You must succeed, Thomas, to bring the Wings of Dawn into this age of Darkness.\" In the year of our Lord 1312, in the remote North York Moors of England, Thomas pursues his destiny--the conquest of Magnus, an 800-year-old kingdom, an island castle that harbors secret dating back to the days of King Arthur and Merlin. Haunted by a beautiful woman he dare not trust, surrounded by enemies he cannot see, and with no army but a mysterious knight he has saved from the gallows, Thomas faces an insurmountable task. Yet armed with a powerful weapon he had concealed since his orphaned boyhood, there remains and glimmer of hope. To win Magnus, however, is the only the beginning of Thomas's quest, one that will unearth ancient secrets, strengthen his fragile faith in God, and place him squarely against an evil conspiracy that has ruled the land for centuries--spreading wings of dawn over a land that has experienced a long, bleak night. \"Brouwer's lyrical western Morning Star , and his thriller-with-a-message Double Helix , established him as one of Christian fiction's most interesting talents...\"--American Library Association Best-selling author Sigmund Brouwer has written eight novels. He and his wife, Cindy Morgan, divide their time between Alberta, Canada, and Tennessee. He is also the author of several children's book series.",
