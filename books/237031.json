  "description": "From Wall Street Journal & USA Today Bestselling Author Lauren Landish.   I’m so done with men. I don’t care if he looks like Ryan Gosling with a ten-inch cucumber in his pants and says he wants me to have his babies.  Just, no. I’m done. I can’t pick them.  To make matters worse, the real estate investment company I work for is on the verge of collapse. There’s one deal that can save it, and it’s all up to me. I make this deal or look for a new job.  Problem is, I’m competing with the arrogant jerk who started my whole bad luck streak with men.  His smoldering green eyes have haunted me for more than a year, and if it weren't for his cockiness, I would’ve been screaming his name during our first encounter.  He’s the competition now, and I can’t let him get to me. I have too much to lose.  But what if I want to have my studmuffin and eat it too?  Stud Muffin is a full-length Romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
