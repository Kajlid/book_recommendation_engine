  "description": "Welcome to their kingdom. \n This is book 3 in the Royal Hearts Academy series. Please note: Although this is Bianca's book, Cruel Prince (Jace and Dylanâ€™s book) and Ruthless Knight (Cole and Sawyer's book) should be read first for a better understanding of the family dynamic. WARNING:  Royal Hearts Academy is a New Adult/High School series of standalones filled with drama, a touch of angst, and boys who are bad to the bone. The characters are flawed. If you're looking for a safe, sweet romance with nice heroes and heroines who are perfect all the time, this series is NOT for you.",
