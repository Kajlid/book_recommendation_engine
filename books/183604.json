  "description": "Salvation. Redemption. Discovery.  The world has lived behind a dark shroud since the cataclysmic Event of 2077 – a solar flare the likes of which has never been recorded, destroying all technology. Two-thirds of the population has perished in the aftermath of the Event itself, or from rampant violence plaguing the world over.  2084: In the aftermath of a set of horrific events leading to his childhood friend's death, Brigadier Stroud, a former Black Ops commando from the elite Epsilon Warriors squadron, stumbles upon the secret the world was never supposed to know – a portal hidden in a remote area of the New Mexico desert.  With the rest of the world shrouded in the darkness caused by the Event of 2077, Brig finds himself thrust into the middle of multiple converging conflicts that threaten to shift the balance of power in a world without power. Can he and his comrades keep their strained relationships bound long enough to overcome disaster and save the day, or will ghosts of the past halt them in their tracks?",
