  "description": "Jordan Matthews is a good kid, an average student, and has never gotten in trouble at school before. But today he finds himself in the principal's office with fellow classmate Casey Sothern. He doesn't think they've done anything wrong, and doesn't expect much in the way of punishment until Casey's mother arrives.Which means someone's called his parents, too.And they'll know Casey isn't just his best friend, but his boyfriend, as well.Then Jordan sees his father storm through the front doors of the school. Any punishment the principal has planned for catching the two boys kissing in the hall between classes will pale in comparison to what Jordan's father might have to say.",
