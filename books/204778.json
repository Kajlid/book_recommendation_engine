  "description": "One year has passed since Sarah Sawyer avenged the death of her parents in a quest that nearly cost her life. Now the gunslinger is living a life she never imagined. No longer roaming the trails alone, she and Jo Porter, the woman she loves, live in relative peace, working a thriving farm of their own. But payback comes with a price. The lingering fear of unsettled debts haunts them both, threatening their newfound peace. When ghosts from the past come to collect, Sarah risks losing herself to the darkness she'd fought so hard to escape. Can she pull herself back from the depths or will the harsh world of the old west finally break her? S.W. Andersen delivers another action-packed romance in the thrilling sequel to \"Somewhere Between Love and Justice.\" This is S.W. Andersen's second novel. Her first earned such praise as \"A Riveting Read\", \"Keeps You Wanting More\" and \"UNPUTDOWNABLE.\"",
