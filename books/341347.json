  "description": "The Art of Readable Writing is an indispensable guide to writing fluently. Noted language maven Dr. Rudolf Flesch moves beyond his examination of and advice on grammar and usage in The Art of Plain Talk to the more general principles of style in contemporary writing. Drawing upon a wealth of material from sources as varied as Aristotle and Life magazine, Dr. Flesch shows us how we can write more simply and effectively. His famous Readability Formula, devised specially for this book, explains how to analyze writing for its clarity and interest. Entertaining and stimulating and crammed with commonsensical advice, The Art of Readable Writing is, above all, immensely readable.",
