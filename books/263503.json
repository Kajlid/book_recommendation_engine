  "description": "Trevor Lincoln is the legendary tight end for Boston University’s football team. As the youngest son of a former NFL player, he lives a life of privilege with an endless stream of girls vying for his attention. He always gets his way.  Until I come along.  Everything about him irks me. From his crooked smile and sexy, dark hair, to his obscenely large trust fund. But when we’re forced to spend time together, the undeniable spark between us blazes and resisting him becomes one of my greatest challenges.  Can I shut down his game, or will he tackle my heart?  *can be read as a standalone*",
