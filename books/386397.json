  "description": "She was pledged to marry a powerful Spanish don…. Was it even possible for the one who held her heart to arrive and claim her? I’ll resist the marriage, Devora thinks stubbornly as her ship heads toward the West Indies and a dreaded new life. Promised to the powerful Don Nicklas Valentin, whose ruthless reputation is legendary, Devora fears a union with this man whom she’s never met. Still alive in her heart are memories of Captain Bruce Hawkins, the daring English buccaneer with the mysterious past—who made her a seemingly impossible promise. An inspiring story of God’s guidance in dangerous circumstances. Silver Dreams takes you on a romantic passage in the world of exotic Old Spain, among danger, intrigue, and adventure. Linda Chaikin is a best-selling author of 35 books whose Heart of India, and Royal Pavilions series, have delighted readers for years. Her Egypt series was honored with the Angel Award for Excellence in Fiction.",
