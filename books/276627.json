  "description": "I wasn't capable of love. Not until I met Cora.  My angel.  I’ve claimed every inch of her body and I only want more.  I’m a man who craves control, but her power over me is absolute.  She holds my heart in her hands.  She can never find out.  The demons in this city want to destroy her.  It’s my job to protect her innocence. Lock her safe in my high tower.  But I’m the danger that she’s trying to escape.  The ruthless man in her bed.  A demon worse than all the others.  One who cannot save her from himself.",
