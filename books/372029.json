  "description": "Bondage is not journalist Carl Guttuso's thing. He has no need to tie a man up or beat the crap out of him and call it sexy. No one is doing that to him either-or so he thought. During an interview, the charismatic BDSM Dom, James Pauly, asks Carl to be his submissive lover to learn about the lifestyle from within and Carl agrees to a six-week contract.  James has not been romantically involved since his last sub left when James refused to whip him beyond what was safe. In Carl, he sees a second chance to connect with a man who wants more than the pain James can give him. He recognizes the sexual interest in Carl's eyes and thinks the handsome young reporter will be perfect.  Carl is surprised by the desire he feels for a man who admits to subjugating his lovers, but the intensity of the games they play becomes addictive and Carl wants more much more. James, dismayed by yet another sub's demands for pain, refuses to be rushed. He hopes to keep Carl past their contract, but it may be all he can do to keep him for the six weeks.  For both men, the arrangement becomes a journey of self-discovery that could tear them apart in spite of their growing attraction.Approx. word 38K",
