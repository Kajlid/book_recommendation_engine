  "description": "Mateo Romero is living the dream as a beach attendant on the turquoise waters of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, helping families get the most of their vacations by day and rescuing kids in need by night. The last thing he expects is to meet Darby Benson, an uptight tourist who has the audacity to call him a stalker. Everywhere he goes, she’s there—either in distress or starting trouble. He should steer clear, but something about her draws him in. Her snide remarks infuriate him, but when she smiles, he forgets why he ever found her irritating in the first place. And he can’t have that—it goes against his first rule: “no getting involved with tourists.”Darby Benson, destination wedding extraordinaire, never expected she would still be unmarried at thirty-four years old. She didn’t imagine her boyfriend of twelve years would ask her to plan a romantic getaway for two only to propose to her assistant. Yet, here she is, single, on vacation alone, trying to avoid her ex and his new fiancé. To make matters worse, she keeps running into Mateo Romero, a local who seems hell-bent on sticking his nose in her business. Everywhere she turns, Mateo is there, offering advice, stepping in where he isn’t needed, being far too sexy for anyone’s good.Annoyance shifts to flirtation, and eventually, they can’t deny their attraction. Darby worries she’s being set up for her next heartbreak. Mateo is ready to give her his heart. If they can get on the same page, their romance could be one to last a lifetime.",
