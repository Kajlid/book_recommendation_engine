Against orders, he spirited them away to a dimension where they would have freedom and purpose. In a vindictive fit, Rosie Storm asked Kellareal for a place to hide out. He knew just the place for her to grow up, learn emotional control, and other things.

They're beautiful to look at, bigger, stronger, faster, and smarter.",
