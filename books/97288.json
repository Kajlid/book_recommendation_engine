  "description": "My pain started when I was just ten years old, it was the day my mom got that dreaded phone call. My life has never been the same... I’m all kinds of broken. I have known Logan White forever, he was my brothers best friend and my secret protector. I used to have nightmares that drew me into a dark place, and when the nightmares got too much... Logan was by my side. The nightmares are few and far between now, but my life is centered around the tragedy of my past. But after an unexpected moment, things changed. Now Logan is somebody else; hot, sexy and so damn delicious and I want to know him. Desperately. But then there’s Angel Walker, who is far from the angelic nature of his name. He’s a broken man who just screams sin. He doesn't want to protect me or care for me, he just wants me. Do I want the man who can cut through all of my pain or the man who could cause me more?",
