  "description": "Nothing has gone to plan.Not a single thing.I entered Poseidon’s palace with one intention – steal a legendary ship and sail it to the darkest, most dangerous depths of the ocean, to try to save my sister.And now I am fighting for my life in a series of deadly trials designed for water gods and sea monsters, not broken, powerless nymphs.I was prepared for risk. I was prepared for danger.I was not prepared for Poseidon, or the soul-deep connection I have with him. His tenuous control teeters closer to the edge the more time I spend with him, and gods help me, I’m starting to hope that he falls – and takes me with him. \nSurrender of the Brutal King is the second book in the Poseidon Trials trilogy. Expect magic, mythology, and a searing slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance that will leave you desperate for more.",
