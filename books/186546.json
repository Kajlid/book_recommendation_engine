  "description": "When the world witnesses its first live zombie attack, one zombie must act quickly to infect as many people as possible before the city is quarantined. Recruiting the likes of police officers and coffeehouse waitresses, it is up to him to bring the apocalypse to Earth and put an end to the notion of hunting zombies. In a town filled with murderous schoolteachers and religious vigilantes, he’ll have to use everything he’s got to survive the resistance…especially when he realizes he’s not the only zombie out there with an agenda. Relentless, sick and laugh-out-loud funny, ‘I Am Become Apocalypse’ is a worthy successor to the book that started it all.",
