  "title": "Hellhound on His Trail & Other Stories",
  "description": "Entertaining tales of British Columbia's logging camps, bunkhouses, smelters and sawmills are collected in Peter Trower's latest short fiction release Hellhound on his Trail. A remarkable glimpse of working life along the coast in the 1950's, Trower's stories of Sunshine Coast hamlets and their colourful characters, steep mountain 'sidehills,' dangerous workplaces and rampant alcoholism paint a picture of a way of life now past. Known as BC s logger-poet, Trower's vivid eye, ear for dialogue and unerring voice capture an unvarnished portrait with the artistry of a master. Raw, edgy and streetwise, Peter Trower's tales possess the lyric eloquence of his poetry.",
