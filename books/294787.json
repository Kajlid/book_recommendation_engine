  "description": "Only one word can describe the man who performs online as HRD4U…FILTHY.He really knows how to work that massive asset on camera.Couple that with the dirty talk he uses to describe his fantasies while he does it…It’s enough to drive me mad while I watch.Because just like my screenname says, INEEDSOMED. Too bad men like HRD4U don’t exist in real life. Apparently, finding a nice guy with a nasty mouth and a mammoth gift between the legs is asking too much. Instead, I just get snooze-inducing lovers and dates with no chemistry. Having my BFF Flynn McAllister right next door helps ease some of the pain of breakup after breakup.But he can’t know what I really want or why my relationships always fail. I just want to be dirty. But now, all my dreams might be coming true…All because of my filthy friend.",
