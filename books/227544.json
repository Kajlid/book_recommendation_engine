  "description": "She thought she was nothing. Until she became everything.  Susan Forresterâ€™s life was on a downward spiral. She had zero friends, a too small apartment, and a soul draining job. But, when she hears the sound of a horn, and the world falls into chaos around her, Susan must make a desperate attempt to survive. Armed with only her wits and an unfamiliar voice that has taken up residence in her mind, Susan tries to flee the city's destruction all while keeping her sanity in tact.  But she can't leave alone. A small, orphaned boy with eyes the color of four leaf clovers needs her help too. And what's worse, strange men in dark suites are pursing them both.  Can she survive the destruction of the city and save the boy? Or will she be captured, and doomed to a fate worse than death?",
