  "description": "The lovely Alani Dane, professional submissive has a thing or two to learn, and Master Nathaniel absolutely will be the one to teach her.When he catches Alani yawning during a scene with one of Zones’ more prestigious members, club owner Master Nathaniel Stratton takes her bad behavior as a personal affront. Although he’s seldom in the country, the club’s success matters to Nathaniel and his partners. Nathaniel vows to personally deal with Alani, fraternization be damned.The dangerous enigma that is Master Nathaniel alternately thrills and terrifies Alani. At heart, she’s no man’s submissive; she’s a masochist who craves beatings that will send her into subspace, make her forget. And she swoons under the bite of this dom’s punishing leather belt.Nathaniel is determined to make her the perfect sub and shatter the emotional barriers she’s erected to keep her safe. But in a battle of wills, dominance, and submission, there can only be one victor, and Nathaniel will win, as soon as he puts Alani in the zone.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: anal play/intercourse, strong BDSM theme and elements.",
