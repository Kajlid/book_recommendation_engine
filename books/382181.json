  "description": "It's time for some Texas-sized adventure for Amigas Incorporated! After throwing dozens of quinceaneras for strangers, friends, and plenty of quince-zillas, Alicia, Carmen, Jamie, and Gaz could use a vacation. Unfortunately, with all their time spent planning, they've forgotten to make their own plans--for Spring Break! So when Alicia's mom mentions she has a friend who wants to throw a quinceanera for her daughter--in Texas--the group figures they can combine fun and business. Soon they are heading South. Alicia is excited to meet her new client, Jamie is pumped she can see her boyfriend compete in a big golf tournament, Carmen is looking forward to hanging with her cousins, and Gaz is psyched to be attending the South by Southwest music conference and concert. But with so much going on, it is hard to stay on task. Will Alicia be able to rein in the group or will the drama have her heading for new pastures?",
