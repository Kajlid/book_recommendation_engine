Rand Washburn has a secret that could cost Julia Cooper her life. When two pea-brains dump an Englishwoman at his farm while he's recovering from yellow fever, he has to figure out how to get rid of her before she finds out he's sitting on top of the biggest smuggling operation ever seen in Territorial Florida.Julia's following in the footsteps of her parents, who put an end to the career of a notorious brigand in Pirate's Price. If she ever wants to make it home to England in one piece, she's going to have to think fast to keep Washburn and his cronies from burying her deep in the back woods, even if it means marrying that handsome scoundrel at gunpoint. Can Rand convince Julia that she's destined to be the smuggler's bride, or is he going to have to make sure she's not able to tell anyone—ever—about what he's up to along the Florida coast?",
