Since they’re both gay and asexual, they made a pact to become boyfriends if they’re still single by the time they turn eighteen. Eventually high school got busy for them, and they drifted apart and went their separate ways.Four years later, it’s Christmas Eve, and Jovy and Saul are both eighteen. After receiving a call from Saul’s sister, Jovy agrees to look after Saul, who is disabled. His sister is often out and about, hence the reason Saul feels lonely.Jovy’s both nervous and excited about reuniting with Saul. He always celebrates Christmas Eve with his family, a tradition he’s never missed in his life, so he figures he can hang out with Saul until evening, then invite him along to be with the family. No one should spend Christmas alone.Unfortunately, Jovy and Saul end up locking themselves in Saul’s safe room, and his out-of-town sister is the only one with the key. This will be the first year Jovy misses out on the family tradition but he and Saul attempt to make the best of the situation while also growing closer than ever, even discovering new things about each other.Saul has two Christmas gifts for Jovy, and one of them could change their friendship. Will Jovy accept the present? Or will they remain best friends forever?",
