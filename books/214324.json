  "title": "Welcome to Kaya's World, 1764: Growing Up in a Native American Homeland",
  "description": "There was nothing Kaya liked better than to ride her beloved horse, Steps High, through the steep mountains, deep canyons, and high prairies of her beautiful homeland -- present-day Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In 1764, Kaya dreamed of becoming a courageous leader for her people, ready to meet whatever the future might bring.  Inside this book you'll see what growing up was like before America became a country. Listen to legends that Kaya loved to hear, about a time before human beings walked the earth -- when animals could talk! Learn what it was like to live inside a snug tipi and ride horses from the time you were a baby. Most important, read about Nez Perce girls and women, who survived wars against their people, risked their lives to protect their traditions, and never, ever, lost their spirit.   From the back cover of the book.",
