  "description": "If you read fairy tales, and who doesn't, you might believe there are witches all over the place -witches baking children into gingerbread, making princesses sleep hundreds of years, even turning normal teenage boys into hideous beasts to teach them a lesson. But, actually, there are only a few of us. The reason it doesn't seem like that is because we're pretty long-lived. We live hundreds of years, as long as we don't find ourselves fueling a bonfire.Wich leads us to another quality of witches: we move around a lot. It's easy for us to get into trouble, and sometimes we need to beat a hasty retreat (in the dead of night or on the business end of a pitchfork) to another town or another country. So that explains the existence of many tles from different times and places, many of wich involve the same witch.In quite a few cases, that witch was me. My name is Kendra, and I'm a witch.Here's my story -well, some of it. It involves romance, drama, even death.It started in England, many years ago; 1666 to be exact. When I was a teenager, the first time.",
