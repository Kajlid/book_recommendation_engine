  "description": "When Maddie Fraser's father was killed fighting for Bonnie Prince Charles, the spirited Scottish lass swore to avenge his death. Hooded and disguised, she led a series of daring raids against the forces of the Crown--vowing to love no man until the English invaders were driven from her native soil. Hot-blooded Captain Garrett Marshall was entrusted with the capture of the mysterious brigand called \"Black Jack.\" But the sensuous, azure-eyed beauty hidden beneath the bandit's manly garb tested Garrett's loyalty to his King. Inflamed by a desire he could not ignore, the handsome officer would wed his bewitching enemy to save her from the gallows. But first he'd have to quell her hatred...and conquer her heart.",
