  "description": "Some say I'm a psychopath, others say sociopath.Deranged, demonic, unhinged.And I am, unashamedly, all of those things and so, so many more.I'm the lone daughter of The Swallow Family crime syndicate.A bloodied, violent queen reigning from a throne of bone and ash, hands and soul bathed in crimson.The one thing I'm not, though?Crazy.Or so I thought...But when I start receiving threats, start 'seeing' people that only I see and get forced to take time out, I start to wonder if they might be right about me after all.Just a crazy girl made up of twisted, shattered pieces, a half dead organ decaying inside her wounded chest and a tendency for violence.Iâ€™m Kyla-Rose Swallow and this is the beginning of my downfall.So, welcome to Southbrook, the city where Swallows rule and psychos raise hell.This is a dark, contemporary reverse harem romance, meaning the female main character will have three or more love interests and will not have to choose. The harem grows throughout the series, meaning there is not an established harem in book 1. It is a medium/fast burn romance.If you are a sensitive reader please note this is a DARK book so if you have triggers this is probably not for you. For a complete and detailed list of triggers please contact the author directly.The characters in this series all deal with trauma and problems differently, the resolutions and methods they use are not always traditional and therefore may not be for everyone.This is book 1 of a planned trilogy and DOES end on a cliffhanger.The series will end with a HEA.",
