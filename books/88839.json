  "description": "If A likes B, but B is setting up C with A, and C is secretly dating D, and E despises B, but now B and E are making out in the car, and D accidentally cuddles B because D thought it was C but B thought it was E, what is the value of pie? Wait, what? It's love at first sight when Allyson, pie-lover and pie-maker extraordinaire, sets eyes on her dreamy neighbor, Scott. Unfortunately, Allyson's sister Layne is determined to set her up with Scott's younger brother, Marc. However, Marc is actually in love with Layne, but Layne has her sights set on the moody man from her night class, who, coincidentally and completely unbeknownst to Layne, is Marc and Scott's older brother and has no interest in Layne at all. In fact, Wes just hates everyone and everything. Five characters plus one mixed up love triangle equals the crazy story of Relationships, Pie, and Other Complicated Stuff. Complete with pie in every chapter!",
