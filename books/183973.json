  "description": "Robert Stone. They call him “Stone” because he’s hard as a rock. He’s sexy, debonair and arrogant as f*ck. A sexy, dangerous rival for power in the city that never sleeps. He sits on top of an empire looking down at the world…and now he’s my stepbrother. Our history has been one dangerous game of cat and mouse. My business is in trouble and a merger is the only solution. I’ll be screwed if this merger falls through…and maybe even if it does. The heat between us is unbearable. If that volcano between his legs erupts we’ll both get scorched. I have to resist or my upcoming marriage will be shattered. I can’t afford to get STONED.",
