  "description": "The \"Friends\" are back in book six, the next chapter in the Friends With Benefits series.When newlyweds Jim and Victoria return from their Vegas wedding, Victoria dives full swing back into her sex therapy practice. With the addition of a new, let's call him, unique client, along with a couple of old surprise visitors, there is never a dull moment in the naughty professional's home office. While Brian and Jillian are in full expectant parent mode, and with twins no less, Jillian's movie opens to great success. Just when the famous author thinks she's gotten Amanda Joseph out of her, and more importantly her husband's hair, the A-list actress returns and in a big way. With the continuation of Jillian's series of novels heading to the small screen, she's looking forward to the promise of a huge financial windfall, but will the price tag be too much to bear. Will Jim and Victoria survive her new clients? Will Brian and Jillian have boys or girls or one of each? And will Jillian's movie's box office triumph be the end of her career or her marriage or both. Find out in Friends With Multiple Benefits. Featuring expanded Ian Dalton scenes, this book is also the continuation of the steamier Victoria Wilde version of the series. The optional \"Ian\" scenes are easily skipable by readers who prefer the Luke Young variety.",
