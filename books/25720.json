Check.Quinley Bevan doesn’t expect to get smacked in the face by intense sexual chemistry during the meeting, but Isaiah Hale—dark, masculine, rugged—sets off all her hormonal fireworks. More, as a dominant shifter, the enforcer pulls at her submissive nature and calls to her inner cat. Both his power and stabilizing strength are plain drugging.Their agreement is pretty standard: If they don’t imprint on each other within two years, they’ll dissolve the mating. But with his cat holding back, danger lurking around corners, and her true mate making a reappearance, things might be more complicated than they bargained for.When he first joined Find Your Match . com, Isaiah wasn’t confident he’d be paired with someone who truly fit him. But he feels a kinship with Quinley. The healer stirs up his protective instincts and ticks his every box. He always envisioned that he’d mate a fellow dominant, but this submissive healer pulls him in like no other.Still, he doesn’t expect to feel possessive of her so fast—she’s a relative stranger. But as soon as he puts the claiming brand on her neck, everything in him screams Mine.His cat, though, doesn’t view her as its mate. The animal is still angry at being unable to have the female it was predestined to claim. But when Quinley’s own fated mate comes sniffing around and she becomes a target of their enemies, the cat is finally in agreement with Isaiah on one vital thing: Quinley belongs to them now, and they’ll never let her go.",
