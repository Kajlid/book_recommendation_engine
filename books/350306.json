But what happens when the clock strikes two? A cat gets hungry for mouse-tail stew . . . and the chase is on! Hour by hour, more animals - and even a few people - join in. The crowd charges into the barnyard, dashes through the kitchen, and eventually heads right into the middle of town. Keep your eye on the many clocks in this book and follow along until this twelve-hour race comes to a surprising end! In each of these unique titles, poetry, stories, and trivia combine to illustrate math principles for young readers. The lighthearted illustrations and storylines show students how fascinating the world of numbers can be.",
