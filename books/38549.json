  "title": "Taking America Back: A Radical Plan to Revive Freedom, Morality, and Justice",
  "description": "According to Joseph Farah, Americans are faced with an unresponsive and unaccountable one-party political system, an establishment propaganda machine posing as a free press and cultural institutions-educational, charitable, entertainment, religious, medical and others-seduced by the materialist gods of an all-powerful secular state. Even more important, the crisis this represents cannot be resolved through the political system by electing new politicians to office. A much more profound, long-term, and fundamental shift is needed, one that rejects the validity of the all-powerful, all-knowing, all-controlling state and affirms the values upon which the American nation was founded. Taking America Back is about freedom, the freedom the founding generation of leaders fought for in establishing the United States. Farah shows how, as a nation, we have moved from being freedom fighters to comfort lovers and he calls for all Americans to realize where our present state of affairs is taking us.",
