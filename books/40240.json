  "description": "This is the third gripping tale in the four-part audio series from Stephen King's best-selling book Four Past Midnight. Set in Junction City, Iowa, \"The Library Policeman\" is the story of Sam Peebles, a middle-aged businessman who happens to have some overdue books. It seems a minor offenseâ€”but not to Junction City's malevolent monster of a librarian. What follows is spine-tingling suspense as only Stephen King can deliver it.",
