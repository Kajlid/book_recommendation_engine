  "title": "Mud, Sweat, and Gears: A Rowdy Family Bike Adventure Across Canada on Seven Wheels",
  "description": "After seventeen years, who would road test a perfectly good marriage by putting it on a summer-long, self-contained bicycle adventure across Canada? Only the Metal Cowboy, of course. Beth Biagini Kurmaskie, the woman behind the man-child, has finally saddled up on her own volition—if only to bring a bit of parental supervision to the mix. She struggles and stumbles along the way while celebrating summer, speed, the simple pleasures of a road trip powered by one’s own muscles, and what it means to be part of one stripped of the comforts and noise of the modern world, riding sixteen feet of bicycle train. With three sons aboard—one celebrating his first birthday on the road—a nursing mother finds her inner Xena Warrior Cyclist and all the reasons why she's stayed married to a whirling dervish of a husband. Mud, Sweat, and Gears brings together absurd and sublime moments, introduces an American family to the wilds of Canada, uncovers choice characters (man and animal), and finds all the humor and pathos a Metal Cowboy adventure is famous for. If Momentum Is Your Friend was about fathers, sons, and hometown heroes, then Mud, Sweat, and Gears is about mothers, wives, family, and the glue that holds the world together. With an extra revealing and outrageous footnotes from Beth throughout, filling in the backstories to many previous Metal Cowboy tales.",
