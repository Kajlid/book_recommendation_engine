  "title": "Manhattan Street Scenes",
  "description": "This richly nostalgic volume highlights some of the mostextraordinary periods of New York City's history, including the first decade of the 20th century, the Roaring Twenties, and the later years that led to the Great Depression and World War II. Abounding with evocative period photography,Manhattan Street Scenes invites readers into an age when no man walked the streets without wearing a hat, when buying liquor was illegal, when vaudeville and Broadway theaters were aglitter with stars and wildly popular songs, and when the city's streets teemed with motorcars such as Packards, Studebackers, and Dusenbergs. Additionally, the inclusion of rare, never before published police and crime photography enhances the charm of this volume.",
