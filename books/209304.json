The clock is ticking and Fathers Whitworth O’Grady and Harrison Stawker are running out of time to find someone for a very special job. As they race around the inaugural Christmas Markets looking for the right man to fill some very big black boots, their search is thwarted at every turn by protests, flirty florists and a vindictive journalist. As all hope seems lost, someone steps forward to save Christmas . Someone they did not expect... Albert's Christmas is a festive extra from the village of Bumpkinton. This is a short story, not a novel or novella. The events take place after the novella, The Bachelor.",
