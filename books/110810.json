  "description": "There was no passion to break her heart, no love to risk and lose. Marrying her boss, prominent businessman Cormick Grayson, was a very reasonable proposition for a woman who'd been hurt in love before. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.At first. But something wasn't right. The heat in Gray s eyes told her there was more to this than a polite, passionless marriage. But Gray s cool, impersonal distance left Amber wondering about the man she'd married.Amber never imagined she'd be the one demanding more, yearning to feel things she vowed she would never risk again.",
