  "description": "Twice Blessed...with money and raffish good looks, Richard Veringer abandoned holy orders for the unholy life as an 18th centruy rakehell - a decision that brought down upon him and his family three hundred years of supernatural horror.Thrice Cursed...by a scorned witch, the sins of the father were visited upon Veringer's sons and daughters, turning them into unspeakable creatures of the night...devourers of human flesh, drinkers of blood. Driven out of England by terrified townspeople, they roamed the earth for three centuries, searching for an end to the curse and their eternal torment. Little did they dream they would find the answer to their unsanctified prayers in the glittering Hollywood of the 1920s. Only in this unreal city could help be found - and the very real terror be stopped forever",
