  "description": "“My goodness, you’re certainly growing up. Getting so tall and mature. Why, you can barely recognize yourself from just a few short months ago—back when you were so young. Your body is changing. Changes can be scary. Especially for girls, and, gosh, it can be confusing.” Nope. No way. That’s not this book. This is NOT your mother’s coming-of-age manual. In the comedic likes of Chelsea Handler, author Jen Ashton breaks sex-education tradition and begins her hilariously endearing journey to womanhood with stories of growing up a tomboy in Middle America, circa the 1980’s. Packed with iconic pop culture, nostalgic geekery, and a healthy dose of self-deprecation, Ashton foregoes the conventional route of learning how to be a lady and dives right in, enlisting the help of Cosmo, Hustler and her anal-loving housekeeper. Forget dancing around the dutiful explanations passed on from generation to generation—tales of ‘the red curse’ and ‘your changing body.’ Ashton’s rites of passage are chock-full of unique life lessons learned the extracurricular way. From bodily functions to breast enlargement, pregnancy prevention to purgatory, learn the real facts of life as only she can describe them. If you’re lucky, you might even discover the answer to the age-old Do Girls Poop? If you thought your journey through puberty was rough, be prepared to finally feel normal. Girls Don’t Poop is a jaw-dropping, side-splitting adventure of one clueless tomboy’s quest to figure out women, so that she could inevitably become one.",
