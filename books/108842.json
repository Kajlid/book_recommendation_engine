  "description": "Having a second chance at your once in a lifetime love doesn’t necessarily mean things will go the way you plan. Logan Brookes and Andrew Eastin thought they had found true happiness; that their lives were finally coming together. Their relationship was no stranger to trials and tribulations, but nothing could have prepared them for the troubles they had yet to experience. After overcoming her fears only to lose the love of her life again, Logan faced a bitter reality. Finally accepting that she could not change things that were out of her hands, she resolved there was one thing that she could control—her own life, and her own acceptance.Andrew couldn’t imagine living without Logan. He never dreamed she would turn to another man. Losing her to someone else was one thing, but losing her completely would send him spiraling out of control. When fate intervenes and paths are rerouted, Andrew is faced with unimaginable decisions. A love interrupted only led to betrayal and more lies, and lies destroy people. Unless, you destroy the lies. Andrew takes it upon himself to fight for the only thing that has ever mattered in his life. Logan. He would come up against his own family if he had to in order to protect her and her unborn child. If he has anything to say about it, nothing will prevent Andrew and Logan from breaking free, being together, and interrupting the lies that threaten to end them both.",
