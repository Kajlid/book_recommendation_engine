  "description": "The pack has started to close in, and it seems the promise of Leadville has at last come down to a promise to die under the blue. One final trek for the sunlight and end of one's own design.  But the closer to the blue Russell and Tanner and Voley get, the less stable even that path becomes. Yet there might be a silver salvation after all.",
