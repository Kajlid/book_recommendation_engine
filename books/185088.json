  "description": "Astronomer and TV science guy Gevin Rees just landed the interview of a lifetime with the world's most famous physicist. Remarkable, because the eccentric genius is notoriously reclusive. And he's already dead. What happens next forces Rees to run for his life from two separate assassins and global powers desperate to bury what he's just uncovered. Mind-blowing technology and solid evidence that would rewrite religious history and challenge the faith of billions. Rees teams up with DCIS Special Agent Kerry Morgan, who soon discovers her own agency has been compromised. Forced underground, the pair must rely on little more than Morgan's fierce tenacity and Rees's scientific know-how. Their only path back to safety is to unlock the shocking secrets of the Kafir Project and expose them to the world. But can they beat the impossible odds stacked against them?",
