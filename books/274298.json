  "title": "Enter the Circle: Essays on Mental Health & the Occult",
  "description": "\"Enter the Circle\" is a collection of personal essays on how occultism has benefitted mental health and wellbeing for Davidson and Stone. Through careful examination and expression these essays will provide insight to the many ways both authors came to the realisation that mental health needn't be something to be ashamed of. The essays vary across a selection of literature from occult and Buddhist teachings, nonfiction and fiction, and other media. Both authors open up how they balance and maintain mental health through personal lessons and experience.",
