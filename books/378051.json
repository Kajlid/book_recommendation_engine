  "description": "John and his cousin Edward were friends in Whitby in the 1880s. However, John's passion for the new science of photography clashes with Edward's resolute faith in art and painting. A feud develops between them and the discovery of a secret cave beneath Whitby Abbey and the arrival of two women in their lives only serve to escalate the tensions. When the two women disappear in mysterious circumstances they are faced with a stark choice. They realise that only by becoming reconciled and joining forces together would they ever stand any chance of finding the women either dead or alive. When everything seems hopeless, John and Edward finally become reconciled and their search takes them in the direction of the secret tunnels and caves deep beneath Whitby Abbey. In a desperate race against time and facing considerable danger the plot builds up to a dramatic and heart stopping conclusion.",
