  "title": "I Love You, Stinky Face",
  "description": "A vividly illustrated bedtime story that shows how the unconditional love of a mother can be tested through the relentless questions of her little boy. \"But Mama, but Mama, what if I were a super smelly skunk, and I smelled so bad that my name was Stinky Face?\"Mothers love their children and this unconditional love is truly tested in I LOVE YOU, STINKY FACE. Lisa McCourt and Cyd Moore beautifully weave a reassuring tale of the love and affection of a parent. The imaginative son turns himself into a meat-eating dinosaur, a swamp creature and much, much more before being satisfied with the fact that no matter how stinky he is or how slimy of a creature he could possibly be, he is loved and nothing will change that.",
