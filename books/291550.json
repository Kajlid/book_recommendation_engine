  "title": "Lost and Found",
  "description": "LOST AND FOUND is an exploration of love blurred with heartbreak, mental health and sexual abuse, female identity, dis/believing, and trying to break free from the chains of cultural toxicity. Ahmed uses haunting language to bring life to the gut-wrenching poems, reflecting on childhood trauma, that first-once-in-a-lifetime love and the broken heart that follows. It is a collection about how depression and anxiety can affect every day life and the role of a daughter in a South Asian family. It is a journey about pain and finding a semblance of hope in all that darkness.",
