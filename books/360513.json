  "title": "Sergeant York and the Great War",
  "description": "There was a time that Sergeant Alvin C. York was a household name in America. Perhaps many of you recognize the name from the motion picture of Sergeant York as portrayed by Gary Cooper. Needless to say the movie won Cooper his first Oscar and gave Sergeant York even more notoriety, helping to retain his status as a true American hero. This book details the early days of Alvin York, a backwoods Tennessean who lived in obscurity until he was drafted and trained to fight for Uncle Sam overseas during the Great War, World War I. Alvin York kept a war diary that was published in 1928 by Mr. Tom Skeykill. This book is unique reproduction of Sergeant York's war diary. Added to the events of the war diary are pictures and general information about World War I which allow the reader to experience perhaps for a moment, the feeling of what it was like to walk alongside Alvin York in the early 1900's.",
