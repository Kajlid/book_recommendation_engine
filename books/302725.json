All he wants to do is love me, but how do I let him do that when I can’t even love myself. ⁣⁣Ciaran:⁣I promised her an epic love story.⁣One that would blow those books she reads out of the water.⁣I knocked down her walls and stormed into her castle. ⁣We were ready to ride off into the sunset — or so I thought. ⁣One stupid decision screwed it all up, now she’s hellbent on saving herself.⁣She can push me away; fight me with her sassy attitude and sarcastic comebacks, but I’m not going anywhere. ⁣Lily O’Shea may not need a hero, but she's getting one anyway. ⁣⁣\"Let yourself love me, Lily. I dare you.\"⁣",
