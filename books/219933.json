  "description": "Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN-10: 1534803254 / ISBN-13: 9781534803251.SHATTERED DREAMS is a deep, rich, layered high fantasy, the beginning of an epic that will be well worth following for years to come. Looming menace, thoughtful worldbuilding; a winner! --Ed Greenwood (NYTimes bestselling fantasy writer, creator of the Forgotten Realms)Friedrich Nietzsche said that if one looks too long into the abyss, the abyss looks back. Drangar Ralgon has been avoiding the abyss's gaze for far too long and now turns to face it.Shattered Dreams is told from multiple viewpoints, with each individual tale eventually intersecting with the others, forming a tapestry. In a land finally at peace, war, like a weaver, pushes lives of warriors every which way until their paths become patterns. There are no shining heroes, no damsels who cannot save themselves, only people trying their damndest to make sense of the chaos they call their lives.This book retells the first steps as they figure out their roles in the gigantic tapestry the gods have laid out for them. In a world where actions do have consequences, and mistakes are paid for in blood and pain, the lives of a few can make a difference.Inspired by the vigorous style of George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, and in the vein of historical fictioneer Bernard Cornwell, SHATTERED DREAMS brings to life a stark, uncompromising tale of a man's path to redemption.",
