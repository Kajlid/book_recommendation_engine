Too many answers she never would have chosen. With no time to think or mourn, she struggles to take control of her fate once again. There’s one thing that Eden has always wanted— find Oscar. One solution— ask for Matt’s help. So begins a frantic journey with high stakes and savage battles. Buoyed by friendship, hardened by experience, Eden fights her way through endless obstacles with the single goal of reuniting her little family.But does Outpost Three still exist, or have the Sentries destroyed it, along with the last of Eden’s hopes?",
