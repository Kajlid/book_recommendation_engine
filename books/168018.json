  "description": "The Hottest New Romance of 2015  They say love and hate are just two sides of the same coin; two poles of the exact same emotion. They say a lot of stuff – whoever they are – and it's mostly grade A bull****, but on this point they're bang on the money. The distance between cold, icy hatred and burning, head-over-heels, yell-it-from-the-rooftops love is but the thickness of a shadow, and you wouldn't believe how easy it is to switch from one to the other.  Even – especially – when you really don't want to.  Ryan was everything shy, awkward scholarship girl Sophia despised: a callous, confident, wealthy ladies man who went through girls faster than she went through gum. It wasn't easy to hate him... it's never easy to hate a guy who looked like Ryan, with his tight abs, chiseled jaw and perfect mess of tousled brown hair, but Sophia managed it.  When Sophia's mother announced her intention to marry Ryan's father she thought her life was over. Even after graduation she couldn't escape this infuriating jackass, and now she'd have to sleep in the room next to his. Could life get any worse?  Maybe, but it might also get much, much better.  You see, Ryan has been hiding a shocking secret for two years, and Sophia is about to learn that she's much more important to him than she could ever understand...  Stepbrother, Where Art Thou? is the hot, steamy, fast-paced opening novella to the Stepbrother, Where Art Thou? series. It contains adult themes, occasional graphic sexual content and harsh language that may cause offence to some, and is suitable only for readers over the age of 18.  It should also be read alone, at night.",
