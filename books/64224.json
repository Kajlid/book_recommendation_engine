  "description": "Meg Fletcher spent her childhood dreaming of escaping Dare Island-her family's home for generations. So after she landed a high-powered job in New York City, she left and never looked back. But when she loses both her job and the support of her long-term, live-in boyfriend, she returns home to lick her wounds and reevaluate her life.Helping out her parents at the family inn, she can't avoid the reminders of the past she'd rather forget-especially charming and successful Sam Grady, her brother's best friend.Their one, disastrous night of teenage passion should have forever killed their childhood attraction, but Sam seems determined to reignite those long-buried embers. As Meg discovers the man he's become, she's tempted to open her vulnerable heart to him. But she has no intention of staying on Dare Island-no matter how seductive Sam's embrace might be.",
