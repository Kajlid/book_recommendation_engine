  "description": "What do bestselling writers Sue Grafton, Danielle Steel, and Tom Clancy all have in common? They've all been murdered in a manner both gruesome and appropriate to their style. An extremely paranoid Stephen King is convinced that he will be the next victim, so he leaves his heavily-barricaded fortress in Bangor, Maine, to discover who is bumping off his fellow novelists. This hilarious send-up of the world of publishing takes readers to Maine, Paris, and Venice and features cameo appearances by Steve Martin, Gerard Depardieuâ€”plus a few surprises.",
