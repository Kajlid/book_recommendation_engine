  "description": "The truth has come to light... but can I ever trust my men again?After weeks of cruel hostility, the guys I swore to save know how wrong they wereâ€”at least about what I did four years ago. Now that they've seen my horrifying new power, will they decide I'm an enemy after all?With what they put me through, I'm not sure I even want to stick with them. These brutal men aren't the boys I fell in love with anymore.But nothing matters more than learning how to control my own vicious urges. So I'll accept a tentative truce while we hunt down more answers... by turning to the very monsters our creator feared most.",
