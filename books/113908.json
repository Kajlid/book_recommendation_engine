Soon after she moved into the eighteenth-century cabin she inherited from her great-aunt Mina—her \"crazy\" great-aunt, who spoke to the dead—a woman was murdered nearby. Craig Rockwell—known as Rocky—is a new member of the Krewe of Hunters, the FBI's team of paranormal investigators. He never got over finding a friend dead in the woods. Now another body's been found in those same woods, not far from the home of Devin Lyle. And Devin's been led to a third body—by...a ghost? Her discovery draws them both deeper into the case and Salem's rich and disturbing history.

But the two of them need every skill they possess to learn the truth—or Devin's might be the next body in the woods...",
