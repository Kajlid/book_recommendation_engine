  "description": "I may have won The Damning...  ...but the games have only just begun.  Forced to participate in seven tasks, each designated by one of the seven kings, my life has just become exponentially more complicated.  First task? Travel to the Mermaid King with my mate and his sadistic brothers and kill a nameless, faceless, non-existent man. Easy.  But the kings aren't the only ones playing games. Someone wants me dead. Someone who is willing to resurrect dead supernatural creatures in order to achieve their goal.  Oh and Bash is still being an ass. What's new?  One thing becomes clear: I have to decide if I'm going to accept the mate bonds or forsake my destiny.  All I wanted was to be a good little assassin and kill some Nightmares. Why does my life have to suck so hard?   This is a reverse harem series featuring a kickass assassin and her seven deadly lovers. These books contain scenes that might be triggering for some readers including strong language, sexual situations, and violence. Reader discretion is advised.",
