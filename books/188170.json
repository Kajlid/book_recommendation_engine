Then her super-geeky teenage brother Tudor claims his hacker worm has escaped and is chewing through the Internet. This, followed by the news that the executives of a major computer company have croaked from exotic fish poison, sets Ana's danger radar pinging. Soon, Tudor is running from government agents, a trained assassin, and corporate spies. Tudor’s worm might have led to murder, but Ana's landlord, the infuriatingly competent Amadeus Graham, could take the fall. Before long, Ana has four bodies, dozens of suspects, and more trouble than she can count. On top of which, the Internet is on the brink of collapse. Finally Ana gets more than a glimpse of sexy Graham, the enigmatic tycoon who holds the family’s inheritance hostage. But this time, she holds the trump card and is about to secure their future, if she lives long enough.",
