  "description": "Jehan might have been born Az-kye but growing up in exile as the son of a disgraced warrior has left him with nothing but contempt for his own kind. Caught in a storm at the edge of Tellaran space he answers a distress call barely in time to save the ship’s sole survivor—an Az-kye slave girl, Liri.    Though living in the Badlands has taught Jehan not to care about anyone but himself, he soon finds that rescuing this lovely creature is turning into a habit. But the woman who calls herself Liri isn’t who she says she is and loving her might just get him killed . . .",
