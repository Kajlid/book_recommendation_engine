  "title": "Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott",
  "description": "Six years before she wrote Little Women, Louisa May Alcott, in financial straits, entered \"Pauline's Passion and Punishment,\" a novelette, in a newspaper contest. Not only did it win the $100 prize, but, published anonymously, it marked the first in the series of \"blood & thunder tales\" that would be her livelihood for years. In Behind a Mask, editor Madeleine Stern introduces four Alcott thrillers: \"Pauline's Passion and Punishment,\" \"The Mysterious Key,\" \"The Abbot's Ghost,\" and the title story, \"Behind a Mask.\" First published in one volume in 1975, they are regarded as Alcott's finest work in this genre.",
