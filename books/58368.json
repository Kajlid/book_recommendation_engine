  "description": "Young Huy's family is thrilled when his uncle offers to pay for the boy to attend a prestigious school at Iunu. Thanks to his generous benefactor, this farmer's son will now have a chance at a better life as a scribe. But once away at school, Huy is unprepared for the jealousy his easy success stirs in fellow pupils, and he becomes the victim of a vicious attack that leaves him dead-or so it would seem.His inexplicable return to life makes Huy a pariah, ostracizes him because of his visions of the deaths of those around him. But priests believe his powers could be the key to interpreting the Book of Thoth, and Huy's newfound fame attracts the attention of Pharaoh Amunhotep. It's only then that Huy begins to realize his power is not granted to him, but owns him, for he is no longer his own master. He is the King's Man.",
