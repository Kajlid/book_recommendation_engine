But the man sitting next to me in 1B has different plans.

Unfortunately, life has other plans because I’m still married, and Cash James is the billionaire playboy standing between me and my dream promotion.My job is simple—find Mr. James a wife. But nothing is easy when simply walking into his office and inhaling his woodsy scent makes me feel a buzz like I’ve just sipped straight from the whiskey bottle. He makes me tipsy with emotion. Breathless, fearless, and stupid.Because no matter how good it feels in the moment, our love burns on the way down.Authors Note: Whiskey Lies is book one of the Falling For Whiskey duet. It is a Billionaire Contemporary Romance. This book is part of a duet and is not a standalone.",
