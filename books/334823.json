  "title": "Cutty, One Rock: Low Characters and Strange Places, Gently Explained",
  "description": "Cutty, One Rock takes the reader on a wild journey by airplane, bus, ferry, and foot from childhood to early manhood in the company of a New Jersey family in equal measures cultivated and deranged. We witness scenes of passionate, even violent intensity that give rise to meditations on eros and literature, the solitariness of travel, and the poetics of place.These individual pieces, most of which first appeared in The London Review of Books and won an international cult following, are by turns \"poignant, surreal, down home and lyrical, a mixture of qualities that inheres in his language with uncommon delicacy and effect\" (Leonard Michaels). Together they make up an intellectual and emotional autobiography on the run. The book's final section, about Kleinzahler's adored, doomed older brother, is unforgettable, and since its appearance last year in the LRB , has already entered the literature as one of the most moving contemporary memoirs.",
