  "description": "Vali's given up hope of finding love thanks to his unfortunate hair and eyes. When an unexpected visitor in his room treats him to delights he never expected, he finds he likes it. Except his midnight guest is a male, and he’s not human. Vali’s definitely straight, but he can't help but wish for the winged being to return.With barely enough energy, Azriel fled beyond the border of the Fallen realm to escape army duty and his abusive lover. He has no idea how he'll survive on Earth with the savage hunger, and he'll never be able to run away from his past as one of Red's victims. He just needs a few pearls to heal his injuries, but maybe Vali and Azriel can give each other more.",
