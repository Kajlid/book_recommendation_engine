  "description": "Jay Connelly has a graffiti problem. At twenty-four, his addiction to painting on the late night streets of Seattle has caused his life to stall before it’s even started. When his most recent painting lands him in jail again, the last thing he expects is to be bailed out by the sexiest, most arrogant jerk he’s ever met, much more to be offered a job. Dylan Phillips has always had enough money and power to acquire anything he wants. He’s spent years trying to track down and hire the artist who keeps leaving amazing murals on the side of his software company, but no matter how much money he’s thrown into finding him, Dylan’s always come up empty—until he helps the police catch the graffiti artist in the act. The first time he sees Jay in person, Dylan knows he wants more than artwork from the sexy young man. Jay doesn’t want to compromise his new job at Artemis Software by hitting on his boss, but he’s so attracted to the older man that he can’t stop thinking about him. Jay can resist the temptation during the day, but working late sparks an explosive affair that makes keeping his hands to himself torture. Incredible sex helps them discover that they have more than enough in common to forge a real relationship, if they can overcome Jay’s dismal sense of self-worth and Dylan’s insecurities over his own submissive cravings. But with the power difference between them, Dylan’s violent ex-lover, Jay’s tendency to get arrested, and a homicidal jail drug lord all threatening to tear them apart, making their relationship last might prove to be impossible.
