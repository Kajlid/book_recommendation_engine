Do I stay above ground, with all my magical friends, and wait for the battle to come to me? Or do I seek the demon out, and pluck the threat out by the root?  I don’t want my friends to die on my behalf. I could never life with myself. But if I venture into the Underworld, it’ll be the most perilous journey of my life.  This time, it isn’t just my life hanging in the balance, it is my eternity.An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.",
