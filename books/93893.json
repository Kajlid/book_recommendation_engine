  "description": "“There is a custom among my people,” he said, his voice shaking with emotion as it bobbed too near the surface of his tightly-lidded calm. “When one commits an immense wrong, he must sing a lament for the preservation of his soul. That is why the great wolf howls. He sings not only for his soul, but for the souls of his forefathers and all the ones who bear the curse of Kamut.” In the gripping conclusion to THE SPIRIT KEEPER, Sarah Redbird struggles to connect with the Katori tribe as she uncovers even more secrets about her past and the family she’s never known. Is she the key to undoing a terrible curse and saving the enemy tribe? Will Sarah’s love for Adrian survive a force—and a destiny—that may be beyond her control? Discover the answers with Sarah in THE PROPHECY. “Just as 17 year old Sarah Redbird finds her inner strength to break an ancient curse, THE PROPHECY proves that author Melissa Luznicky Garrett continues as one of the strongest writers of paranormal romantic young adult fiction. With her innovative plots, dramatic scenes, and memorable characters, Garrett makes her readers of all ages fall even more in love with Adrian and Sarah. The result is a highly entertaining read with echoes of the eternal powers of ancestry, spirit, nature, and love on every page.\" Melissa M.
