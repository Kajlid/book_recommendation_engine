We burned fast. We burned bright. I shouldn’t have loved him at all. I shouldn’t have left him. But the call of success, fame, and a dream career, pulled me away from the one man who made me come alive. Now he hates me. And though I have everything I thought I wanted, success, fame, legions of screaming fans, without Aidan, it feels as if I have nothing. He hasn’t forgiven me. He swears he never will. But he’s the only man I’ve ever loved, And I can’t give him up.",
