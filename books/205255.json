  "title": "In the Country of Shadows",
  "description": "From the author of the award-winning Flights of Angels comes the fourth book in the Exit Unicorns series. It is the winter of 1975 in Northern Ireland and the Troubles are at their darkest hour. Casey Riordan is missing and Jamie Kirkpatrick has just returned home from two years in a Russian gulag. Desperate to find her missing husband, Pamela Riordan makes a devil’s bargain with the one man she believes can help her, forming an alliance which will have grave consequences for her and those she loves. For Pamela and her family, caught in the quagmire of eight hundred years’ worth of hate and betrayal, compromise, both that of body and soul—is inevitable. All of them face an uncertain future in Northern Ireland—a country of shadows, where nothing is as it seems and the slightest misstep can have deadly consequences. Shimmering historical detail and masterful storytelling combine in a tale which sweeps us across continents and seas from the bloody events of the Troubles to the rough streets of post-Vietnam San Francisco, and make this fourth book a journey of both turbulent intensity and heartbreaking choices.",
