  "title": "Oliver Twist: The Parish Boy's Progress",
  "description": "Dickens attacks the modern workhouse with a sort of inspired simplicity as of a boy in a fairy tale who had wandered about, sword in hand, looking for ogres and who had found an indisputable ogre. All the other people of his time are attacking things because they are bad economics or because they are bad politics, or because they are bad science; he alone is attacking things because they are bad. ... Oliver Twist is not pathetic because he is a pessimist. Oliver Twist is pathetic because he is an optimist. The whole tragedy of [him asking for more] is in the fact that he does expect the universe to be kind to him, that he does believe that he is living in a just world.",
