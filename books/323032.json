  "description": "Parker Davies, former rodeo star turned U.S. Marshal, wants something he can’t have—Tilly Bradford. He had met the equestrian, fell for her, and then saw her name on a case that came across his desk. Suddenly he had to step back from the one woman he had wanted. Instead, he threw himself into the work of the task force he’d been assigned to—the one tasked with taking down the person responsible for financing the criminal underworld.Tilly Bradford wasn’t like the rest of her family. She didn’t care about the generations of old money, the glamorous galas, or being the center of attention. She cared about show jumping and investing in small businesses. And Tilly certainly didn’t ever care to see Parker Davies, the man who had completely shut her down, again.But then Parker went and kicked down her door. Handcuffs were used (and not in a fun way), bullets were flying, and criminals came out of the woodwork to take her out. Now it wasn’t just Tilly’s heart, but her life in Parker’s hands. The question was: what would he do with it, and would she even be alive to find out?",
