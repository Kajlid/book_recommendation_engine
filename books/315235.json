He and his wife Samantha appear to have the perfect marriage. After a series of mistakes led them to New York City decades earlier, Vince has built an empire for them and their two children as a high-profile stockbroker. But inside the walls of their Upper East Side apartment tells a different story. Restless in a passionless marriage, Vince finds himself infatuated with Bianca, an aspiring Broadway actress. As they fall deeper in love, Samantha grows increasingly suspicious. All three of their lives start to spiral toward a collision course with the past. A path paved with betrayal, confusion, and jealousy. In Wounds of Time by Stevie D. Parker, we are taken on the sexy, emotional roller coaster ride of three vastly different people tormented by the effects of an affair, forced to face the decisions they have made.",
