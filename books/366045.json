That could have been Dave Connor's six word memoir. \"At first he couldn't remember how he'd ended up in that shallow grave; he just knew it was hell to claw his way out, and that the taste of its dirt would remain in his mouth for the rest of his time on this earth\" ... Expect the unexpected in this existential resurrection thriller.",
