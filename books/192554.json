  "description": "The author of Mrs Queen Takes The Train, a national bestseller, delivers a grandly imaginative historical novel, set in the glamorous, stratified world of nineteenth-century Brahmin Boston, about the transformative friendship between socialite Isabella Stewart Gardner and iconic artist John Singer Sargent.Isabella Stewart Gardner married into one of Boston’s grandest families, but she chafes at the company of society matrons. Already tainted by her nouveau riche origins, something else isolates her in the gilded drawing rooms of Beacon Hill: She’s a fiercely intelligent, independent woman who refuses to conform.John Singer Sargent knows he’s different. Admitted to exhibit in the prestigious Salon before he’s twenty-one, he’s also secretly gay. The sensational, sensual quality of his “Madame X” shocks the establishment, threatens his exposure, and compels him to leave Paris.Both Gardner and Sargent may look like insiders, but they feel like outcasts. The nineteenth century threats of ostracism and condemnation were real. When they meet, they slowly discover an affinity that transcends their roles as patron and painter. So begins an intense, unconventional friendship that propels them on an odyssey through American and British high society, and the increasing pressures of fame and fidelity. Embroidered around the historical milestones of their lives, this atmospheric, deeply felt novel celebrates two vibrant individuals who, with each other’s help, embrace their singular gifts to shape the world of Western art.",
