  "description": "Falling in love wasn't part of Jessika's temporary job description. Nor, initially, was being asked by billionaire CEO Asher Landseer to become an egg donor and surrogate for his infertile wife. All Jessika wants to do is help, but is she setting herself up for heartbreak in the process? (A Cerys du Lys contemporary BDSM erotic romance novel) Screwing up on her first day of a one-day job is the last thing Jessika Fevrier wanted to do. Worse yet, she's managed to infuriate Asher Landseer, the young, handsome, reclusive and eccentric billionaire CEO of Landseer Enterprises. His idea of work performance punishment is unorthodox to say the least, but Jessika finds herself intrigued by this singularly unaffected man nonetheless. She was only supposed to clean Asher's office, but before she leaves for the day he has another job he'd like to offer her. Revealing that his wife is infertile, Asher asks her to consider becoming an egg donor for his family. He's always wanted children of his own, but the fates have plotted against him, it seems. Asher's marriage is of necessity, rough and possibly loveless, but his desire for children is genuine and real. His absoluteness and certainty in himself and his surroundings, despite everything, captivates her. Jessika finds herself charmed by this dominant, enigmatic man who seems to know everything about business and nothing about love. Behind the scenes, there's more than the fates plotting against him. Someone has it out for Landseer Enterprises, and they're going to do everything within their power to cause Asher's downfall. Between dealing with Asher's conditions and requirements, the cruel gaze of his spiteful wife, and corporate sabotage, Jessika finds herself lost in a world completely different from the one she's used to. Can she rediscover herself and come to terms with her impossible feelings for a man she can't have? Or in her attempts to satisfy His Absolute Need will she inadvertently become the catalyst that leads to his (and her) ruin? Dominant, sexy, and powerful. This tantalizing story of love, lust, intrigue and suspense will bind you, entwine you, and thrill you until the very end. This book is intended for mature audiences.",
