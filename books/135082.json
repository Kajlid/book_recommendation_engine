The dinner was starting to get out of control. “I wasn’t aware this was going to be an inquisition,” she stated between nervous giggles.“Just getting to know you,” Scott said. “Ever had sex with more than one person at a time?” he asked.“What?” Now she was shocked. “No.”“Would you like to?” Joanie asked as she rested her hand on Menolly’s knee.“Oh.”Joanie continued. “You’re young, you’re pretty, you’re sexy,” she said, “and you have the most incredible blue eyes. Scott and I have an…unusual marriage compared to a lot of couples. We thought we’d let you know because we’re interested in you. We like you.”“I…uh…I’ve never had that type of invitation before,” she managed to stammer out. As much as she hated to admit it, Menolly was intrigued and more than a bit aroused.“You don’t have to give us an answer right away, we just thought we’d extend the invitation to let you know who we are,” Joanie told her but didn’t remove her hand from Menolly’s knee.“Wow,” she said. “I don’t know what to say.”",
