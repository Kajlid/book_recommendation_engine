  "description": "The Queen of Werewolves Never Bows—She Hunts.\nBeing Queen of the British Werewolves means I’m not one to back down, especially when my friend Emory is facing trial on spurious charges. I stormed in, certain that my impassioned speech would help save the king of the dragon shifters – but darker forces prevailed.The Domini, a sinister secret society, is pulling strings from the darkness. They manipulate rulers and topple thrones – but they’ve picked the wrong woman to mess with. I refuse to dance to their tune; the only thing I dance to is nineties’ pop music.My mission is clear: dismantle the Domini and find a long-lost magical artefact that could restore our pack’s lost air powers. With a few powerful werewolves at my side, lured in by yummy cookies, cute unicorns and a commitment to gender equality, I’m building an unstoppable force.Once I’ve got my allies and our ancient orb back, I won’t just be levelling the playing field – I’ll be obliterating it. And then it’ll be time for me to go hunting…The Domini better start sleeping with one eye open.",
