  "description": "Golden ChildHer daughter meant everything to Carly Alderson. After all, she'd gone through hell to have her. As an unwed teenager, no one had understood Carly's fiercely protective bond to her fatherless child…not her parents, not the sometimes narrow-minded college town she called home. But Tracy was hers, and no one would ever take her away, especially the golden boy who'd made Carly a woman—and nearly destroyed her world—one all-too-memorable night….The memory of Mitch Scanlon hadn't faded with the years. And now the man himself threatened to become a permanent fixture in her life—as well as a bittersweet reminder of her darkest secret. One that surely couldn't last once father and daughter were united.",
