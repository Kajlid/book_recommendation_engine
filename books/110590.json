  "description": "When Elle disappeared without a trace, police officer Morgan Beckett was devastated. The two shared a relationship where she relinquished absolute power to him, and he knows he failed to protect her. When he sees her again outside a coffee shop they used to frequent, he’s stunned. But then she runs—terrified of him—when he calls out to her, and he knows that things are not what they seem.Upon tracing her back to the hotel where she’s staying, he makes a discovery that threatens to tear him apart. Elle, the woman he loved, the woman he thought he’d lost forever, has not one, but two men in her life, and they’re both fiercely protective of her. And worse, she has no memory of Morgan—or their life together before her disappearance.Morgan only knows one thing. He’s not letting her go without one hell of a fight. But there’s also the question of why she disappeared and who tried to kill her. Now he and Elle’s two lovers must combine forces to protect Elle from her dark past. And the man who’ll stop at nothing to make sure he succeeds in killing her this time.",
