  "description": "The Corn County Theatre is holding auditions for its big show, and Daisy is suddenly stage-struck. The director, however, won't allow a cow on stage. That's when one of the dancers suggests that Daisy could work behind the scenes. Daisy takes to her new job with boundless enthusiasm. Then comes opening night and one of the dancers is taken ill. Will the show go on? It's all up to Daisy. Viki Woodworth's delightful story of an adorable cow with big dreams is a fun-filled follow-up to Daisy the Firecow.",
