  "title": "John Paul Jones: Finding the Forgotten Patriot",
  "description": "You don't need to be a history or nautical buff to truly enjoy the fascinating characters in this historical novel. The author has written the dialogue in such a way as to make the reader feel a part of the conversation; part of the scene. It would be as if they were standing right next to John Paul Jones as he got down to the real issue, which is trying to figure how he's going to win the battle aboard the sinking Bon Homme Richard ; with rotten oaken sides and holds that are filling with sea water. While at the same time, the HMS Serapis , commanded by Captain Pearson, is ready to finish him off and strip him of his ship and crew.The astonishing life of John Paul Jones has been forgotten through the ages. He is but a footnote; seldom mentioned as a respectable peer among the honored land generals of the Revolutionary War.Maybe this story will help enlighten a few grey cells among the citizens of the USA. Just maybe they will welcome this extraordinary historical character into that inner circle of supreme and brave men who fought so diligently during the American Revolutionary War.",
