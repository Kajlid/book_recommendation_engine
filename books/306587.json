  "title": "Odyssey: Attila Balogh and the Quest for the Perfect Guitar",
  "description": "Between 1976 and 1982, Attila Balogh and his Odyssey Guitars Limited made around 2,000 mysterious, unique instruments in a small factory in Vancouver, B.C. Most were identified only by a small brass disc on their headstock, glimpsed onstage with some of the world's biggest bands, and then, like a dream, they slipped into mist and myth and were gone, along with the tragic young genius who created them. Today, some swear Balogh's instruments are the most beautiful and best-playing electric guitars and basses that have ever been. In this thoroughly researched history, biography, and collector's reference, Craig Jones tells for the first time the story of Attila Balogh, the young men of Odyssey Guitars Limited, and the amazing instruments they made.",
