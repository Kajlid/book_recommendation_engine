  "description": "Some stories are meant to be written in prose. Hers will be written in blood.In the wilds of Old Virginia, the shadows whisper of rebellion. The air may be heavy with discontent, but Maia Avalos only feels the burn of whiskey as she grieves her mother over another glass. One night, a rebel approaches her to finish the fight her father started against Porticoâ€”the tyrannical law-and-order of the land. Determined to prove she's worthy to carve her mark on the world and avenge her parents' deaths, Maia takes his offer, making her Portico's new target.Now part of the lawless world of the rebels, Maia recruits a bruised-up gambler, a vengeful brothel madame, and an ex-bounty hunter, placing her life in their deceitful hands. When Maia and her team are the sole survivors of a heist meant to tip the scales in the rebellion's favor, she realizes the only way to destroy Portico is from within. Once inside, she's pulled into a dangerous game of manipulation, making her question if she's fighting on the right side of history.THE LEGACIES OF TRAITORS is a gritty new adult dystopian that journeys into a nature-reborn post-apocalyptic world on the brink of revolution, with a morally gray ensemble cast and twists that will make you question who you can trust.",
