  "description": "In a world full of Vicious Beasts, if you are not a predator, you are prey.With my life going down in literal flames I ran from everything. From my father, from a forced marriage, from my mates .Now, charged with a crime I didn’t commit, they’re all hunting me . And they’re all furious.The dangerous deputy headmaster of Animus Academy manages to catch me and along with three of my five mates we’re taken back to the prison-school they use to teach feral beasts how to be civilised. Now I’m locked up with the very men I’ve been trying to avoid all my life.No one can know who my mates are. No one can know who I really am. Because if they do, it’s lights out for me. I’ll be chained up and bred until I die. And I refuse to allow that to happen.",
