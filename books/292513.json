  "description": "Longing for love, can she escape the shadows that follow her to Dark Island?1910, Thousand Islands, New York. Others may consider The Towers castle on Dark Island an enchanting summer retreat, but to Devyn McKenna, it's a prison. Yet as she works as a maid for Frederick Bourne, former president of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, her life blossoms under the kindness of his family and fascinating entrepreneurs such as J.P. Morgan, Thomas Lipton, and Captain Vanderbilt. But more than anything, the growing friendship of Mr. Bourne's valet, Brice McBride, begins to pry away the painful layers that conceal Devyn's heart.Brice is drawn to the mysterious Devyn even though he's certain she's hiding a secret, one far more dangerous than the clues they find in The Towers that hint of a treasure on the island. When Devyn is accused of stealing Bourne's investment in Vanderbilt's New York City subway expansion, he might not be able to protect her.",
