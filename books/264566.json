  "description": "'It is actually a serious book, but it had me laughing out loud several times on the Tube. All mothers should receive one for Christmas.' Marcus Berkmann, SpectatorEveryone who loves The Crown on Netflix will enjoy this celebration of Queen Elizabeth II and her beloved canine friends.The Queen has had corgis by her side ever since she was seven years old and persuaded her father to buy one for the family. She also has several dorgis (a cross resulting from an accidental liaison between one of the Queen's corgis and Princess Margaret's dachshund) and is a passionate breeder of gundogs.The dogs are the Queen's constant companions, travelling with her by air, road and rail, from one royal residence to another. She walks and feeds them herself, chooses names for them, and at the end of their days, buries them with personalised plaques to commemorate each individual. Penny Junor reveals the scraps and scrapes that the dogs have been involved in - the hierarchy amongst them, the corgis' feisty attitude to footmen and guests, gardeners and innocent passersby. This fascinating and affectionate look at the Queen and her most faithful companions is a book for dog lovers everywhere about what really makes our much-loved and longest reigning monarch truly light up.",
