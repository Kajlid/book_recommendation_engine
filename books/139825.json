But even at the risk of losing their souls, they can’t seem to let her go.As riddles unravel and enemies close in, it becomes clear their fates are intertwined in ways none of them could have imagined. But if they can’t trust each other, even fate might not be enough to save them.A Curse of Twisted Fates is the first book in a slow-burn PNR Reverse Harem series and will end on a cliffhanger.",
