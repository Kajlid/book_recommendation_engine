  "description": "In this penetrating memoir, we witness the Holocaust through the eyes of Mike Jacobs (then Mendel Jakubowicz), who was a teenager during Word War II. With great clarity, Jacobs recounts five years of confinement in ghettos and concentration camps. A story told without hatred or bitterness, \"Holocaust Survivor\" teaches us that when we recognize that freedom comes from within, we are never completely powerless.",
