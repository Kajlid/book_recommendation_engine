  "description": "The butterfly effect — one small change, one moment in time that impacts the future.At twenty-six years old I never dreamed I’d walk in on my husband in bed with my best friend. At twenty-seven years old I found myself divorced, and the mother of a one-year-old son. Never mind I was learning to take the reins of my family’s apple orchard business. There was no way my life could be any more complicated…or so I thought.Can a woman who’s lost all trust in men help a man who can’t even trust himself?Aiden O’Hara was my brother’s best friend, and I would be remiss if I said I hadn’t always found him utterly attractive—and the passing of time or circumstances didn’t change that. But when he moves back to Boggy Creek Valley after serving his time as a Navy SEAL, I cannot deny the pull I feel between us.Aiden is haunted by his own demons—demons that seem bigger than the both of us—and my heart warns me to stay away. I’d been burned already and didn’t need that added complication in my life, or so I thought. But one moment in time changes everything between us, and neither one of us can deny the hidden feelings we share.Our pasts want to keep us apart…our future will be up to the wings of fate.The Butterfly Effect is book one in the Boggy Creek Valley series and is a stand-alone novel.",
