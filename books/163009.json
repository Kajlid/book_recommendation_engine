  "description": "~ She was hoping for a hero, but never realized who she would save. ~  This is a contemporary, new adult romance serial. For 18+ readers.  Kate Samuel met the handsome Lieutenant Matt Lewis, and it seemed like everything changed. He seemed like the only genuine man she knew, even though he was also a billionaire.  When her ex-coworker Joy announces that Matt is her man, all Kate's faith disappeared. It was a painful reminder about all the hero heart-breakers she had already experienced first hand.  Were her instincts all wrong? Was Matt just another two-timing billionaire?  Find out by reading HERO For Me, Book 2 of The Billionaire Salvation Series. Note: This is the second of at least 4 books in the serial.",
