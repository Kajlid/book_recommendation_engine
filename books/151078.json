  "description": "Dear Author,This is the last day of our senior year of high school. It hasn’t been an easy year for us, but we’ve made it. Please give us a story.This picture of us can represent the beginning, or the end, of your story for us. How did we make it to this point or where are we going from here?Photo Description: The photograph shows us two blond teenage boys on a sunny day, in front of a stadium. Both are quite buff and wearing identical maroon-colored rugby jerseys. The taller boy has an arm around the other in a gentle embrace whilst pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. Both appear to be happy and not the least concerned about their public display of affection.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story. This story may contain sexually explicit content and is intended for adult readers. It may contain content that is disagreeable or distressing to some readers. The M/M Romance Group strongly recommends that each reader review the General Information section before each story for story tags as well as for content warnings.",
