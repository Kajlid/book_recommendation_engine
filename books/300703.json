  "description": "RYDERWhen I quit the biggest boy band on the planet, I was supposed to get my life back.It’s not that I wanted to leave the spotlight. I felt like I had to for my daughter. Her picture shouldn’t be splashed all over the tabloids.I thought I could do this parenting thing on my own, but it’s obvious I need help. I just didn’t expect to find it in the form of a gorgeous guy I meet by chance.I can put my attraction aside for my daughter’s sake. I’ve put my whole life on hold for her.If only he wasn’t so tempting. LYRICWorking as a nanny is my backup to my backup plan. My first plan is fame, but something always holds me back.When I randomly run into Ryder Kennedy and end up becoming his daughter’s nanny, I figure it’ll be a short-term thing.But then Ryder finds out I can sing. He wasn’t ready to give up music, and now he’s found a new way to have it: through me. He wants to produce my demo and make me a star.He says I was born to be in the spotlight, but I think I was born to run from it.It doesn’t help that each day I’m with him and his daughter, the deeper I fall into fantasies of being part of their family. And not just as the nanny.",
