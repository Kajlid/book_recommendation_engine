  "description": "Asher Lowe, rock god, notorious womanizer and rebellious son of ruthless billionaire Sterling Lowe, has spent two decades building Spade into the most successful rock band of the era and living down to his father's expectations. His antics on and off stage are the stuff of fantasy and legend. Fiercely independent Maddy Anderson doesn't back down from a challenge, even when it hurts. She's spent ten years dealing with chronic illness and is succeeding on her own terms, just a semester away from finishing her degree and starting her lifelong dream of a career in education. When tragedy strikes, Asher's life is torn apart. He hires Maddy to care for his dead sister's child, and discovers he has a lot to learn about love and commitment. She makes him want to be the kind of man who can care for them both. But can this rock star make the leap from sexy front man to family man or will their bright future be sacrificed to the past?",
