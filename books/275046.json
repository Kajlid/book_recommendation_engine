  "description": "When 24-year-old Savannah learns her mother arranged for her to win a fiction contest, she decides that her mother’s drastic meddling calls for drastic countermeasures. Though first place in a fiction contest guarantees that 24-year-old Savannah Phillip's novel will be published, she soon discovers that her mother—Savannah, Georgia's most charming, if diva-like citizen—is behind her literary win. So, mortified and furious, she resolves to give up her dreams of literary fame. Savannah rejects the coveted publishing contract and returns to her hometown, to prove to her parents, her city, and herself, that she is someone who shouldn't be messed with. Someone who's someone, without her mother's assistance. Someone who can write an unforgettable story all by herself, thank you very much. Following in the footsteps of her career hero, a columnist for The Savannah Chronicle , Savannah gets a job at the paper and sets out to take the journalism world by a storm. Her very first assignment is a quest for truth, investigating what appears to be a rigged beauty pageant. Journey with Savannah as she forges new dreams, uncovers the heartache of loss, and comes to terms with her unique calling.",
