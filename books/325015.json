  "title": "Ravel",
  "description": "A bestseller in France, Ravel is a beguiling and original evocation of the last 10 years in the life of a musical genius. Opening in 1927 as Maurice Ravel - dandy, eccentric and curmedgeon - voyages across the Atlantic to begin his triumphant grand tour across the United States, Ravel is not just a delightfully quirky portrait of a famous musician coping with the ups and downs of his professional and personal life, but a truly touching farewell to a diginified and lonely old man going reluctantly into the night.",
