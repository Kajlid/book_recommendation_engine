  "description": "Sally Schneider was tired of doing what we all do—separating foods into \"good\" and \"bad,\" into those we crave but can't have and those we can eat freely but don't especially want—so she created A New Way To Cook .Her book is nothing short of revolutionary, a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, where the pleasure principle is essential to well-being, where the concept of self-denial just doesn't exist. So here it is, 756 glorious pages of all the deliciousness and joy that food is meant to convey.",
