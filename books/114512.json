  "description": "(The Legend of the Gate Keeper #4) Eric pulled a dagger from inside his shirt and sat down on the platform with his feet hanging off the edge. Holding the point to his neck, he said, “Since you seem to be so sure I’m the cause of all your pain, I will give you one chance to seek the revenge you lust for.” He smiled at the man. “I give you my word, I will not move. Come now, do your people a service and obtain the blood you seek.” The man just lowered his head, unable to say a word through his trembling lips.Eric looked to the old woman holding the baby. He raised his head, still holding the dagger point to his throat, then pushed it in deeper as a trickle of blood ran from the small cut. “You say you lost your family, that your grandchild will never be able lead a normal life. I’m truly sorry for your loss, and I humbly offer my life in return. Someday you will be able to tell him you singlehandedly smote the evil that took his parents from this world.” Eric made a clicking noise with his tongue. “Come now, I promise you it will be easy. All you have to do is push, and justice will be done.” He jiggled the handle a couple of times, making the line of blood flow a bit faster. The old woman began to sob, nuzzling her cheek against the infant’s stomach. This book is intended for mature audiences.",
