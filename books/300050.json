  "description": "War is coming, and Seyda knows it. The biggest problem is that no one believes her or the other Dragonriders. Having refused the Elders, Seyda now has to find ways to survive the political attacks thrown at her and those at Icosagon. Even worse, Malcolm wasn't acting alone, and as Seyda realizes just how deep his betrayal has gone, she has to find a way to fix all that Malcolm has broken. But personal issues are rising as well, and relationships are changing all around her. Seyda will have to make some hard choices, and take whatever repercussions come, but she can't fail. Failure means losing Centralia, her dragon, the other Dragonriders, and maybe even herself. War is coming. When it does, Seyda is determined that she will be ready.",
