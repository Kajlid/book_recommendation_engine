  "description": "Jessica wants more than anything to join her mother's the selective sisterhood of Theta Theta Psi. When the shy but voluptuous college Freshman receives a bid, she is ecstatic, but her excitement is tempered by the unsettling rumors that surround the group's secretive initiation rituals. What begins as a series of embarrassing but harmless hazings quickly escalates beyond anything that Jessica bargained for when her initiation is outsourced to a group of senior boys. Jessica is taken away on a weekend-long road trip that becomes a relentless ordeal of humiliation and sexual exploitation, coerced into doing things she'd never imagined and submitting to disgraces beyond what she can endure.",
