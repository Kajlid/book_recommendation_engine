  "description": "Officer Ryan has a fairly calm life. Serious and responsible, she has it all under control; until she meets a fashion model with an extremely similar name. Now it seems like Officer Rose has her own personal damsel in distress; she has to rescue the famous model again and again. Rose Ryan is a model trying to make it big time. She's got the look, but actually she's a sweet home town kind of girl with ridiculously bad luck! The only good thing that has happened to her lately is meeting her own personal police woman who keeps saving the day. Can these two women make it through all the miscommunications and find love by any other name?",
