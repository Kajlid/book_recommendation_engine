  "description": "Evil lurks on the shores of Lake Avonelle. A cunning shape-shifter has stolen the Lady of the Lake's most precious possession and will use it to subjugate the world if the Lady cannot recover it. The hunt to procure the heart of the first female in the line of Gwenevere drags the future queen of Collingswood, Farrin the Fair, into the fray and patience has never been one of her strong suits. Although Farrin possesses the fabled sword, Excalibur, she senses she will need more than a sword to ward off the powerful magic wielded by her enemies. When Merlin appears as an unexpected ally, he generously offers to teach her a few tricks of the trade. If Farrin can survive the infamous wizard's perilous training, the future of all England will rest upon her ability to outwit the bloodthirsty Morgana le Fay.",
