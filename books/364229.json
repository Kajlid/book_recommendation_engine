  "title": "The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes",
  "description": "Previously published as Invisible Republic and already considered a classic of modern American cultural criticism, The Old, Weird America is Greil Marcus's widely acclaimed book on the secret music (the so-called \"Basement Tapes\") made by Bob Dylan and the Band while in seclusion in Woodstock, New York, in 1967--a folksy yet funky, furious yet hilarious music that remains as seductive and baffling today as it was more than thirty years ago.As Mark Sinker observed in The Wire: \"Marcus's contention is that there can be found in American folk a community as deep, as electric, as perverse, and as conflicted as all America, and that the songs Dylan recorded out of the public eye, in a basement in Woodstock, are where that community as a whole gets to speak.\" But the country mapped out in this book, as Bruce Shapiro wrote in The Nation, \"is not Woody Guthrie's land for made for you and me . . . It's what Marcus calls 'the old, weird America.'\" This odd terrain, this strange yet familiar backdrop to our common cultural history--which Luc Sante (in New York magazine) termed the \"playground of God, Satan, tricksters, Puritans, confidence men, illuminati, braggarts, preachers, anonymous poets of all stripes\"--is the territory that Marcus has discovered in Dylan's most mysterious music. And his analysis of that territory \"reads like a thriller\" (Ken Tucker, Entertainment Weekly) and exhibits \"a mad, sparkling brilliance\" (David Remnick, The New Yorker) throughout. This new edition of The Old, Weird America includes an updated discography.",
