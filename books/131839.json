  "description": "The Fey have been with us since the beginning, sometimes to our great joy but often to our detriment. Usually divided (at least by us silly humans) into two courts, the second volume of A Chimerical World focuses on the Unseelie Court: the court we humans seem to view as the \"evil\" faeries. But \"good\" and \"evil\" are human concepts and as alien to the Fey as their mindsets are to us. Inside you will find 19 stories that delve into the world of the faeries of the Unseelie Court, from authors both established and new, including Michael Shimek, Deedee Davies, and Nick Bryan. But don't be surprised if these faeries decide to play with their food.Stories included in Tales of the Unseelie Court:In Plain Sight by Rebecca LeoThe Wunderhorn by David TurnbullTreehouse by Kim SmithI'll Watch Over You by Angeline TrevenaThe Enemy of my Enemy by Deedee DaviesMaestro by Nicholas PaschallPrey of the Boggart by Rony BlechmanFear of Little Men by Mike PieloorFaerie Stories and the Bean Nighe by Carmen TudorGifts by Michael ShimekDjinn and Tonic by S.
