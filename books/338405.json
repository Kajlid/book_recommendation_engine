  "description": "Tara had always been curious about being a submissive and when she read a submissive's journal, which was posted online, she knew this was the lifestyle she wanted to live. She found a club which was owned by a man named Gabriel. After being accepted into the club Tara put herself up for auction without thinking about it. Once at the auction she quickly began to wonder if she had made a mistake. Then she heard his deep voice. The moment she laid eyes on Raven she was mesmerized. Raven had no intention on going to the auction. He was tired of training submissives, which in the end weren't what he needed and he wasn't what they needed. Alex drags Raven to the auction and chooses Tara for him to bid on. Now Raven and Tara will embark on a year's journey together. He will teach her everything about this lifestyle and she will be his final hope in staying in this lifestyle. \"Mine\" is the first book in the dom/sub trilogy",
