  "description": "Summer has arrived, and Dr. Fell is hosting a summer camp for Doms and their subs. He plans a festival sort of atmosphere, with commitment ceremonies and games, hoping for some fun, and some training. Of course, nothing is ever that simple, and when the other Doms put together a foundation for rescuing subs from bad situations, Dr. Fell ends up being nominated as the director. The first sub that turns up in need of rescue happens to be the stripper the boys hired for Dr. Fell's birthday, and there's another young man who's having trouble communicating his problems, and Dr. Fell knows he has to help. Can he deal with the camp, the rescues, and his own problems with finding someone special, all at the same time?",
