  "title": "The Middle-aged Man on the Flying Trapeze",
  "description": "Subtitled \"A Collection of Short Pieces, Mainly Humourous But with a Few Kind of Sad Ones Mixed in with Drawings by the Author\".Darker in tone than \"My Life and Hard Times\", \"The Middle-Aged Man\" draws on Thurber's troubled marriage for material. The humor is ridden with pathos, and yet is quite sharp.  This collection has 36 stories including: \"The Gentleman is Cold,\" \"Everything is Wild,\" \"Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife,\" \"Hell Only Breaks Loose Once,\" \"If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox,\" and \"How to See a Bad Play.\" The London Times said, \"There may be greater humorists writing in America today than James Thurber, but none with quite his individual touch and his flavor.\"",
