  "description": "He Always Knew She Was Exactly His Type  B Positive  Gia Felice has a Rolodex full of vampires, werewolves, witches, and aliens  not to mention the livestock suppliers, undead-friendly hotels, and sleazy bars that cater to her clients' more carnal needs. Sometimes being the premier book publicist to the underworld can suck  literally. Especially if you're human. Especially if you've got the hots for irresistible Johnny and his sly half smile that shows just a little fang.  Her best friend, Lola, a werewolf, can't talk any sense into her, and now Gia's agreed to help Belladonna Nightshade, a New York Times bestselling vampire author, find the supernatural killing machine who changed Bella centuries ago...if he doesn't find Gia first. Yesterday, Gia's biggest problem was how to get an alien with a metal skeleton through airport security. Today she's got a bloodthirsty boyfriend dying to get into her pants, and an evil, centuries-old vampire on the hunt for her. Who knew publicity was such a deadly business?",
