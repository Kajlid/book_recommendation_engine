  "description": "“I live in my head,” I said. Esther Agnes-Robbin’s glasses slid to the brim of her nose, her eyebrows wrinkled in a stare I tried to ignore. I hated when she looked at me like that. Like a mental case. “Tell me what you mean.” I looked away. Imagined myself chained against a cell wall. Her eyes were closed, a fragile body curled in pain. Pieces of my insides swirled in the darkness beneath her feet. Fear. Drugs. Insanity. Maybe it was time to let it out. I sighed and licked my lips. Felt a gurgle in my throat. They were words. I spoke. The girl inside my head opened her eyes.",
