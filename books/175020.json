  "description": "Rudy Miller has tons of ideas on how to escape the camp he's been sent to “for his own good.” The problem is – none of them work. Rudy teams up with Mike Webster, a quiet guy who's almost as happy to be there as Rudy is, and many “great escapes” are carefully planned and hilariously attempted. Chip, their counselor and nemesis, is just as determined to keep them there as they are to leave.",
