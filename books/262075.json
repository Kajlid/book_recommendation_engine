  "description": "Nominated by the National Cartoonist Society as Best Comic Strip, Jef Mallett's Frazz follows the life of Bryson Elementary School janitor and hit-songwriting-wonder Edwin Frazier. An all-round Renaissance man, role model, and friend rolled into one, Frazz feels as comfortable philosophizing with the students as he is with the teachers and principal. Always placing an emphasis on the importance of seizing opportunities to learn and grow, Frazz is a family favorite and multiple-year recipient of the Wilbur Award from the Religion Communicators Council for excellence in communicating values and ethics.",
