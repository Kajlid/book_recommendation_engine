But her suburban life is turned upside down when she encounters three younger boys, naked and on the run. Mia is drawn into a shadow world where dark shapes prowl quiet neighborhoods, hunting for fresh meat. A spate of strange disappearances heralds a terrible secret-the outbreak of a plague that will change the natural order of the entire planet.  This oncoming war for the top of the food chain threatens Mia's family, and with the help of the three boys, she must save her mother from the ruthless man-beast who wants to put her on the menu.  Mia doesn't know it yet, but her blood may hold the key to the future of the human race.",
