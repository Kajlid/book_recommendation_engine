  "title": "The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More",
  "description": "We think Chris Anderson is onto something big with 'The Long Tail', a groundbreaking look at a well-known feature of statistical distribution and its potential to revolutionize business. 'Wired' magazine editor Anderson expands his influential 2004 article into a comprehensive exploration of this phenomenon -- which, simply stated, holds that products with low demand or sales volume can collectively comprise a market that exceeds the bestsellers. Catering to the tastes and expectations of consumers increasingly disenchanted with the same old thing, these new \"niches\" provide limitless opportunity for savvy companies. Fresh, insightful, and surprisingly accessible, 'The Long Tail' explains how to tap into the new economics of abundance.",
