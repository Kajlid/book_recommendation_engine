  "description": "Jonathan Hammersmith was without a sexy woman for once. Linda Harrison just might have gone forever, then Abigail Dupree walked into his office with a woman named Mia Malkovich and just like that the gasoline hit the fire that the brunette beauty Abigail Dupree always caused. Someone was extorting her pretty friends from the Baltimore Yacht Club. Seven wealthy women had been playing sexual games and they called themselves the Wife Club. They hired male strippers to cater to their sexual desires just like men so often did for themselves. Then they graduated to hiring Hard Bodies from a secret escort agency and they had swinging weekend yacht parties on the Atlantic Ocean. And Abigail Dupree had been a part of it all. When they later found out that they all had been making blackmail payments separately, suddenly Abigail and Jack Hammer were digging in and getting deeper into each other and everything else. Jack Hammer had never been more motivated and lovely brunette Abigail Dupree had never been more personally bared to what he discovered about her. He was ready to burn the house down and set the entire yacht club on fire. Wife Games suddenly had an aroused detective poking into everything and everyone and Abigail Dupree had to deal with the hard treatment he was giving to her and her friends. They were playing Wife Games with gasoline and Jack Hammer believed in sharing the pain on this case that he took so very personally.",
