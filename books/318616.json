  "description": "Lia glanced back at the town of Burkshire, her vision blurred with tears. Half the houses were burning and people were racing in all directions, trying to escape the cruel warriors who placed swords at their throats, demanding information. The Rebels were searching for something that could unleash enough power to seal the terrible fate of Leijona, something so important that they would murder anyone standing in their way. Lia sucked in a shuddering breath. They must be stopped.",
