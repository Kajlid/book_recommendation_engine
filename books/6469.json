  "title": "Fortune and Glory: A True Hollywood Comic Book Story",
  "description": "ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY gave him an A, Hollywood insiders fell all over themselves to praise him, and fans everywhere gave him a full thumbs-up for hilarity. Now, on the heels of his praise and punishment, Brian Michael Bendis puts his sold-out miniseries, FORTUNE & GLORY, into one hefty volume. Marvel once again at the stupidity of Hollywood producers, the vanity of stars like Uma Thurman and Clint Eastwood, and the enthralling mood swings and ego nosedives of a little indie comic-book creator caught up in the maelstrom of the motion picture industry. Presented in a handy 6\" X 9\" format, this collection features brand-new pages left on the cutting room floor and not included in the original comics. The individual issues are becoming increasingly hard to find, and that's because everyone who read it didn't like it, they loved it. Featuring an introduction by Paul Dini, who himself knows a thing or two about the Hollywood machine.",
