  "description": "The Backlund House is haunted, but no one knows why. No violence has taken place there, no one has died within its walls. Over the course of a century, no one has determined what—or who—haunts the storied property.Even Phoebe Backlund, who built her family’s dream home, has no explanation for the events that take place there. She invites curious thrill seekers and notorious skeptics alike in the golden age of spiritualism to experience the house’s clockwork poltergeists. Knocks, slamming doors, screams, and looming specters delight and terrify her guests, but answers are as elusive as the phantoms.The inexplicable and supernatural beckons Noah Benjamin and his crew to investigate the mystery. Using tomorrow’s state-of-the-art technology, Noah aims to reveal what is happening, and why, to finally provide an answer to the enigma.IN THE HOUSE OF IN BETWEEN is horror with a dash of sci-fi spanning the paranormal history of the Backlund House, and tells the story of the lives within and their experiences with whatever is inside.",
