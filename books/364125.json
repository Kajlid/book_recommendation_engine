  "description": "Featuring artwork inspired by the \"good girl\" pin-ups of the 1950s and '60s, CODENAME: KNOCKOUT tells the fast-paced story of Angela St. Grace, a buxom agent for the clandestine agency of G.O.O.D. (Global Organization for the Obliteration of Dastardliness), and her loyal gay assistant Go Go Fiasco. Together they battle the forces of E.V.I.L. (Extralegal Vendors of Iniquity and Licentiousness) in exotic locales across the globe. There's just one snag: her mother is the head of GOOD and Angela's about to discover that mom has been less than honest about the fate of her supposedly dead father!",
