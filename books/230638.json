The only ones by his side are his family, giving him strength to fight the pain.  Soon things become even worse. He is rushed into an emergency surgery following an episode of internal bleeding.  He wakes up to the sound of voices. The first thing the voices tell him is, -No one comes back from death empty-handed. We are going to stay with you, either to guide you or to torture you. We will play with your head and thoughts as we feel fit.-  What do these voices want from him?  Will they help him or turn against him?",
