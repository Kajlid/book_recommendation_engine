In the second book, Beyond, Estelle becomes a celebrity dissident, tolerated by the Congloms, acclaimed by the youth of the city, and living the life of her dreams with her brother Terran, and her boyfriend, William. But unbeknownst to her, the Congloms are inventing ways to control her rebellion. Then the Governmental Oversee disappears someone she loves and Estelle must summon the courage to head into the Beyonds, with nothing but a phone, a pillowcase, and barely a plan, and risk everything to save him.",
