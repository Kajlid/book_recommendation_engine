  "description": "The Paris of the East is a sweeping epic of love and war, courage and survival, sacrifice and loss. Warsaw, 1939. Four friends picnic on a brilliant summer's day and celebrate an engagement, aware of the rumbles of war, but hopeful that in any conflict Poland will have the upper hand. But only months later, Poland has surrendered and dare-devil pilot Rafael is ordered to flee the country, eventually flying for the RAF in Britain. The other three remain in Nazi-occupied Warsaw—Rafael's spirited wife, Celina; his shy and brooding brother Marek—who wishes he was the one Celina had married—and their plucky friend Anna. Danger lurks on every corner of occupied Warsaw, even more so when the three friends become active members in the Polish Resistance... A page-turning story that spans the period of the Second World War, this is a dramatic historical adventure that goes from Warsaw to Lublin, from Bucharest to Paris, from London to the Concentration Camp at Ravensbruck—but always at the heart of this novel is the mesmerising city of Warsaw—'The Paris of the East.'",
