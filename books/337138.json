Scarlett quickly realizes that her only chance to escape death is to get out of her betrothal and get rich on her own... but how to break off an engagement with a tyrant?As Scarlett does everything that she can to show herself as unfit for marriage-from pouring wine all over her dress to singing an off-key love song to his face-little does she know that the tyrant has learned what she is up to... and is more endeared than before! Will Scarlett's wish to be dumped come true, or will all of her plans backfire?With fairy-luring fruit trees and a cast of hilarious characters, Ten Ways to Get Dumped by a Tyrant is the perfect comedy of errors to add to your isekai romance collection.",
