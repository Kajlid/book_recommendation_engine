  "description": "“Welcome to Ynys Diawl, our beautifully isolated Welsh island. We greet visitors in a special way! What? Oh, true, the English translation is Devil Island, but that’s just slander.”“Yes, it was the perfect escape for three strangers. Each had their own reasons for visiting. We don’t care why anyone comes here! Hey now, who said the locals are violent? Surly, maybe, but we love all types, here.”“Mmm, that does look like a storm coming in. A bad ’un. No escape from the island tonight. Escape? I meant … never mind. Come down these steps with me, I have something to show you. Don’t look so worried, we don’t bite!”An atmospheric folk horror likened to The Wicker Man in Wales.",
