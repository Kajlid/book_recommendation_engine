  "description": "When Mike found out he would be sharing a dorm with a former football star, he was terrified. He'd been bullied by jocks all his life for being scrawny and weak and didn't have high expectations of how it would go. To his surprise, Brett was a great guy that was easy to get along with and seemed to enjoy his company. When Mike learned that Brett was gay, it was a shock but it also explained the threatening letters that Mike had been receiving. Was Mike really at risk because of a jealous ex? Was there even anything to be jealous of? *** Warning: Contains graphic descriptions of gay sex ***",
