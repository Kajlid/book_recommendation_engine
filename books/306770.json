From the epic viewing of the moon landing to struggling with religious beliefs, Lorney travels through a cluster of hilarious adventures while trying to understand a complicated time. Set in the summer of 1969 in Alberta Canada, one escapade flows into another and the learning curve is steep for the young swashbuckler. His innocent comprehension of this world is nothing short of hysterical. An exercise that you will not regret undertaking and hopefully Lorney will leave you noticeably happier after reading.",
