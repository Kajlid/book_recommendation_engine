  "description": "Ryan: Who is she? What does she want? As if I don't already know. She wants him. Will I be able to be enough now that she is back? I guess I will have to learn to be enough because I can't lose him.  Russell: Why is she back? What does she want from me? Whatever it is, she won't get it. Ryan is running scared. But, what my boy doesn't realize is that Iâ€™m still holding his leash. I will only allow him to run so far. I refuse to lose him.  Claire: I can see that he's trying to figure out why I'm back. He damn well knows what I want from him. I want perfection back, and I will happily stomp on anyone who gets in the way of that. Including his new 'boy.' Who, an old friend tells me, \"can't even bow properly. Getting Russell back is going to be a walk in the park. I won't be so stupid as to lose him...again.  When it comes to what I want, I have a will of iron...and I want him.",
