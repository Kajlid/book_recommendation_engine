  "description": "During a long illness that took her life, author Maria Polydouri was able to write and publish two of the most relevant Greek poetry books of the 20th Century. The first, Los trinos que se extinguen , is considered a classic as it depicts her heart in a particularly intimate way. Her poems portray vivid images of love, death, and the fleeting passages of human existence, although the book is considered a celebration of life. “A bitter celebration,” someone has said, “such as the last drink at a party.” Each poem feels like an agonizing farewell that doesn’t want to let go, desperately grabbing onto places and words and memories. Still, at the end, love seems to find its way to triumph.",
