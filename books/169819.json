  "description": "When is a marriage worth saving, and when is it worth letting go?'He felt his stomach tighten, his heart begin to race. The coffeemaker beeped, signalling its readiness, and Ellen got up and poured two mugs. She set one in front of Griffin, one in front of herself. Griffin watched the steam rise up and curl back on itself, then dissipate. He said quietly, \"I'm not going anywhere.\" \"Pardon?\" \"I said, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not moving.\" She nodded. \"I see. Well, I can't. I have to be here to take care of Zoe.\" Griffin pictured his daughter, a redheaded beauty who would knock the stuffing out of any man who crossed her. \"All right, you can stay, too,\" he told Ellen. \"Griffin. One of us has to go.\" In Say When, Elizabeth Berg negotiates perfectly the fine balance between humour and poignancy as she charts the days and nights of a family whose normal life has been shattered. Told from the point of view of a man who goes overnight from being a husband to becoming his wife's roommate, this is a gripping and heartfelt story.",
