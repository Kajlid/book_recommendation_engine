It is also about happiness, empathy and love, and introduces us to intriguing characters such as a broken-hearted gorilla-woman, and a man able to, literally, carry the world inside of him.The book has 48 beautiful illustrations by Sidney Falcão.In I remember my circus, the award-winning author Tom S. Figueiredo presents us with one more of his children’s stories, which does not underestimate their intelligence and perhaps, for this same reason, has equally captivated older readers.The Editora Cedraz specializes in the publication of titles for children and youth and has been bestowed with UNESCO’s acknowledgement for one of its literary projects which included comic books.",
