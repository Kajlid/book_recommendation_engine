  "description": "The true stories from this handwritten journal maintained by the ward physicians at The Asylum for Insane Criminals (Matteawan) have never been told. The leather-bound book has survived for more than a century. Frayed and weathered with time, it was hidden away until now. This historical document is a surviving journal from The Matteawan Asylum and has never been shown until transcribed and published in this book. Many of the insane patients tell their stories, and the madness and mayhem they speak of are revealed in detail. This was a violent they could never be released among the general prison population. Many of them were so violent even Sing Sing could not restrain them. Their one obsession was to escape and, occasionally, they did. You are, therefore, invited to enter a world never seen until now. This is the world of the asylum. This is the truth. This is Matteawan.",
