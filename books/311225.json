  "description": "“What did this sorry sucker do to deserve a visit from me?” It’s better not to know. Just stay focused on the task at hand. Do my job. Collect the payment. On to the next one. This job will go a long way toward getting me closer to my goal of living in complete peace and tranquility, away from all this death and destruction that has consumes my very existence. But there’s something off about my target. It’s a woman. And I don’t kill women. Especially not a little princess like this one. I almost assassinated a unicorn. And that’s exactly what she is. Only a few minutes ago I was seconds away from ending her life, by accident of course.And it’s no accident that I didn’t. I don’t believe in that fate nonsense, but this is…well…this was meant to be. And she was meant to be mine. Who in their right mind would want to destroy something so perfect, so beautiful, so unique? I have to find out who hired me to take her down, and then destroy them like each and every one of her enemies until there are none.Because this little unicorn is mine. She may have been my target but she’s the one who stole my heart. This is a short, steamy \"daddy-lite\" romance with some daddy elements, but it is not a spot on ddlg story. No OM / OW drama and no cliffhangers. Always a sweet HEA.",
