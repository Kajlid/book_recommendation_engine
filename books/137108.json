  "description": "This is not your typical love triangle. Landon Pratt is torn between two women, worlds apart in every way, yet each pull at his deepest desires from different directions. Following his promotion to CEO of a prestigious Wall Street financial house, Landon meets Bria. Between her luscious dark hair and curvaceous figure, Bria’s beauty is ethereal. Deep down she’s a sweetheart, but Landon can’t help but feel there’s more to Bria than meets the eye. Her icy skin and mysterious diet speak to a well-guarded secret… Then there’s Natalie. Sassy and fiercely independent, Natalie captures Landon’s attention with her swirl of blonde hair and blue eyes. But Landon has a feeling that spending time with him isn’t her only nighttime activity—and the other involves black leather, a tool belt, and a mysterious duffel bag… While Landon’s trying to sort through his feelings for these very different women, he falls under the blood-red eyes of the Stanton financial sharks willing to go to any length to eliminate the competition. The real and the supernatural come face to face in this provocative paranormal romance where opposing forces must unite to protect a love more powerful than any could have imagined.",
