  "description": "“Reginald Hill is quite simply one of the best at work today.” — Boston Globe   There is no end to the praise mystery writer Reginald Hill has already earned for his British police procedurals featuring Chief Inspector Peter Pascoe and Detective Superintendent “Fat Andy” Dalziel. Having recently bested Harlan Coben, Val McDermid, Michael Connelly, and James Patterson for the Crime Writers Association’s Mystery and Thriller People’s Choice Dagger, the master returns with The Price of Butcher’s Meat —as a recuperating Andy Dalziel (following his close brush with mortality in Death Comes for the Fat Man ) gets involved in the murderous politics of a not-so-peaceful seaside community. The Price of Butcher’s Meat is more “great stuff from one of the greats, and a true must for fans of British crime” ( Denver Rocky Mountain News ).",
