  "description": "Jake is forty five and has lived alone for some time. He's happy. He's not really in the market for any kind of romance, so why has his new neighbour set his heart racing and his stomach churning with butterflies? Jake has watched this neighbour with interest over the last few weeks, telling himself that writing down this guy's every move in a special note book whilst observing him from behind his ivy on his deck is perfectly normal, but he is actually beginning to think he's turning into a creep. He can't help himself though. He's addicted. This new neighbour is quite simply the most beautiful creature Jake has ever set eyes on. He is also young enough to be Jake's son. How is Jake ever going to get to know this guy without everyone, including the neighbour, thinking he is just a dirty old man? And how is he ever going to reconcile the fact that he is at least twenty years older? The age gap is the least of his problems though, because this guy is elusive to say the least. Jake has a plan, but even the best laid plans go astray. After some disastrous attempts to meet his enigmatic neighbour something happens to bring them together and then Jake faces the possibility that he may have fallen for this guy, but how is someone young enough to be his son going to look at him as anything other than a friend?",
