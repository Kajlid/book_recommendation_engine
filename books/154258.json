  "title": "Origins of the Outbreak",
  "description": "Every epidemic begins with a relatively small group of people who’ve been exposed to an illness. The Centers for Disease Control believes that it is imperative to reach the site of an initial outbreak as quickly as possible in order to prevent further spread of the disease. Sometimes that isn’t always possible and events reach a catastrophic tipping point before the government can organize a response. Origins of the Outbreak follows the chain of infection from one person to another after a university researcher in a small Texas town unwittingly develops an disease that turns its victims into zombies and threatens to destroy the world as we know it. Told as a series of short stories from the perspective of each victim as they experience their own version of hell while struggling to survive, Origins of the Outbreak will leave you gasping in fear.",
