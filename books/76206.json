  "description": "A cat. A miser--his accountant and lawyer. Add three old ladies who travel in style... conditions are ripe for murder. Concierge veterinary medicine can be deadly.  Veterinarian Dr. Heidi Knack already has trouble with disorderly patients and their overbearing owners. But when a miserly old man's cat is poisoned, it’s up to Heidi to find out who did it before he shuts down her practice. As she desperately tries to appease her best paying client, she stumbles upon another victim—this time a human. It’s murder, mystery and mayhem. Can she solve the case before she’s the next victim?  What are the reviewers saying? \"... that is just plain fun, The Cat's Last Meow will do just fine. Some good character development and a good plot.\"  \"The writing is up-beat, accessible and tons of fun. A great book to pick up if you have some time by the fire or in the sun to enjoy yourself.\"  \"The cat at the center of this book is named Precious and the book is a precious little gem of a mystery. This was a quick, fun read.\"",
