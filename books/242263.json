  "description": "Samantha Masters was doing just fine. She was in control of her life, or so she thought. Settled into her comfortable surroundings with her Yorkshire Terrier, Rags, she had good friends in the ladies of Riverhaven. They got along quite well before Colonel John Francis McLain, USMC (retired), put his grubby hand on her. Well, there was the little problem of an unsolved murder in the neighborhood...Christina Strong is the award-winning author of 15 New York published books and a Novella (in Jennifer Blake's Quilting Circle). She has written Historicals, Regencies, Ghost, and Time-Travel under the pen names Christina Kingston and Christina Cordaire, but she has decided to use her real name from now on. She also has created a contemporary mystery in Murder Makes it Mine, and she really hopes you will enjoy it! It is the first in a series with the next half finished and 7 more synopses already lined up.",
