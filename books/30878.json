  "description": "• Reveals how the sexual practices of the White Tigress can preserve and restore a woman's physical youthfulness and mental energy.• The first modern guide to White Tigress techniques, the only sexual teachings exclusively for women.• Reveals for the first time in English the hidden teachings of immortaless Hsi Wang Mu, a White Tigress from 3,000 years ago.• Provides Western medical correlations to substantiate White Tigress practices.White Tigress women undertake disciplined sexual and spiritual practices to maintain their beauty and youthfulness, realize their full feminine potential, and achieve immortality. Revealed here for the first time in English are the secrets of the White Tigress that have all but disappeared from the world. Under the guidance of Madame Lin, the matriarch of a distinguished White Tigress lineage still in existence in Taiwan, Hsi Lai was given the privilege to study these practices and record them from a modern perspective so they will be forever preserved.The vast majority of Taoist texts on alchemy, meditation, and sexuality are directed at male practitioners. The Sexual Teachings of the White Tigress presents traditions that focus on women, traditions that stem from a long line of courtesans and female Taoists. Translations of the ancient teachings from a rare White Tigress manual dating back 3,000 years explain the sexual and spiritual refinement of ching (sexual energy), chi (vital energy), and shen (consciousness)--the Three Treasures of Taoism--the secret to unlocking eternal youthfulness and immortality.",
