  "description": "In this comic parody, Ray Almaviva is minding his own business when the FBI wrongly accuses him of fomenting insurrection. Before they can nab him, he and Ilsa Guilford-Schlitz, an avid researcher, are zapped back to the year 1776, when they help Ray's madcap ancestor, Don Raimondo, hijack the Spanish Treasure Fleet and supply the gold that helps America win the Revolutionary War. The grateful Founders confer upon him the title of Duke and deed him the Duchy of Almaviva on the north bank of the Potomac River. When the three are zapped back to the twenty-first century, the FBI scoops Ray up. Ilsa and Don Raimondo swing into action and rescue Ray by proving his legal and long-forgotten rights to all the land on which the District of Columbia now sits. It's a standoff! Ray and his growing number of populist friends and foreign allies defy the mighty forces of a Federal Government gone rogue. Can the world once more be turned upside down? Can there again be a new birth of freedom? And can love still really come to two patriots in such trying times?",
