  "description": "Genevieve Ferguson didn't know what she was getting herself into when she agreed to fill in for her ailing aunt at the Harrison's ranch. Seeing as to how this is Aunt Ruthie, though, and you can't ever outguess the spry, quirky old woman, she should have known better. The smart mouthed, normally prickly Miss Ferguson gets way more than she'd ever bargained for when she gets sucked into the crazy, kooky family madness that is the Harrison men.Reader Advisory: This story contains foul language, mild violence, menage sex scenes, a quirky gal with a chip on her shoulder and a house full of sexy cowboys. (m/f/m) (no m/m)",
