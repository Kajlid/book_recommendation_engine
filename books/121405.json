  "description": "In sultry Savannah is where we lay our scene, from a time that once, but never was… Two households, both alike in dignity, collide in the chaos of civil unrest– igniting a forbidden romance between a pair of star-cross’d lovers. Seventeen year-old automaton, Sephony Roulette, is beautiful and headstrong. Against her will she’s been betrothed to an ambitious politician desperate for her father’s money. Sephony would rather die than marry him and her mechanical heart breaks to set her free. It’s her sworn enemy, Marcus Wexhaven, who is called in to use his micro-cogs to repair her damaged heart. When she wakes in his arms the fiery passion between them cannot be denied. To prove to their feuding families their love is worthy of being celebrated, Sephony and Marcus work in secrecy to unravel a vicious political plot set against their city. But when Sephony finds herself on the receiving end of a hideous crime, it’s Marcus who comes to the rescue again. He is willing to fight to protect her, even if that means his own death. But what no one understands about Sephony– she is far too proud to let Marcus die alone. For never was a story of more darkness than this of Sephony and her Marcus.",
