  "description": "1928. Generally agreed to be one of the most significant forces in the history of the American theater, O'Neill is a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in literature for 1936. He won one of his Pulitzer prizes for Strange Interlude. The play exemplifies O'Neill's ability to explore the limits of the human predicament, even as he sounds the depths of his audiences' hearts and it was probably the furor of discussion aroused by the novelty both of theme and treatment in Strange Interlude that made O'Neill's name known wherever the English-speaking stage is discussed.
