Can a PhD with incredible mental powers stop a real-life firestarter?Years after a tragic car accident claimed his fianc√©e, Dr. Leonard \"Len\" Wise is just coming to terms with his demons. Now sober, the countless drunken nights helped him cope with the pain while he studied his newly-acquired psychic abilities. When a friend enlists him to deliver a lecture on parapsychology, he never expected it to end with a strange invitation: a police consult on a case of spontaneous human combustion. With no-nonsense Detective Bill McGee by his side, Len deduces the victim may have been murdered by someone with similar abilities to his own. But when an enchanting suspect catches fire before his eyes, the PhD becomes the prime suspect. To clear his name and protect the people he loves, Len must take his powers to the next level before he too is engulfed in flames. Fire in the Mind is the first book in the Doctor Wise series of paranormal mysteries.",
