  "description": "Songs in the Parking Lot is a poignant and often whimsical collection of short stories about the hidden worlds of young people. Meet a boy who says his heart is filled with bumblebees, a girl whose childhood is intertwined with the life of a toy cat, and a young alien-hunter awaiting an extraterrestrial visit. Flecked with magic, these stories illuminate the inner lives of protagonists who teeter on the edge of what they think should be adulthood and what they know is not. A tribute to the seriousness, playfulness, and nostalgia of childhood, from a promising new voice.",
