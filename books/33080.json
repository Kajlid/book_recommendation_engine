  "description": "From Bill Zehme, renowned journalist and author of the New York Times bestseller The Way You Wear Your Frank Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin' , comes this masterful biography of the late comic genius Andy Kaufman.Based on six years of research, Andy's own unpublished, never-before-seen writings, and hundreds of interviews with family members, friends, and colleagues, Lost in the Funhouse takes us through the maze of Kaufman's mind to see, firsthand, the fanciful landscape that was his life.Andy Kaufman was often a mystery even to his closest friends. Remote, aloof, impossible to know, his internal world was a kaleidoscope of characters fighting for time on the outside. He was as much Andy Kaufman as he was Foreign Man (tenk you veddy much), who became the lovably dithering Latka on the hit TV series Taxi . He was a contradiction, a paradox on every level, an artist in every sense of the word.In Lost in the Funhouse , Bill Zehme sorts through a life of misinformation put forth by a master of deception to uncover the man behind the legend. Magically entertaining, it is a singular biography matched only by its singular subject.",
