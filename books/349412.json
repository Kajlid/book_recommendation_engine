  "description": "Two years ago, Aaron lost his partner in a drowning accident. He's trying to move on, but letting go of the past, of the life they were building, is hard. One thing he knows he's not ready for is a new relationship, but Garrett and Dane are determined to change that.Lifepartners Garrett and Dane, a cop and an ER doc, bring Aaron home after an accident. They're happy in their light Dom/sub relationship, fulfilled and in love, but they've been keeping their eyes open for a third. It doesn't take long for them to decide that wounded, pretty Aaron is exactly who they've been looking for. The three get along great, but Garrett and Dane have their work cut out for them in convincing Aaron there's a time for starting over.",
