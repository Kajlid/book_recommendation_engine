Sixteen year-old online gamer Jinxy James has been trained as an expert sniper in the war against a terrorist-spread plague which has decimated the USA. Now she’s a wanted fugitive, on the run with a rebel splinter group, risking everything to save and protect her loved ones.  Jinxy has never wanted to hurt or kill, but the rebels are determined to uncover the truth about The Game, the government, and ASTA’s sinister activities, whatever the cost. She will need all her courage, skill and strength if she hopes to help liberate the nation from the second war, without betraying herself, or her love.  Rebel is the third book in the Recoil Trilogy (young adult dystopian romance) and follows on from Recoil and Refuse. It begins immediately after the exciting ending of Refuse. Buy it now to continue the compelling story of Jinxy, Quinn and the forces determined to bring them down and tear them apart.  SPECIAL PRE-ORDER OFFER: 0.99c ONLY!",
