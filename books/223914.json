  "description": "VINTAGE VAMPIRE FICTION! Originally published in 1913 and long out of print! Reginald Hodder's novel is a thoughtful yet entertaining tale about a vampire helpless to inflict harm on those she loves. Dr. Craddock, fresh out of medical school, begins his private practice in a small village where few ever become ill. Yet suddenly, his dearest friends begin to waste away. He suspects almost from the start that it has something to do with a village newcomer, Mrs. Valtudor. Yet his rational side repeatedly attempts to convince himself that such a creature as he suspects her to be does not exist. Also included in this volume is Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's short story, \"Luella Miller,\" as well as a short story by the editor. This is NOT a scanned facsimile! It has been transcribed and edited page by page from the text of the original novel in order to produce an attractive, readable copy.",
