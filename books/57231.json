  "description": "Charming, wealthy Randle Kennedy has a secret: he's British Columbia’s most prolific producer of boutique marijuana. He’s developed strains of B.C. Bud to please the most sophisticated palates and produce any desired effect, from a light contemplative buzz to the most mind-warping stone. His medical varieties offer relief for conditions ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's disease. Come legalization, he'll be the first on the market with marijuana's answer to single-malt Scotch. Until that day, he runs a tight operation with terrorist-cell security. Tate MacLane is brilliant, miserable, and broke. Since graduating from high school at age 14, he's failed at university, failed to support his family, failed at everything except making a superb caffe latte. Randle wants a fresh face to front his transactions. Tate desperately needs a mentor and yearns for respect. And money ... Then there are the bikers, the muscle with the cross-border connections that Randle needs to bring his product to the American market. Soon Tate finds out that it's harder to get out of the business than to get in.",
