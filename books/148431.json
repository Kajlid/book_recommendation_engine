  "description": "LIVING, LOVING AND LEARNING is a delightful collection of Dr. Buscaglia's informative and amusing lectures, which were delivered worldwide between 1970 and 1981. This inspirational treasure is for all those eager to accept the challenge of life and to profit from the wonder of love.\"An investment in life is an investment in change. When you are changing all the time, you’ve got to continue to keep adjusting for change, which means that you are going to be constantly facing new obstacles. That’s the joy of living. And once you are involved in the process of becoming, there is no stopping. You're doomed! You’re gone! But what a fantastic journey!\" \"I think the loving person must return to spontaneity — return to touching each other, to holding each other, to smiling at each other, to thinking of each other, to caring about each other….Hugs are good, they feel nice, and if you don’t believe it, try it.\" \"We've got to learn to trust again, to believe again. Of course it's a risk, but everything is a risk. We need to begin to go beyond just ‘being’ again. We’ve got to get in touch with being human and there’s a difference.\"",
