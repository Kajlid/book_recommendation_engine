  "description": "The Beautiful Ones at Shadowlight Academy is broken.  Shadowlight Academy itself is barely standing.  The Beautiful Boys are gone... leaving me to pick up the pieces...  To Stand Strong. Me. Against an Army.  *****  Unlike many high school heroines in fantasy books, I always knew I was not ordinary. Far from it.  Since I was two, I have been seeing angels and demons. Given the gift of battle as a warrior, my role as a slayer often interferes with my role as a normal girl. So no, I was never a typical girl who had just found out she was heir to some magical family or something like that. I've been \"gifted\" practically all my life.  So when my ordinary family moved us to San Francisco to a new school where my father teaches, I didn't think much of the school. Shadowlight Academy, the most exclusive and posh prep academy for the super rich. I thought I would be there to slay the evil like an undercover superhero amongst the ordinary.  I just didn't think the ordinary would all be extremely unordinary. Especially the three most popular kids in school, known as the Beautiful Ones. Then there's the hot brooding rebel boy who didn't seem to fit in, too. Everyone here has secrets, and I am determined to find out what, before it kills me... the entire Academy and even the world.  *Gone Rogue is the third book in a high school paranormal academy series for mature teens and up. Expect a tough heroine who can take on anyone and anything, will, lots of steam literally and figuratively, and a reverse harem.",
