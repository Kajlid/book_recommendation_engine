There, he learns each of them has been brought to the island for a deadly purpose - to be hunted and killed by grudges from their past.

He's been targeted specifically by the island owners, barbaric brothers who have hunted and killed everything imaginable, including men. Harrison will provide them with an altogether new challenge. Why? Because Harrison Dale is a werewolf. The caveat - Harrison has vowed to never allow the demon within him to rise again, even if it means losing his life. The brothers, however, can be extremely convincing. Can Harrison hold out long enough to escape and not lose his soul in the process?They Dared to Hunt a Werewolf. A horror action-adventure novel. For those who love werewolf fiction and the power of the werewolf.See more of my novels and short fiction collections at",
