  "title": "The Science of Mind: The Original First Edition Text",
  "description": "Here is the complete first edition of The Science of Mind. For the careful practitioner this is the preferred edition, as later editions lacked the power and focus of this edition and were simply less readable. Here you will find six lessons and countless affirmations that will help you unlock the power of your mind and find higher truths. You won't find a guide to the science of the mind that is clearer and easier to use. With the power of right thinking you will find that a new, better world awaits you! Earnest Shurtleff Holmes was the founder of the Church of Religious Science. Religious Science, like many New Thought faiths, emphasizes positive thinking, influence of circumstances through mental processes, recognition of a creative energy source and of natural law. Holmes had an immense influence on New Age beliefs, particularly his core philosophy that we create our own reality.",
