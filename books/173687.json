He weighs the pros and cons and knows Haylie is a bad investment on so many levels, but something about her gets under his skin. And once he makes up his mind, he pulls out all the stops to make her his.Haylie soon realizes that Cam's quiet charm and unfaltering confidence is like a magnet she doesn't want to refuse. Their chemistry is undeniable and maybe the rules she set up for herself are worth reconsidering.",
