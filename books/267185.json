  "description": "Let me tell you a secret - Dracula had a brother. This is true. They called him Radu the Handsome, but his beauty was deceiving, and it hid a deadly secret...With high ambitions as a journalist, Juliet Jochs travels to the Carpathians to investigate a mysterious and unnaturally beautiful prince. She suspects that he's a dangerous man, and that this mission may cost her life. But, as the prince's masks begin to peel off, she fears she may lose her sanity.Â Prince Radek's dark powers suck Juliet into a whirl of hypnotic desire--no woman has ever resisted his lures. But something is different about her, special, and he's growing dangerously addicted to her. She must keep her head above the water if she is to save herself, run away and not look back before he consumes her completely. But can she resist opening the last door to his most terrible secret?",
