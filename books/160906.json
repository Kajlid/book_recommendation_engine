  "description": "Gabrielle Hyde and Damian Hunt were ready to create a life together. But, as determined as they were to build a future, the demons they fought to overcome were just as determined to destroy it. As Hunt struggled to find the strength to trust Elle with his past, it abruptly collided with the present, forcing Elle to make the decision to walk away from the love of her life and, possibly, her only chance at true happiness. As the two attempt to find their footing, a dark secret larger than either Damian or Elle could have imagined lurks in the shadows, waiting to make itself known… Will their love survive? Will Elle’s desire to protect Damian from their shattered pasts tear them apart, or will it make them stronger? Will Damian find his way back to his heart, or will he remain…A Dominant Fallen?",
