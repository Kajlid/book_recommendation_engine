  "description": "Art lovers, spiritual seekers, and anyone entranced by The Perfection of Wisdom , Words of Paradise , and The Moon in the Pines will want to own The Katha Upanishad . One of India's most revered texts and part of the famous Hindu scriptures, the thousand-year-old Vedas, it tells the story of a young boy who compels the Lord of Death to reveal the secret of what happens after we die. There are, teaches The Katha Upanishad , two paths in life. One-that of the senses-leads to the world and all its pleasures. But since all material things must perish, it ends inevitably in death. The other path is \"the way inward that leads to grace, \"a spiritual journey toward immortality and joyous union with the universal Divine. This translation converts simply and practically the wisdom at the heart of the scripture.",
