My heart’s being pulled in multiple directions and somehow it actually feels right.Meanwhile, I’ve been tasked with the impossible for this show. I can’t just pull it off, I have to nail it perfectly or the whole operation could go up in flames. The ride has just begun. Step right up.Abra Cadabra is the second installment in the Harem of Freaks series. These books are not standalones, so be sure to read Freak Show first.",
