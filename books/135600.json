  "title": "The Clouds Still Hang",
  "description": "A trilogy telling a story of love and loyalty, betrothal and betrayal, triumph  and tragedy; novels that chart one man's attempts to rise above the legacy of a traumatic childhood. The first book deals with Simonâ€™s childhood friendship and eventually love affair with an older boy, the second the trauma of his teenage years and early adulthood, the third his struggle to maintain equilibrium and the consequences of his failure at one point to achieve that. It is a fictional biography, written because it tells a strong story which raises many issues over six decades, the post war baby boomer generation who in many ways never had it so good. His own experience is probably unique, yet will strike a chord with many others who have been through similar things, as well as those with an interest in such matters, either personal or professional. It's a varied, exciting, demanding, sometimes terrifying life story. It is not suitable for those under 18 years or who find explicit sexual narrative, including sexual violence, offensive.",
