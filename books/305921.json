But investing all her time into building her business means she's lost contact with the outside world- except the owners of the local cafe where she picks up her morning coffee. In exchange for a branding package, Caroline agrees to accept a lifetime of free coffee and pastries from Annie and Dan. So what if she doesn't need the extra padding to her hips? Never in a million years did she think helping Annie would lead her to Jolan. When Jolan invites Caroline to yoga class, she can't say no. So what if she's shy, feels she looks terrible in yoga pants, and has never done yoga before? She can figure this out, right?Jolan is everything Caroline doesn't think she deserves, but his unexpected insecurities, sweet nature, and warm laugh only make her want to get closer. Then comes the chance of a lifetime: Jolan invites her to go to New York City with him. New York City. Perfect guy. A growing business. With everything beginning to go so right, what could go wrong? Caroline is about to find out.",
