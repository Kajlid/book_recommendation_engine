  "description": "The Time Chair Diary is the journal of Laura Evans, aka \"Ell\". She began her travels through time in 1974, when she was 11 years of age. Bored with history books, yet loving history, after reading The Time Machine, Ell discovers the Old Man and his time traveling invention. An old chair with clocks stuck in a special motor does the job! Off Ell goes to experience history first hand. Ell's desire, to \"feel\" history comes to fruition as she joins Washington's crossing of the Delaware on Christmas night, 1776. Of course there's trouble! What time travel goes off smoothly? Certainly not this one. Ell, however, is a real trooper as she deals with her troubles, and a dog named Plato, with pluck and stamina.",
