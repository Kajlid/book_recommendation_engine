  "description": "Sometimes you just need to bang it out... Shy paleontologist Thea Pope just wants to get through her sister's '80s-themed monstrosity of a TV reality-show wedding so she can get to her summer field work. The only problem? Her sister has turned into the ultimate bridezilla - as in pink parasols, organza hats, forcing people to shave and dye their hair levels of over-the-top, it's-my-day antics - all while on location in a place literally called hell that reeks of sulfur and lost hopes.  The only thing that can make it worse is when her sister declares that she never even wanted Thea in the wedding at all but that the producers insisted. Ouch doesn't begin to express how much it hurts that her own sister didn't even want her to be at her wedding.  There's only one thing Thea can do after her sister finally pushes her too far - she picks the one man at the wedding her sister cannot stand - the groom's brother, Kade St. James - and has sex with him.  Is it petty revenge that she'll be rubbing in her sister's face from now until eternity? Absolutely. Still, it seems like a great idea at the time, and really what could go wrong? Pretty much everything it turns out.",
