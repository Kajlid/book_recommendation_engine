  "description": "This course consists of the necessary materials and information to protect yourself and those around you from being exposed to blood or blood-containing items that you may come into contact with throughout the course of your job. This training may be required as part of your training for bloodborne pathogens by your employer. In addition, such training is required annually by the Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA). Your employer will provide you with additional training, which will be referred to as an Exposure Control Plan (ECP), on bloodborne pathogens as indicated by your role and responsibilities in your organization. Bloodborne pathogens are basically any germ or organism that resides in an infected person’s blood stream. These pathogens may be transmitted by any substance that may contain blood, including sneeze droplets, urine, feces, seminal fluid and all other bodily fluids.  COURSE OBJECTIVES: • Identify sources of bloodborne pathogens. Understand the risks involved when caring for people where you may come into contact with blood. • Learn how to clean up blood and blood-containing fluids appropriately. Understand the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) for preventing transmission of bloodborne pathogens. • Explain how bloodborne pathogens are transmitted. Learn how to avoid exposure to bloodborne pathogens from the use of sharps. • Learn how to respond if exposure does occur. • Create a core sense of responsibility among participants to prevent future incidence of exposure to bloodborne pathogens.",
