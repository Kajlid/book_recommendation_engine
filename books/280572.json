Her childhood sweetheart is fighting on the Peninsula, and she can’t imagine marrying anyone but the staid Major Barnett.  But when the clock strikes midnight, and Hogmanay begins, a knock at the front door changes Jane’s life forever.  A sweet Regency holiday romance. This story first appeared in the collection ‘Tis the Season in October 2018.",
