  "description": "There are very few bright spots left in Bryn Lonneman's life. A dysfunctional relationship with her family, especially her mother, has left her with a jaded view of the world. It doesn't help that a traumatic event in her past has left her with lingering panic attacks, sometimes even debilitating, especially when riding motorcycle with someone else. Bryn desperately wants to take control again, starting with learning how to ride motorcycle solo, so she can go with her best friend and her pseudo family to Sturgis. A freak riding accident sends Bryn to the hospital, where she meets Dr. Charlie Glynn, a no-nonsense doctor that quickly becomes enamored with the feisty biker brat. The two of them start a steamy romance that takes Bryn down a path she is not sure she can follow. Will Bryn let her past control her future, or will she finally take a leap of faith and fly?",
