  "description": "Delaney Collins doesn't believe in fairy tales. And why should she? Her mom is dead, her best friend is across the country, and she's stuck in California with \"Dr. Hank,\" her famous life-coach father—a man she barely knows. Happily ever after? Yeah, right.Then Dr. Hank tells her an outrageous secret: he's a fairy godmother—an f.g.—and he can prove it. And by the way? The f.g. gene is hereditary. Meaning there's a good chance that New Jersey tough girl Delaney is someone's fairy godmother. But what happens when a fairy godmother needs a wish of her own?",
