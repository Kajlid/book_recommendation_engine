  "description": "Can love heal the pain and heartache? Dr. Benjamin Henderson has seen the woman watching him while he has lunch with his colleague. He decides to take matters into his own hands and introduces himself. Becky Price seems surprised when the handsome doctor takes an interest in her while assuring her that the woman he’s with is his sister. But he has secrets. There’s the war wound he won’t talk about, and the fact that he assisted the doctor who operated on Becky’s mother who died on the operating table. All of them were baffled as to why it happened, but there was no clear explanation for it and nothing made sense. How will Becky react about the full extent of his war wound? Better yet, what will she do if she finds out he was there when her mother died? Will Ben ever be able to figure out what really happened? And even if he does, will Becky believe him?",
