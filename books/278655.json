  "description": "Secret of the Dragon's Eye recounts the adventures of Gavin Kane, Emily Scott, and Bunty Digby, twelve-year-olds who struggle with their daily lives in England during the autumn of 1940.  While relatively safe on the north Cornish coast, their world is still turned upside down by war, as the Germans bomb London and the surrounding industrial cities.  These friends must learn to cope with constant air-raid sirens, rationing, and the fear of impending invasion, while still going to school and trying to lead normal lives. Secret of the Dragon's Eye is also a tale of fantasy, with legends that come alive and a high-spirited dragon named Thaddeus Osbert, who is not your typical dragon in any sense of the word.  Faced with danger and intrigue, the children band together with the dragon, to thwart a German top-secret mission, aimed at seizing the mystical and magical sword of King Arthur - Excalibur.  By combining their wits, their courage, and their imagination, the children overcome many obstacles to forge friendships as solid as time itself.  Yet there is a price to pay for their brave intervention against the forces of evil. Will they be willing to once again battle incredible odds to make amends?  What sacrifices will be required to save their mythical, fire-breathing friend from his pre-ordained fate?  Three adolescents must discover the answers to many difficult questions, all against the backdrop of World War Two.",
