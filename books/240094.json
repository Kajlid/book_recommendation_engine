  "description": "T.E.D. Klein's highly acclaimed first novel The Ceremonies - which Stephen King called \"the most exciting novel in my field to come along since Straub's Ghost Story - established him in the top rank of horror writers. Now, with the four novellas gathered here, Klein proves himself to be a master of this classic shorter form.The collection opens with \"Children of the Kingdom\", a beautifully crafted chiller that gradually reveals the horrors that lurk behind the shadows of the city. In \"Petey\", George and Phyllis and the die-hards at their housewarming think that their new rural retreat is quite a steal - unaware that foreclosure, in a particularly monstrous form, is heading their way.In the insidiously terrifying \"Black Man with a Horn\", a homage to Lovecraft, a chance encounter with a missionary priest over the Atlantic lures a traveller into a web of ancient mystery and fiendish retribution. And in \"Nadelman's God\", the protagonist discovers, degree by shocking degree, that the demons of our imaginations are not always imaginary.",
