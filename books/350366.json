  "description": "Within some very wealthy and elite Middle Eastern families, there is a secret ancient practice rarely heard of in the Western honor killing. This unspoken law allows men the right to kill their daughters or female relatives without consequences, if it is believed that they have dishonored their family name. Noora Fendil, the favorite daughter of an influential Middle Eastern businessman, is the victim of such a crime. Shortly before marrying her childhood sweetheart, Noora is framed by her jealous sister who has devised a diabolical plot to destroy Noora's happiness. Believing she has shamed him and in order to preserve his family name, Noora's father attempts to drown her. Unbeknownst to him, she survives and the courageous and remarkable story of Noora, Light of the Desert, begins. Noora's dangerous path takes her from Jordan to a Bedouin village in the desert, on to Egypt, crossing the Mediterranean to France and eventually, to California. All along her path, she must hide her true identity in the hope of one day returning to prove her innocence, as she is relentlessly stalked by a fundamentalist ex bodyguard who vows to bring her back to \"justice\".",
