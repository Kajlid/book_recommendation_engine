From the start, sixteen-year-old Noa senses that the mysterious transfer student to her Monterey boarding school is different.

Soon they are bound by his deepest secret: Callum is Fae, banished from another world after a loss hauntingly similar to her own.But in Noa’s world, Callum needs a special human energy, Light, to survive; his body steals it through touch—or a kiss. And Callum’s not the only Fae on the hunt. When Callum is taken, Noa must decide: Will she sacrifice everything to save him? Even if it means learning their love may not be what she thought?",
