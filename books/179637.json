  "description": "When Belle fled for the woods in a desperate attempt at saving her virtue and her father, she never imagined the dark castle where she would be held captive, would ever hold any curiosities for her. But it did. Nothing there was as is seemed. The shadows danced and the people hid great secrets. Where she thought she would just find a tyrant, she found a man with another side to him—a monstrous side. And through the key holes and cracks in the doors, she saw things—things she couldn't resist watching. But somewhere along the way the captive became the curious and the master became less of a monster.  18+  Sophie Starr is the naughty side no one likes to talk about, but everyone likes to read.",
