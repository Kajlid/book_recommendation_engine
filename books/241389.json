  "description": "Some years earlier, Alec McNee hit the jackpot, winning a landmark Supreme Court decision against the use of cameras to issue traffic infractions. Buoyed by this success, he attempted his own crusade to alter the campaign finance laws of Washington State. In this endeavor, he met the enigmatic research lawyer Lukas Schmidt. Before Alec could determine exactly who this guy was, Lukas was abducted. Local authorities identified Lukas as a convicted sexual predator, but were unable to pursue him into Montana. Alec was drafted to do so. To solve the mystery of Lukas' disappearance, Alec followed him into the most unusual of Federal prisons.",
