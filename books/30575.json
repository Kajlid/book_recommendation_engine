  "title": "The Big Squeal: A True Story About a Homeless Pig's Search for Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness",
  "description": "In a stranger-than-fiction odyssey, a homeless pig reveals her struggles for survival in a heartland hamlet which was once Abraham Lincoln's last stop during his days as a circuit-riding lawyer. Dubbed \"...a rare glimpse into Abraham Lincoln's lighter side...\" by acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, \"The Big Squeal\" introduces a real-life, orphan pig who encounters Lincoln's likenesses all over the Town Square. Looming large is a towering bronze statue showing an amused Lincoln peering at a piglet --immortalizing Abe's request for a \"writ of quietus\" to calm noisy village pigs living under the rustic 1840s courthouse. Vividly paralleling the adventure are full-color illustrations celebrating the hamlet's 19th Century architecture, the people who reside there and the heart-warming transformation of a pig from rural to city life. About the \"As Told to Author\": Carol Alexander has chronicled America's heartland at five newspapers as a writer, investigative reporter and editor. She is the recipient of numerous regional, statewide and national awards. She never expected to be a pig farmer, but is glad she did. Carol resides in Taylorville, IL in a leafy haven with her family which, for the past five years, has included Liberty the Pig, the unpredictable, fascinating former orphan on the run.",
