  "title": "Learning to Breathe: One Woman's Journey of Spirit and Survival",
  "description": "An extraordinary spiritual memoir about the will to survive . . . one breath at a time  While traveling in Laos on a winding mountain road, the bus that award-winning journalist Alison Wright was riding in collided with a logging truck. As she waited fourteen hours for proper medical care-in excruciating pain, certain she was moments from death-Alison drew upon years of meditation practice and concentrated on every breath as if it would be her last.  Despite countless surgeries and a grueling recovery, Alison set herself the goal of achieving a new to one day climb Mount Kilimanjaro-and she reached the summit on her fortieth birthday. Gasping for air once again, she stood at the highest point in Africa, determined to never again take a single breath for granted. Perfect for readers who love spiritual authors traveling abroad, such as Elizabeth Gilbert (\"Eat, Pray, Love\") and Greg Mortenson (\"Three Cups of Tea\"), this memoir is an amazingly inspirational tale of how a life-changing accident transformed one woman's faith.",
