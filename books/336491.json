  "description": "ALL YOU NEED IS... AN AFFAIR WITH THE BOSSWhen the boss invites you for a business dinner, impressing is a must.It is the cardinal rule not to overindulge in the expensive Chardonnay. Neither should you ruin your boss’s pants with a stain on his crotch and then try to rub it off him. Nor should you kiss that same boss.But Ms Lucille ‘Lucy’ Monroe did all that.Yep, that’s me – the one person who was definitely left impressed with how much that one tiny-but-extremely-hot, drunken kiss would cause a massive earthquake in my life.See, my boss Sam Webb used to be brother-from-another-mother and business partners with my best friend Joe. Then when thunders had struck in their skies, they became sworn enemies for life - personally and professionally, which meant that I was now standing in the middle of their crossfire. And it was a very, very dangerous battlefield. One that became even more perilous with every R-rated daydream about my boss. But who could blame me when I spent over eight hours a day around that provocatively gorgeous man who teased me with his dirty talk. Especially when considering that I was a woman who had been solely focused on the need to succeed in my career that I had almost forgotten about my other needs.But Sam had ignited the fiercest fire in me.Too bad he was my boss and my best friend’s nemesis. Too bad my career could be ruined along with the rest of my sad little life.It was one kiss. It should never happen again…",
