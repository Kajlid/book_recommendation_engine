  "description": "\"Facts you can bend. Memories are much stronger things.\" North Mikra’s best spy has everything she wants: a decades-old civil war riding on her shoulders, guns, weapons smuggling, and an elusive enemy, Agent S. A fierce woman in a male-dominated world, she’s the best fighter, the sharpest shooter, and apparently the most heartless soldier. A kid at a party once asked her if she’d killed anybody and she said no. She did her job.

Who is she?",
