  "description": "“Whatever I do or say next, please don’t hate me,” I plead in a whisper, and our lips rub. I don’t allow him to answer; I claim his lips in a kiss.   They’re a match made in hell: Reid Brice is the leader of a notorious gang called the Grim Reapers, and Scarlett Hades is the daughter of the lord of the underworld.  Scarlett convinces her father, Hades, to let her live on Earth for a year, as she is bored in Hell. She meets Reid on a weekend at the beach, but this is no ordinary, peaceful, sunny day: Reid and his gang are trying to kidnap a young girl. Scarlett comes to the rescue, and thus begins her entanglement with the Grim Reapers.  Reid pursues Scarlett, drawn by her bravado and her unusual nonchalance in the face of blood and deadly threats. He thinks this is the girl he has been looking for.  Will he still think the same when she reveals her true form to him? Or will he see her as nothing but a monster?   Hades’ Daughter presents Greek mythology in a way you probably haven’t seen before. How will a young-adult goddess survive in the modern human world? Grab a copy now to find out!",
