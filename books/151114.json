Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but it’s just another day in the life of Kyle McKinley.Kyle was born with the ability to erase memories, and along with her teammates – a vampire who resembles a sexy pirate with fangs, and a Shamat demon with a penchant for Italian pastries – they clean up the supernatural messes left behind.

So much so, that when the police step in, Kyle has to deal with Joe Dalton, a know-it-all human with the sexiest turquoise eyes she has ever seen. He definitely makes her naughty parts sit up and take notice, and it’s more than mutual. But first they must join forces to solve a dangerous puzzle. And when they uncover the truth, the apocalyptic ripple effect could destroy everyone that Kyle has vowed to protect, including Dalton.",
