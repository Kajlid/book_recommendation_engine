  "description": "HOW CAN YOU CATCH A KILLER WHEN EVERYONE THINKS HE'S DEAD?KENDRA MICHAELS was instrumental in bringing serial killer Eric Colby to justice, but despite his apparent execution at San Quentin, Kendra is convinced that Colby is still alive. The problem is that she canâ€™t prove it. Even her razor-sharp powers of observation - developed to an amazing capacity during the twenty years she spent blind, and now in constant demand by law enforcement agencies - have gotten her nowhere.But then a reporter who very publicly humiliated Kendra is murdered. Visiting the crime scene in search of anything that might link the brutal homicide to Colby, Kendra instead finds evidence that points to her. Finally Colby's master plan becomes clear to her: he is framing Kendra for murder.Suspicions mount and Kendra is thrust into deadly pursuit to clear her name and catch the killer no one believes exists anymore. A killer who is always nearby, watching, waiting to make his next move, although everyone assumes him to be dead. A killer whose trail of destruction is invisible to the naked eye, despite the carnage he leaves in his wake. It will take everything Kendra has to find Colby and stop him - and save her own life one more time.",
