  "description": "The year is 1971.Julian Carter is a music journalist who has his entire career ahead of him–if only the music industry would take a 20-year-old seriously. Building his short career on a steady reputation of honest, objective reporting, Julian is beginning to become a trusted journalist in the industry. All he needs is one shot to truly make a name for himself. When confronted with the chance to write what he’s led to believe may be the “story of a lifetime”, ultimately boosting his credibility and further leaving a troubled past behind him, he jumps at the opportunity.The Midnight Dolls, a band that had rocketed to superstardom in the late 1960s, struggles with their poor image after years of partying and wild behavior. Desperate to improve their reputation to appease their label, not to mention the eyes of the public, the band members agree to let their lives while on tour be reported on, even if it means showing a good side of themselves they don’t want seen.Embarking on a cross country tour in an old bus with the band, Julian aims to pen a poignant article of what the life of a rock star is really like, yet quickly finds himself amidst the ever growing tension of frayed relationships, drugs, and lies. Just as animosity turns into friendships, one devastating night digs up a past of poor choices Julian had long since buried and challenges where exactly his loyalties lie. With the band’s reputation and label on the line, not to mention Julian’s entire career, he must quickly decide to risk keeping their secrets out of friendship or show the world the lengths that some people will truly go to for love and attention for his own gain.It’s a good thing rock history doesn’t write itself—he does.",
