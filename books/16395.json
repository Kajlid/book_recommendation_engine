  "description": "A lonely cat, a rainy night, and an empty dinghy launch a heartwarming, seafaring tale about finding home in unlikely places.The scrawny cat used to belong to someone, someone who scratched his ears and let him lick her chin and knew his name. Now the only thing anyone ever calls him is \"get out of here!\" But when a snarling dog and a blowing rain turn the scrawny cat into a sailor cat, he learns that even a scared and shivery stray can find a kindred soul at the end of a storm-tossed night. Phyllis Rootâ€™s lyrical narrative joins with charming illustrations by Alison Friend in a classic, comforting tale about a lost creature that cat lovers (and story hounds) will cozy up to.",
