  "description": "EmilyBeing the sweet, popular girl next door with a family name everyone knows isn't always what it's cracked up to be. In fact, I'm starting to crumble under the pressure of the facade. I tried to be perfect. I tried to be what I thought everyone wanted, but in the end it only left me lonely. They think they know me. They think they see me, but no one really does. The one person I thought did—my brothers best friend—walked away in the end. I shouldn't be surprised. I always seem to be left alone.ChaseShe thinks I don't see her, when all I've ever seen is her. Her forced smiles and laughter are slowly driving me insane as I bide my time. I want to make them real. I want my girl back. I don’t care what bridges I have to burn to have her. I’ll spend my life proving to her I’m never going anywhere. That I’m the one person she can always count on. In the end, I’ll win, and she will be mine.",
