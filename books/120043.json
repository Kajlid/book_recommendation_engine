  "description": "December 1879. Farrow and Flint are back in London. Relegated to the lower ranks of music hall acts, and stripped of their beloved dressing room, theyâ€™re determined not to get involved in any more investigations. That is, until Farrow meets a widowed showgirl who tells them of the mysterious death of her husband. A death the police show no interest in. Once again the comedians encounter the cantankerous Sgt Wyatt, as they embark upon a quest that takes them to the upper and lower reaches of Victorian society.",
