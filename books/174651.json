A monster in need of rescue...  And a mathematical genius with a real demon of a mother...  Fate draws Theo, Gabe, Erin and Kitty to a place they jokingly call \"The School for Wayward Demons.\" There they learn that sinister forces threaten to invade the city of San Francisco and plot to overthrow the powers that be. Now they must choose whom to trust: the witches, the demons, or the Shaitans. Or each other.",
