Robert Garry, ex-military officer, wants nothing more than to maintain his integrity and his team’s safety despite a career change to pirate leader but a cargo freighter he targets proves to be holding much more than he bargained for. Will he escape with his own life, let alone the lives of his crew? He has always shunned the ‘folk hero’ label but is he in danger of becoming an arch villain in the process…  10% of the proceeds of this book will be donated to the Wellington Cancer Society, a local division of a New Zealand wide charity that helps combat cancer with education, prevention, care, support and also runs local projects.",
