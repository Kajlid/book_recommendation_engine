  "description": "Everyone said our love wouldn’t work. That it was too hard, too complicated, too messy. Oh how I enjoy proving everyone wrong.  My men are smart, sexy, sophisticated— and most of all, crazy about me. The only problem is trying to explain that to my big, opinionated Italian family.  But after all we’ve been through, we deserve a happily ever after. And if there’s one thing I know about my guys, they always manage to have a few surprises up their sleeves.",
