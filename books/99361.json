  "description": "In The Insanity of Memoirs of a Mad Man , Fred Goldberg gives us an unforgettable glimpse into the chaos, drama, and outright wackiness that fuels one of the most of loved and hated industries in the world. While Goldberg shares plenty of behind-the-scenes dirt on what it was like to craft ad campaigns for some corporate titans, he also doesn’t spare the mad men who worked alongside him. Many had outsize personalities and some were prone to jaw-dropping displays of ego and antics that would make Mad Men 's Don Draper and company blush.  The Insanity of Memoirs of a Mad Man  is the real story of mad men in a very mad world.",
