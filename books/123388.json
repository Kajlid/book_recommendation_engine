  "description": "Someone wants to put Santa on the naughty list, but that has to be a mistake. Santa is the essence of good. Who is behind this push to make Santa the number one offender of being naughty? Maybe it's payback from someone who doesn't like to be on the naughty list. You'll giggle and laugh at the funny antics around the North Pole. Then decide for yourself if you're on Team Santa Nice list or Team Santa Naughty list.",
