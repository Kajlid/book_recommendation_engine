  "description": "It's 1940. Gloria and her little brother have been evacuated to the countryside to get away from the dangers of the Blitz in London. But their new home isn't as friendly as they'd hoped. The woman they're living with, Miss Saunders, is strict, severe and an outcast in the village. And the local children and other evacuees are equally unwelcoming and mocking. But Gloria quickly learns that nothing is ever as it seems in this strange new place. As possible friends turn out to be enemies, and once sworn enemies might be the best possible friends, Gloria finally realizes that believing first impressions could mean missing out on the friendships that can last a lifetime.",
