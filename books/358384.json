  "description": "A ten-year navy seal veteran, Richard “Mack” Machowicz was trained to complete every mission assigned to him, under any condition, because failure was not an option. Drawing from this experience, Unleash the Warrior Within (more than 25,000 copies since 2002, largely through word-of-mouth) offers Mack's original program for mastering the arts of focus, discipline, and determination under any circumstances. In this newly revised edition, Mack shows readers how to use his seven principles of combat—such as Create an Action Mind-Set, The Critical Keys to Conquering Anything, and Guarantee the Win—in order to conquer fear and turn ambitions and dreams into reality.",
