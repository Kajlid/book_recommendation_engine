  "description": "This book documents the period of Hamsun's life where he could not make enough money through his writing to buy food or pay rent. Resembling the punishment of Sisyphus, a Greek king condemned by Hades to roll a boulder up a hill only to have it role down again each time he reached the pinnacle, the narrator is faced with constant frustration of repetitive rejection.--worldcat",
