  "description": "Randy and Alana set out to the Yucatan hoping to get away from their stressors so they can put their relationship back on course. But soon after they arrive on Isle Mujeres mysterious events begin to occur, and while meditating in Tulum they each experience visions of a possible past-life as Mayans. Unnerved by it all, Randy shuts down but Alana opens and wants to seek answers. On the bus back to their hotel, Alana sits next to a Mayan healer named Molo who offers, out of the blue, to help her with the visions. Filled with desire and curiosity, Alana decides to stay and work with Molo who leads her back to past-lives in order to uncover themes and people that still influence her life enough to keep it in chaos. Alana discovers through this difficult and painful work that she is meant to be a healer. She learns how to cultivate peace and forgiveness. And, she finds her true love, a man from her lifetime as a Mayan, in Tulum.",
