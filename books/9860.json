  "title": "Messenger of Beauty: The Life and Visionary Art of Nicholas Roerich",
  "description": "A celebration of the artist, mystic, and Nobel nominee Nicholas Roerich, whose life and work significantly influenced the development of modern art and culture. Messenger of Beauty opens the door to the mystical world of Nicholas Roerich and invites us to witness his far-reaching vision. Artist, writer, educator, archaeologist, explorer, mystic, and peacemaker, Roerich (1874-1947) left a rich legacy of some 7,000 paintings, drawings, and set and costume designs (most notably for Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring); 30 books on the mystic East; and countless articles and lectures. The Roerich Peace Pact--a remarkable treaty signed by President Roosevelt and 26 other heads of state that sought to preserve cultural monuments during times of war--earned the artist a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Messenger of Beauty includes 88 color plates that cover the full scope of Roerich's artistic career, from ancient Slavic, mythic, and archaeological subjects to breathtaking Himalayan landscapes and religious themes that span the spiritual traditions of the world. First paperback edition of Nicholas Roerich: The Life and Art of a Russian Master",
