  "description": "All over the world, crowds chant my name.I'm gonna make her scream it. I need to discover a band, and sign them - fast. I didn't expect to find Wreckage. And I definitely didn't want to find Ewan Boyd. The Scottish bad boy's temper has already burned me once. He f*cked me over. He got me fired. He's the worst kind of mistake. But he plays his guitar like a god and he plays my body even better. I know I can build him up to be a huge success again. I just have to keep myself from falling apart. When the sh*t hit the fan and my band disintegrated, I was ready to walk away. Until she walked into the room. I was ready to give up on everything I'd worked for, but I'm not going to give up Celia Silver. She wants to work with me. She wants a \"business relationship.\" But my only business plan is hearing her scream my name. I'm not a flash in the pan. I'm no f*cking \"one hit wonder.\" I've got a second chance at rock stardom. But she's got to take a chance on me first.",
