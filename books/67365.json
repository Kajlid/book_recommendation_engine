  "description": "As an Olympic messenger, suburban Aussie girl Ophelia Lind is used to being at the beck and call of the gods. But when gorgeous demigod Aden moves into her neighbourhood and starts taking advantage of her services, Ophelia believes life could not get any worse. She's about to be proven very wrong. Ophelia tries to enjoy a normal, everyday life while running messages for the Greek gods, but without warning an odious creature – evil incarnate – begins to stalk her. As a messenger dealing with the all-powerful and sometimes frightening gods, Ophelia is accustomed to adventures and scrapes. But this is different. Even Aden, who is madly and deeply in love with Ophelia, finds it difficult to protect her. Suddenly Ophelia is in a battle for survival and begins to question everything – her upbringing, her identity and her true feelings for the alluring and entirely frustrating Aden. Harbinger is a terrific romance laced with humour, danger and adventure. The deeply likeable, unstoppable Ophelia takes us on a quest that puts all the memories she holds dear – and her own heart – at risk.   This fantastic book is a must read for all that enjoy mythology, humour, romance and action. It has it all. 5 stars – Turner's Antics I want, need, more from this author! - Totallybooked",
