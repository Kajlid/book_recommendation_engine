  "description": "An extraordinary work of tense, outsider fantasy… Enchantment’s Reach is a fast-paced, intricately-woven saga of conflict, mystery, intrigue, magic and betrayal, set in a world where the fabulous and the unexpected have become the norm.The small kingdom of Enchantment’s Reach lies close on the border of the mysterious land of Enchantment from where strange magical energies seep, borne invisibly on unnatural breezes. Untamed magic resides in the very air, the land itself, and sometimes also deep within the minds of its inhabitants.It is a time of immense tension. Enchantment’s Reach is being torn apart from both inside and out. From the southwest have come the Karai, a brutal warrior race not wholly human, one of whose armies now musters just a few leagues from the border. The Karai are in league, it appears, with mysterious and powerful entities who dwell within Enchantment itself, commonly held to have the powers of gods. Yet neither the Karai nor these godlike creatures of Enchantment have been known before to interfere directly in the affairs of lesser creatures.What is it that they seek from Enchantment’s Reach?",
