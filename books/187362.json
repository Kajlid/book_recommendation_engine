  "description": "What a difference a day can make. Mia Caruso grew up under the roof of a tyrant. Her father, an enforcer for the DeLuca crime family, ruled his home with the same brutality that his job required. Just shy of her eighteenth birthday and four months away from a fresh start at college, he showed up and turned her world upside down. Carlo DeLuca was at the top of his game, master of his own universe as he commanded the most successful organized crime syndicate on the west coast. He'd built his empire from the ashes of his father's legacy and vowed to never allow anything to threaten that. But when Carlo looked into a pair of shining amber eyes and saw a fire that rivaled his own, he knew nothing would be the same again.",
