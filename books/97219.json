  "title": "Intelligent Universe",
  "description": "Ancient records suggest that universes, galaxies, stars, and planets are alive and sentient and capable of communicating with their Creator, as are the peoples who inhabit them. What does our universe look like? What does it have in common with human physiology? How are we connected to it? What natural infrastructures are designed into it? What did the inhabitants of Babel intend to accomplish when they started building a pyramid? What of our Heavenly progenitors? Is there an eternal pattern of creation, opposition, and redemption common to the Fathers of our God? Are human beings mere creations of God, or are we His literal offspring? Inquiring minds and sincere hearts may find a springboard to soul stretching questions in this candid, concise, and well sourced work.",
