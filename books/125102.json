  "description": "The purpose of the Path to Self-mastery is not to raise you up to where you become powerful as judged by a human standard, but where you actually become the open door for the power of God. But you see, the power of God wants to express itself on earth, but it will not express itself according to human expectations and standards. That is why – as long as you hold on to such expectations and standards – your mind will be the closed door. You are subconsciously imposing conditions on how the creative power of God can be expressed through you, and this will effectively close the valves in your chakras and prevent the power of God from streaming through. For of course, the power of God, while all-powerful, will not violate the power of free will.Ascended Master MORE is the Chohan of the First Ray—the ray of Creative Drive, Divine Power and Divine Will. He is a universal teacher who helps lifestreams unlock their creative powers so that they are willing to make creative decisions and do it without letting previous choices limit their future choices.",
