  "description": "Sean Condon has moved to Amsterdam. He got married, and he’s unemployed (what’s worse, so is his wife). Sean is back and funnier than ever, this time exploring the strange habits of the Dutch. He also keeps a watchful and wonderfully self-deprecating eye on the whole strange business of writing about yourself doing, well, nothing much, in this post-modern age. Sean’s uncanny ability to find the absurd in everyday life misses nothing and My ‘Dam Life will strike a side-splitting chord with anyone who has ever been unemployed, been married or tried not to be deported from a foreign land.",
