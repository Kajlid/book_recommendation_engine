  "description": "Glen Carter had it a wife, a family, a thriving medical practice … until tragedy struck and the life he once adored was nothing more than a heartbreaking memory. With few resources and little knowledge of how to survive without the conveniences of modern life, he dissolves into the woods, where he finds forgiveness and embraces life off the grid. Then, once again, his life is upended … An impending solar storm threatens the earth, but governing bodies have opted to keep that information close to the vest. But their attempts fail. The storm devastates the electrical grids and leaves the world in chaos. That is, everyone except Glen … for now.",
