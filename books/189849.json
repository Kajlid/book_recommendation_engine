  "description": "For 50 years and still counting, it has been a one-family rule in Russia as President Nikolai Lupechenko continued from where his grandfather (Admiral) and father (Viktor) left off. Unlike the duo, who are seen during their regime as the people’s president – Nikolai took a detour, believing that the best way to rule a country is to instill fear and awe into his citizens- this tyrannical rule doesn’t go well with some of the country’s overlords as plots were put in place to eliminate Viktor’s only son and to finally put an end to the Lupechenkos’ grapple to power.",
