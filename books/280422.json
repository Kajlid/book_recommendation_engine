  "description": "If they don’t kill each other, the forest will.Willful and daring, Lady Colette dreams of finding true love with a man who can handle her wild nature without dominating her. Those dreams come crashing down when her doting father decides it’s high time she settle down and marry a weakling lord who could never inspire her passion. While enjoying her final hunt as a free woman, Colette throws caution to the wind and chases her quarry into the dark and forbidding forest known only as “The Twist”. Wyvern-rider, Sven, has one thing on his mind: capture the beautiful huntress he’s been watching and get her back to his mountain home. Then he can resume his bid to become his clan’s next chieftain. Just as he gets his opportunity, a dagger across his chest alerts him that his would-be-bride possesses far more spirit than he bargained for, but not more than he’s willing to take on.Stranded together in one of the most dangerous places in the world, a lady and a barbarian find themselves at the mercy of each other as much as the labyrinthian terrain they must escape. Tension grows thick even as time runs short, for something malevolent lurks in the shadows.Author’s Note: This is not a shifter romance. The Dokiri men are savage enough in their manly forms. That being said, this book features subdued sexual content. Enjoy the heat but don’t expect to get singed.Trigger warning: This novel plays on the trope of abduction. While Dokiri men won’t let anything keep them from the woman they love, even that woman herself, all sexual acts in this book are consensual.",
