  "title": "Wars I Have Seen",
  "description": "Wars I Have Seen first published in 1945 is the follow-up to Stein's very successful Paris France. With her great wit and highly original style, Stein gives an account of her life in France during two world wars. As a lesbian and as an American Jew, Stein had plenty to cope with under the Nazi occupation, and the humorous exploits she undertook to harass the Germans show us a side of Stein that may help to explain her strength in dismissing the whole literary establishment to pursue her own modernist writings. In this first British paperback edition of Wars I Have Seen Stein shows her best form and established beyond doubt her place as a pioneer and founder of contemporary literature.",
