  "description": "Criminality rates are rising, the whole country dives into chaos, and the only ones who can bring peace back to the citizens use their power for their own agenda. Once a global superpower, now a country destroyed from within, Sapia is home to Peter Rivers, who has devoted his life and used his inhuman abilities to ensure peace in his homeland, but disappeared without notice, leaving an unprepared police force and a downsized military behind. The safety of the citizens rests in hands of SDS, a private company owned by David Johansson.SDS’ methods, however, divides the population between those who believe brute force is essential for peace, and those who fight for their freedom from Johansson’s tyranny. Among the revolutionaries, there is Monica Dawn. An ambitious reporter who antagonized Johansson during her entire career and had her life destroyed by two of Johansson’s personal bodyguards after SDS rose to power.DREAMS OF A LOST HERO is a story about love and vengeance, and how one gets in the way of the other, as the reader digs inside Peter’s memories and follows Monica’s thirst for vengeance.",
