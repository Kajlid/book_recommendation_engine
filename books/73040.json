  "description": "You'd think after being drugged, taken to a secret military facility, attacked by a flying red monkey, finding out one of your parents isn't human, being shot, imprisoned, thrown out of a collapsing building and shot again, that the thing Thane wouldn't be most afraid of was his high school chemistry teacher. But you'd be wrong.15 year old Thane is invisible. At least he's worked really hard to be, and all he wants is to get through school unnoticed. Things were going well for him until Remi showed up. She's pretty, fun, outgoing, and she picked Thane for a friend. If only a temporary one. Being with Remi means everybody notices him too, even Cressida Rasmussen, the beautiful and possibly insane chemistry teacher who seems to be trying to kill him with science, and Brennan Tayler, the thirty-something man who only shows up when Thane is in trouble and who may or may not be a figment of Thane's stressed imagination.When Ms. Rasmussen ensures that a science experiment goes horribly wrong, Thane is a suspect in an attempted murder where he's the one who should have died. Brennan offers Thane a way to escape-- enter Sanctum, a secret pseudo-military organization that's been tracking him. If Thane doesn't go, at best Ms. Rasmussen will try again and next time someone might die. But if he does the price might just be Thane's freedom, humanity, and self-control. The most powerful magic and the most advanced technology together won't save him, and neither will understanding the song and science of the universe. The only hope he has is to find a way to disbelieve a lie he's been told all his life, the darkest lie we're ever told, and find out what's true for himself.",
