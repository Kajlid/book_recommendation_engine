Every idea falls flat. Every scrambling attempt fails. The more pressure he puts on himself, the more unsuccessful his efforts, and Quaid’s fears grow.Aslan needs to solve this serial killer case and get home to straighten the mess he’s made.Disrupted Engagement is the sixth book in the Valor and Doyle mystery series.
