  "description": "Chris Towns is overworked and lonely. As the only beta wolf in the Fraser Lake Pack and co-owner of a fledgling business, he barely has time to sleep, let alone commit to a relationship. Until a simple trip to the airport changes everything.  When Eagle Elder Rylan Blake lands in Fraser Lake, he's expecting to treat a sick, lone eagle. The last thing he expects to find is romance, especially since he's never felt any type of attraction before.  Just as Chris and Rylan begin to realize their feelings, tragedy strikes, reminding them both why falling in love with each other had been such a bad idea.  Can love really conquer all?",
