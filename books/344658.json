  "title": "The Camel Knows the Way",
  "description": "The Camel Knows the Way is a candid account of an extraordinary and ultimately thrilling quest for God. Lorna Kelly's odyssey from middle class British school girl to glamorous, New York Sotheby's auctioneer to volunteer in the slums of Calcutta is a trek that is sobering, inspiriing and breathtakingly compelling. En route Kelly confronts alcoholism, divorce, a growing sense of spiritual disquiet and her own \"dark night.\" What emerges from that spiritual thirst is a buoyant and compelling affirmation of our common humanity. -- Tom Stretton. (This is the second and revised edition which includes new photographs and an Epilogue explaining why the book was self-published as well as a reporting on Mother Teresa's Beatificaton, October 2003.)",
