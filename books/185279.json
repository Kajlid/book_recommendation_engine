  "description": "You could blame Abbey Finch. If she hadn't come back from town with tales of a fountain bubbling with \"colored\" water, LuLu and Jelly would not have needed to go see for themselves. But it's not Abbey's fault. It's the early 1960s and colored water isn't the fruit-flavored Technicolor wonder that LuLu and Jelly are expecting. And having a drink doesn't come without a price.",
