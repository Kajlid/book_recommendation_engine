  "title": "Grave Faces: A Forensic Technician’s Story of Gathering Evidence of Genocide in Bosnia",
  "description": "This book is the story of the author’s experiences as a forensic technician, gathering evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo, from 1996 to 2002, during the most extensive international forensic investigation in history conducted by the United Nations. ‘Grave Faces’ is unique in that it’s the first book written by an experienced technician who was involved in that investigation. The majority of the victims were from Srebrenica, but he also worked with victims murdered in the notorious concentration camps around Prĳedor, as well as mass graves in Krusha Madhe and Prizren. While this book is significant for all ordinary readers interested in Bosnia and Kosovo, it also provides an important insight to those interested in forensic work, development of international law and justice, contemporary genocide studies and post war and reconciliation studies.",
