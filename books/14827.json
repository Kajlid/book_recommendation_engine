  "description": "Willie Juan said, “Little friends, what is one thing you think Abba will ask you someday when you are in heaven?” Willie Juan and Ana couldn’t have children of their own, but somehow, their home is always full of children and laughter and love. One day, when gathered together enjoying a beautiful evening and Ana’s most delicious sopapillas, Willie Juan asks this most curious question. As the group discusses the question, all come to the wonderful realization that Abba loves each of us, and we are all smack-dab in the middle of His love. “Abba loves you so much and wants you to enjoy his gifts every day. Gifts like Ana’s absolute best, most delicious sopapillas. And the hummingbirds and burros. And abuelas.” The first of Manning’s children’s books, this tender message is right on brand for the popular speaker and author who has traveled the world sharing Abba’s incredible love for His children.",
