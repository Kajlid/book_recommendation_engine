  "description": "Her memory is blank. Her name is not her own. Found in a field, covered in bleeding lash marks, Troy of Cathylon searches for a new life. Taken in by outlawed scholars, trained in a city hidden beneath desert sands, she masters the lore of a supernatural stone called elaa and joins an uprising that could overturn the present regime. Hunted for her ability with the powerful blue stone that seems to do anything she wills, and a book containing the scholars' secrets, every move she makes brings her enemies closer - a zealous new ruler, traitorous warriors, and a ruthless commander - who recognize her from her past. Enemies who hold the answers to it. Their first encounter erased her memory. Their second will end her life.",
