  "description": "LITTLE HARRY WASNâ T LIKE OTHER CHILDRENHarry never cared for reading or writing. He never showed any interest in baseball or TV. Harry lived for other things â like the pleasing sound of living creatures screaming in agony. And the soothing feel of warm blood running through his fingers. But when his grisly experiments progressed beyond stray pets and farm animals to classmates, Harryâ s dad decided to lock the boy away for good in the family basement. After all, the neighbors might begin to talkâ ¦In the solitude of the dank, musty cellar, Harry waited and grewâ ¦ and grewâ ¦ and GREW! And while he waited, he was counseled by his one and only friend â the bright silvery orb in the inight sky that he called â Moom.â Harry spoke to Moom. And Moom spoke to Harry. Moom told Harry what he should do when he finally broke out of his subterranean prison â ¦Moom told Harry to killâ ¦and Killâ ¦and KILLâ ¦",
