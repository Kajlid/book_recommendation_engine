  "description": "\"You don't want to miss this one!\"  A new cozy mystery series from New York Times and USA Today best-selling Author Diane Capri.  Follow former lawyer turned concierge and amateur sleuth Andi Steele and her lovable cats (and dogs) as they catch murderers and solve crimes on historic Frontenac Island, Michigan.  Dead bodies. Hunky men. A never-ending parade of demanding hotel guests, quirky villagers, cats, dogs, and maybe a ghost.  Andi Steele loved her career as a lawyer, until she got caught in the fallout when her boss embezzled millions from clients. With no good options open to her, Andi accepted the only job she could get, filling in as the concierge at The Park Hotel on scenic Frontenac Island.  She meets the devilishly handsome Mayor Daniel Evans, but she’s in no position to be thinking about romance.  Now all she wants to do is lie low while she waits for the scandal to blow over so she can get her life back on track again.  But lying low isn’t an option when she stumbles across a dead body in the hotel swimming pool closet, a dead body that didn’t get that way naturally.  The local sheriff isn’t handling the investigation to Andi’s satisfaction, so the former legal eagle wades in to add her expertise.  But when the killer has Andi in the line of fire, getting her old life back is no longer a priority. If she doesn’t look out, she might lose the only life she’s got. Permanently.  If you love traditional cozy mystery with a side of romance and a splash of suspense, you’ll love Andi Steele and \nThe Park Hotel Mysteries.\n  Get it now!",
