All were apparently designed to teach her the skills she needs to undertake the duty that Fate has given her. As absurd as it may seem, she is destined to save the world. Thankfully, she won’t have to tackle this daunting task alone.The rival organization known as EERI are somehow involved in the coming threat. The Squad’s goal is to hunt down the rival organization’s leader and end them before they can destroy mankind. Before they can embark on their search, they are sidetracked by a new mission. As they begin to close in on their enemy, a new threat arises that heralds the beginning of the end. Their target knows their weaknesses and they will do anything they can to destroy the team’s morale. Lexi was told that she has all the tools she needs to fight her nemesis, but not even her new speed and strength will be enough to save the life of someone she loves.",
