  "description": "Have you ever asked yourself why an English speaker can use two tenses to mean the same thing? Or questioned why one sentence that fits the general rules can be seen as incorrect - and another that seems to break the rules is acceptable? Find your answers in this book.  A comprehensive guide to the grammatical forms, rules and usage patterns of all 12 aspects of the English language, The English Tenses: Practical Grammar Guide is ideal as either an accompaniment to core texts or as a full self-study guide. For English learners of an intermediate level and above, this book introduces the reader to flexible uses of the English tenses, with simple, easy-to-follow explanations and colourful examples.  This guide explains the theory behind the grammar of the different aspects of English, as well as the many ways native English speakers adapt the rules. It covers simple, continuous, perfect and perfect continuous forms in the past, present and future, explaining their uses for showing time, emphasis and other purposes. Also covered are the specific applications of bare infinitives, participles and time clauses.  Phil Williams, tutor and author of the website “English Lessons Brighton”, takes the reader from the past, to present to future, in a friendly, readable style - carefully comparing the tenses along the way. The book offers valuable advice to guide students towards more natural, and fluent, use of advanced English language. It highlights confusing areas in grammar, and compares individual tenses directly, to show how the rules are applied and can sometimes change.",
