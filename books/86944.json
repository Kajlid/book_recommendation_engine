Determined to retrieve his cat, the thief headed for New York City, unaware that Pinkerton Detective Stanley Hawk was on the case. What Remi and Hawk didn’t expect–aside a whole heap of trouble, was the whirlwind romance which swept them off their feet.With the thief gone, Remi and Hawk have settled into their new roles as lovers, and nowadays their biggest challenge comes from running the Purple Rose Tea House, and avoiding the shenanigans from the old gals at the Society of Lavender Lilies. Little do they know trouble lurks near, and it’s far more perilous than matchmaking grannies.",
