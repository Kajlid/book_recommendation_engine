No man companions needed, thank you very much.Until the hot, hunky and charming adventure tour guide shows up at surfboard yoga. And Caleb's got me thinking about new uses for downward facing dog.But indulging in an island fling that'll surely put me on the path to heartbreak again is definitely not on the my single-versary agenda.At least, it shouldn't be on the agenda.",
