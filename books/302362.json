  "description": "Twisted mages, dragons, and a sacrificial bride to save the land.Every year, the villagers of Omdahl pay tribute to their Dragon Master by gifting him with food and jewels for his protection against outside forces. For centuries, this exchange has taken place. This year, the neighboring radical mages have grown agitated, and have attacked the villagers. If matters weren’t already dire, the land is steadily dying, and becoming uninhabitable. When the attacks grow more violent, the Elders of Omdahl agree, the tithe for the Dragon Master will be a bride.Imara always knew she was different, and the village never ceased to remind her. Unable to conjure magic like her fellow seidr’s, she’s a pariah. But when the opportunity to save her homeland arises, she knows what she must do–even if it means becoming the Dragon Master’s bride.Now, to protect all she loves, Imara must work alongside the Dragon Master, or they risk losing everything.\nFans of Sarah J. Maas, Grace Draven, Holly Black, and Casey L. Bond are devouring Christis Christie & Elle Beaumont’s co-written novel!",
