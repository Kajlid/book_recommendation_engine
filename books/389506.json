  "description": "Kayla, a twelve-year-old girl who recently lost her father during a school shooting, is facing many changes. Raised in a Christian home, she has learned to take her religion for granted. Now, she is starting seventh grade in a new town, a new school, with no friends, and no father. Her problem escalates when she makes friends with two girls who seem to be archenemies. For the first time, being a Christian seems to interfere with being popular, and she is faced with one of the biggest decisions of her life: Does being a Christian mean more than just believing in God ... and if so, does she really want to be one?",
