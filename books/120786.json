Her life consists of Friday night fights with her family for the remote control, her crappy minimum wage job, and convincing her sisters that collecting action figures doesn't disqualify her from being Black or a girl.Then Tabitha blunders into the Wardein, those sworn to police the supernatural hybrids and legendary creatures of the city. She reluctantly abandons her dreams of being the popular girl on her new campus, to be powerful in a hidden world with a dangerous learning curve.When a physicist that uses Seattle's population for monstrous experiments wants Tabitha as the next subject, Tabitha has to accept the darkness she's capable of, or lose everything.",
