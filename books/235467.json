  "title": "Parental Alienation is Abuse!",
  "description": "Parental abduction and alienation is abuse. It is caused by the vindictive actions of a former spouse or partner, family court bias/ignorance of the dangers of alienation. As a result, this is a worldwide epidemic that effects mothers, fathers, children and extended family members and is growing at an alarming rate. Left unchecked, it will only continue to worsen and our next generation will pass down this problem to their own children. It is only through the creation awareness that we can hope to make change a possibility. This is why it is important to become involved and share our stories with others who have never been subjected to losing their child.",
