  "description": "Natalie Baker, a girl from rural America, has an unforgettable sexual encounter with billionaire, Tanner Clarke. The passion between them ignites a flame that can’t be put out. She discovers her dark desire – her life will never be the same. “There was something in his face. She couldn't think the thought she grasped for. His skin was pale, and she got the impression he wasn't out in the sun much. His baby blue eyes were so bright, they appeared luminous. And his dark brown hair shimmered with auburn highlights, here under the blaring brightness of the lobby. He was just beautiful. She'd never known a man could be beautiful, but he definitely was.”Dark Desire, 1st novella in the Touched By You series, is a romantic tale that takes place in New York. The sex scenes are graphic - includes light bdsm. The author was inspired by the endearing romance in the Twilight series. And the sexual enlightenment, and sweet romance, in the Fifty Shades Of Grey series. Touched By You is a unique love story, with full character development, and added intrigue from the billionaire’s life, that will make each book in the series hard to put down.",
