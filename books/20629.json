  "description": "I am meeting this woman for one reason and one reason only. And that officially makes her off-limits. I want the one woman I cannot have. Again.The second I lay eyes on Naomi Kent, I know I want her. And not just for my duet, though her voice is so strikingly beautiful, it can make angels weep. It's her mind, her passion, her perfect curvy body. Everything about her sets my blood on fire.But here's the thing... I need her to get this song produced. She needs me to help her regain the life she lost. So, any chance at an us... Well, that's a no-go, right? I don't want anything Gus Diamond has to offer me. And that includes his gorgeous face and sexy-as-all-sin body. Well, maybe I do want those. But this duet? Nope. Not a chance. I gave up this life when my world shattered and my broken pieces were stomped all over in a very public way. So you can understand why the last thing I want is to relive all that. But Gus has this way about him. And before I know what's happening, I'm saying yes to things I know better than to say yes to. Including him. That is until my past decides to make an unexpected return. With one hell of an entrance. CRAZY TO LOVE YOU is a 100k word full length sexy, fun, and emotional forbidden romance with all the feels! It can be read as a standalone.",
