When he meets his parents and twin sister Tara, he learns a shocking he was kidnapped at birth, and they had not seen him since that day. Soon after, he gains a single memory of another hostage, his friend Age. With Tara’s help, Matt tries to recover his memories to stop the criminal group and save his best friend. But Matt’s not the only one dealing with a waking nightmare. Tara has severe OCD and struggles daily just to function.

If that’s not daunting enough, his kidnappers start to speak of their final plan coming together. Even if Age gets out, he can’t let the remaining hostages be left for whatever nefarious purposes are laid out for them. Will Matt and Tara uncover the secrets of the captors against the clock while dealing with Tara’s OCD spike? Can Age manage to slip away and alert the authorities before it’s too late, or are they doomed to live in the dark forever?",
