  "description": "The List of Possibilities used to be the back-up list- that is until Calvin Hunt ‘borrowed’ it from Kinley Brooke’s wallet. He’s taken it upon himself to be her matchmaker now that her divorce is final. She has celebrity crushes like anyone else, and in his position as a rock star, he can make her dreams come true. When he sets her up with a handsome television star, Cal is ready to pat himself on the back. The trouble is she wants someone else, someone she can’t have.Rory Hunt has been living in marital misery for years now. He’s separated but still legally wedded to Satan incarnate. In his grief, he’s accidentally bonded with and become best friends with another woman, Kinley Brooke. He didn't mean for it to happen, but he wants to be more than friends. This is so not like him; he’s never been unfaithful in any way. Kinley’s been hurt by her cheating ex-husband and is not about to enter into a relationship with a married man. He’s trying to push his divorce through, but it doesn't seem to be fast enough. She’s dating- a lot, even her ex. The only thing he can do is ‘act’ like her closest friend, when in reality she is the love of his life. Can he, as her friend, protect her from an unwanted stalker and a vicious scorned woman who will stop at nothing to destroy her?",
