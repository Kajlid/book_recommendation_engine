  "description": "*** Best Beach Read, Chick Lit Cafe's Best Books of 2012 *** The famous and beloved foursome – they are both things on Captain’s Island in the Great South Bay of Long Island, New York, where they grew up and developed their fun-loving defiantly-barefoot reputation – helped raise one little girl together, their “Barefoot Baby” Hannah. Now grown, Hannah has done the unthinkable and written a poison-pen novel that could tear apart not only her relationship with her mother and the other Barefoot Girls, but also pushes Hannah’s life into a downward spiral that threatens to destroy everything that matters to her including her engagement to Daniel, the one man who had been able to scale the high walls around her heart. As Hannah battles to come to terms with her equally blessed and troubled childhood and understand her mother and her sister-close friends, she’s confronted with the power of forgiveness and the dangers of holding on to the past.",
