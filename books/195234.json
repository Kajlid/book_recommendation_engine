  "title": "Elegant Entrepreneur: The Female Founders Guide to Starting & Growing Your First Company",
  "description": "This is a female founder’s guide to grow a company from idea to exit, regardless of whether you have a business background or entrepreneurial ties. It is not a textbook containing exhaustive abstract business tenants; it is the book I wish was available when I started my first company.I wrote this book to fill a void – there are very few how-to-build your business/become an entrepreneur books written by women for women. I will not only explain the steps to building a successful company, I will illustrate elegant insights to smooth what can be a very awkward and precarious navigation between those business steps. My goal is to not only help a new generation of women find their place in the entrepreneurial world, but to enable them to flourish!This book is a left brain/right brain map. It identifies 12 major steps to creating a successful business (left brain) and 12 elegant entrepreneurship insights (right brain) that provide pleasingly ingenious and simple concepts to gracefully span the gaps in between the business steps. These transparent, candid glimpses into the entrepreneur lifestyle will help you make a clear decision about whether the lifestyle is right for you and your vision of success.Each chapter builds understanding of consecutive business concepts. Key information gives a foundation for applying these concepts to your idea. Each chapter concludes with a summary of insights, an exploration of how it feels to be living that step, and suggestions for further reading on the topic.",
