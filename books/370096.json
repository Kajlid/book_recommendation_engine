  "title": "The Hampdenshire Wonder",
  "description": "A fascinating forerunner of modern science fiction: The mind-bending story of a prodigy in Edwardian England Born to a famous cricket player, Victor Stott is a giant-headed, awkward boy who never cries or says a word. At first, he is branded an idiot, but as he grows up it becomes apparent that Victor possesses a superior intelligence. He can master any language, memorize entire libraries—perhaps even control people with his mind. As word of his otherworldly gifts spreads, so too do fears of what he might be capable of.   First published in 1911 and considered to be the first novel about a superman, The Wonder is a masterpiece of speculative fiction and a compelling portrait of what it means to be extraordinary.   This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.",
