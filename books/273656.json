  "title": "After the Clockwork Universe: The Emerging Science and Culture of Integral Society",
  "description": "We are in the midst of the most dramatic cultural shift in three hundred years. This book explains why great change is simmering in all facets of our civilization, from economics and politics to science and spirituality. Our inherited concept of a machine world, the clockwork universe, is giving way and the vision of a web world is rising to take its place. Goerner explains the new and profound rethinking across modern science, from anthropology to physics. Interdependence is now seen as central to understanding organization and change at all levels from chemical networks and living cells to ecosystems, cities and economies. He weaves current realities and new scientific insights into a vision of history and science progressing through upheavals and rebirths to the present day.",
