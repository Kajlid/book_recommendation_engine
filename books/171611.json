  "title": "Tell Them We Remember: The Story of the Holocaust",
  "description": "A vital, award-winning introduction to the Holocaust, with photos and documents from the United States Holocaust Memorial MuseumDrawing on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's large collection of artifacts, photographs, maps, and taped oral and video histories, this book tells the story of the Holocaust and how it affected the daily lives of innocent people throughout Europe. Excerpts from 'identity cards' that are part of the Museum's exhibit focus on specific young people whose worlds were turned upside down when they became trapped under Nazi rule. Many of these young people never had the chance to grow up. One and a half million of the victims were children and teenagers--the great majority of them Jewish children but also tens of thousands of Roma (Gypsy) children, disabled children, and Polish Catholic children. Like their parents, they were singled out not for anything they had done, but simply because the Nazis considered them inferior.Those who survived to become adults passed on the stories of relatives and friends who had been killed, with the hope that the terrible crimes of the Holocaust would never be forgotten or repeated. The powerful stories and images in this book are presented with the same hope. Only by learning about the Holocaust will we be able to tell the victims we remember.",
