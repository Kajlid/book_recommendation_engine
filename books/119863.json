  "description": "\"I wish someone - my mother, my husband, anybody - would really let me have it, instead of telling me everything's not my fault when it obviously is...\" Sara's seen the cost of interfering in other people's dreams firsthand; it's measured in ruined lives and cemetery plots. When her supernatural dreams start up again, Sara is faced with problem after problem. And the only solution she can see is the one she's sworn never to attempt - changing the minds of the dreamers from the inside-out. Sara thought that fighting against serial killers, mobsters and crooked politicians was difficult, but she's about to come up against the most difficult foe she's ever faced: her own conscience. Dream Reunion is the emotional sixth book in the Dream Series.",
