If only it was that simple, but she didn't just have herself to consider.CalistaThe sympathy ringers rang, only I was so damn tired of being looked at with pity - looked at as if I had lost something vital. The truth was that, as terrible as it sounded, I had found my freedom. But that freedom came with the two loves of my life. Being a mother to them was probably the only thing that kept me grounded.So when he came into the picture, I chalked it up to a passing interest - a fling. Only, I'm starting to learn that once you're in the Club, there is no such things as a fling.BearShe was everything I wasn't looking for in a woman, and yet I refused to let her go - refused to let her find any option that didn't include us.",
