  "description": "Special Agent Erik Langston has been tracking Clarissa O’Connell for nearly a year, always one step behind the cyber hacking thief. She’s escaped his clutches often and easily. Except tonight.In the snow-covered switchbacks of the Colorado mountains in a worsening snowstorm, a car crash robs Clarissa of her memory and lands her as Erik’s prisoner. Riding out the storm in a cabin, Erik is forced to protect someone he knows to be a criminal, though O’Connell isn’t anything like he’d imagined her to be. In a race to stay one step ahead of those who’ll do anything for what she knows, Clarissa and Erik must dig into her locked memories if they’re going to survive. But revelations of her past prove to Clarissa she’s everything Erik despises. Can she trust his feelings even when he knows the truth? Is it really possible to start over with a blank slate?",
