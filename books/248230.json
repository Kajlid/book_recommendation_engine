  "description": "Wheatfield, Minnesota - a metropolis of seven hundred souls. The word \"moribund\" might have been invented for Wheatfield. Nothing ever happened there and nothing ever would—until the mayor of sorts (campaign slogan: \"I'll Do What I Can\") and a buddy come up with a scheme to put the town on the map. They'd heard of a place where a floating image of the Virgin Mary had turned the whole town into a shrine, attracting thousands of pilgrims. And all those pilgrims needed food, shelter, all kinds of crazy things, right? They'll get rich! What could go wrong?When the first dead body shows up, they find out. That's only the beginning of their troubles—and those of Virgil Flowers'—as they are about to discover all too soon.Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021. It is part of the \"Prey\" series but Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers share the billing - \"Ocean Prey.\"",
