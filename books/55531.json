It is the near future, and in the conflict between advancing high technology and its opponents, the worldâ€™s first intelligent robot violently escapes its creators and the men sent to shut it down. This novella follows the intertwining lives of the people trying to find, save or destroy the robot, and explores the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence and what it means to be human.",
