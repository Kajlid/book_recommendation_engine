  "description": "There are three names that have haunted me for ten years.Silas, Damon, Jude.I never wanted to come back to Greythorn, MA. And I never thought I’d see Silas Huxley, Damon Brooks, or Jude Vanderbilt again—especially not after what happened.But here they are, in all of their grown, badass glory—brutal, tatted, muscular, and no longer the boys I knew at Ravenwood Academy—the boys I bullied relentlessly.I made their life a living hell back then, so they plan on making my life a living hell now.They’re out for blood—my blood. Their ruthless thirst for revenge turns my skin to ice, and I soon discover just how savage and hateful they are.But despite popular opinion, my life was never full of butterflies and sunshine. I’ve endured a hell of a lot worse than what they plan to do to me.They may think I’m back in Greythorn with my tail between my legs, all battered and bruised—but what they’ve forgotten is that I am the original Queen of Ravenwood Academy.And I refuse to be dethroned.Savage Hate (Savage Hearts Book One) is a spinoff of the Ruthless Royals duet, which does not have to be read first. It is a full-length enemies-to-lovers/bully reverse harem romance, and while it doesn’t end with a true cliffhanger, there will be unanswered questions. It is advised to read them in order. Please note Savage Hate contains explicit language, bullying, needles, and violence. There are flashbacks of abuse/grooming/trauma. The series will have a HEA.",
