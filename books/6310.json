  "description": "Lance Bennett is definitely Willow’s type, with his windswept sandy blonde hair, muscles built from hours in construction, and a grin that melts her heart. He’s almost perfect …all except for his ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ lifestyle. Willow has been there, done that, and has no interest in repeating it, thank you very much.When she can’t resist Lance’s undeniable charm, or his dreamy blue eyes, any longer, Willow agrees to being friends with benefits. And once the fun is over and Lance is leaving, she will have to decide whether she’ll dare to take a chance on him, or if she’ll watch him walk away for good.It only takes a single life-altering kiss to convince Lance that he’s finally met the one. Too bad Willow St. John is equally convinced he isn’t her type. Even Lance, the steamy nights they spend together, and his three adorable rescue dogs can’t change her mind. So what if he doesn’t want to stay in one place for more than six months, while Willow wants a house and white picket fence? If they’re together, that should be enough, right?When Lance receives an opportunity to board a plane for foreign shores, and Willow is seemingly okay with cutting their relationship off, he packs his bag. Will he be able to forget Willow once he’s boarded the plane, or can he dare to stay in one place for the woman he loves most?Daring Lance is a sexy romantic comedy that proves no strings attached don’t necessarily stay that way…",
