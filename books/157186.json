  "description": "Fourteen year-old Eva tries to be a good disciple of Righteous Path, a polygamy cult in Colorado, but her forays into the \"heathen world\" cause her to question all she knows. Eva wants to be a good disciple of Righteous Path. She grew up knowing that she's among the chosen few to be saved from Armageddon. Lately, though, being saved feels awfully treacherous. Ever since they moved to the compound in Colorado, their food supplies have dwindled while their leader, Ezekiel, has stockpiled weapons. The only money comes from the jewelry Eva makes and sells in town―a purpose she'll serve until she becomes one of Ezekiel's wives. But a college student named Trevor and the other \"heathens\" she meets on her trips beyond the compound are far different from what she's been led to believe. Now Eva doesn't know which is more dangerous―the outside world or Reverend Ezekiel's plans.",
