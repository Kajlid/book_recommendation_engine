  "title": "Rebuilding Brandon: A Second Chance at Life and Love for an Ex-Con",
  "description": "Brandon is an ex-con attempting to rebuild his integrity after spending several years in prison. Elizabeth is a young volunteer worker at a halfway house, a place where ex-convicts find a second chance at life and acclimate to the noise, chaos, and freedom of modern society. The two meet at the halfway house and immediately spark a complicated journey of sexual tension and primal attraction. A second chance at love is the unexpected result. Elizabeth helps Brandon rebuild his life and get a fresh start in the world. She gradually grows closer and develops a unique emotional connection to him, and in turn, he helps her unlock a new level of confidence and assertiveness she had never known. Her new assertiveness helps her take charge of her career—as well as get what she wants in the bedroom. As Brandon’s new life starts to take root and Elizabeth begins to explore other career paths, the two find themselves at a tense decision point: Will they part ways after one last passionate fling or will they find a way to keep their paths and bodies entwined?",
