  "description": "New York theater actress Teresa Guzman has landed the coveted lead role in the true story of the life of a murdered prostitute, but the emotions the role evokes are almost more than she can handle. Haunted by the suffering of her character, Teresa is losing faith in men and fights not to fall in love with Joaquin Solis, a generous fan. Joaquin will have to prove his love for Teresa is genuine. After the tragic death of her fiancé, professional singer Eloisa Morales is putting her life back together. Eloisa wrestles with the decision of whether she will ever sing again. As she tries to find her path forward, Marcos Marquez, the theater's biggest backer, is determined not to lose Eloisa and the chance for love to her grief for her late fiancé. As the four lives intertwine, their passion for the arts and for helping women like Teresa's character will bind their lives together in a romantic and mystical journey to overcome their fears of bearing their souls and help them learn to trust, on and off the theater stage.",
