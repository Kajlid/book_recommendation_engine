  "description": "The first edition of \"Alzheimer's Disease:What if There Was a Cure?, which details Dr. Newport's discovery and use of medium-chain fatty acids (which act like alternative fuel in the Alzheimer's brain), had such a strong reception in 2011 that a second edition is now in demand. In this updated and expanded version, Dr. Newport, a neonatal practitioner, continues the story of her husband Steve's progress and provides the most recent research on the possible connection between Alzheimer's disease and the herpes simplex virus and nitrosamine substances, as well as how infection, inflammation, and genetic makeup may affect an individual's response to fatty acid therapy. Among many other updates, Dr. Newport details the latest clinical trials aimed at removing beta-amyloid, which accumulates in the Alzheimer's brain.< Dr. Newport's story of Steve's reprieve from Alzheimer's disease provides a real breakthrough for caregivers eager to learn about readily available fatty acids in foods that may reverse the ravages of this derreaed disease. Because ketone esters, a synthesized form of these powerful fatty acids,work faster and more comprehensively than fatty acids in foods, Dr. Newport has become an ardent advocate for ketone ester research, wtih FDA approval her final goal.",
