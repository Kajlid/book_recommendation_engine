  "description": "This is Dennis Patterson's life story living as an African American in Idaho, one of the whitest and most conservative states in America. It is a journey that begins with a young boy coming to grips with the truth of race and racism. As he travels the path to adulthood he is inspired by his parents and Black heroes to stand up and speak out against injustice. Later, his fight against racism for one man leads to four years of abuse, harassment, and retribution by Idaho's largest employer, the Idaho National Laboratory. He persevered and never lost hope. Throughout his adult life Patterson fought for racial justice, first as the Legal Redress Officer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and later as the President of a non-profit, the Idaho Falls African American Alliance (AAA). The AAA's mission was to initiate dialogue and provide resources to improve the city of Idaho Falls and to improve understanding among all races. The book also details the amazing people he had the honor of meeting including Pulitzer Prize winning author Isabel Wilkerson, the late civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis. Barack Obama, and Michelle Obama. Readers will be amazed and inspired by how one man fought to make life better for others.",
