  "description": "The sequel to Highland Steam. Sorcha never thought she’d be married, let alone to Reed Campbell, leader of a rival clan. But when her brother and Campbell form a truce—and she finds herself kissing Campbell in her bedchamber—her brother insists on a marriage. And Campbell insists on having Sorcha in his bed. Though she vowed never to fall in love, she can’t resist his strong arms and hot kisses—or the way he spanks her when provoked. And oh, she provokes him. As much and as often as possible. Campbell has never cared for weak women. Is it any wonder his desire for the sword-wielding, knife-throwing Sorcha consumes him so completely? The lass may say she doesn’t like him, but the way she writhes and moans beneath him proves otherwise. He’s determined to have her in every way—and in every position—it’s possible to have a woman. But first he needs to win her fierce, feisty heart.",
