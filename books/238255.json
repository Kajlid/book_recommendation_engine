  "description": "Gideon's Credo A sequel to Gideon’s Passage “Where injustice persists … Vengeance will follow” Visualize sixteenth century France, a period that symbolized the very peak of the glorious European Renaissance; a period in which Architecture and Universities of Learning thrived that germinated the arrival of the ‘Free Thinkers’ who dared to think outside the square. Temporarily relieved from the dangers of its Ottoman enemies from “without”, France turned its attention on its citizens “within”. What followed was religious intolerance. Religious zealots had the entrenched belief that it was their divine right to ruthlessly rid France of all opposition to Papal authority; that trailed bloodshed and misery in its wake for almost half a century. The Huguenot reformists were their “choice” of persecution. This then is the canvas on which the story is painted. A narrative of war, of courage, and honour, of the deceit and brutality of humans, the raw passions and emotions of those who were caught in its midst … and one man’s desperate pursuit for justice for the innocent citizens of his beloved France that were being persecuted … and the price he paid for it! His name was Gideon!",
