  "description": "Patrick Lindsay wasn’t looking for anything when he met Shawn Waters. Flirty and forward, the younger man didn’t seem opposed to an open relationship. They could see other people, the exact level of commitment Patrick wanted. Shawn was looking for a good time when he stumbled into the arms of two people who seemed destined to be together, but for an unknown reason, weren’t. Will Steele and Dean Baldwin had danced around each other for years, their feeling gradually growing with time. When they included Shawn in their bed for one steamy night, it changed everything forever. Almost missing out on a chance to have something serious with Will forces Dean to admit his feelings, but Will has grown attached to Shawn and doesn’t want to give him up. Rather than walk away with nothing, Dean agrees that Will can have them both. When the three of them first discuss this crazy plan, they realize they should talk with someone who has been down the same road. Shawn thinks his boyfriend Patrick is just the person. But Patrick isn’t sure what he can offer the trio. His marriage ended when his husband ran off with their boyfriend and he doesn’t feel qualified to lead them down that path.",
