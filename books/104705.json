But it’s hard to follow a simple recipe for relaxation when murder gets thrown in the mix…   The Cookbook Nook is set to host the town’s upcoming Grill Fest, a tasty tradition which pits local amateur chefs against one another to concoct the most delicious dishes. This year’s challenge: grilled cheese.
