  "description": "Joseph Chattoche is an Apache Native American working on an assignment far from home, tormented by nightmares and guilt of his wife's recent death. Shannon Gallagher is looking for her one remaining relative and isn't pulling up her roots anytime soon. Can she let herself love a man that will leave her in a few months? Can he find the answers he needs to let his wife's spirit rest? Together, can they find a way to help each other and maybe even allow themselves to love again?\"A contemporary Native American romance with scorcher love scenes and a delightfully sexy hero.\"\"Helping Each Other is a beautiful and inspiring romance. I didn't want it to end.\"\"Set in the 1980's, before cell phones, this makes me nostalgic for answering machines and driving to each other's homes unannounced. Learning about Apache culture through Joseph and his friends is eye opening and clearly shows his motivation and priorities as he strives for balance in his life.\"\"I love Joseph Chattoche!\"This is a stand alone novel with no cliff hangers. More novels in the series are coming soon. They are all stand alone, although some characters are introduced in prior books.",
