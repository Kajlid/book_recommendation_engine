  "title": "Schlomo Raven Public Detective",
  "description": "This was the first volume of Fiction Illustrated, a graphic novel experiment from 1976. This book was published only in a weird little 5 x 6 1/2\" format and printed on cheap comic book paper. Schlomo Raven is a hardboiled dick, but played for laughs in the MAD comic style of Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. If anything can be said to be more over the top than Kurtzman and Elder, this is it. The first of two stories, called \"The Farx Job,\" lampoons not only the Marx Brothers but Karloff and Lugosi in character as the Monster and Dracula. The other tale, \"Rosebug,\" takes on Orson Wells and Citizen Kane. Sophomoric humor, to be sure, but you're in the mood for it, this delivers.",
