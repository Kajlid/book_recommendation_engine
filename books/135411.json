  "description": "A Thane and Moss mystery When a corpse is fished out of the River Clyde, CID inspectors Colin Thane and Phil Moss are confronted with several problems. In the first place, Margaret Barclay was certainly murdered - strangled, to be precise. Secondly, she came from Monkswalk, an affluent and status-conscious suburb where police officers are about as welcome as tax inspectors. And third, she was the friendly neighborhood witch. Thane and Moss find themselves confronting a maze of contradictory facts, concealed motives and outright lies, until a sudden realization leads them to a strange rite, and the cost of folly is paid for in blood.",
