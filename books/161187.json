  "title": "Weird Ghastly Horror: Forbidden Horror Comics of the 1950s",
  "description": "These are the horror comics your parents didn’t want you to read. For a brief period in the early 1950s they were available everywhere and then suddenly just disappeared from sight. Everyone knows about the celebrated EC horror comics, but manypeople have forgotten, or never knew about, these “other” horror comics from the same period. Weird Ghastly Horror presents a nostalgic look at what was great, not so great, and yet very typical of the forbidden horror comics of the 1950s. Don’t let your mother catch you reading these!",
