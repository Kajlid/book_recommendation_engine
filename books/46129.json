  "description": "There are a good many folks who live along the coast of South carolina who do, in fact, believe in ghosts. It is for them that I have written this book. The ones who have enough imagination to look past what can merely be seen with our eyes and to look a little harder at that long shadow, or listen a little closer to the sounds of the night wind. Many of these folks have taken the sotries they have heard of the years to heart.",
