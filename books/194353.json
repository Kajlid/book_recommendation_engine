  "title": "The Christmas Bower",
  "description": "The Kubicheks were a Store Family. To be in the middle of things was not only their living, it was the breath of life. And so they could never understand why Uncle willie chose to be Curator of Birds at the Museum of Natural History. For who in his right mind would spend his life messing around with birds when he could be downtown making money?No one could understand, that is, except young Noah Kubichek, who loved the museum with its dusty odor of animal skins, camphor , and pressed leaves and went there to visit Uncle Willie as often as he could. On this particular day in November he was sent to ask for Uncle Willie's help at the store - it was something about the Christmas decorations, he explained - \"Don't you remember, Uncle Willie? The birds. The Twelve Days of Christmas theme. Remember?\" Uncle Willie did remember, but even he didn't foresee just how hopelessly (and riotously) entangled biology and merchandising could become. Though The Christmas Bower is an allegory in a a way, all the science part of the book is real. It is the only known work of ornithological science fiction, full of quips and quibbles, and is especially recommended for reading aloud by the whole family.",
