  "description": "The Bad Girl of Poetry, Kristie LeVangie, also known under the pen name of K-, is the creative mind behind www.libidacoria.com, THE Place for Sexual Intellectuals. She's a poetess, plus-size pin-up model, podcast and talk show host, voiceover narrator and performance artist. Her shows are downloaded in more than 59 countries around the world, and her book, In a Plain Brown Wrapper, has been described as \"wallowing in an orgy of undiluted lust\" that questions \"aspects of both traditional gender roles and contemporary feminism\" She does it again with her latest release, 4play. 4play once again showcases LeVangie's mastery of rhyme and rhythm while seducing you with erotic semantic foreplay. This book is very aptly named. Word of warning, this bad girl uses bad words and that's what makes her so, so good.",
