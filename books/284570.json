Then fate crossed my path with Bexley.A siren who put fire in my heart.And every dream and goal became about her.Until it ended.She was a whirlwind of savage possession I wasn’t prepared for.No warning could have ever saved me from being swept up in her tornado.AND LIKE ALL STORMS … ONE DAY IT RETURNED.One day it begged for forgiveness, and for my heart.She had her reasons. And I have mine for resisting.No matter what, our lives are irrevocably entwined.Because as all storms go … the allure to chase them is irresistible.AND MY QUEEN NEEDED TO KNOW WHO SHE BELONGED TO.",
