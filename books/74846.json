  "description": "Through much of the 20th century, books for children encouraged girls to be weak, submissive and fearful. This book discusses such traits in much of our most popular literature, making an indictment of the books that many generations of girls have loved. This includes Alcott, Betsy-Tacy, Seventeenth Summer, Cherry Ames, the Chalet School, Daddy Long Legs, Elizabeth Enright, Anne of Green Gables and others.",
