  "description": "He wasn't expecting to meet his mate yet. He also wasn't expecting his mate to be a fox shifterâ€”or a man.  Marlow's childhood was a nightmare, as an orphaned wolf shifter trying to survive a hostile pack and protect his younger brother. At twenty-three, he's finally in a good place, with a great job working with the police and a partner he trusts. But is he ready for a mate?  Even if he can wrap his head and his heart around this, is there any chance for a good outcome? Marlow has no idea how to even begin talking to a pretty fox shifter. It would help if Frankie didn't hate him already...  69,000 words. Very low heat.",
