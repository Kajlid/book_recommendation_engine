  "description": "David Zindell crafted a glorious fantasy in The Lightstone , an epic tale of good versus evil...and how far a man will go to save his world without destroying all he loves. The quest continues in The Silver Sword . On the island continent of Ea it is a dark time of chaos and war. Morjin, the evil Lord of Lies, seeks to enslave the entire world. Land after land falls under his evil power. The one thing that has the potential to destroy him is an object that has been lost for the Lightstone. The call to seek this stone was sent out by one of the few major rulers still free of Morjin's grip to all those who oppose the dreaded sorcerer. One who answered this call was Valashu Elahad, the seventh and youngest Valeri prince of the royal house of Mesh. Val and his stalwart companions have braved many dangers and fought many battles in their search for this elusive totem. It looks as if their quest may be at an end and a great victory shimmers on the horizon. But not all images are real. Is the Lightstone within Val's grasp or has he embarked upon a road too horrible to conceive?",
