  "description": "From the loudest, most fiercely unapologetic misfit writing in France today comes this provocative manifesto for a new punk feminism. With humor, rage, and confessional detail, Despentes explodes common attitudes about sex and gender, and proclaims that modern beauty myths are ripe for rebelling against. Using her own experiences as a jumping-off point, she creates a new space for all those who can’t or won’t obey the rules.\"I write from the realms of the ugly, for the ugly, the old, the bull dykes, the frigid, the unfucked, the unfuckable, the hysterics, the freaks, all those excluded from the great meat market of female flesh. And if I’m starting here it’s because I want to be crystal clear: I’m not here to make excuses, I’m not here to bitch. I wouldn’t swap places with anyone because being Virginie Despentes seems to me a more interesting gig than anything else out there.\"",
