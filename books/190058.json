  "title": "Al-Muwatta of Imam Malik - Arabic English",
  "description": "The Muwa a' contains a record of the exemplification by the last Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, of the message of the Qur' n, the practice ('amal) of the people of Mad nah of the first generations, a transmission of the ethos that permeated the city, and Im m M lik's painstaking clarification of the Sunna, the ad ths, the practice and legal judgements. Ash-Sh fi' said, \"After the Book of Allah, there is no book on the face of the earth sounder than the book of M lik.\" 'Al ' ad-D n Maghla y al- anaf said, \"The first person to compile the a was M lik.\" Ibn ajar said, \"The book of M lik is sound by all the criteria that are demanded as proofs in the mursal, munqa i' and other types of transmission.\" As-Suy followed Ibn ajar's judgement and said, \"It is absolutely correct to say that the Muwa a' is sound ( a ) without exception.\" Al-Bukh r and Muslim transmitted most of its ad ths and included them in their a collections. The authors of the rest of the six books, the Im m of the ad th scholars, A mad ibn anbal, and others did the same.\"",
