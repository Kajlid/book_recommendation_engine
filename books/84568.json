  "description": "Devon Harper is a cambion, the offspring of an incubus and one of his female followers. Discovered by those who could've helped him too late to be saved from his nature, he barely survived a brutal childhood before getting a handle on his powers of seduction. Lust, sex, these are second nature to cambion, and are their road to both riches and ruin. Devon has the power to bring people to their knees with a glance, to drive them so crazy with pleasure that they forget their names, and occasionally forget to breathe as well. He could use his birthright to force the world to worship him, but Devon is trying to fight against the pull, to do what he can to track down people with the power to summon a demon and stop them before more cambion can be made.But Devon doesn't realize that the path he and his friends are following is only one strand of a web laid in place by a demon who's not content to wait on the whims of humanity to get out of Hell. Devon is this demon's key to staying above ground permanently, and when he finally catches up with the cambion, he's not taking no for an answer.Episode 1: Heaven's On FireDevon's infiltration of a Chinese kingpin's lair doesn't quite go off as planned, and lands him in a dangerous predicament. Shangdi knows about Devon, and knows how useful a cambion can be, particularly to his partner, the mysterious demon summoner Porter Grey. With time running out for Devon, it's up to the even more mysterious Rio Pagani to storm the compound and pull Devon out before Porter can put his plans for the cambion into motion.",
