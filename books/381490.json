  "title": "Bread and Jam for Frances",
  "description": "The classic funny story about a stubborn little badger with very particular tastes in food. Frances is a fussy eater. In fact, the only thing she likes is bread and jam. She won't touch her squishy soft-boiled egg. She trades away her chicken-salad sandwich at lunch. She turns up her nose at boring veal cutlets. Unless her parents can come up with a plan, Frances just might go on eating bread and jam forever! Join the generations of families that have laughed along as Frances sings \"Jam on biscuits, jam on bread, Jam is the thing I like most, Jam is sticky, jam is sweet, Jam is tasty, jam’s a treat—raspberry, strawberry, gooseberry, I’m very FOND…OF…JAM!\"",
