  "description": "Ironside is more than a regular academy. It’s also the biggest reality TV show in the world … and a very elaborate, very luxurious prison. Their hallowed halls are ruled by the powerful Betas and the middling Omegas, with the plentiful Deltas as their main targets, but this year, the officials are stirring things up.Isobel Carter—the only rare Sigma to be accepted—is the first sign. But there are others. Many others. A sudden influx of precious Alphas will turn academy life, and Isobel’s life, upside down. She might be the lowest rung on the ladder, but in order to survive Ironside, where social media is king and consequences are deadly, she will need to make her mark.She will need to climb.This isn’t a game for the faint of heart, and those who rise should be prepared for a beautiful, brutal fall.Beware the pretty posers, because this social media game just got dangerous.The Hunger Games collides with America's Got Talent, and you've just been invited to binge it all in high definition. But here's some viewer discretion before you continue:This book is a “why choose” romance with as many book boyfriends as enemies, so expect a slow-to-medium burn. If you like your omegaverse, reverse harem, and academy troupes twisted and defiled to stretch your imagination, then this is the book for you!Now it's time to grab some popcorn and dive right in!",
