  "description": "A taste of honey...When a mysterious drifter appeared at Honey Farrell's ranch, willing to work for room and board, the wary widow had to hire him. Tall, dark and grouchy, Jesse Whitelaw could scare away the lurking cattle rustlers with one growl. And Honey's sons could sure use a man around. Still, there was something mighty suspicious about the cowboy....Jesse hated lying about who he really was, yet he had to keep his cover--and the Farrells--safe. But who knew that somewhere between fixing fences and secret meetings, he'd teach a teenage boy how to be a man ... or that with one wet kiss he'd remind a brokenhearted woman what it meant to love again? Or that, when the truth came out, he'd lose everything?",
