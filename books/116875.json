  "description": "\"Really, Jill I never knew anybody like you for falling on your feet. When other people would be landed in an absolute mess, you find yourself a house and plenty to eat.\"Jill and her friends are going on a pony trek. Of course, nothing goes absolutely to plan, especially when Jill and Ann manage to forget where they're supposed to be meeting up with the rest of the trek. Rather than have to spend the night shivering in a ditch, they manage to come to the rescue of someone who's fallen down the stairs, and stay in their house. This is not their only adventure, and this last Jill story sees Jill back where she belongs, surrounded by ponies and the people who love them.",
