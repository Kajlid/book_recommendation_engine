  "description": "The Love & Rockets library continues with this special volume.To a very great extent, Love & Rockets is synonymous with Hoppers' Maggie & Hopey and Palomar's Luba & Carmen & Heraclio & Tonantzin... but there was always more to L&R than that. Amor y Cohetes finally collects together in one convenient package all the non-Maggie and non-Palomar stories by all three Hernandez Brothers from that classic first, 50-issue Love and Rockets series—a dizzying array of styles and approaches that re-confirms these groundbreaking cartoonists' place in the history of comics.The book leads off with Gilbert's original 40-page sci-fi epic \"BEM\" from 1981's very first issue of Love & Rockets, featuring a very different Luba and a much looser, Heavy Metal and Marvel Comics-inspired way of storytelling.Other stories include Jaime's charming \"Rocky and Fumble\" series starring a planet-hopping girl and her robot; stunning one-shots such as Gilbert's Frida Kahlo biography \"Frida\" and his shocking autobiographical fantasia \"My Love Book\"; Mario's genre thrillers which take place \"Somewhere in California\"; Gilbert's brutally dystopian \"Errata Stigmata\" stories; the playful \"Hernandez Satyricon,\" with Gilbert drawing Jaime's characters, and \"War Paint,\" with Jaime trying out Palomar; Gilbert's light-hearted \"Music for Monsters\" starring Bang and Inez; and even a fantastical \"non-continuity\" Maggie and Hopey story \"Easter Hunt\" by Jaime that didn't fit into the other books.Amor y Cohetes, the seventh (and concluding, for now) volume in the new \"Complete Love & Rockets\" series of compact, affordable paperbacks, shows a very different side of Los Bros Hernandez.",
