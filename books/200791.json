  "description": "The Mission of Abb� Glasberg is the fascinating story of a priest - of Jewish origins - who dedicated himself to the task of helping the refugees who were streaming into France during the years preceding World War II. Together with Father Chaillet, Abb� Glasberg created the ecumenical Amiti� Chr�tienne in May 1942 with the full support of Cardinal Gerlier, archbishop of Lyon. In a joint effort, they managed to retrieve hundreds of Jewish children from French-run concentration camps and disperse them among religious houses and private homes. They refused to give them up even when the government of Vichy placed Chaillet under house arrest in a psychiatric hospital for three months. They disregarded the orders of Alexandre Angeli, the regional prefect of Lyon, who was a Nazi collaborator. Angeli was condemned to a death penalty immediately after the war, later commuted to a sentence of four year-imprisonment. Abb� Glasberg later joined the French underground. After the war, Abb� Glasberg assisted the Mossad in their attempt to transport many of the war survivors to the land of Israel.",
