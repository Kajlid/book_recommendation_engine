  "title": "Not In The Eye",
  "description": "In a world running rapidly out of new ideas, the most precious commodity is innovation. In a future so near that it may already be upon us, Western society faces cultural bankruptcy. Our creative heritage has been looted, recycled and plagiarised to the point of exhaustion. The entertainment industry has traded artistic merit for commercial success and mass appeal. Everything is just a rehash of something that came before. Nothing is original. When a radical new phenomenon erupts (quite literally) onto the porno scene, it changes the industry forever, and forces audiences, jaded by endless reiteration, to sit up and take notice. It's a watershed moment in these culturally bereft times, and - for a select few - it's a chance to make some serious money. But wherever there's serious money to be made, you can bet there's a lawsuit just around the corner. Join Indigo Julius, self-styled godfather of NuGonzo journalism, as he searches for the story behind the story behind the most controversial porn sensation in history, and examines its far-reaching consequences. Across a series of probing interviews with the stars of this media spectacular, Indigo brings you their compelling - if often conflicting - versions of events, as everyone tries to stake a claim in this pornographic goldrush. Novella, 27,000 words Edited by Nico Reznick, with a cover design by Nick Calloway.\"",
