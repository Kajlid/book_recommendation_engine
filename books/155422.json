  "title": "Sophia's Journal",
  "description": "Her cell phone is dead, and she has no idea where she is. After a bad fall in the river, 16 year-old Sophia suddenly finds herself in nineteenth century Kansas. She struggles to adjust to new food, new entertainment and a new family. She is still a twenty-first century Muslim girl, though, so slavery is intolerable and the way Native Americans are treated is unacceptable. Sophia copes the best she can as she tries to understand how she got there, how she can help those she's met and if she will ever get back. Sophia's Journal is a fresh take on a pivotal moment in American history. Filled with adventure, romance and self-discovery, it offers a glimpse into a world half-forgotten, from a vantage point like no other. \"Quite simply, an excellent read.\" -J.M. Hayes, author of the Mad Dog and Englishman series \"Finally, a well-written novel about a teenage Muslim!\" - Freeda C. Shamma, Curriculum Consultant \"A valuable and entertaining addition to any social studies or language arts curriculum.\" -Tamara Gray, Educational Consultant and founder of Rabata.org",
