  "description": "Sylvia Day returns to the \"stunning new world\"* of the Renegade Angels for a riveting new novel of a dangerous romance conceived in the shadows between the living and the damned. Dr. Karin Allardice, a renowned--and mortal--virologist, has been kidnapped for a dire purpose: to create an anti-serum that will cure the Wraith virus infecting the vampire ranks. Captured by Syre, leader of the vampire nation, she is thrust into a preternatural underworld of blood-drinking immortals, ferocious lycans, and warrior angels--and is now forced to cure parasitic creatures she feels are no better than the viruses she's dedicated her life to eradicating. But the most perilous dilemma threatening Karin's resolve is Syre, an enigma driven to abhorrent extremes in order to survive and the most perfectly beautiful, darkly seductive man she's ever met. She's drawn to the sadness inside him, to the man tormented by a past that continues to haunt him. Now, as the Wraith virus spreads unchecked, Karin and Syre are torn between the very real dangers of a world in chaos . . . and an impossible, all-consuming passion for which there is no cure.",
