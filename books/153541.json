  "description": "Release Date - August 14th - Can be read as standaloneWas he a hitman? A Navy Seal? Gigolo?I had no idea what Bradley Emerson did for a living. I’d figure it out though, secrets didn’t sit well with me and I loved a challenge.~ WiskaI wanted her. I didn’t want to want her. The brain in my head was no longer in control of this vessel. Wanting her went against my rules, but apparently my male member was a rule breaker. ~ BradleyThis is NOT a dark romance. Nor is it smut...This is a slightly silly, LOL read, with a lighthearted look at the kinkier side of life. It comes served with a dash of wit and a sprinkle of playful romance.Recommended for audiences 18yrs+Book One - Decker's Wood (Kink Harder Presents)",
