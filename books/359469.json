  "title": "Uncommon Faith",
  "description": "Change is coming to the mid-nineteenth-century town of Millbrook, Massachusetts, whether folks are ready for it or not. Old traditions and values are being questioned, especially by an outspoken young woman named Faith Common. She defies expectations that women be obedient and limit their education to domestic duties such as sewing. Faith is determined to find her own truth about her abilities as well as the abilities of any human being, man or woman, black or white. With her uncommon faith in each person, she is a powerful catalyst for change. In this stirring historical novel, many citizens of Millbrook make their voices heard. Each tells of personal triumphs and tragedies, and of the controversies surrounding the rights of individuals, women, slaves, and freed slaves. Their stories shape their New England town in the years 1837 and 1838.",
