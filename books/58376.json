  "description": "This Today Show book club selection is now available on audio. Laced with fine storytelling, sharp wit, dead-on observations, and moments of sheer joy, Haven Kimmel's straight-shooting portrait of her childhood gives us a heroine who is wonderfully sweet and sly as she navigates the quirky adult world that surrounds her. Kimmel takes listeners back to a time when small-town America was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar people helped their neighbors, went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards.",
