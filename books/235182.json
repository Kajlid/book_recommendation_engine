  "description": "Perfect for fans of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series, Christina Lauren, and Emily Henry's Beach Read.Alex has planned and executed her life with laser focus since she first met her future husband at the play-doh table on the first day of kindergarten. They have a terrific life, a gorgeous house on the bay, and fantastic careers they love. There's only one Alex's husband has a secret. A big one.Now, Alex's perfectly planned life has completely fallen apart, her biological clock is starting to feel like the timer on a nuclear device, and she finds herself drooling over her completely-dreamy-but-definitely-off-limits client, a star chef opening a hot new restaurant. Armed with dating guidance from her oddball collection of advisers--including her gay ex-husband, a foul-mouthed political consultant, a perkily masochistic yogi, and a pot-smoking octogenarian--Alex navigates the booby-trapped world of modern dating, in her search for a second chance at love in Single-Minded by Lisa Daily.Single-Minded is a heartfelt take on the romance genre. The first person narration makes you feel as though you're right there with Alex as she navigates dating for the first time in well, forever.  It's total booklover catnip -- witty, charming, and swoony. Seriously swoony.",
