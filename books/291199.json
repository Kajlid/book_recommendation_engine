  "description": "He’ll break her chains. She’ll free his soul.Tasked by his chieftain, Sigvard the Nameless will do whatever it takes to save his people, and the whole of Sestoria, from succumbing to darkness. He’ll travel the continent to claim a magess said to be so powerful, she can wake a sleeping mountain. It won’t be a true bonding. One must have a heart for such things, and Sigvard’s went dormant years ago.Adira Greykeeper has spent her life hidden behind high walls, under the thumb of a man she both despises and depends upon. The only thing she fears more than her prison is the thought of a life without it, a life where her power reigns unchecked—even by her own will.When a wild man on a legendary mount spirits her away, Adira is determined to return to her gilded cage before she can relive the horror of her youth. The savage is willing to suffer any fate to keep her at his side, a folly Adira knows will herald his doom. Despite his tortured soul, the barbarian lends her a bravery she’s never known, and with it, hope. But it comes with a price, and he’ll demand more from her than she could ever have imagined.Two hearts. Two wounds. One great love—may the mountain fall.Author’s Note: This is not a shifter romance. The Dokiri men are savage enough in their manly forms. That being said, this book features a mild heat level. Enjoy the smoke but don’t expect to get singed.Trigger warning: This novel plays on the trope of abduction. While Dokiri men won’t let anything keep them from the woman they love, even that woman herself, all love scenes between the hero and heroine are consensual.",
