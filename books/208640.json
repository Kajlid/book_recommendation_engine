  "description": "The UK’s favorite funnyman offers a hilarious and insightful grand tour of these fifty states in Stephen Fry in America. In this full-color companion volume to his miniseries on public television, Fry lovingly delves into each region and subculture with the spirit of an anthropologist and the wit of a master satirist. The Emmy Award-winning (for his special The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive ) comedian whom the Guardian (London) dubbed “a treasure of the British Empire,” Fry joins the ranks of other humorists who have previously provided uniquely British takes on contemporary American life—including Michael Palin and Eric Idle of Monty Python—not to mention New York Times bestselling expatriate Bill Bryson. Warmhearted, eye-opening, and very, very funny Stephen Fry in America is a journey that is not to be missed.",
