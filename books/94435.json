  "title": "Seven Days in Usha Village: A Conversation with Dr. Sebi",
  "description": "Part biography, part health education, part social commentary, this 132-page paperback explores the candid, controversial life and unconventional pathology skills of noted healer and nutritionist Dr. Sebi. Written in interview style and published on the 20th anniversary of Dr. Sebi's acquittal by the New York Supreme Court, Seven Days in Usha Village: A Conversation with Dr. Sebi, exposes readers to the healer's updated views on health and nutrition as he speaks from his native home Honduras, Central America. Beverly Oliver, the book's editor, tape recorded the seven-day interview in November 2005. She chose excerpts that shed light on Dr. Sebi's 25-year relationship with community activists, political leaders and celebrities, including Michael Jackson and the late hip hop singer Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes. The book also includes Dr. Sebi's relentless appeals to Black Americans specifically, and more broadly the general public, to change generations of harmful food consumption. The book's glossary contains chemical and botanical definitions as well as descriptions of historical figures in music, education, health, religion, and philosophy. Dr. Sebi's Office, Inc. sells the book at his Los Angeles, California office.",
