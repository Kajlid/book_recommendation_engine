  "description": "Maria has made a few changes...Maria is a struggling writer in Cordoba, Spain. After years without success, she decides to try her hand at translating books. Unfortunately, her editor can only offer her a second-rate detective series. She is so disgusted at the standard of writing and the fact that something so bad can get published, she makes some improvements. Or more precisely, completely rewrites the book.The troubles start when the Spanish version becomes an enormous success and later she meets Mike, the author.A romantic comedy in which it is a case of hate at first sight. It also gives a peek at Spain and its culture. A book for anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel and still believes in \"old-fashioned\" romance, where you don't jump into bed immediately and have to discover the real person inside, first.",
