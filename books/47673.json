  "description": "The time is the 26th century and mankind has just about recovered from the Dark, an ecological and political catastrophe that brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Life is good now, on Earth and the core planets of her trade empire, but not so much so on the poorer worlds. Earth preserves her dominance by means of covert manipulation and elimination of her enemies, that being the remit of Earth Intelligence, an amalgamation of a number of security organisations. EI have a secret weapon, a group of spies who can read minds, move objects without touching them and walk through walls, tricks worked not by magic but by pairing ordinary people with a computer that gives them access to psionics.Anna-Marie Delany knows nothing of all this. She's a bored little rich girl who takes on the alias of an actress in the holo-industry to spice up her life. She has some success and wins a lesser award or two before tragedy strikes and she almost dies in an aircar crash. As she recovers and regains her memory, she finds that the crash wasn't an accident. Her attempts to uncover the truth bring her to EI's attention and lead to a meeting with one of their psionic computers, but Zenith-alpha 4013 is flawed, unable to pair with any of the candidates offered by EI. It picks Anna as its partner, changing both of them forever.",
