Go to Hell - and see it as a tourist. Get lured into a pie-throwing cult. Peek backstage at the Second Coming. Attend a surprise party for the Grim Reaper. Encounter talking pigs, a tongue-twisting poet, levitating patients, militant tots, a dastardly schoolbus driver and a song-and-dance act that's its own show-stopper. The misadventures just keep coming in this collection of short fiction snatched from Modern Short Stories, Comic Relief, Beyond Science Fiction & Fantasy, Northcoast View, The MacGuffin and other journals and magazines.",
