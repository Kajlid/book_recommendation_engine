  "description": "The third book in the Olympian Love trilogy - not a stand-alone volume. When she returns to Houston after leaving Nikos in Greece during one of the most troublesome times of his life, Sabrina is miserable and heartbroken. She promised Maggie she would never talk to him again - that was part of their deal which resulted in her ultimate sacrifice. Her graduation is upon her, but she can't get Nikos out of her mind. A chance encounter with Aleksy, Nikos's rival, reopens her wounds, and when she learns Nikos will be back in town, she's beside herself. Tormented between her promise to Maggie and her undying love to Nikos, and believing Nikos will never forgive her, she faces an agonizing reality. Will she ever have the courage to answer him why and reconquer the man she loves?",
