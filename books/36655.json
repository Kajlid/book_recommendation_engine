  "description": "\"Quirky, irreverent and laugh-out-loud hilarious, Rhonda Nelson speaks my language!\" --New York Times bestselling author Vicki Lewis ThompsonVintage Rhonda Nelson! Though Rhonda is known more recently for her sexy, romantic comedies she began her career writing funny, heart-warming romance for Kensington's Precious Gems line. The books were only sold in Wal-Mart and spent less than a month on the shelves. Now, thanks to the wonderful world of digital publishing, they're available again.Runaway bride Louisa Honeycut is looking for a quick escape when she passes the Double Dare, Inc sign and the slogan \"Are you ready for the time of your life?\" seems like divine intervention. Sheltered by her overbearing father, Louisa has years of catching up to do and can think of no better person than gorgeous Sam Rawlins to show her. Is she ready for the time of her life? Hell, yes.Ordinarily unflappable adventure guide Sam Rawlins makes his living showing the wealthy how to have fun, but nothing in his experience could have prepared him for the \"adventure\" Louisa Honeycut asks for. He might be showing Louisa the time of her life, but the quirky little snack-cake heiress is soon turning Sam's own life upside down...and perversely, he likes the new vantage point.",
