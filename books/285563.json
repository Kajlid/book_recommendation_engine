  "description": "I never imagined that I’d be adding Manager of Operations for Park Street Animal Shelter to my resume. Not until my firm closed up, my boss moved away, and I was asked, nearly begged to step in and help. Once I found a decent allergy medication and adjusted to the smell that accompanied the shelter, I was oddly excited to start my new venture.That is until I met our on-call Veterinarian.Greyson Knox.Local animal doctor, famously rich, unfathomably gorgeous and my worst nightmare.I can put up a good fight, always have, but against Greyson; I’ve always been flustered, irritated…weak.Especially after what happened.Four years I've managed to avoid him. I’ve stayed on my side of town with my head down and now he’s here…and I can’t escape him.Some men are cordial, kind, professional…but Greyson Knox is nothing but a vicious vet looking to score.My first order of business was to strip him of his job, get him out of my clinic. But like everything between us, it turned into a war.Except for this time, losing would strip me of something I never expected to have. Something I’ve been too afraid to want and when Greyson plays dirty by revealing a secret he’s been harboring; my battle lines grow weak, leaving me vulnerable for attack.",
