  "title": "The Royal Tenenbaums",
  "description": "This is the screenplay for the acclaimed film, directed by Wes Anderson. There were three extraordinary children in the Tenenbaum family; Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) was a financial expert and started buying real estate in his early teens; Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) was an acclaimed playwright and won a Pulitzer Prize in the 9th grade; Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) was a champion tennis player ranked 2nd in the world by the age 17. They were brilliant. They were famous. They were unlucky enough to be the children of a man named Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman). Now for the first time in 25 years, they're all living together under the same roof. After having largely gone their separate ways they're looking to mend fences--and themselves in the process.",
