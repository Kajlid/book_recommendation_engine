This book could serve you for a lifetime.â€ -- Natural Health How can we go on living â€œwhen things fall apartâ€ -- when we are overcome by pain, fear, and anxiety? Pema Chodron's answer to that question contains some spectacularly good there is a fundamental happiness readily available to each one of us, no matter how difficult things seem to be. To find it, according to traditional Buddhist teaching, we must learn to stop running from suffering and instead actually learn to approach it -- fearlessly, compassionately, and with curiosity. This radical practice enables us to use all situations, even very painful ones, as means for discovering the truth and love that are utterly indestructible. The graceful, conversational tone of Chodron's writing gives the impression of sitting on a pillow across from her, listening to her everyday examples of Buddhist wisdom. Pema Chodron is an American Buddhist nun in the lineage of Chogyam Trungpa. She is resident teacher at Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia, and is the author of nine books and many audiobooks including The Places That Scare You and Don't Bite the Hook.",
