  "description": "The earth’s climate has passed the tipping point. White supremacists are armed and marching. Our government cages immigrant children. The wealthy get all the tax breaks. We can’t even agree on wearing masks to stop a deadly pandemic.Many Americans believe that our nation's problems multiply by the day, that those in charge are willing to end our republic to retain power. And they're right.With riveting insight, political strategist Haven McVarish fights back and sets the “democracy revival” agenda. Weaving a set of comprehensive solutions with an organizing plan to get these solutions into law, McVarish creates the strategy we need for 2021. Otherwise, Democratic leaders will squander this last chance to save democracy afforded by the 2020 \"blue wave”.These bold solutions will neutralize the GOP’s attacks on democracy. These attacks include unlimited dark money, extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression and endless weaponized misinformation. McVarish's solutions will also deliver ongoing Democratic majorities and depoliticized courts. All without constitutional amendments.You don’t have to feel frustrated and scared.This blueprint lays out a clear path for us to compel Democrats into taking effective action in 2021 before it’s too late.",
