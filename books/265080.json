  "title": "My Irish Kings",
  "description": "Five years I’ve been kept under the control of Ireland’s most vicious gang leader. Now that I’m eighteen, he’s forcing me to marry him. I’d rather die a thousand deaths.  I escape to the only place I can be safe--home of my captor’s biggest rival, the Irish Kings.  There’s X, the living weapon with a haunted past. His vicious touch helps release all this anger in me.  Jace, the teddy bear with a warrior’s heart. His melodic Irish brogue is a balm to my soul.  And Magnar King, their intimidating leader. Whose eyes flare with hunger when I’m near, yet backs away like I’ve burned him when we touch. He doesn’t remember me. But I remember him.  They’re all so different. But they all make me feel safe. They awaken needs in me—strange needs.  I want all of them.  But I just might need all of them to heal.  This is a smoking hot yet emotional reverse-harem romance, a full-length, standalone novel. Three sexy Irish brothers-in-arms who aren’t afraid to share and take their special woman to the ends of her pleasure.  Sienna’s Quick & Dirty series consists of standalone novels which are hotter, dirtier and quicker than her other novels.",
