  "description": "Being abducted from her home, given a new code name, and drafted into an elite black-ops training program isn't Infinity's ideal way to start the week--or the next six weeks, as it turns out. Yet, here she is, competing against twenty-five other recruits in a cutthroat competition, known only as The Program, for one of five spots on a super-secret intelligence and counter-terrorism team. And she might actually have a shot at making it. Until someone starts killing off the top performers.Now, the only way to stay in The Program--and alive--is to find the sweet spot between scoring too high and falling too low on the murder board. She can't do it alone, though. So, she forms an alliance with a recruit code-named Ghost, who proves knowledgeable and capable, not to mention charming. But Infinity is increasingly drawn to another, more enigmatic recruit, Maverick. Despite his loner vibe, he's all heart, spiritually strong, and reliable--saving Infinity when she needs it most. But can she really trust them? Relying on her faith and instincts, Infinity needs to find out who's snuffing out the competition, or she could be next.",
