  "description": "A beautiful duchess mourns for her beloved.A sun-bronzed merchant returns to claim a birthright.Disparate souls in need of love and renewal.Paths cross and the journey begins…Set in Hampshire England in 1777, AUTUMN DUCHESS tells the story of Antonia, heroine of NOBLE SATYR, and how she emerges from utter despair after the death of her husband and soul mate the Duke of Roxton to unexpectedly find love again.Book 3 in the acclaimed ROXTON family saga....Once again Lucinda Brant provides the reader with an extraordinary look into polite society of years gone by and made sure we were aware of all their foibles. No lack for adventure and suspense in her latest foray into London’s society. AUTUMN DUCHESS definitely moves up the ranks to one of my historical romance favorites -- 5-Star TOP PICK, SWurman, Night Owl Reviews.Passion is the keynote of this abundantly clear in the passion of the main characters, the robust energy of the age, and the pulse of action that creates an energetic and well-paced novel. The author has a wonderful turn of phrase, creating a sense of the opulence and oftentimes excessive luxuriance of the era. Highly recommended. --5-Stars, Fiona Ingram, Readers Favorite.",
