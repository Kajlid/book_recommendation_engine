  "description": "A Foothills Pride Story  Barista Jimmy Patterson thinks it's a good idea to get rip-roaring drunk on his birthday after he’s dumped by his boyfriend. When the burly owner of Stonewall’s Bar rescues Jimmy, the night starts to look up.  Now Jimmy just wants to know the bartender's first name since he's worn a different name tag every time Jimmy's seen him. \"Guy\" Stone gives Jimmy seven guesses, one for each night he takes Jimmy out on a date.  While Jimmy’s trying to come up with his name, he's distracted by the destruction of his coffee shop and what looks more and more like a hate crime.",
