  "description": "Caleb Nichollas has a Christmas secret and a problem. Dunder, one of Santa's premier reindeers, is sick...And the vet is laid up in the hospital, leaving his cantankerous--though beautiful--daughter in charge of the practice. Getting along with Faith Saintsbury would be easier if Caleb could tell her about Christmas Magic, flying reindeer, or the Nichollas Family's roll in making sure Christmas goes off without a hitch. But he can't. The family rules keep the reindeer, and therefore Santa, safe. Faith doesn't trust easily and she has a sore spot when it comes to the reindeer that take up so much of her father's time. She's determined to do what she has to and then get out of town. She's not about to let this wrangler have the upper hand--or work his way into her heart. Will Faith find a way to celebrate Christmas once again and believe in the Magic; or, will she leave town, Reindeer Ranch, and Caleb in her rearview mirror? You'll love this magical Christmas romance!",
