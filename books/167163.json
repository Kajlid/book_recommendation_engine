  "description": "Logan has a past he doesn't want to talk about. One, that after tonight, he is leaving behind for good. He is also leaving behind his all-consuming, unrequited love for Ryder. He will drink the Amber Moon that wise old Solomon has put in front of him and finally walk into a new future. Maybe even a new love.But that may not have been what Solomon meant. Maybe Solomon knew something Logan didn't. Like things in Logan's past that can't be left behind. Ryder being one of them. Because Ryder doesn't like the idea of only being in Logan's past, not when he fully intends to be Logan's future.Watch the trailer:https://youtu.be/lTUiCcktJD4",
